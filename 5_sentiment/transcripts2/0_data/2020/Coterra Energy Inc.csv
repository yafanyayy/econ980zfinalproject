Thank you for joining us today for its fourth quarter full year 2019 earnings call. I do have the management team here with me today. I would first like to remind everyone that on this call, this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. For 2019, Cabot reported its best year in company history, while posting record levels of net income, operating cash flow, free cash flow, production, proved reserves and operating expense per unit. Some of the key highlights for the year include 41% growth in adjusted earnings per share, 90% growth in free cash flow, a return on capital employed of 22%, a return of $665 million of capital to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and 2 increases in our quarterly dividend per share. This represented a return of 118% of our free cash flow, far exceeding our target of returning at least 50% of our annual cash flow. And 18% increase in production and a 11% increase in year-end proved reserves. And an 18% reduction in all-in operating expenses per unit to $1.44 per 1,000 cubic foot equivalent and a reduction in net debt to 0.7x EBITDAX. I think, by all standards, a very good year. 
Specific to the fourth quarter of '19, despite declining natural gas prices, we still generated $121 million of adjusted net income or $0.30 per share and $110 million of free cash flow, while returning over 190% of our free cash flow for the quarter to shareholders. We ended the fourth quarter with $200 million of cash on the balance sheet, which coupled with our expectations for a fifth consecutive year of free cash flow. And 2020 will allow us to continue to return a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders, while also providing financial strength in a challenging market. On the operational front, in yesterday's release, we provided the results of our Upper Marcellus test from the last 2 years, which delivered an average EUR per 1,000 of approximately 2.7 Bcf. We believe these results highlight that our upper Marcellus, as a distinct incremental interval and it generates return that exceed the majority of assets across the basin. We plan to continue to test a limited number of upper Marcellus wells annually to further optimize lateral placement and completion designs. However, our recent results are relatively in line with the average EUR of 2.9 Bcf per 1,000 foot across all of our upper Marcellus drilled to date, which is a much larger sample size of over 50 wells. In the release, we also made reference to over 2 decades of remaining inventory life, which is consistent with our measure -- measuring over the past few years regarding our ability to continue to primarily focus on development plans on the lower Marcellus through the latter part of this decade, before moving to the full development of the Upper Marcellus, which provides inventory life into the 2040 decade. This assumes a return to modest levels of growth in the future, if the price environment warrants it. In addition to the lower and Upper Marcellus, we have tested other concepts across our acreage position that would be incremental to our multi-decade inventory life, while the testing of these concepts is still in the early phase. The results we have seen to date are very encouraging. 
Moving on to our plans for 2020. Earlier this month, we announced our official 2020 plan, which included the adoption of previously disclosed maintenance capital program of $575 million, representing a 27% reduction in capital spending year-over-year. Our corporate strategy has always been centered around the acute focus on disciplined capital allocation, and we believe this reduction in capital further demonstrates our commitment to that philosophy. Our 2020 program is projected to deliver an average net production rate of 2.4 Bcf cubic foot per day, up for the full year based on the current NYMEX future curve. This plan is expected to generate enough free cash flow to cover our dividend, while also providing a modest amount of excess free cash flow for further returns of capital to shareholders or debt repayment. At a $2.25 average NYMEX price, the plan is expected to generate $275 million to $300 million of free cash flow, while delivering a return on capital employed of 11% to 12%, not too many programs can represent that. We believe our current plan is the appropriate level of capital investment in this market environment. 
However, we will continue to assess the outlook for the natural gas market in 2020 and 2021 and are prepared to discuss capital spending reductions further if market conditions warranted. Our guidance for 2020 includes modest sequential production declines in the first and second quarter, which we believe is prudent given the weakness in pricing we've experienced during the first quarter and expect to experience in the spring shoulder season. We are currently forecasting an increase in production beginning in the second half of the year, which corresponds with improvement in prices across the NYMEX future curve. As we look to 2021, while it's too premature to issue any formal guidance, given the likelihood of continued volatility and commodity prices throughout the year. I would expect us to adopt a similar program next year if natural gas prices were to remain lower for the foreseeable future. I would also add that while we are fully prepared for a continuation in this lower natural gas price environment, we believe that current activity levels across the country are not sustainable at these prices and ultimately, market forces should move natural gas supply and demonstrate a more sustainable balance in the future.  2020 could prove to be one of the most challenging natural gas markets in recent history, however, we continue to believe our business model is uniquely positioned to navigate through the market environment, giving our combination of low-cost assets and lower leverage position. Giving our free cash flow outlook, and our strong balance sheet, we remain fully committed to continuing to return capital to shareholders through a combination of dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, while also planning to pay down our current debt at maturity later this year. While it's impossible to predict when the prices may improve even at the current strip prices for '21 and '22, we expect to expand our free cash flow yield and return on capital to levels that exceed the medium of the S&P 500. And Gary, with that, I'm more than happy to answer questions."

One, as we've referenced, we've drilled only 50 wells in the Upper Marcellus. Compared to 700 or so in the lower Marcellus. In the Marcellus, we still look at efforts and tests on where we're placing the lateral and how we tweak completions. With the Upper Marcellus, we drilled some early-stage upper Marcellus wells that are in that 50% cap. With those early stage completions, we were just gathering the data with the completion -- generation completions we had at that particular time. As we have moved forward with trying to utilize what we've learned in the lower and apply it to the upper, we continue to tweak the results we've seen in some of the upper wells. With the -- what we've used in the lower and trying to determine whether or not it's applicable in the upper rock. The upper, as a point of reference, is anywhere from -- the thickness is anywhere from, say, 140 to almost 300 feet in just the upper. So lateral placement is going to be important in that thickness of ice pack. We have looked at the laying wells in various different sections of that thick interval. One test we've referenced was to look at that thickener and ask -- we asked the question, do we need to stagger and put well in the higher part of the upper and the lower part of the upper and see if we can maximize drainage, effectiveness of return and so forth by doing so. Couple of the wells that we laid -- got a little bit too low in the Upper Marcellus, and those were not that effective wells and we're not that good of wells because we -- in 2020 hindsight, laid the laterals a little bit too low. But that learning curve, Charles, to your point, is going to continue for an extended period of time.  And when you couple that with a new legislative process that the Pennsylvania legislator have approved in the fourth quarter of 2019, it's allowing us to look at the development of the upper a little bit different than we're looking at the -- and that we had to implement in the lower. In the lower -- and I'm little bit long-winded here, but I'll maybe cover other questions that others might have by the answer. In the lower, we had unit designation sizes that had us at certain lateral lengths. We could only go so far with the unit designations with the certain lateral lengths in the lower. And therefore, our -- for example, this last year, our average lateral length was over 8,000 feet in the lower, but nevertheless, we have drilled some where we could -- that -- extended that laterally, gain of efficiencies, a little bit lower cost per foot and things like that. In the upper, it's our expectation that when you look at the entire upper section, in a very thick section, like I mentioned, there are only in 170,000 something acres, there's only 50 take points in that upper section. So when you look at that area entirely in the upper -- it's undeveloped section. When we're looking at what we're trying to do now by gathering the information and trying to tweak landing laterals and all, it's going to help us lay out our development plan and with the new PAA that the legislation approved up there. It's going to allow us to lay out the upper in a way that will facilitate probably plus or minus over 40% longer laterals than the laterals we drilled this year in the lower. So that 10,000, 12,000 foot lateral that we're going to lay out in the upper is going to create its own efficiencies, more so than we realized in the lower. And with that development layout, it is our anticipation that we're going to narrow the gap on the return profile, on the delta between the EUR per well that we see in the upper as opposed to what we realized in the lower."

I'll now make a kind of 5,000 foot comment, Brian and I'll turn it to Steve Lindeman. But in the -- our reserve revisions this year, we had our learning curve in the proximal drilling with some of our wells out there on the parent child, kind of in the latter part of '18, beginning of '19. And we have -- when we saw the impacts of that drilling, and we've locked some wells not temporarily lose some wells or Knox them off with some of the frac hits. We take that learning curve, and we see how we can mitigate it in the future, and that affected some of our PDP revisions down by these frac hits. One of the things that we've been able to do with our learning curve through this period of time, is look at the results of now proximinal drilling in all our future guidance and our program is laid out, taking in consideration that it's all going to be approximal drilling to existing wells. And the mitigating factors that have helped improve now our expectations versus our initial learning curve is looking at our completion designs. We have looked at the reduction in our fluid levels that has helped considerably. We've also looked at the increase in clusters per stages that has helped significantly on the offset effects. We are also, as I've mentioned, in the upper, but in the lower also, we're looking at lateral placements to see the impact and benefits of lateral placements where we're taking a proximal development. We have also been using retrievable bridge plugs that has mitigated the impacts on offset wells. We've also tested perforation hole sizes to accommodate our fluid levels of pumping and how we're laying out the cluster. So all of this has helped mitigate the impacts going forward. We did experience through, to your point, about revisions, and particularly on the PDP side, some revisions on some wells, which we took out reserves off on some of those PDP. But some of those wells that we've taken reserve off, we really haven't gone back and then the workover on, say, a handful of those wells. So that's kind of a higher level, and I'll let Steve add to how you handle some of our reserve bookings."

But as Dan indicated, we've taken a number of remediation steps to improve and to mitigate some of this parent-child relationship. And then there was roughly about 30 Bcf or 10% that was impacted negatively to short-term line pressure gains in the field from turning offset pads on.

So they are way out ahead on designing these pad sites, along with Phil's guys trying to do the  logistics on the ground of roads, pad site construction, the permitting side, looking at, of course, the equipment and personnel necessary. So I would say the ramp-up -- yes, it's a hell of a lot easier to cut off the first strings and head down. It is a little bit more challenging to ramp up less in except if you had maybe stranded capital and you had say, a frac crew or 2 teed up, but you weren't going to pull the string on those until a year from now, but you were paying some kind of rate to have them ready and available at that -- just in the nick of time.

The level  -- how much is covered by the dividend is going to be obviously a function of what the NYMEX strip is going forward. But we're looking at it exactly like you said. The other thing I would add in there, which I thought you were going to ask is, we have 2 small maturities in the next 2 years, and our plan is to use part of that free cash flow to just pay that debt off, which would further reduce our leverage about another $250 million, which in this environment makes a lot of sense. But we'll be opportunistic on buybacks when appropriate. But at the same time, I'm not opposed with my bent and Dan's bent to cord a little cash if it makes sense because who knows where the strip is going to end up going."

We have always had strategic in boardroom discussions on how we maximize shareholder value. That will continue. We just had our board meeting this week. We had thorough discussions about the questions that you asked, how do we enhance shareholder value. And all -- in every meeting we've discussed the market, the M&A, the activities that are going on in the macro space, the expectation of commodity pricing in the future, both oil versus gas. We look at the oil guys and how they're dealing with the issues that they deal with. We look at the gas as on how they're dealing with their programs. And in the Northeast, we look at the -- area around us is having some very, very good wells. Chesapeake has drilled some really good wells beside us. And -- if we could drill those wells, we would -- and we do also. But to have an M&A transaction, it's just cumbersome. It's difficult up there. They're -- where our area up there is about 100% operated. And the areas that are west of us. They're not 100% operated. There's multiple partners that are in those wells. And that creates its own uniqueness to what you might do if you had those assets or if you're the operator of those assets in the southwest part of the state, you have a lot of production going on in the southwest part of the state. But the balance sheets on some of those companies are admittedly stressed at this point in time. And they have maturities coming up that they're trying to deal with through their programs and having that type of M&A conversation and all just is extremely difficult. When you look at a dual commodity split that there's circumstances that it would make sense. But you also have to understand the area that you might go into, the capital allocation you'd have in the future. Either accretion or dilution that you might have on that capital allocation. And quite frankly, the -- when you look at the strip price for oil right now and you look at the strip price for natural gas right now, Cabot delivers a very, very good return profile compared to all the wells that are being drilled out there and all the programs that are being drilled out there. So do I think at times, it would have a benefit. Absolutely, it would. If we had 2 environments to work in and operate in and also to commodities, to dial levers and also. But trying to make that come together to get all the stars line up all at one time, it's a difficult proposition. That's why it's not done every day."

But when you look at our program and if you're comparing '19 to '20, if you look at our program, by design, our '19 program as a result of late innings, drilling in '18, we had to answer some of the questions, which I've already talked about, about how we implement technique changes on completions, drilling laterals, things like that to mitigate approximal drilling. So our '19 program was designed to answer some of those questions, and we had our learning curve and that showed up in some of our numbers. We've mitigated the numbers that we presented in '19, even though a record year for Cabot. We've mitigated some of the concerns about proximal drilling by what we did. But when you look at our differences in the 60 or 70 wells, we had 25 wells that we designed specifically for the upper to try to get ahead of our program and learn about how we now -- because we had the daylight that the PA legislation created by the PAA decision and now the longer laterals and then working into the opportunity that Josh asked, well, ago, how we can maybe develop the upper in concert with lower. We had a lot of wells, and we are gathering a lot of data in the upper purposely for that program. In 2020 compared to '19, we only have 5 wells designed for the upper. 
And the placement of some of our wells in our field are also going to be slightly different because in the queue of things when we have pads ready and they jump all over the field, 2020 program is going to have a less uppers and the locations of the well of the pads that we're going to drill in the 2020 is going to be slightly enhanced in the geographic area that we'll drill compared to '19.

Everybody has the reasons why they might grow any into a market that we live in today and looking at the realizations that are out there today. And I think the financial numbers by the majority would dictate that if you had a vision that the current strip is going to be what it will be perpetually into the future, to your point, about 5 years, 6 years from now, I don't know why anybody would be drilling wells into -- as a growth measure into this market. I think it is a difficult to -- for me to sit in every chair out there and the reasons behind it. I do know there's reasons that are attached to debt positions and balance sheet concerns. I know there's reasons why maybe firm transportation arrangements might be dictating how you allocate capital. There has been midstream negotiations and separations, upstream from midstream. There's been changes and volume -- minimum volume and commitments and different things that are affecting decisions out there. We look at it as a how we can manage the shareholder value in a way that is going to yield a return. 
We've been able to point to the fact that at a $2 NYMEX, we still generate free cash flow, we'll generate an earnings profile and so -- and even us, and there's nobody else that can make that statement. We are at a maintenance level of capital because we don't think it is prudent to drill up all your core inventory and push it out at a losing proposition. We don't think it's prudent to drill even at a marginal return profile and use it all up in this particular environment. 
So we're going to keep our balance sheet strong. We're going to manage our dividend. As Scott has mentioned, we're going to manage our debt towers. As we have to and will also reduce further maintenance capital and reduce as opposed to have the growth out there in what we see in the current environment and the foreseeable future.

I would first like to remind everyone that on this call, this morning, we will",1125,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's fourth quarter full year 2019 earnings call. I do have the management team here with me today. I would first like to remind everyone that on this call, this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earning release. 
For 2019, Cabot reported its best year in company history, while posting record levels of net income, operating cash flow, free cash flow, production, proved reserves and operating expense per unit. Some of the key highlights for the year include 41% growth in adjusted earnings per share, 90% growth in free cash flow, a return on capital employed of 22%, a return of $665 million of capital to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and 2 increases in our quarterly dividend per share. This represented a return of 118% of our free cash flow, far exceeding our target of returning at least 50% of our annual cash flow. And 18% increase in production and 11% increase in year-end proved reserves. And an 18% reduction in all-in operating expenses per unit to $1.44 per 1,000 cubic foot equivalent and a reduction in net debt to 0.7x EBITDAX. 
I think, by all standards, a very good year. 
Specific to the fourth quarter of '19, despite declining natural gas prices, we still generated $121 million of adjusted net income or $0.30 per share and $110 million of free cash flow, while returning over 190% of our free cash flow for the quarter to shareholders. We ended the fourth quarter with $200 million of cash on the balance sheet, which coupled with our expectations for a fifth consecutive year of free cash flow. And 2020 will allow us to continue to return a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders, while also providing financial strength in a challenging market. On the operational front, in yesterday's release, we provided the results of our Upper Marcellus test from the last 2 years, which delivered an average EUR per 1,000 of approximately 2.7 Bcf. We believe these results highlight that our upper Marcellus, as a distinct incremental interval and it generates return that exceed the majority of assets across the basin. We plan to continue to test a limited number of upper Marcellus wells annually to further optimize lateral placement and completion designs. 
However, our recent results are relatively in line with the average EUR of 2.9 Bcf per 1,000 foot across all of our upper Marcellus drilled to date, which is a much larger sample size of over 50 wells. In the release, we also made reference to over 2 decades of remaining inventory life, which is consistent with our measure -- measuring over the past few years regarding our ability to continue to primarily focus on development plans on the Lower Marcellus through the latter part of this decade, before moving to the full development of the Upper Marcellus, which provides inventory life into the 2040 decade. This assumes a return to modest levels of growth in the future, if the price environment warrants it. In addition to the Lower and Upper Marcellus, we have tested other concepts across our acreage position that would be incremental to our multi-decade inventory life, while the testing of these concepts is still in the early phase. The results we have seen to date are very encouraging. 
Moving on to our plans for 2020. Earlier this month, we announced our official 2020 plan, which included the adoption of previously disclosed maintenance capital program of $575 million, representing a 27% reduction in capital spending year-over-year. Our corporate strategy has always been centered around the acute focus on disciplined capital allocation, and we believe this reduction in capital further demonstrates our commitment to that philosophy. Our 2020 program is projected to deliver an average net production rate of 2.4 Bcf cubic foot per day, up for the full year based on the current NYMEX future curve. This plan is expected to generate enough free cash flow to cover our dividend, while also providing a modest amount of excess free cash flow for further returns of capital to shareholders or debt repayment. At a $2.25 average NYMEX price, the plan is expected to generate $275 million to $300 million of free cash flow, while delivering a return on capital employed of 11% to 12%, not too many programs can represent that. We believe our current plan is the appropriate level of capital investment in this market environment. 
However, we will continue to assess the outlook for the natural gas market in 2020 and 2021 and are prepared to discuss capital spending reductions further if market conditions warranted. Our guidance for 2020 includes modest sequential production declines in the first and second quarter, which we believe is prudent given the weakness in pricing we've experienced during the first quarter and expect to experience in the spring shoulder season. We are currently forecasting an increase in production beginning in the second half of the year, which corresponds with improvement in prices across the NYMEX future curve. As we look to 2021, while it's too premature to issue any formal guidance, given the likelihood of continued volatility and commodity prices throughout the year, I would expect us to adopt a similar program next year if natural gas prices were to remain lower for the foreseeable future
 
I would also add that while we are fully prepared for a continuation in this lower natural gas price environment, we believe that current activity levels across the country are not sustainable at these prices and ultimately, market forces should move natural gas supply and demonstrate a more sustainable balance in the future. 2020 could prove to be one of the most challenging natural gas markets in recent history. However, we continue to believe our business model is uniquely positioned to navigate through the market environment, giving our combination of low-cost assets and lower leverage position. Giving our free cash flow outlook, and our strong balance sheet, we remain fully committed to continuing to return capital to shareholders through a combination of dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, while also planning to pay down our current debt at maturity later this year. While it's impossible to predict when the prices may improve even at the current strip prices for '21 and '22, we expect to expand our free cash flow yield and return on capital to levels that exceed the medium of the S&P 500. 
And Gary, with that, I'm more than happy to answer questions."

One, as we've referenced, we've drilled only 50 wells in the Upper Marcellus. Compared to 700 or so in the Lower Marcellus. And in the Lower Marcellus, we still look at efforts and tests on where we'",685,"Well, just a first set of facts on the Upper Marcellus. One, as we've referenced, we've drilled only 50 wells in the Upper Marcellus. Compared to 700 or so in the Lower Marcellus. And in the Lower Marcellus, we still look at efforts and tests on where we're placing the lateral and how we tweak completions. With the Upper Marcellus, we drilled some early-stage Upper Marcellus wells that are in that 50% cap. With those early-stage completions, we were just gathering the data with the completion -- generation completions we had at that particular time. As we have moved forward with trying to utilize what we've learned in the lower and apply it to the upper, we continue to tweak the results we've seen in some of the upper wells. With the -- what we've used in the lower and trying to determine whether or not it's applicable in the upper rock. 
The upper, as a point of reference, is anywhere from -- the thickness is anywhere from, say, 140 to almost 300 feet in just the upper. So the lateral placement is going to be important in that thickness of ice pack. We have looked at the laying wells in various different sections of that thick interval. One test we referenced was to look at that deck of interval. And ask -- we asked the question, do we need to stagger and put well in the higher part of the upper and the lower part of the upper and see if we can maximize drainage, effectiveness of return and so forth by doing so. 
Couple of the wells that we laid got a little bit too low in the Upper Marcellus, and those were not that effective wells and we're not that good of wells because we -- in 2020 hindsight, laid the laterals a little bit too low.
But that learning curve, Charles, to your point, is going to continue for an extended period of time.  And when you couple that with a new legislative process that the Pennsylvania legislator have approved in the fourth quarter of 2019, it's allowing us to look at the development of the upper a little bit different than we're looking at the -- and that we had to implement in the lower. In the lower -- and I'm little bit long-winded here, but I'll maybe cover other questions that others might have by the answer. In the lower, we had unit designation sizes that had us at certain lateral lengths. We could only go so far with the unit designations with the certain lateral lengths in the lower. And therefore, our -- for example, this last year, our average lateral length was over 8,000 feet in the lower, but nevertheless, we have drilled some where we could that extended that laterally, gain of efficiencies, a little bit lower cost per foot and things like that. 
In the upper, it's our expectation that when you look at the entire upper section, a very thick section, like I mentioned, there are only in 170,000 something acres, there's only 50 take points in that upper section. So when you look at that area entirely in the upper, it's undeveloped section. When we're looking at what we're trying to do now by gathering the information and trying to tweak landing laterals and all, it's going to help us lay out our development plan and with the new PAA that the legislation approved up there. It's going to allow us to lay out the upper in a way that will facilitate probably plus or minus over 40% longer laterals than the laterals we drilled this year in the lower. So that 10,000, 12,000 foot lateral that we're going to lay out in the upper is going to create its own efficiencies, more so than we realized in the lower. And with that development layout, it is our anticipation that we're going to narrow the gap on the return profile, on the delta between the EUR per well that we see in the upper as opposed to what we realized in the lower."

I'll now make a kind of 5,000 foot comment, Brian, and I'll turn it to Steve Lindeman. But in the -- our reserve revisions this year, we had our learning curve in the proximal drilling with some of our wells out there on the parent child, kind of in the latter part of '18, beginning of '19. And we have -- when we saw the impacts of that drilling, and we lost some wells not temporarily lose some wells or knock some off with some of the frac hits. We take that learning curve, and we see how we can mitigate it in the future, and that affected some of our PDP revisions down by these frac hits. One of the things that we've been able to do with our learning curve through this period of time, is look at the results of now proximinal drilling in all our future guidance and our program is laid out, taking in consideration that it's all going to be a proximal drilling to existing wells. And the mitigating factors that have helped improve now our expectations versus our initial learning curve is looking at our completion designs. We have looked at the reduction in our fluid levels that has helped considerably. We've also looked at the increase in clusters per stages that has helped significantly on the offset effects. We are also, as I've mentioned, in the upper, but in the lower also, we're looking at lateral placements to see the impact and benefits of lateral placements where we're taking in proximal development. We have also been using retrievable bridge plugs that has mitigated the impacts on offset wells. We've also tested perforation hole sizes to accommodate our fluid levels of pumping and how we're laying out the cluster. So all of this has helped mitigate the impacts going forward. We did experience through, to your point, about revisions, and particularly on the PDP side, some revisions on some wells, which we took off -- reserves off on some of those PDP. But some of those wells that we've taken reserve off, we really haven't gone back and then work over on, say, a handful of those wells. So that's kind of a higher level, and I'll let Steve add to how you handle some of our reserve bookings."

But as Dan indicated, we've taken a number of remediation steps to improve and to mitigate some of this parent-child relationship. And then there was roughly about 30 Bcf or 10% that was impacted negatively to short-term line pressure gains in the field from turning offset pads on.

So the marketing group, Jeff, is always allocating, when we're going to bring on a large pad, is always allocating away from that particular area.
As we've mentioned in the past, we have multiple options to move gas around. You'll allocate away from that as we bring on those lower wells.

It's going to be delivering gas at certain areas, certain compressor sites to be able to move the gas without having negative effects of higher line pressure and knocking wells off. So they are way out ahead on designing these pad sites, along with Phil's guys trying to do the logistics on the ground of roads, pad site construction, the permitting side, looking at, of course, the equipment and personnel necessary. 
So I would say the ramp-up, yes, it's a hell lot easier to cut off the first strings and head down. It is a little bit more challenging to ramp up less and except if you had maybe stranded capital and you had, say, a frac crew or two teed up, but you weren't going to pull the string on those until a year from now, but you were paying some kind of rate to have them ready and available at that, just in the nick of time.

The level -- how much is covered by the dividend is going to be obviously a function of what the NYMEX strip is going forward. But we're looking at it exactly like you said. The other thing I would add in there, which I thought you were going to ask, is we have two small maturities in the next 2 years, and our plan is to use part of that free cash flow to just pay that debt off, which would further reduce our leverage about another $250 million, which, in this environment, makes a lot of sense. But we'll be opportunistic on buybacks when appropriate. But at the same time, I'm not opposed with my bent and Dan's bent to cord a little cash if it makes sense because who knows where the strip is going to end up going."

We have always had strategic in boardroom discussions on how we maximize shareholder value. That will continue. We just had our Board meeting this week. We had thorough discussions about the questions that you asked, how do we enhance shareholder value. In all -- every meeting we've discussed the market, the M&A, the activities that are going on in the macro space, the expectation of commodity pricing in the future, both oil versus gas. We look at the oil guys and how they're dealing with the issues that they deal with. We look at the gas guys as on how they're dealing with their programs. And in the Northeast, we look at the -- the area around us is having some very, very good wells. 
Chesapeake has drilled some really good wells beside us. And if we could drill those wells, we would and we do also. But to have an M&A transaction, it's just cumbersome. It's difficult up there. They're -- where our area up there is about 100% operated. And the areas that are west of us, they're not 100% operated. There's multiple partners that are in those wells. And that creates its own uniqueness to what you might do if you had those assets or if you're the operator of those assets in the southwest part of the state. You have a lot of production going on in the southwest part of the state. But the balance sheets on some of those companies are admittedly stressed at this point in time. And they have maturities coming up that they're trying to deal with through their programs and having that type of M&A conversation and all just is extremely difficult. 
When you look at a dual commodity split that there's circumstances that it would make sense. But you also have to understand the area that you might go into, the capital allocation you'd have in the future, the either accretion or dilution that you might have on that capital allocation. And quite frankly, the -- when you look at the strip price for oil right now and you look at the strip price for natural gas right now, Cabot delivers a very, very good return profile compared to all the wells that are being drilled out there and all the programs that are being drilled out there. 
So do I think, at times, it would have a benefit? Absolutely, it would, if we had 2 environments to work in and operate in and also 2 commodities to dial levers in also. But trying to make that come together to get all the stars line up all at one time, it's a difficult proposition. That's why it's not done every day."

But when you look at our program and if you're comparing '19 to '20, if you look at our program, by design, our '19 program as a result of late innings, drilling in '18, we had to answer some of the questions, which I've already talked about, about how we implement technique changes on completions, drilling laterals, things like that to mitigate a proximal drilling. So our '19 program was designed to answer some of those questions, and we had our learning curve and that showed up in some of our numbers. We've mitigated the numbers that we presented in '19, even though a record year for Cabot. We've mitigated some of the concerns about proximal drilling by what we did. But when you look at our differences in the 60 or 70 wells, we had 25 wells that we designed specifically for the upper to try to get ahead of our program and learn about how we now -- because we had the daylight that the PA legislation created by the PAA decision and now the longer laterals and then working into the opportunity that Josh asked, a while ago, how we can maybe develop the upper in concert with lower. We had a lot of wells, and we were gathering a lot of data in the upper purposely for that program. In 2020 compared to '19, we only have 5 wells designed for the upper.
And the placement of some of our wells in our field are also going to be slightly different because in the queue of things when we have pads ready and then they jump all over the field, 2020 program is going to have a less uppers and the locations of the well of the pads that we're going to drill in the 2020 is going to be slightly enhanced in the geographic area that we'll drill compared to '19. So we do anticipate 2020 and a lot of areas is going to be an enhanced program to '19."

Everybody has their -- an opinion and everybody looks at what's going on in the market and the reasons for it. Everybody has the reasons why they might grow any into a market that we live in today and looking at the realizations that are out there today. And I think the financial numbers by the majority would dictate that if you had a vision that the current strip is going to be what it will be perpetually into the future, to your point, about 5 years, 6 years from now, I don't know why anybody would be drilling wells into -- as a growth measure into this market. I think it is a difficult to -- for me to sit in every chair out there and the reasons behind it. I do know there's reasons that are attached to debt positions and balance sheet concerns. I know there's reasons why maybe firm transportation arrangements might be dictating how you allocate capital. There has been midstream negotiations and separations, upstream from midstream. There's been changes in volume -- minimum volume and commitments and different things that are affecting decisions out there. We look at it as how we can manage the shareholder value in a way that is going to yield a return. 
We've been able to point to the fact that at a $2 NYMEX, we still generate free cash flow, we'll generate an earnings profile and so -- and even us, and there's nobody else that can make that statement. We are at a maintenance level of capital because we don't think it is prudent to drill up all your core inventory and push it out at a losing proposition. We don't think it's prudent to drill even at a marginal return profile and use it all up in this particular environment. 
So we're going to keep our balance sheet strong. We're going to manage our dividend. As Scott has mentioned, we're going to manage our debt towers as we have to and will also reduce further maintenance capital and reduce as opposed to have the growth out there in what we see in the current environment and the foreseeable future. 
So I have a hard time rationalizing why industry is growing into a market today."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's fourth quarter, full year 2019 earnings call. I do have the management team here with me today. I would first like to remind everyone that on this call this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earning release. 
For 2019, Cabot reported its best year in company history, while posting record levels of net income, operating cash flow, free cash flow, production, proved reserves and operating expense per unit. Some of the key highlights for the year include 41% growth in adjusted earnings per share, 90% growth in free cash flow, a return on capital employed of 22%, a return of $665 million of capital to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases, and 2 increases in our quarterly dividend per share. This represented a return of 118% of our free cash flow, far exceeding our target of returning at least 50% of our annual cash flow. And 18% increase in production and 11% increase in year-end proved reserves. And an 18% reduction in all-in operating expenses per unit to $1.44 per 1,000 cubic foot equivalent and a reduction in net debt to 0.7x EBITDAX. 
I think, by all standards, a very good year. 
Specific to the fourth quarter of '19, despite declining natural gas prices, we still generated $121 million of adjusted net income or $0.30 per share and $110 million of free cash flow, while returning over 190% of our free cash flow for the quarter to shareholders. We ended the fourth quarter with $200 million of cash on the balance sheet, which coupled with our expectations for a fifth consecutive year of free cash flow. And 2020 will allow us to continue to return a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders, while also providing financial strength in a challenging market.
On the operational front, in yesterday's release, we provided the results of our Upper Marcellus test from the last 2 years, which delivered an average EUR per 1,000 of approximately 2.7 Bcf. We believe these results highlight that our Upper Marcellus has a distinct incremental interval and it generates return that exceed the majority of assets across the basin. We plan to continue to test a limited number of Upper Marcellus wells annually to further optimize lateral placement and completion designs. 
However, our recent results are relatively in line with the average EUR of 2.9 Bcf per 1,000 foot across all of our Upper Marcellus drilled to date, which is a much larger sample size of over 50 wells. In the release, we also made reference to over 2 decades of remaining inventory life, which is consistent with our measure -- measuring over the past few years regarding our ability to continue to primarily focus on development plans on the Lower Marcellus through the latter part of this decade, before moving to the full development of the Upper Marcellus, which provides inventory life into the 2040 decade. This assumes a return to modest levels of growth in the future, if the price environment warrants it. In addition to the Lower and Upper Marcellus, we have tested other concepts across our acreage position that would be incremental to our multi-decade inventory life. While the testing of these concepts is still in the early phase, the results we have seen to date are very encouraging. 
Moving on to our plans for 2020. Earlier this month, we announced our official 2020 plan, which included the adoption of previously disclosed maintenance capital program of $575 million, representing a 27% reduction in capital spending year-over-year. Our corporate strategy has always been centered around the acute focus on disciplined capital allocation, and we believe this reduction in capital further demonstrates our commitment to that philosophy. Our 2020 program is projected to deliver an average net production rate of 2.4 Bcf cubic foot per day, up for the full year. Based on the current NYMEX future curve, this plan is expected to generate enough free cash flow to cover our dividend, while also providing a modest amount of excess free cash flow for further returns of capital to shareholders or debt repayment. At a $2.25 average NYMEX price, the plan is expected to generate $275 million to $300 million of free cash flow, while delivering a return on capital employed of 11% to 12%. Not too many programs can represent that.
We believe our current plan is the appropriate level of capital investment in this market environment. However, we will continue to assess the outlook for the natural gas market in 2020 and 2021, and are prepared to discuss capital spending reductions further if market conditions warrant it. Our guidance for 2020 includes modest sequential production declines in the first and second quarter, which we believe is prudent given the weakness in pricing we've experienced during the first quarter and expect to experience in the spring shoulder season. We are currently forecasting an increase in production beginning in the second half of the year, which corresponds with improvement in prices across the NYMEX future curve. As we look to 2021, while it's too premature to issue you any formal guidance, given the likelihood of continued volatility in commodity prices throughout the year, I would expect us to adopt a similar program next year if natural gas prices were to remain lower for the foreseeable future.
 
I would also add that while we are fully prepared for a continuation in this lower natural gas price environment, we believe that current activity levels across the country are not sustainable at these prices and ultimately, market forces should move natural gas supply and demonstrate a more sustainable balance in the future. 2020 could prove to be one of the most challenging natural gas markets in recent history. However, we continue to believe our business model is uniquely positioned to navigate through the market environment, giving our combination of low-cost assets and low leverage position. Giving our free cash flow outlook and our strong balance sheet, we remain fully committed to continuing to return capital to shareholders through a combination of dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, while also planning to pay down our current debt at maturity later this year. While it's impossible to predict when the prices may improve, even at the current strip prices for '21 and '22, we expect to expand our free cash flow yield and return on capital to levels that exceed the medium of the S&P 500. 
And Gary, with that, I'm more than happy to answer questions."

But I was wondering if you could take a little bit of time and characterize for us the relative maturity, or how far how along you are on the path of optimization of your completions there.

One, as we've referenced, we've drilled only 50 wells in the Upper Marcellus, compared to 700 or so in the Lower Marcellus. And in the Lower Marcellus, we still look at efforts and tests on where we'",687,"Well, just a first set of facts on the Upper Marcellus. One, as we've referenced, we've drilled only 50 wells in the Upper Marcellus, compared to 700 or so in the Lower Marcellus. And in the Lower Marcellus, we still look at efforts and tests on where we're placing the lateral and how we tweak completions. With the Upper Marcellus, we drilled some early-stage Upper Marcellus wells that are in that 50 count. With those early-stage completions, we were just gathering the data with the completion -- generation completions we had at that particular time. As we have moved forward with trying to utilize what we've learned in the Lower and apply it to the Upper, we continue to tweak the results we've seen in some of the Upper wells with the -- what we've used in the Lower and trying to determine whether or not it's applicable in the Upper rock. 
The Upper, as a point of reference, is anywhere from -- the thickness is anywhere from, let's say, 140 to almost 300 feet in just the Upper. So the lateral placement is going to be important in that thickness of ice pack. We have looked at the laying wells in various different sections of that thick interval. One test we referenced was to look at that thick of interval and ask -- we asked the question, do we need to stagger and put a well in the higher part of the Upper and the lower part of the Upper and see if we can maximize drainage, effectiveness of return and so forth by doing so. 
Couple of the wells that we laid got a little bit too low in the Upper Marcellus, and those were not that effective wells and were not that good of wells because we, in 2020 hindsight, laid the laterals a little bit too low.
But that learning curve, Charles, to your point, is going to continue for an extended period of time. And when you couple that with a new legislative process that the Pennsylvania legislator have approved in the fourth quarter of 2019, it's allowing us to look at the development of the Upper a little bit different than we're looking at the -- and that we had to implement in the Lower. In the Lower -- and I'm little bit long-winded here, but I'll maybe cover other questions that others might have by the answer. In the Lower, we had unit designation sizes that had us at certain lateral lengths. We could only go so far with the unit designations with the certain lateral lengths in the Lower. And therefore, our -- for example, this last year, our average lateral length was over 8,000 feet in the Lower, but nevertheless, we have drilled some where we could that extended that laterally, gain of efficiencies, a little bit lower cost per foot and things like that. 
In the Upper, it's our expectation that when you look at the entire upper section, a very thick section, like I mentioned, there are only, in 170,000 something acres, there's only 50 take points in that upper section. So when you look at that area entirely in the upper, it's an undeveloped section. When we're looking at what we're trying to do now by gathering the information and trying to tweak landing laterals and all, it's going to help us lay out our development plan and with the new PAA that the legislation approved up there, it's going to allow us to lay out the Upper in a way that will facilitate probably plus or minus over 40% longer laterals than the laterals we drilled this year in the Lower. So that 10,000, 12,000 foot lateral that we're going to lay out in the Upper is going to create its own efficiencies, more so than we realized in the Lower. And with that development layout, it is our anticipation that we're going to narrow the gap on the return profile, on the delta between the EUR per well that we see in the Upper as opposed to what we realized in the Lower."

I'll now make a kind of 5,000 foot comment, Brian, and I'll turn it to Steve Lindeman. But in the -- our reserve revisions this year, we had our learning curve in the proximal drilling with some of our wells out there on the parent-child, kind of in the latter part of '18, beginning of '19. And we have -- when we saw the impacts of that drilling, and we lost some wells, not -- temporarily lose some wells or knock some off with some of the frac hits, we take that learning curve, and we see how we can mitigate it in the future, and that affected some of our PDP revisions down by these frac hits. One of the things that we've been able to do with our learning curve through this period of time, is look at the results of now proximinal drilling in all our future guidance. And our program is laid out, taking in consideration that it's all going to be a proximal drilling to existing wells. And the mitigating factors that have helped improve now our expectations versus our initial learning curve is looking at our completion designs. We have looked at the reduction in our fluid levels. That has helped considerably. We've also looked at the increase in clusters per stages. That has helped significantly on the offset effects.
We are also, as I've mentioned, in the Upper, but in the Lower also, we're looking at lateral placements to see the impact and benefits of lateral placements where we're taking in proximal development. We have also been using retrievable bridge plugs that has mitigated the impacts on offset wells. We've also tested perforation hole sizes to accommodate our fluid levels of pumping and how we're laying out the cluster. So all of this has helped mitigate the impacts going forward. We did experience through, to your point, about revisions, and particularly on the PDP side, some revisions on some wells which we took off -- reserves off on some of those PDP. But some of those wells that we've taken reserve off, we really haven't gone back and done the work over on, say, a handful of those wells. So that's kind of a higher level, and I'll let Steve add to how you handle some of our reserve bookings."

Brian, just to divide the revision into categories, we had 420 Bcf of positive revisions associated with our PUDs. That's a combination of drilling longer laterals and an increase in what our average booking would be for PUDs per lateral length. And then we had a 350 Bcf negative revision associated with some of the data that Dan's discussed, parent-child relationships. A lot of those occurred in wells that were stimulated in 2018 that we didn't realize the effect or see the effect into '19. But as Dan indicated, we've taken a number of remediation steps to improve and to mitigate some of this parent-child relationship. And then there was roughly about 30 Bcf or 10% that was impacted negatively to short-term line pressure gains in the field from turning offset pads on. And like Dan indicated, that should come back in future bookings as the line pressure levels out."

So the marketing group, Jeff, is always allocating, when we're going to bring on a large pad, is always allocating away from that particular area. As we've mentioned in the past, we have multiple options to move gas around. You'll allocate away from that as we bring on those Lower wells.

When Phil is, say, looking out ahead for our future programs, we -- today, we need to get out and -- you two, Jeff and Phil can correct me on this, but we need to be out ahead about 3 years, if you will, in order to coordinate the marketing side of our program to allow Williams to have the appropriate lines, to evaluate the amount of gas that we're going to be bringing, and I'm talking about a growth program and building up. It's going to be delivering gas at certain areas, certain compressor sites to be able to move the gas without having negative effects of higher line pressure and knocking wells off. So they are way out ahead on designing these pad sites, along with Phil's guys trying to do the logistics on the ground of roads, pad site construction, the permitting side, looking at, of course, the equipment and personnel necessary. 
So I would say the ramp-up, yes, it's a hell of a lot easier to cut off the purse strings and head down. It is a little bit more challenging to ramp up less and except if you had maybe stranded capital and you had, say, a frac crew or two teed up, but you weren't going to pull the string on those until a year from now, but you were paying some kind of rate to have them ready and available at that, just in the nick of time.

The level -- how much is covered by the dividend is going to be obviously a function of what the NYMEX strip is going forward. But we're looking at it exactly like you said. The other thing I would add in there, which I thought you were going to ask, is we have 2 small maturities in the next 2 years, and our plan is to use part of that free cash flow to just pay that debt off, which would further reduce our leverage about another $250 million, which, in this environment, makes a lot of sense. But we'll be opportunistic on buybacks when appropriate. But at the same time, I'm not opposed with my bent and Dan's bent to hoard a little cash if it makes sense because who knows where the strip is going to end up going."

We have always had strategic in-boardroom discussions on how we maximize shareholder value. That will continue. We just had our Board meeting this week. We had thorough discussions about the questions that you asked, how do we enhance shareholder value. In all -- every meeting we've discussed the market, the M&A, the activities that are going on in the macro space, the expectation of commodity pricing in the future, both oil versus gas. We look at the oil guys and how they're dealing with the issues that they deal with. We look at the gas guys on how they're dealing with their programs. And in the Northeast, we look at the -- the area around us is having some very, very good wells. Chesapeake has drilled some really good wells beside us. And if we could drill those wells, we would, and we do, also.
But to have an M&A transaction, it's just cumbersome. It's difficult. Up there, they're -- where our area up there is about 100% operated. And the areas that are west of us, they're not 100% operated. There's multiple partners that are in those wells. And that creates its own uniqueness to what you might do if you had those assets or if you're the operator of those assets. In the southwest part of the state, you have a lot of production going on in the southwest part of the state. But the balance sheets on some of those companies are admittedly stressed at this point in time. And they have maturities coming up that they're trying to deal with through their programs, and having that type of M&A conversation and all just is extremely difficult. 
When you look at a dual commodity split that there's circumstances that it would make sense. But you also have to understand the area that you might go into, the capital allocation you'd have in the future, the either accretion or dilution that you might have on that capital allocation. And quite frankly, the -- when you look at the strip price for oil right now and you look at the strip price for natural gas right now, Cabot delivers a very, very good return profile compared to all the wells that are being drilled out there and all the programs that are being drilled out there. 
So do I think, at times, it would have a benefit? Absolutely, it would if we had 2 environments to work in and operate in and also 2 commodities to dial levers in also. But trying to make that come together to get all the stars line up all at one time, it's a difficult proposition. That's why it's not done every day."

But when you look at our program and if you're comparing '19 to '20, if you look at our program, by design, our '19 program as a result of late innings drilling in '18, we had to answer some of the questions which I've already talked about, about how we implement technique changes on completions, drilling laterals, things like that to mitigate a proximal drilling. So our '19 program was designed to answer some of those questions, and we had our learning curve and that showed up in some of our numbers. We've mitigated the numbers that we presented in '19, even though a record year for Cabot. We've mitigated some of the concerns about proximal drilling by what we did. But when you look at our differences in the 60 or 70 wells, we had 25 wells that we designed specifically for the upper to try to get ahead of our program and learn about how we now -- because we had the daylight that the PA legislation created by the PAA decision and now the longer laterals and then working into the opportunity that Josh asked a while ago, how we can maybe develop the Upper in concert with the Lower. We had a lot of wells, and we were gathering a lot of data in the Upper purposely for that program.
In 2020 compared to '19, we only have 5 wells designed for the Upper. And the placement of some of our wells in our field are also going to be slightly different because in the queue of things, when we have pads ready and then they jump all over the field, 2020 program is going to have a less Uppers and the locations of the well of the pads that we're going to drill in the 2020 is going to be slightly enhanced in the geographic area that we'll drill compared to '19. So we do anticipate 2020 and a lot of areas is going to be an enhanced program to '19."

Everybody has their -- an opinion and everybody looks at what's going on in the market and the reasons for it. Everybody has their reasons why they might grow any into a market that we live in today and looking at the realizations that are out there today. And I think the financial numbers by the majority would dictate that if you had a vision that the current strip is going to be what it will be perpetually into the future, to your point, about 5 years, 6 years from now, I don't know why anybody would be drilling wells into -- as a growth measure into this market. I think it is a difficult to -- for me to sit in every chair out there and the reasons behind it. I do know there's reasons that are attached to debt positions and balance sheet concerns. I know there's reasons why maybe firm transportation arrangements might be dictating how you allocate capital. There has been midstream negotiations and separations, upstream from midstream. There's been changes in volume -- minimum volume and commitments and different things that are affecting decisions out there. We look at it as how we can manage the shareholder value in a way that is going to yield a return. 
We've been able to point to the fact that at a $2 NYMEX, we still generate free cash flow, we'll generate an earnings profile and so -- and even us, and there's nobody else that can make that statement, we are at a maintenance level of capital because we don't think it is prudent to drill up all your core inventory and push it out at a losing proposition. We don't think it's prudent to drill even at a marginal return profile and use it all up in this particular environment. 
So we're going to keep our balance sheet strong. We're going to manage our dividend. As Scott has mentioned, we're going to manage our debt towers as we have to and will also reduce further maintenance capital and reduce as opposed to have the growth out there in what we see in the current environment and the foreseeable future.

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's fourth quarter, full year 2019 earnings call. I do have the management team here with me today. I would first like to remind everyone that on this call this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earning release. 
For 2019, Cabot reported its best year in company history, while posting record levels of net income, operating cash flow, free cash flow, production, proved reserves and operating expense per unit. Some of the key highlights for the year include 41% growth in adjusted earnings per share, 90% growth in free cash flow, a return on capital employed of 22%, a return of $665 million of capital to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases, and 2 increases in our quarterly dividend per share. This represented a return of 118% of our free cash flow, far exceeding our target of returning at least 50% of our annual cash flow. And 18% increase in production and 11% increase in year-end proved reserves. And an 18% reduction in all-in operating expenses per unit to $1.44 per 1,000 cubic foot equivalent and a reduction in net debt to 0.7x EBITDAX. 
I think, by all standards, a very good year. 
Specific to the fourth quarter of '19, despite declining natural gas prices, we still generated $121 million of adjusted net income or $0.30 per share and $110 million of free cash flow, while returning over 190% of our free cash flow for the quarter to shareholders. We ended the fourth quarter with $200 million of cash on the balance sheet, which coupled with our expectations for a fifth consecutive year of free cash flow. And 2020 will allow us to continue to return a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders, while also providing financial strength in a challenging market.
On the operational front, in yesterday's release, we provided the results of our Upper Marcellus test from the last 2 years, which delivered an average EUR per 1,000 of approximately 2.7 Bcf. We believe these results highlight that our Upper Marcellus has a distinct incremental interval and it generates return that exceed the majority of assets across the basin. We plan to continue to test a limited number of Upper Marcellus wells annually to further optimize lateral placement and completion designs. 
However, our recent results are relatively in line with the average EUR of 2.9 Bcf per 1,000 foot across all of our Upper Marcellus drilled to date, which is a much larger sample size of over 50 wells. In the release, we also made reference to over 2 decades of remaining inventory life, which is consistent with our measure -- measuring over the past few years regarding our ability to continue to primarily focus on development plans on the Lower Marcellus through the latter part of this decade, before moving to the full development of the Upper Marcellus, which provides inventory life into the 2040 decade. This assumes a return to modest levels of growth in the future, if the price environment warrants it. In addition to the Lower and Upper Marcellus, we have tested other concepts across our acreage position that would be incremental to our multi-decade inventory life. While the testing of these concepts is still in the early phase, the results we have seen to date are very encouraging. 
Moving on to our plans for 2020. Earlier this month, we announced our official 2020 plan, which included the adoption of previously disclosed maintenance capital program of $575 million, representing a 27% reduction in capital spending year-over-year. Our corporate strategy has always been centered around the acute focus on disciplined capital allocation, and we believe this reduction in capital further demonstrates our commitment to that philosophy. Our 2020 program is projected to deliver an average net production rate of 2.4 Bcf cubic foot per day, up for the full year. Based on the current NYMEX future curve, this plan is expected to generate enough free cash flow to cover our dividend, while also providing a modest amount of excess free cash flow for further returns of capital to shareholders or debt repayment. At a $2.25 average NYMEX price, the plan is expected to generate $275 million to $300 million of free cash flow, while delivering a return on capital employed of 11% to 12%. Not too many programs can represent that.
We believe our current plan is the appropriate level of capital investment in this market environment. However, we will continue to assess the outlook for the natural gas market in 2020 and 2021, and are prepared to discuss capital spending reductions further if market conditions warrant it. Our guidance for 2020 includes modest sequential production declines in the first and second quarter, which we believe is prudent given the weakness in pricing we've experienced during the first quarter and expect to experience in the spring shoulder season. We are currently forecasting an increase in production beginning in the second half of the year, which corresponds with improvement in prices across the NYMEX future curve. As we look to 2021, while it's too premature to issue you any formal guidance, given the likelihood of continued volatility in commodity prices throughout the year, I would expect us to adopt a similar program next year if natural gas prices were to remain lower for the foreseeable future.
 
I would also add that while we are fully prepared for a continuation in this lower natural gas price environment, we believe that current activity levels across the country are not sustainable at these prices and ultimately, market forces should move natural gas supply and demonstrate a more sustainable balance in the future. 2020 could prove to be one of the most challenging natural gas markets in recent history. However, we continue to believe our business model is uniquely positioned to navigate through the market environment, giving our combination of low-cost assets and low leverage position. Giving our free cash flow outlook and our strong balance sheet, we remain fully committed to continuing to return capital to shareholders through a combination of dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, while also planning to pay down our current debt at maturity later this year. While it's impossible to predict when the prices may improve, even at the current strip prices for '21 and '22, we expect to expand our free cash flow yield and return on capital to levels that exceed the medium of the S&P 500. 
And Gary, with that, I'm more than happy to answer questions."

But I was wondering if you could take a little bit of time and characterize for us the relative maturity, or how far along you are on the path of optimization of your completions there. And if we look back at your history, it's several years ago now, but you guys moved the EUR per 1,000 feet of the Lower Marcellus up a number of times to arrive at the point where you are now. And I'm just wondering how much more optimization you think there might be left, whether -- you mentioned lateral placement and completion optimization.

One, as we've referenced, we've drilled only 50 wells in the Upper Marcellus, compared to 700 or so in the Lower Marcellus. And in the Lower Marcellus, we still look at efforts and tests on where we'",687,"Well, just a first set of facts on the Upper Marcellus. One, as we've referenced, we've drilled only 50 wells in the Upper Marcellus, compared to 700 or so in the Lower Marcellus. And in the Lower Marcellus, we still look at efforts and tests on where we're placing the lateral and how we tweak completions. With the Upper Marcellus, we drilled some early-stage Upper Marcellus wells that are in that 50 count. With those early-stage completions, we were just gathering the data with the completion -- generation completions we had at that particular time. As we have moved forward with trying to utilize what we've learned in the Lower and apply it to the Upper, we continue to tweak the results we've seen in some of the Upper wells with the -- what we've used in the Lower and trying to determine whether or not it's applicable in the Upper rock. 
The Upper, as a point of reference, is anywhere from -- the thickness is anywhere from, let's say, 140 to almost 300 feet in just the Upper. So the lateral placement is going to be important in that thickness of ice pack. We have looked at the laying wells in various different sections of that thick interval. One test we referenced was to look at that thick of interval and ask -- we asked the question, do we need to stagger and put a well in the higher part of the Upper and the lower part of the Upper and see if we can maximize drainage, effectiveness of return and so forth by doing so. 
Couple of the wells that we laid got a little bit too low in the Upper Marcellus, and those were not that effective wells and were not that good of wells because we, in 2020 hindsight, laid the laterals a little bit too low.
But that learning curve, Charles, to your point, is going to continue for an extended period of time. And when you couple that with a new legislative process that the Pennsylvania legislator have approved in the fourth quarter of 2019, it's allowing us to look at the development of the Upper a little bit different than we're looking at the -- and that we had to implement in the Lower. In the Lower -- and I'm little bit long-winded here, but I'll maybe cover other questions that others might have by the answer. In the Lower, we had unit designation sizes that had us at certain lateral lengths. We could only go so far with the unit designations with the certain lateral lengths in the Lower. And therefore, our -- for example, this last year, our average lateral length was over 8,000 feet in the Lower, but nevertheless, we have drilled some where we could that extended that laterally, gain of efficiencies, a little bit lower cost per foot and things like that. 
In the Upper, it's our expectation that when you look at the entire upper section, a very thick section, like I mentioned, there are only, in 170,000 something acres, there's only 50 take points in that upper section. So when you look at that area entirely in the upper, it's an undeveloped section. When we're looking at what we're trying to do now by gathering the information and trying to tweak landing laterals and all, it's going to help us lay out our development plan and with the new PAA that the legislation approved up there, it's going to allow us to lay out the Upper in a way that will facilitate probably plus or minus over 40% longer laterals than the laterals we drilled this year in the Lower. So that 10,000, 12,000 foot lateral that we're going to lay out in the Upper is going to create its own efficiencies, more so than we realized in the Lower. And with that development layout, it is our anticipation that we're going to narrow the gap on the return profile, on the delta between the EUR per well that we see in the Upper as opposed to what we realized in the Lower."

I'll now make a kind of 5,000 foot comment, Brian, and I'll turn it to Steve Lindeman. But in the -- our reserve revisions this year, we had our learning curve in the proximal drilling with some of our wells out there on the parent-child, kind of in the latter part of '18, beginning of '19. And we have -- when we saw the impacts of that drilling, and we lost some wells, not -- temporarily lose some wells or knock some off with some of the frac hits, we take that learning curve, and we see how we can mitigate it in the future, and that affected some of our PDP revisions down by these frac hits. One of the things that we've been able to do with our learning curve through this period of time, is look at the results of now proximinal drilling in all our future guidance. And our program is laid out, taking in consideration that it's all going to be a proximal drilling to existing wells. And the mitigating factors that have helped improve now our expectations versus our initial learning curve is looking at our completion designs. We have looked at the reduction in our fluid levels. That has helped considerably. We've also looked at the increase in clusters per stages. That has helped significantly on the offset effects.
We are also, as I've mentioned, in the Upper, but in the Lower also, we're looking at lateral placements to see the impact and benefits of lateral placements where we're taking in proximal development. We have also been using retrievable bridge plugs that has mitigated the impacts on offset wells. We've also tested perforation hole sizes to accommodate our fluid levels of pumping and how we're laying out the cluster. So all of this has helped mitigate the impacts going forward. We did experience through, to your point, about revisions, and particularly on the PDP side, some revisions on some wells which we took off -- reserves off on some of those PDP. But some of those wells that we've taken reserve off, we really haven't gone back and done the work over on, say, a handful of those wells. So that's kind of a higher level, and I'll let Steve add to how you handle some of our reserve bookings."

Brian, just to divide the revision into categories, we had 420 Bcf of positive revisions associated with our PUDs. That's a combination of drilling longer laterals and an increase in what our average booking would be for PUDs per lateral length. And then we had a 350 Bcf negative revision associated with some of the data that Dan's discussed, parent-child relationships. A lot of those occurred in wells that were stimulated in 2018 that we didn't realize the effect or see the effect into '19. But as Dan indicated, we've taken a number of remediation steps to improve and to mitigate some of this parent-child relationship. And then there was roughly about 30 Bcf or 10% that was impacted negatively to short-term line pressure gains in the field from turning offset pads on. And like Dan indicated, that should come back in future bookings as the line pressure levels out."

So the marketing group, Jeff, is always allocating, when we're going to bring on a large pad, is always allocating away from that particular area. As we've mentioned in the past, we have multiple options to move gas around. You'll allocate away from that as we bring on those Lower wells.

When Phil is, say, looking out ahead for our future programs, we -- today, we need to get out and -- you 2, Jeff and Phil can correct me on this, but we need to be out ahead about 3 years, if you will, in order to coordinate the marketing side of our program to allow Williams to have the appropriate lines, to evaluate the amount of gas that we're going to be bringing, and I'm talking about a growth program and building up. It's going to be delivering gas at certain areas, certain compressor sites to be able to move the gas without having negative effects of higher line pressure and knocking wells off. So they are way out ahead on designing these pad sites, along with Phil's guys trying to do the logistics on the ground of roads, pad site construction, the permitting side, looking at, of course, the equipment and personnel necessary. 
So I would say the ramp-up, yes, it's a hell of a lot easier to cut off the purse strings and head down. It is a little bit more challenging to ramp up less and except if you had maybe stranded capital and you had, say, a frac crew or 2 teed up, but you weren't going to pull the string on those until a year from now, but you were paying some kind of rate to have them ready and available at that, just in the nick of time.

The other thing I would add in there, which I thought you were going to ask, is we have 2 small maturities in the next 2 years, and our plan is to use part of that free cash flow to just pay that debt off, which would further reduce our leverage about another $250 million, which, in this environment, makes a lot of sense. But we'll be opportunistic on buybacks when appropriate. But at the same time, I'm not opposed with my bent and Dan's bent to hoard a little cash if it makes sense because who knows where the strip is going to end up going."

We have always had strategic in-boardroom discussions on how we maximize shareholder value. That will continue. We just had our Board meeting this week. We had thorough discussions about the questions that you asked, how do we enhance shareholder value. In all -- every meeting we've discussed the market, the M&A, the activities that are going on in the macro space, the expectation of commodity pricing in the future, both oil versus gas. We look at the oil guys and how they're dealing with the issues that they deal with. We look at the gas guys on how they're dealing with their programs. And in the Northeast, we look at the -- the area around us is having some very, very good wells. Chesapeake has drilled some really good wells beside us. And if we could drill those wells, we would, and we do, also.
But to have an M&A transaction, it's just cumbersome. It's difficult. Up there, they're -- where our area up there is about 100% operated. And the areas that are west of us, they're not 100% operated. There's multiple partners that are in those wells. And that creates its own uniqueness to what you might do if you had those assets or if you're the operator of those assets. In the southwest part of the state, you have a lot of production going on in the southwest part of the state. But the balance sheets on some of those companies are admittedly stressed at this point in time. And they have maturities coming up that they're trying to deal with through their programs, and having that type of M&A conversation and all just is extremely difficult. 
When you look at a dual commodity split that there's circumstances that it would make sense. But you also have to understand the area that you might go into, the capital allocation you'd have in the future, the either accretion or dilution that you might have on that capital allocation. And quite frankly, the -- when you look at the strip price for oil right now and you look at the strip price for natural gas right now, Cabot delivers a very, very good return profile compared to all the wells that are being drilled out there and all the programs that are being drilled out there. 
So do I think, at times, it would have a benefit? Absolutely, it would if we had 2 environments to work in and operate in and also 2 commodities to dial levers in also. But trying to make that come together to get all the stars line up all at one time, it's a difficult proposition. That's why it's not done every day."

But when you look at our program and if you're comparing '19 to '20, if you look at our program, by design, our '19 program as a result of late innings drilling in '18, we had to answer some of the questions which I've already talked about, about how we implement technique changes on completions, drilling laterals, things like that to mitigate a proximal drilling. So our '19 program was designed to answer some of those questions, and we had our learning curve and that showed up in some of our numbers. We've mitigated the numbers that we presented in '19, even though a record year for Cabot. We've mitigated some of the concerns about proximal drilling by what we did. But when you look at our differences in the 60 or 70 wells, we had 25 wells that we designed specifically for the upper to try to get ahead of our program and learn about how we now -- because we had the daylight that the PA legislation created by the PAA decision and now the longer laterals and then working into the opportunity that Josh asked a while ago, how we can maybe develop the Upper in concert with the Lower. We had a lot of wells, and we were gathering a lot of data in the Upper purposely for that program.
In 2020 compared to '19, we only have 5 wells designed for the Upper. And the placement of some of our wells in our field are also going to be slightly different because in the queue of things, when we have pads ready and then they jump all over the field, 2020 program is going to have a less Uppers and the locations of the well of the pads that we're going to drill in the 2020 is going to be slightly enhanced in the geographic area that we'll drill compared to '19. So we do anticipate 2020 and a lot of areas is going to be an enhanced program to '19."

Everybody has their -- an opinion and everybody looks at what's going on in the market and the reasons for it. Everybody has their reasons why they might grow any into a market that we live in today and looking at the realizations that are out there today. And I think the financial numbers by the majority would dictate that if you had a vision that the current strip is going to be what it will be perpetually into the future, to your point, about 5 years, 6 years from now, I don't know why anybody would be drilling wells into -- as a growth measure into this market. I think it is a difficult to -- for me to sit in every chair out there and the reasons behind it. I do know there's reasons that are attached to debt positions and balance sheet concerns. I know there's reasons why maybe firm transportation arrangements might be dictating how you allocate capital. There has been midstream negotiations and separations, upstream from midstream. There's been changes in volume -- minimum volume and commitments and different things that are affecting decisions out there. We look at it as how we can manage the shareholder value in a way that is going to yield a return. 
We've been able to point to the fact that at a $2 NYMEX, we still generate free cash flow, we'll generate an earnings profile and so -- and even us, and there's nobody else that can make that statement, we are at a maintenance level of capital because we don't think it is prudent to drill up all your core inventory and push it out at a losing proposition. We don't think it's prudent to drill even at a marginal return profile and use it all up in this particular environment. 
So we're going to keep our balance sheet strong. We're going to manage our dividend. As Scott has mentioned, we're going to manage our debt towers as we have to and will also reduce further maintenance capital and reduce as opposed to have the growth out there in what we see in the current environment and the foreseeable future.

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Before I get into our performance for the first quarter, I'd like to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by COVID-19. I want to thank those",1153,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Before I get into our performance for the first quarter, I'd like to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by COVID-19. I want to thank those individuals on the front lines, especially the health care workers who have been working to keep us all safe during this pandemic. Additionally, I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless efforts to keep our operations running efficiently. While we are navigating through truly challenging times, I would never bet against the resiliency of the manure, and I do expect us to emerge from this period even stronger. 
As a reminder, on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
During the first quarter, Cabot generated positive net income of $53.9 million or $0.14 per share and $49.8 million of positive free cash flow despite a 49% decrease in realized prices relative to the prior year period, highlighting the company's ability to deliver profit and free cash flow even in the most challenging of markets. 
We returned approximately 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend, which currently yields approximately 2% on an annualized basis. We remain fully committed to our dividend and, based on current NYMEX futures for 2020, our program for the year is expected to generate enough free cash flow to fully cover our dividend. 
Our balance sheet remains iron-clad, with net debt for the trailing 12-month EBITDAX ratio of 0.9x. 
Our lenders group recently unanimously reaffirmed our $3.2 billion borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. 
Aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility remained at $1.5 billion, which results in approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity at the end of the first quarter, when including over $200 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
We have an $87 million tranche of debt maturing in July of this year, which we plan to pay off with a portion of our cash position. 
On the operational front, our production for the first quarter was 2.363 billion cubic foot per day, which was inside our guidance range for the quarter. We placed 9 wells on production during the quarter, all of which were turned in line during February. We are currently operating 2 rigs and utilizing 2 completion crews. 
As previously disclosed, we expect sequential decline in production during the second quarter, driven in large part by a lighter turn in line schedule during the first 4.5 months of the year with only 13 wells expected to be placed on production between the beginning of the year and mid-May. This is primarily a result of long-cycle times for large pads with long laterals during the first and second quarter. Additionally, our forecast assumes modest price-related curtailments during the natural gas shoulder season. 
Our second quarter production guidance range also reflects the impact of an unplanned downtime related to remedial work on 1 well on a large pad that resulted in the deferral of over 230 completed stages from the first quarter to the second quarter, which led to lower capital spending levels in the first quarter. 
We have updated our full year production guidance to a range of 2.35 to 2.375 billion cubic foot per day to reflect the previously mentioned operational changes. The midpoint of this range implies flat production levels year-over-year. 
Additionally, we have reaffirmed our capital program of $575 million. 
We do expect a significant sequential increase in production during the third quarter based on expectations of placing approximately 2/3 of our wells on production between mid-May and late August, while our fourth quarter production is expected to be flat with the fourth quarter levels from last year. 
We used the recent rally in 2020 NYMEX futures to layer in additional hedges for the summer months to protect against the potential for more prolonged demand destruction this summer related to the global pandemic. However, the outlook for natural gas prices later this year and into 2021 has drastically improved since our year-end call in February with a 2021 NYMEX future increasing by almost $0.50 to approximately $2.75 per MMBTU. This has been driven by the expectation for significant gas supply declines in 2020 and 2021 from the substantial reduction in activity levels we have seen in legacy gas producing basins like the Marcellus, the Haynesville and Utica, in addition to sizable cuts in activity we are seeing in oil basins like the Permian, Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent, which are expected to result in significant declines in associated gas production. 
It is premature to disclose any formal guidance for 2021 at this point. However, I would highlight that a maintenance capital program next year would deliver a free cash flow yield over 6% and a return on capital employed of approximately 20% at the current strip, all while maintaining a net leverage ratio below 1x EBITDA. 
As of today, we remain unhedged for 2021 as we continue to assess the natural gas market outlook for next year. While the recent increase in the forward curve for 2021 is extremely positive for us, we believe that the market is currently underestimating the potential undersupply of natural gas markets entering into 2021, providing us optimism that the forward curve for 2021 will need to move higher to incentivize increased activity levels to address the undersupplied market. For reference, every $0.10 improvement in the annual NYMEX price in 2021 results in approximately $55 million of incremental free cash flow under a maintenance capital scenario, highlighting the opportunity for significant free cash flow expansion and increased levels of capital returned to shareholders next year. 
While 2020 will likely prove to be a trough year for our free cash flow and return on capital employed due to the lower price environment we are managing through currently resulted from an oversupply market exiting last winter, our outlook for the year, however, is markedly -- next year is markedly improved. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital spending with an acute focus on delivering on the strategic objectives we have laid out previously, including focusing on financial returns, demonstrating continued cost control, maintaining our financial strength generating positive free cash flow, returning capital to shareholders and increasing our proved reserve base. 
I once again like to stress that our thoughts are on anyone who has been impacted during this difficult time, including our employees and shareholders. EBIT remains extremely healthy financially. And given the current outlook for natural gas market in 2021, we believe we will emerge from this period stronger than before. 
With that, I'm happy to open it up for any questions."

We're looking at all scenarios. And our focus is on our current program in 2020 being efficient as we can possibly be. 
And just a comment on growth in general, if you look at our industry and you take a step back and you look at the carnage that's out there right now and all that we're dealing with, you have a number of stressed balance sheets. You have oversupplied in markets. You have low commodity price in both oil and gas. And it seems that this is a bad replay each time you get a little bit of growth or increase in price, everybody jumps in and tries to take advantage of that increase. And the issue for us is before we would make a decision for growth, we would have to feel comfortable that there's some fundamental changes, and it's sustainable in the long term versus having a few months of an increase and trying to spend capital for that. You participate for a little bit better pricing for a short period of time, pricing rolls off and you still hadn't recaptured all your excess capital you put into it. That, again, has been played back over and over and over. And that's why there's such stress and distress in our market. You look at the strip right now, you can go out into 2024, and I think you get into somewhere like an average, it's such a backwardated market, you get into an average of 2 40, 2 45, somewhere in that range. That's not what we would view as a sustainable market. And the backwardation for us gives us concern. Now if we had a contango market, I felt comfortable about that. We would participate in the growth side of that story. With that said, our program has built in through our service contracts flexibility to spend more capital if we chose and to complete a few more stages and to build up into 2021, if, in fact, we elect to do so. We've kind of given right now at our production level our maintenance capital that we're at kind of today is kind of the maintenance capital we would have rolling forward also. So we feel comfortable where we are, our focus being on generating free cash flow. And the financial metrics is going to be our focus. It has for years. This is our fifth year of generating free cash flow in what has been historically, the -- one of the depressed markets that we had in a long, long time. And we're one of the few companies that can make that claim, and we're not going to change the way we perceive it. We'd love to have the higher sustainable commodity strip. We'd love to grow into it, but we're cautious with our balance sheet and our capital exposure."

And you got the tagline there on returning 50% at least to shareholders. And even right now, we've kind of returned, what, 80% or so. So and in the past, we've returned more with the -- we bought back about 14% of our shares. We've increased our dividend about 5x since 2017. So we feel good about what we can deliver with our program. We referenced the maintenance program for 2021, as an example, to illustrate that we're focused on the financing metrics. But at least the 50% going back. And if you look historically, we have delivered more back to shareholders. Our base operation is priority, obviously, for the most part. And then maintaining that dividend that we currently have is another important consideration for us. Kind of put in growing the dividend and also, obviously, we always -- we don't have a real -- a large amount of debt and certainly don't have much near term, but considerations for debt repayment is always going to fall into the mix. But after maintaining the dividend, growing the dividend is a strong consideration. If we saw sustainable, we saw a sustainable commodity strip and we felt comfortable that layering in a little bit more capital would give us growth into a market that would allow an expected return of that capital before any roll-off would occur with commodity price, i.e., oversupplied and under demand, then we would use some of that capital for that. And we've always been interested in optimistic buybacks, if there's a disconnect."

And Jeff Hutton presented the marketing outlook to the Board and talked about where we think the market might go. And so it is a consideration, Josh. We, at this stage, in looking ahead in what we think the market will do, we're actually very pleased that we're unhedged in 2021. I think that -- I think we're going to be able to couch the hedges that we placed in 2021 when we do it as offensive hedges. And we're looking forward to do it. We'll continue to take consideration of where the market is currently and also anticipate where we think it might go to layer in hedges. So I understand your position.

The difficult part each time we grind on it, the difficult part is the debt levels and the debt load associated with the Appalachia peers. It is a significant debt load. The loss of some of the market caps through all this carnage that we've been going through has such a large percentage of debt compared to an equity in these companies. And it just makes a combination, if you will, a difficult analysis particularly for us. It's -- we have what we think is extremely good asset. We are cognizant of the fact of any dilution that might occur with a combination. And if you -- if it comes with a debt load that we're not prepared to take and it comes with acreage that -- each company has some good acreage, but each company has maybe some acreage that would not line up in our drilling schedule for 20-plus years. So it's difficult.

With the in-basin demand that we've picked up over the last couple of years with the 2 power plants and some miscellaneous in-basin customers, we've been able to, again, exceed the in-basin supply prices that are typical in that neck of the woods. But as we see better pricing and going out into 2021 and with differentials being very close to what they are in this very poor pricing environment, it's encouraging to see that our in-basin supply is one that receive a much higher realization than historically."

And thanks for the question, Jeffrey, and I'll flip it to Jeff here in a second, but we're looking at certainly the lower supply and feel like the shut ins, the frac holidays, the associated gas reduction, the reduction in capital allocation going forward are all constructive to reduce supply. We feel good about the reduction in supply, and it's going to be somewhere probably between 8 to 10 Bcf a day reduction in supply is kind of conventional wisdom right now. And we've seen prior to this pandemic coming through and with the start of demand loss, we were actually seeing some pretty healthy demand numbers out there. And I'll let Jeff make his comments on the outlook on both."

I will say that there are a lot of positives, though, that need to be considered and another reason the strip is trading the way it is. As we look at the larger macro view, we are seeing industrial demand down anywhere from 1 Bcf to 1.5 Bcf a day. That's no secret. But we've also seen, as we enter the shoulder months, little bit of demand [ destruction, ] as you normally would see it with residential, commercial and the power side. But we do expect the shoulder month was to leave us shortly. We expect the industrial demand to pick up here during Q2. But on the most positive side, we've just hit a record on exports to Mexico. And then on the LNG side, yes, there has been a few cargoes delayed, but as you look back this year, I believe the LNG export averages are very close to capacity, maybe at least in excess of 8 Bcf a day. So the resiliency of LNG and Mexican exports and the fact that we've been in a slump with the economy, but are taking steps to get out of that slump, is very encouraging. So I think on the macro view, with the supply decline, price holidays, et cetera, that Dan described and a possibility of a 8, 9, 10 Bcf a day reduction in supply year-over-year from this point in time, paints a pretty good picture for 2021."

Before I get into our performance for the first quarter, I'd like to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by COVID-19. I want to thank those",1152,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Before I get into our performance for the first quarter, I'd like to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by COVID-19. I want to thank those individuals on the front lines, especially the health care workers, who have been working to keep us all safe during this pandemic. Additionally, I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless efforts to keep our operations running efficiently. While we are navigating through truly challenging times, I would never bet against the resiliency of the human spirit, and I do expect us to emerge from this period even stronger.
As a reminder, on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release.
During the first quarter, Cabot generated positive net income of $53.9 million or $0.14 per share and $49.8 million of positive free cash flow despite a 49% decrease in realized prices relative to the prior year period, highlighting the company's ability to deliver profit and free cash flow even in the most challenging of markets.
We returned approximately 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend, which currently yields approximately 2% on an annualized basis. We remain fully committed to our dividend, and based on current NYMEX futures for 2020, our program for the year is expected to generate enough free cash flow to fully cover our dividend. Our balance sheet remains iron-clad, with net debt-to-trailing 12 months EBITDAX ratio of 0.9x.
Our lenders group recently unanimously reaffirmed our $3.2 billion borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. Aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility remain at $1.5 billion, which results in approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity at the end of the first quarter when including over $200 million of cash on the balance sheet. We have an $87 million tranche of debt maturing in July of this year, which we plan to pay off with a portion of our cash position.
On the operational front, our production for the first quarter was 2.363 billion cubic foot per day, which was inside our guidance range for the quarter. We placed 9 wells on production during the quarter, all of which were turned in line during February. We are currently operating 2 rigs and utilizing 2 completion crews.
As previously disclosed, we expect sequential decline in production during the second quarter driven in large part by a lighter turn-in-line schedule during the first 4.5 months of the year, with only 13 wells expected to be placed on production between the beginning of the year and mid-May. This is primarily a result of long cycle times for large pads with long laterals during the first and second quarter. Additionally, our forecast assumes modest price-related curtailments during the natural gas shoulder season.
Our second quarter production guidance range also reflects the impact of an unplanned downtime related to remedial work on 1 well on a large pad that resulted in the deferral of over 230 completed stages from the first quarter to the second quarter, which led to lower capital spending levels in the first quarter.
We have updated our full year production guidance to a range of 2.35 to 2.375 billion cubic foot per day to reflect the previously mentioned operational changes. The midpoint of this range implies flat production levels year-over-year.
Additionally, we have reaffirmed our capital program of $575 million. We do expect a significant sequential increase in production during the third quarter based on expectations of placing approximately 2/3 of our wells on production between mid-May and late August, while our fourth quarter production is expected to be flat with the fourth quarter levels from last year.
We used the recent rally in 2020 NYMEX futures to layer in additional hedges for the summer months to protect against the potential for more prolonged demand destruction this summer related to the global pandemic. However, the outlook for natural gas prices later this year and into 2021 has drastically improved since our year-end call in February, with a 2021 NYMEX future increasing by almost $0.50 to approximately $2.75 per MMBtu. This has been driven by the expectation for significant gas supply declines in 2020 and 2021 from the substantial reduction in activity levels we have seen in legacy gas-producing basins like the Marcellus, the Haynesville and Utica, in addition to sizable cuts in activity we are seeing in oil basins like the Permian, Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent, which are expected to result in significant declines in associated gas production.
It is premature to disclose any formal guidance for 2021 at this point. However, I would highlight that a maintenance capital program next year would deliver a free cash flow yield over 6% and a return on capital employed of approximately 20% at the current strip, all while maintaining a net leverage ratio below 1x EBITDA.
As of today, we remain unhedged for 2021 as we continue to assess the natural gas market outlook for next year. While the recent increase in the forward curve for 2021 is extremely positive for us, we believe that the market is currently underestimating a potential undersupply of natural gas markets entering into 2021, providing us optimism that the forward curve for 2021 will need to move higher to incentivize increased activity levels to address the undersupplied market. For reference, every $0.10 improvement in the annual NYMEX price in 2021 results in approximately $55 million of incremental free cash flow under a maintenance capital scenario, highlighting the opportunity for significant free cash flow expansion and increased levels of capital returned to shareholders next year.
While 2020 will likely prove to be a trough year for our free cash flow and our return on capital employed due to the lower price environment we are managing through currently resulted from an oversupply market exiting last winter, our outlook for the year, however, is markedly -- next year is markedly improved. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital spending with an acute focus on delivering on the strategic objectives we have laid out previously, including focusing on financial returns, demonstrating continued cost control, maintaining our financial strength generating positive free cash flow, returning capital to shareholders and increasing our proved reserve base.
I would once again like to stress that our thoughts are with anyone who has been impacted during this difficult time, including our employees and shareholders. Cabot remains extremely healthy financially. And given the current outlook for natural gas market in 2021, we believe we will emerge from this period stronger than before.
With that, I'm happy to open it up for any questions."

We're looking at all scenarios. But our focus is on our current program in 2020 being as efficient as we can possibly be. 
And just a comment on growth in general. If you look at our industry and you take a step back and you look at the carnage that's out there right now and all that we're dealing with, you have a number of stressed balance sheets, you have oversupplied end markets, you have low commodity price in both oil and gas. And it seems that this is a bad replay. Each time you get a little bit of growth or increase in price, everybody jumps in and tries to take advantage of that increase. And the issue for us is before we would make a decision for growth, we would have to feel comfortable that there's some fundamental changes, and it's sustainable in the long term versus having a few months of an increase and trying to spend capital for that. You participate for a little bit better pricing for a short period of time, pricing rolls off and you still hadn't recaptured all your excess capital you put into it. That, again, has been played back over and over and over. And that's why there's such stress and distress in our market.
You look at the strip right now, you can go out into 2024, and I think you'd get into somewhere like an average -- it's such a backward-dated market, you'd get into an average of $2.40, $2.45, somewhere in that range. That's not what we would view as a sustainable market. And the backwardation for us gives us concern. Now if we had a contango market, I felt comfortable about that. And we would participate in the growth side of that story.
With that said, our program is -- has built in, through our service contracts, flexibility to dispense more capital if we chose and to complete a few more stages and to build up into 2021, if, in fact, we elect to do so. We've kind of given right now at our production level our maintenance capital that we're at kind of today is kind of the maintenance capital we would have rolling forward also. So we feel comfortable where we are, our focus being on generating free cash flow. And the financial metrics is going to be our focus. It has for years. This is our fifth year of generating free cash flow in what has been historically, the -- one of the depressed markets that we had in a long, long time. And we're one of the few companies that can make that claim. And we're not going to change the way we perceive it. We'd love to have the higher sustainable commodity strip. We'd love to grow into it. But we're cautious with our balance sheet and our capital exposure."

So we feel good about what we can deliver with our program. We referenced the maintenance program for 2021 as an example to illustrate that we're focused on the financing metrics. But at least the 50% going back. And if you look historically, we have delivered more back to shareholders.
Our base operation is priority, obviously, for the most part. And then maintaining that dividend that we currently have is another important consideration for us. Kind of put in growing the dividend and also, obviously, we always -- we don't have a real -- a large amount of debt and certainly don't have much near term, but considerations for debt repayment is always going to fall into the mix. But after maintaining the dividend, growing the dividend is a strong consideration. If we saw a sustainable commodity strip and we felt comfortable that layering in a little bit more capital would give us growth into a market that would allow an expected return of that capital before any roll-off would occur with commodity price, i.e., oversupplied and underdemand, then we would use some of that capital for that. And we've always been interested in opportunistic buybacks, if there's a disconnect."

As I've said in the past, Brian, and you're totally aware that we have that conversation at our executive session and our Board at every Board meeting. The market, I think, still needs to consolidate. It's been our position for a long time that consolidation would be healthy. The difficult part -- each time we grind on it, the difficult part is the debt levels and the debt load associated with the Appalachia peers. It is a significant debt load. The loss of some of the market caps through all this carnage that we've been going through has such a large percentage of debt compared to an equity in these companies. And it just makes a combination, if you will, a difficult analysis particularly for us. It's -- we have what we think is extremely good asset. We are cognizant of the fact of any dilution that might occur with a combination. And if you -- if it comes with a debt load that we're not prepared to take and it comes with acreage that -- each company has some good acreage, but each company has maybe some acreage that would not line up in our drilling schedule for 20-plus years. So it's difficult. If there were quality assets that made sense, we would always look at that as we've done for years and years and years and years, but also meeting our expectations on what fits for a valuation for Cabot and its shareholders versus what sellers expectations might be. It's always hard to get it lined up. But I'm not trying to dance around the question, Brian. But I think if I could put down the #1 reason why it makes things so difficult, it's the drop quality and debt levels."

Jeffrey, as you mentioned, the situation we find ourselves here today, as a result of the virus and the local demand destruction that we've seen, is troubling. I will say that the -- there are a lot of positives, though, that need to be considered and another reason the strip is trading the way it is. As we look at the larger macro view, we are seeing industrial demand down anywhere from 1 Bcf to 1.5 Bcf a day. That's no secret. But we've also seen, as we enter the shoulder months, little bit of demand destruction, as you normally would see it with residential, commercial and the power side. But we do expect the shoulder month was to leave us shortly. We expect the industrial demand to pick up here during Q2.
But on the most positive side, we've just hit a record on exports to Mexico. And then on the LNG side, yes, there has been a few cargoes delayed. But as you look back this year, I believe the LNG export averages are very close to capacity, maybe at least in excess of 8 Bcf a day. So the resiliency of LNG and Mexican exports and the fact that we've been in a slump with the economy but are taking steps to get out of that slump is very encouraging. So I think on the macro view, with the supply decline, price holidays, et cetera, that Dan described and a possibility of a 8, 9, 10 Bcf a day reduction in supply year-over-year from this point in time, paints a pretty good picture for 2021."

Before I get into our performance for the first quarter, I'd like to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by COVID-19. I want to thank those",1152,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Before I get into our performance for the first quarter, I'd like to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by COVID-19. I want to thank those individuals on the front lines, especially the health care workers, who have been working to keep us all safe during this pandemic. Additionally, I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless efforts to keep our operations running efficiently. While we are navigating through truly challenging times, I would never bet against the resiliency of the human spirit, and I do expect us to emerge from this period even stronger.
As a reminder, on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release.
During the first quarter, Cabot generated positive net income of $53.9 million or $0.14 per share and $49.8 million of positive free cash flow despite a 49% decrease in realized prices relative to the prior year period, highlighting the company's ability to deliver profit and free cash flow even in the most challenging of markets.
We returned approximately 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend, which currently yields approximately 2% on an annualized basis. We remain fully committed to our dividend, and based on current NYMEX futures for 2020, our program for the year is expected to generate enough free cash flow to fully cover our dividend. Our balance sheet remains ironclad, with net debt-to-trailing 12 months EBITDAX ratio of 0.9x.
Our lenders group recently unanimously reaffirmed our $3.2 billion borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. Aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility remain at $1.5 billion, which results in approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity at the end of the first quarter when including over $200 million of cash on the balance sheet. We have an $87 million tranche of debt maturing in July of this year, which we plan to pay off with a portion of our cash position.
On the operational front, our production for the first quarter was 2.363 billion cubic foot per day, which was inside our guidance range for the quarter. We placed 9 wells on production during the quarter, all of which were turned in line during February. We are currently operating 2 rigs and utilizing 2 completion crews.
As previously disclosed, we expect sequential decline in production during the second quarter, driven in large part by a lighter turn-in-line schedule during the first 4.5 months of the year, with only 13 wells expected to be placed on production between the beginning of the year and mid-May. This is primarily a result of long cycle times for large pads with long laterals during the first and second quarter. Additionally, our forecast assumes modest price-related curtailments during the natural gas shoulder season.
Our second quarter production guidance range also reflects the impact of an unplanned downtime related to remedial work on 1 well on a large pad that resulted in the deferral of over 230 completed stages from the first quarter to the second quarter, which led to lower capital spending levels in the first quarter.
We have updated our full-year production guidance to a range of 2.35 to 2.375 billion cubic foot per day to reflect the previously mentioned operational changes. The midpoint of this range implies flat production levels year-over-year.
Additionally, we have reaffirmed our capital program of $575 million. We do expect a significant sequential increase in production during the third quarter, based on expectations of placing approximately 2/3 of our wells on production, between mid-May and late August, while our fourth quarter production is expected to be flat with the fourth quarter levels from last year.
We used the recent rally in 2020 NYMEX futures to layer in additional hedges for the summer months to protect against the potential for more prolonged demand disruption this summer related to the global pandemic. However, the outlook for natural gas prices, later this year and into 2021 has drastically improved since our year-end call in February, with a 2021 NYMEX future increasing by almost $0.50 to approximately $2.75 per MMBtu. This has been driven by the expectation for significant gas supply declines in 2020 and 2021 from the substantial reduction in activity levels we have seen in legacy gas-producing basins like the Marcellus, the Haynesville and Utica, in addition to sizable cuts in activity we are seeing in oil basins like the Permian, Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent, which are expected to result in significant declines in associated gas production.
It is premature to disclose any formal guidance for 2021 at this point. However, I would highlight that a maintenance capital program next year would deliver a free cash flow yield over 6% and a return on capital employed of approximately 20% at the current strip, all while maintaining a net leverage ratio below 1x EBITDA.
As of today, we remain unhedged for 2021, as we continue to assess the natural gas market outlook for next year. While the recent increase in the forward curve for 2021 is extremely positive for us, we believe that the market is currently underestimating a potential undersupply of natural gas markets entering into 2021, providing us optimism that the forward curve for 2021 will need to move higher to incentivize increased activity levels to address the undersupplied market. For reference, every $0.10 improvement in the annual NYMEX price in 2021 results in an approximately $55 million of incremental free cash flow under a maintenance capital scenario, highlighting the opportunity for significant free cash flow expansion and increased levels of capital returned to shareholders next year.
While 2020 will likely prove to be a trough year for our free cash flow and our return on capital employed due to the lower price environment, we are managing through, currently, resulted from an oversupply market exiting last winter, our outlook for the year, however, is markedly -- next year is markedly improved. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital spending with an acute focus on delivering on the strategic objectives we have laid out, previously, including focusing on financial returns, demonstrating continued cost control, maintaining our financial strength, generating positive free cash flow, returning capital to shareholders and increasing our proved reserve base.
I would once again like to stress that our thoughts are with anyone who has been impacted during this difficult time, including our employees and shareholders. Cabot remains extremely healthy, financially. And given the current outlook for natural gas market in 2021, we believe we will emerge from this period stronger than before.
With that, I'm happy to open it up for any questions."

We're looking at all scenarios. But our focus is on our current program in 2020, being as efficient as we can possibly be. 
And just a comment on growth in general. If you look at our industry and you take a step back and you look at the carnage that's out there right now and all that we're dealing with, you have a number of stressed balance sheets, you have oversupplied end markets, you have low commodity price in both oil and gas. And it seems that this is a bad replay. Each time you get a little bit of growth or increase in price, everybody jumps in and tries to take advantage of that increase. And the issue for us is, before we would make a decision for growth, we would have to feel comfortable that there's some fundamental changes, and it's sustainable in the long term versus having a few months of an increase and trying to spend capital for that. You participate for a little bit better pricing for a short period of time, pricing rolls off and you still hadn't recaptured all your excess capital you put into it. That, again, has been played back over and over and over. And that's why there's such stress and distress in our market.
You look at the strip right now, you can go out into 2024, and I think you'd get into somewhere like an average -- it's such a backward-dated market, you'd get into an average of $2.40, $2.45, somewhere in that range. That's not what we would view as a sustainable market. And the backwardation for us gives us concern now. If we had a contango market, I felt comfortable about that. And we would participate in the growth side of that story.
With that said, our program is -- has built in, through our service contracts, flexibility to dispense more capital if we chose and to complete a few more stages and to build up into 2021, if, in fact, we elect to do so. We've kind of given right now at our production level our maintenance capital that we're at kind of today is kind of the maintenance capital we would have rolling forward also. So we feel comfortable where we are, our focus being on generating free cash flow. And the financial metrics is going to be our focus. It has for years. This is our fifth year of generating free cash flow in what has been historically, the -- one of the depressed markets that we had in a long, long time. And we're one of the few companies that can make that claim. And we're not going to change the way we perceive it. We'd love to have the higher sustainable commodity strip. We'd love to grow into it. But we're cautious with our balance sheet and our capital exposure."

So we feel good about what we can deliver with our program. We referenced the maintenance program for 2021 as an example to illustrate that we're focused on the financing metrics. But at least the 50% going back. And if you look historically, we have delivered more back to shareholders.
Our base operation is priority, obviously, for the most part. And then maintaining that dividend that we currently have is another important consideration for us. Kind of put in growing the dividend and also, obviously, we always -- we don't have a real -- a large amount of debt and certainly don't have much near term, but considerations for debt repayment is always going to fall into the mix. But after maintaining the dividend, growing the dividend is a strong consideration. If we saw a sustainable commodity strip and we felt comfortable that layering in a little bit more capital would give us growth into a market that would allow an expected return of that capital before any roll-off would occur with commodity price, i.e., oversupplied and underdemand, then we would use some of that capital for that. And we've always been interested in opportunistic buybacks, if there is a disconnect."

The difficult part -- each time we grind on it, the difficult part is the debt levels and the debt load associated with the Appalachia peers. It is a significant debt load. The loss of some of the market caps through all this carnage that we've been going through has such a large percentage of debt compared to an equity in these companies. And it just makes a combination, if you will, a difficult analysis, particularly for us. It's -- we have, what we think is extremely good asset. We are cognizant of the fact of any dilution that might occur with a combination. And if you -- if it comes with a debt load that we're not prepared to take and it comes with acreage that -- each company has some good acreage, but each company has maybe some acreage that would not line up in our drilling schedule for 20-plus years.

Jeffrey, as you mentioned, the situation we find ourselves here today, as a result of the virus and the local demand destruction that we've seen, is troubling. I will say that the -- there are a lot of positives, though, that need to be considered and another reason the strip is trading the way it is. As we look at the larger macro view, we are seeing industrial demand down anywhere from 1 Bcf to 1.5 Bcf a day. That's no secret. But we've also seen, as we enter the shoulder months, little bit of demand destruction, as you normally would see it with residential, commercial and the power side. But we do expect the shoulder month was to leave us shortly. We expect the industrial demand to pick up here during Q2.
But on the most positive side, we've just hit a record on exports to Mexico. And then on the LNG side, yes, there has been a few cargoes delayed. But as you look back this year, I believe the LNG export averages are very close to capacity, maybe at least in excess of 8 Bcf a day. So the resiliency of LNG and Mexican exports and the fact that we've been in a slump with the economy but are taking steps to get out of that slump is very encouraging. So I think on the macro view, with the supply decline, frac holidays, et cetera, that Dan described and a possibility of a 8, 9, 10 Bcf a day reduction in supply year-over-year from this point in time, paints a pretty good picture for 2021."

Before I get into our performance for the first quarter, I'd like to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by COVID-19. I want to thank those",1152,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Before I get into our performance for the first quarter, I'd like to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by COVID-19. I want to thank those individuals on the front lines, especially the health care workers, who have been working to keep us all safe during this pandemic. Additionally, I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless efforts to keep our operations running efficiently. While we are navigating through truly challenging times, I would never bet against the resiliency of the human spirit, and I do expect us to emerge from this period even stronger.
As a reminder, on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release.
During the first quarter, Cabot generated positive net income of $53.9 million or $0.14 per share and $49.8 million of positive free cash flow despite a 49% decrease in realized prices relative to the prior year period, highlighting the company's ability to deliver profit and free cash flow even in the most challenging of markets.
We returned approximately 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend, which currently yields approximately 2% on an annualized basis. We remain fully committed to our dividend, and based on current NYMEX futures for 2020, our program for the year is expected to generate enough free cash flow to fully cover our dividend. Our balance sheet remains ironclad, with net debt-to-trailing 12 months EBITDAX ratio of 0.9x.
Our lenders group recently unanimously reaffirmed our $3.2 billion borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. Aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility remain at $1.5 billion, which results in approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity at the end of the first quarter when including over $200 million of cash on the balance sheet. We have an $87 million tranche of debt maturing in July of this year, which we plan to pay off with a portion of our cash position.
On the operational front, our production for the first quarter was 2.363 billion cubic foot per day, which was inside our guidance range for the quarter. We placed 9 wells on production during the quarter, all of which were turned in line during February. We are currently operating 2 rigs and utilizing 2 completion crews.
As previously disclosed, we expect sequential decline in production during the second quarter, driven in large part by a lighter turn-in-line schedule during the first 4.5 months of the year, with only 13 wells expected to be placed on production between the beginning of the year and mid-May. This is primarily a result of long cycle times for large pads with long laterals during the first and second quarter. Additionally, our forecast assumes modest price-related curtailments during the natural gas shoulder season.
Our second quarter production guidance range also reflects the impact of an unplanned downtime related to remedial work on 1 well on a large pad that resulted in the deferral of over 230 completed stages from the first quarter to the second quarter, which led to lower capital spending levels in the first quarter.
We have updated our full-year production guidance to a range of 2.35 to 2.375 billion cubic foot per day to reflect the previously mentioned operational changes. The midpoint of this range implies flat production levels year-over-year.
Additionally, we have reaffirmed our capital program of $575 million. We do expect a significant sequential increase in production during the third quarter, based on expectations of placing approximately 2/3 of our wells on production, between mid-May and late August, while our fourth quarter production is expected to be flat with the fourth quarter levels from last year.
We used the recent rally in 2020 NYMEX futures to layer in additional hedges for the summer months to protect against the potential for more prolonged demand disruption this summer related to the global pandemic. However, the outlook for natural gas prices, later this year and into 2021 has drastically improved since our year-end call in February, with a 2021 NYMEX future increasing by almost $0.50 to approximately $2.75 per MMBtu. This has been driven by the expectation for significant gas supply declines in 2020 and 2021 from the substantial reduction in activity levels we have seen in legacy gas-producing basins like the Marcellus, the Haynesville and Utica, in addition to sizable cuts in activity we are seeing in oil basins like the Permian, Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent, which are expected to result in significant declines in associated gas production.
It is premature to disclose any formal guidance for 2021 at this point. However, I would highlight that a maintenance capital program next year would deliver a free cash flow yield over 6% and a return on capital employed of approximately 20% at the current strip, all while maintaining a net leverage ratio below 1x EBITDA.
As of today, we remain unhedged for 2021, as we continue to assess the natural gas market outlook for next year. While the recent increase in the forward curve for 2021 is extremely positive for us, we believe that the market is currently underestimating a potential undersupply of natural gas markets entering into 2021, providing us optimism that the forward curve for 2021 will need to move higher to incentivize increased activity levels to address the undersupplied market. For reference, every $0.10 improvement in the annual NYMEX price in 2021 results in an approximately $55 million of incremental free cash flow under a maintenance capital scenario, highlighting the opportunity for significant free cash flow expansion and increased levels of capital returned to shareholders next year.
While 2020 will likely prove to be a trough year for our free cash flow and our return on capital employed due to the lower price environment, we are managing through, currently, resulted from an oversupply market exiting last winter, our outlook for the year, however, is markedly -- next year is markedly improved. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital spending with an acute focus on delivering on the strategic objectives we have laid out, previously, including focusing on financial returns, demonstrating continued cost control, maintaining our financial strength, generating positive free cash flow, returning capital to shareholders and increasing our proved reserve base.
I would once again like to stress that our thoughts are with anyone who has been impacted during this difficult time, including our employees and shareholders. Cabot remains extremely healthy, financially. And given the current outlook for natural gas market in 2021, we believe we will emerge from this period stronger than before.
With that, I'm happy to open it up for any questions."

We're looking at all scenarios. But our focus is on our current program in 2020, being as efficient as we can possibly be. 
And just a comment on growth in general. If you look at our industry and you take a step back and you look at the carnage that's out there right now and all that we're dealing with, you have a number of stressed balance sheets, you have oversupplied end markets, you have low commodity price in both oil and gas. And it seems that this is a bad replay. Each time you get a little bit of growth or increase in price, everybody jumps in and tries to take advantage of that increase. And the issue for us is, before we would make a decision for growth, we would have to feel comfortable that there's some fundamental changes, and it's sustainable in the long term versus having a few months of an increase and trying to spend capital for that. You participate for a little bit better pricing for a short period of time, pricing rolls off and you still hadn't recaptured all your excess capital you put into it. That, again, has been played back over and over and over. And that's why there's such stress and distress in our market.
You look at the strip right now, you can go out into 2024, and I think you'd get into somewhere like an average -- it's such a backward-dated market, you'd get into an average of $2.40, $2.45, somewhere in that range. That's not what we would view as a sustainable market. And the backwardation for us gives us concern now. If we had a contango market, I felt comfortable about that. And we would participate in the growth side of that story.
With that said, our program is -- has built in, through our service contracts, flexibility to dispense more capital if we chose and to complete a few more stages and to build up into 2021, if, in fact, we elect to do so. We've kind of given right now at our production level our maintenance capital that we're at kind of today is kind of the maintenance capital we would have rolling forward also. So we feel comfortable where we are, our focus being on generating free cash flow. And the financial metrics is going to be our focus. It has for years. This is our fifth year of generating free cash flow in what has been historically, the -- one of the depressed markets that we had in a long, long time. And we're one of the few companies that can make that claim. And we're not going to change the way we perceive it. We'd love to have the higher sustainable commodity strip. We'd love to grow into it. But we're cautious with our balance sheet and our capital exposure."

So we feel good about what we can deliver with our program. We referenced the maintenance program for 2021 as an example to illustrate that we're focused on the financing metrics. But at least the 50% going back. And if you look historically, we have delivered more back to shareholders.
Our base operation is priority, obviously, for the most part. And then maintaining that dividend that we currently have is another important consideration for us. Kind of put in growing the dividend and also, obviously, we always -- we don't have a real -- a large amount of debt and certainly don't have much near term, but considerations for debt repayment is always going to fall into the mix. But after maintaining the dividend, growing the dividend is a strong consideration. If we saw a sustainable commodity strip and we felt comfortable that layering in a little bit more capital would give us growth into a market that would allow an expected return of that capital before any roll-off would occur with commodity price, i.e., oversupplied and underdemand, then we would use some of that capital for that. And we've always been interested in opportunistic buybacks, if there is a disconnect."

The difficult part -- each time we grind on it, the difficult part is the debt levels and the debt load associated with the Appalachia peers. It is a significant debt load. The loss of some of the market caps through all this carnage that we've been going through has such a large percentage of debt compared to an equity in these companies. And it just makes a combination, if you will, a difficult analysis, particularly for us. It's -- we have, what we think is extremely good asset. We are cognizant of the fact of any dilution that might occur with a combination. And if you -- if it comes with a debt load that we're not prepared to take and it comes with acreage that -- each company has some good acreage, but each company has maybe some acreage that would not line up in our drilling schedule for 20-plus years.

I will say that the -- there are a lot of positives, though, that need to be considered and another reason the strip is trading the way it is. As we look at the larger macro view, we are seeing industrial demand down anywhere from 1 Bcf to 1.5 Bcf a day. That's no secret. But we've also seen, as we enter the shoulder months, little bit of demand destruction, as you normally would see it with residential, commercial and the power side. But we do expect the shoulder month was to leave us shortly. We expect the industrial demand to pick up here during Q2.
But on the most positive side, we've just hit a record on exports to Mexico. And then on the LNG side, yes, there has been a few cargoes delayed. But as you look back this year, I believe the LNG export averages are very close to capacity, maybe at least in excess of 8 Bcf a day. So the resiliency of LNG and Mexican exports and the fact that we've been in a slump with the economy but are taking steps to get out of that slump is very encouraging. So I think on the macro view, with the supply decline, frac holidays, et cetera, that Dan described and a possibility of a 8, 9, 10 Bcf a day reduction in supply year-over-year from this point in time, paints a pretty good picture for 2021."

These results demonstrate our uniquely advantaged low-cost structure that we have continued to improve upon year after year, allowing us to deliver profitability and positive returns on capital even the very trough of the natural gas price cycle, which is where we believe we are today.
While we are seeing green shoots emerging in the natural gas market, which I will get into in more detail later in the call. I want to commend our team for delivering another profitable quarter in the face of the recent headwinds across our industry. Operationally, our team delivered another strong quarter with our daily production of 2.229 Bcf per day, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our realized prices before the impact of derivatives represents a $0.30 differential to NYMEX, which is in line with the low end of our full year guidance range and is a significant improvement relative to a $0.44 differential in the prior year comparable period. Additionally, all of our operating expenses were in line with or below our guidance ranges for the quarter, demonstrating our continued focus on cost control.
In the second quarter, we generated our first quarterly free cash flow deficit since the second quarter of 2018, but it's the only our second free cash flow deficit in the last 17 quarters, given the historically low natural gas price environment during the first half of this year, in addition to the combination of our first half weighted capital program and a second half weighted production profile. Our plan for 2020 was expected to generate a slight free cash flow deficit during the first 6 months of the year before turning to a free cash flow positive program in the second half of the year. Ultimately, at the current strip, we still expect our capital program for the year to be fully funded within cash flow and to generate enough free cash flow to cover the majority of our regular dividend.
Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with a net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDAX ratio of 1.2x at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we use cash on the balance sheet to repay our $87 million tranche of senior notes, which matured this month. It is important to note that while we have seen a moderate expansion in our leverage metrics this year as a result of trough natural gas prices, we anticipate a significant compression in our leverage ratio next year at the current strip. This compression is driven, not only by the expectation for higher EBITDAX resulting from improved price realizations, but also from lower absolute debt levels as we continue to pay down our near-term maturities with free cash flow. In yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our full year production guidance range of 2.35 Bcf to 2.375 Bcf per day, with the midpoint of the range implying a flat production levels year-over-year. Additionally, we have reaffirmed our capital program of $575 million. We also initiated our third quarter production guidance range of 2.4 Bcf to 2.45 Bcf per day, which represents a 9% sequential increase in daily production. Midpoint of our guidance range for the third quarter and full year imply that production volumes in the fourth quarter will be roughly flat to the fourth quarter of last year.
On the capital side, we expect spending to sequentially decline in both the third and fourth quarters, driven by a reduction in our completion activity during the second half of the year. The macro outlook for natural gas markets is obviously top of everyone, so mind, especially given the stark contrast between the current market conditions and where we believe these dynamics could be during the winter withdrawal season. On the demand side, while LNG exports have continued to disappoint this summer, we believe that July and August will likely mark the trough for the export levels, resulting in a gradual improvement in LNG utilization rates beginning in the latter part of the third quarter as the U.S. experiences fewer cargo cancellations. Our base case expectation is that as we move into the winter, higher global gas prices will put U.S. LNG back in the money leading to significant improvements in utilization rates and a corresponding increase in export related demand for natural gas. While we anticipate some reduction in power burn this winter due to reduced coal-to-gas switching, we would expect stronger residential and commercial demand year-over-year, assuming normal weather, which should offset any power-related demand loss.
On the supply side, we continue to see the potential for over 6 Bcf per day reduction in production year-over-year this winter, driven only -- driven not only by the sizable activity cuts in natural gas focused basins, which we think is good, but also from steeper-to-cuts and oil-focused basins, resulting in the expectation for continued structural declines in associated gas production. Given the ongoing focus across industry on capital discipline, including the prioritization of capital allocation on debt reduction and return of capital to shareholders over growth, we believe any future recovery in natural gas supply will be much slower than in prior cycles. And ultimately, the market will need to see higher prices to either incentivize more production or to disincentivize LNG exports and economic coal-to-gas switching. While there are certainly risks to this thesis, we remain cautiously optimistic about the natural gas market heading into this winter.
We remain acutely focused on executing on a risk management strategy for 2021 that optimistically locks in hedges to protect against potential downside risk, while also remaining exposed to potentially one of the most favorable setups we have seen for the commodity in years. While we have yet to formulate official plans for 2021, in our release yesterday, we highlighted that based on 2021 NYMEX price assumptions of [ $2.75 ] per MMBTU, which is roughly in line with the future current futures. We can deliver similar production levels as 2021 from a modestly lower capital program while delivering a free cash flow yield of approximately 8% and a return on capital employed between 19% and 20%. As we disclosed previously, every $0.10 improvement in NYMEX natural gas price is expected to increase our 2021 free cash flow by approximately $55 million highlighting the upside potential if the natural gas market does, in fact, reach a point of inflection this winter. As we anticipate a significant expansion in free cash flow in 2021. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation with a focus on balancing the deployment of our free cash flow next year between returning capital to shareholders and repayment of our $188 million of senior notes maturing in 2021.
Our capital return focus will be grounded in our base quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share or $0.40 annually and further supplemented by optimistic returns of capital, including special dividends and/or share repurchases. While 2020 may ultimately deliver the lowest average NYMEX price on record since 1995, I am proud of Cabot's resiliency, highlighted by our ability to deliver positive free cash flow and positive corporate returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet even in the trough of the commodity price cycle.
We will continue to execute, deliver on our plans for this year, which was formalized in February before the widespread impacts of the Global Pandemic, and we remain optimistic about the potential for an inflection point in natural gas markets this winter and the corresponding expansion in our free cash flow, return on capital employed and return of capital to shareholders in 2021.
And Allison, with that comment, I will be more than happy to answer any questions."

I know you guys certainly said that you think about this in a conservative way. I guess would that end up being a similar shape to what we saw in '20, where your production was down a little bit early in the year due to lack of winter fracking and then maybe pick up from there? Just trying to understand the dynamic as to why you'd kind of be down versus 4Q if gas is strong next year."

We have not nailed down exactly the cadence for the quarters. One thing I would say that right now, if you look out in this summer, we had $1.60 gas, $1.70 gas in the say, the April to October. And if you look out in 2021, if we're even partially right about the lower supply higher demand running through this winter, then you ought to be able to look out at the period between the April and October and say that, that market right now might be about a [ $2.60 ] market. So there is an effect, almost a dollar difference during that period of time. So the cadence is still -- we still have a discussion going internally.

And to not make this a long-winded answer, Scott, has told me sometimes that I talked too long on my answers. But when you look at the full development of the Marcellus, you can really -- Upper Marcellus, you can really look at the Upper Marcellus. It's a blank piece of paper for the most part. We intend to particularly with the legislation that has been passed recently about longer laterals and how you drill within or across units. It is our intent to lay out the sticks for the Upper Marcellus with longer laterals on average than we've been able to drill in the Lower Marcellus program. With the drilling of the longer laterals, and I'm talking about kind of the 12,000 foot type laterals in the Upper Marcellus, there's efficiencies inherent in drilling longer laterals than shorter laterals. With our currently, even in the lower, in our longer laterals, if we drill 11,000 or 12,000 foot laterals, and you look at our completion efficiencies or some represent their -- the cost of development in what the cost is per foot and our -- even in our lower, we have a, say, a 700 -- slightly over $700 per foot cost in our 11,000 foot type of lateral that we drill in the lower. And we have those as actual costs that we have seen in first and second quarter of this year. There's another thing on the efficiencies that we see in those -- in that cost Cabot also loads in -- of our cost per foot. We also load in our -- all our facilities in that cost, and we load in all the construction associated with our pad sites into those costs. That is, again, all-in cost for us. And the other thing we do is we have what we think are very efficient completions. We have 2,500 pounds of proppant we use in our completions. And versus, I know some other companies might use less proppant. So their cost for proppant is going to be maybe slightly less than ours, but we do like the amount of gas that we have coming in out of our wells and so our recipe, we think we have dialed in, is very efficient. So there is going to be, overall, considerably less cost attached to the development of our Upper Marcellus, including use of roads, reuse of pad sites. We hope reuse of some of the equipment so we would take -- even though the -- it might be a 70-plus percent comparison to the lower, we think on a return profile basis because of what I'm just mentioning, our upper development is going to be in an extremely good return profile."

As a reminder, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earning release. Despite the ongoing global pandemics impact on natural gas demand during the second quarter, which contributed to the lowest average quarterly NYMEX price since the third quarter of 1995, Cabot was still able to generate positive net income of $30.4 million or $0.08 per share. These results demonstrate our uniquely advantaged low-cost structure that we have continued to improve upon year after year, allowing us to deliver profitability and positive returns on capital even the very trough of the natural gas price cycle, which is where we believe we are today.
While we are seeing green shoots emerging in the natural gas market, which I will get into in more detail later in the call, I want to commend our team for delivering another profitable quarter in the face of the recent headwinds across our industry. Operationally, our team delivered another strong quarter with our daily production of 2.229 Bcf per day, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our realized prices before the impact of derivatives represents a $0.30 differential to NYMEX, which is in line with the low end of our full year guidance range and is a significant improvement relative to a $0.44 differential in the prior year comparable period. Additionally, all of our operating expenses were in line with or below our guidance ranges for the quarter, demonstrating our continued focus on cost control.
In the second quarter, we generated our first quarterly free cash flow deficit since the second quarter of 2018, but it's the only -- our second free cash flow deficit in the last 17 quarters, given the historically low natural gas price environment during the first half of this year, in addition to the combination of our first half weighted capital program and a second half weighted production profile. Our plan for 2020 was expected to generate a slight free cash flow deficit during the first 6 months of the year before turning to a free cash flow positive program in the second half of the year. Ultimately, at the current strip, we still expect our capital program for the year to be fully funded within cash flow and to generate enough free cash flow to cover the majority of our regular dividend.
Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with a net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDAX ratio of 1.2x at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we use cash on the balance sheet to repay our $87 million tranche of senior notes, which matured this month. It is important to note that while we have seen a moderate expansion in our leverage metrics this year as a result of trough natural gas prices, we anticipate a significant compression in our leverage ratio next year at the current strip. This compression is driven, not only by the expectation for higher EBITDAX resulting from improved price realizations, but also from lower absolute debt levels as we continue to pay down our near-term maturities with free cash flow. In yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our full year production guidance range of 2.35 to 2.375 Bcf per day, with the midpoint of the range implying a flat production levels year-over-year. Additionally, we have reaffirmed our capital program of $575 million. We also initiated our third quarter production guidance range of 2.4 to 2.45 Bcf per day, which represents a 9% sequential increase in daily production. Midpoint of our guidance range for the third quarter and full year imply that production volumes in the fourth quarter will be roughly flat to the fourth quarter of last year.
On the capital side, we expect spending to sequentially decline in both the third and fourth quarters, driven by a reduction in our completion activity during the second half of the year. The macro outlook for natural gas markets is obviously top of everyone's mind, especially given the stark contrast between the current market conditions and where we believe these dynamics could be during the winter withdrawal season. 
On the demand side, while LNG exports have continued to disappoint this summer, we believe that July and August will likely mark the trough for the export levels, resulting in a gradual improvement in LNG utilization rates beginning in the latter part of the third quarter as the U.S. experiences fewer cargo cancellations. Our base case expectation is that as we move into the winter, higher global gas prices will put U.S. LNG back in the money leading to significant improvements in utilization rates and a corresponding increase in export-related demand for natural gas. While we anticipate some reduction in power burn this winter due to reduced coal-to-gas switching, we would expect stronger residential and commercial demand year-over-year, assuming normal weather, which should offset any power-related demand loss.
On the supply side, we continue to see the potential for over 6 Bcf per day reduction in production year-over-year this winter, driven only -- driven not only by the sizable activity cuts in natural gas focused basins, which we think is good, but also from steeper cuts and oil-focused basins, resulting in the expectation for continued structural declines in associated gas production. Given the ongoing focus across industry on capital discipline, including the prioritization of capital allocation on debt reduction and return of capital to shareholders over growth, we believe any future recovery in natural gas supply will be much slower than in prior cycles. And ultimately, the market will need to see higher prices to either incentivize more production or to disincentivize LNG exports and economic coal-to-gas switching. While there are certainly risks to this thesis, we remain cautiously optimistic about the natural gas market heading into this winter.
We remain acutely focused on executing on a risk management strategy for 2021 that optimistically locks in hedges to protect against potential downside risk, while also remaining exposed to potentially one of the most favorable setups we have seen for the commodity in years. While we have yet to formulate official plans for 2021, in our release yesterday, we highlighted that based on 2021 NYMEX price assumptions of $2.75 per MMBtu, which is roughly in line with the future -- current futures. We can deliver similar production levels as 2021 from a modestly lower capital program while delivering a free cash flow yield of approximately 8% and a return on capital employed between 19% and 20%. As we disclosed previously, every $0.10 improvement in NYMEX natural gas price is expected to increase our 2021 free cash flow by approximately $55 million highlighting the upside potential if the natural gas market does, in fact, reach a point of inflection this winter. As we anticipate a significant expansion in free cash flow in 2021. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation with a focus on balancing the deployment of our free cash flow next year between returning capital to shareholders and repayment of our $188 million of senior notes maturing in 2021.
Our capital return focus will be grounded in our base quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share or $0.40 annually and further supplemented by optimistic returns of capital, including special dividends and/or share repurchases. While 2020 may ultimately deliver the lowest average NYMEX price on record since 1995, I am proud of Cabot's resiliency, highlighted by our ability to deliver positive free cash flow and positive corporate returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet even in the trough of the commodity price cycle.
We will continue to execute, deliver on our plans for this year, which was formalized in February before the widespread impacts of the global pandemic, and we remain optimistic about the potential for an inflection point in natural gas markets this winter and the corresponding expansion in our free cash flow, return on capital employed and return of capital to shareholders in 2021.
And Allison, with that comment, I will be more than happy to answer any questions."

And I still think that's the case. But I think there's also ample supply on the Transco system to satisfy that demand. So initially, and even today, we still think that, that was too much gas in that region.

That is a tremendous opportunity. It is out there and now in the books with the governor's signature.

We have not nailed down exactly the cadence for the quarters. One thing I would say that right now, if you look out in this summer, we had $1.60 gas, $1.70 gas in the say, the April to October.

And to not make this a long-winded answer, Scott has told me sometimes that I talk too long on my answers. But when you look at the full development of the Marcellus, you can really -- Upper Marcellus, you can really look at the Upper Marcellus, it's a blank piece of paper for the most part. We intend to -- particularly with the legislation that has been passed recently about longer laterals and how you drill within or across units, it is our intent to lay out the sticks for the Upper Marcellus with longer laterals on average than we've been able to drill in the Lower Marcellus program. With the drilling of the longer laterals, and I'm talking about kind of the 12,000 foot type laterals in the Upper Marcellus, there's efficiencies inherent in drilling longer laterals than shorter laterals. 
With our currently -- even in the lower, in our longer laterals, if we drill 11,000 or 12,000 foot laterals, and you look at our completion efficiencies or some represent their -- the cost of development in what the cost is per foot in our -- even in our lower, we have a, say, a 700 -- slightly over $700 per foot cost in our 11,000 foot type of lateral that we drill in the lower. And we have those as actual costs that we have seen in first and second quarter of this year. There's another thing on the efficiencies that we see in those -- in that cost Cabot also loads in -- of our cost per foot. We also load in our -- all our facilities in that cost, and we load in all the construction associated with our pad sites into those costs. That is, again, all-in cost for us. And the other thing we do is we have what we think are very efficient completions. We have 2,500 pounds of proppant we use in our completions versus, I know some other companies might use less proppant. So their cost for proppant is going to be maybe slightly less than ours, but we do like the amount of gas that we have coming in -- out of our wells and so our recipe, we think we have dialed in, is very efficient. So there is going to be, overall, considerably less cost attached to the development of our Upper Marcellus, including use of roads, reuse of pad sites. We hope reuse of some of the equipment so we would take -- even though the -- it might be a 70-plus percent comparison to the lower, we think on a return profile basis because of what I'm just mentioning, our upper development is going to be in an extremely good return profile."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our co",1382,"Thank you, Allison, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earning release. Despite the ongoing global pandemics impact on natural gas demand during the second quarter, which contributed to the lowest average quarterly NYMEX price since the third quarter of 1995, Cabot was still able to generate positive net income of $30.4 million or $0.08 per share. These results demonstrate our uniquely advantaged low-cost structure that we have continued to improve upon year after year, allowing us to deliver profitability and positive returns on capital even the very trough of the natural gas price cycle, which is where we believe we are today.
While we are seeing green shoots emerging in the natural gas market, which I will get into in more detail later in the call, I want to commend our team for delivering another profitable quarter in the face of the recent headwinds across our industry. Operationally, our team delivered another strong quarter with our daily production of 2.229 Bcf per day, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our realized prices before the impact of derivatives represents a $0.30 differential to NYMEX, which is in line with the low end of our full year guidance range and is a significant improvement relative to a $0.44 differential in the prior year comparable period. Additionally, all of our operating expenses were in line with or below our guidance ranges for the quarter, demonstrating our continued focus on cost control.
In the second quarter, we generated our first quarterly free cash flow deficit since the second quarter of 2018, but it's the only -- our second free cash flow deficit in the last 17 quarters, given the historically low natural gas price environment during the first half of this year, in addition to the combination of our first half weighted capital program and a second half weighted production profile. Our plan for 2020 was expected to generate a slight free cash flow deficit during the first 6 months of the year before turning to a free cash flow positive program in the second half of the year. Ultimately, at the current strip, we still expect our capital program for the year to be fully funded within cash flow and to generate enough free cash flow to cover the majority of our regular dividend.
Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with a net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDAX ratio of 1.2x at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we use cash on the balance sheet to repay our $87 million tranche of senior notes, which matured this month. It is important to note that while we have seen a moderate expansion in our leverage metrics this year as a result of trough natural gas prices, we anticipate a significant compression in our leverage ratio next year at the current strip. This compression is driven, not only by the expectation for higher EBITDAX resulting from improved price realizations, but also from lower absolute debt levels as we continue to pay down our near-term maturities with free cash flow. In yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our full year production guidance range of 2.35 to 2.375 Bcf per day, with the midpoint of the range implying a flat production levels year-over-year. Additionally, we have reaffirmed our capital program of $575 million. We also initiated our third quarter production guidance range of 2.4 to 2.45 Bcf per day, which represents a 9% sequential increase in daily production. Midpoint of our guidance range for the third quarter and full year imply that production volumes in the fourth quarter will be roughly flat to the fourth quarter of last year.
On the capital side, we expect spending to sequentially decline in both the third and fourth quarters, driven by a reduction in our completion activity during the second half of the year. The macro outlook for natural gas markets is obviously top of everyone's mind, especially given the stark contrast between the current market conditions and where we believe these dynamics could be during the winter withdrawal season. 
On the demand side, while LNG exports have continued to disappoint this summer, we believe that July and August will likely mark the trough for the export levels, resulting in a gradual improvement in LNG utilization rates beginning in the latter part of the third quarter as the U.S. experiences fewer cargo cancellations. Our base case expectation is that as we move into the winter, higher global gas prices will put U.S. LNG back in the money leading to significant improvements in utilization rates and a corresponding increase in export-related demand for natural gas. While we anticipate some reduction in power burn this winter due to reduced coal-to-gas switching, we would expect stronger residential and commercial demand year-over-year, assuming normal weather, which should offset any power-related demand loss.
On the supply side, we continue to see the potential for over 6 Bcf per day reduction in production year-over-year this winter, driven only -- driven not only by the sizable activity cuts in natural gas focused basins, which we think is good, but also from steeper cuts and oil-focused basins, resulting in the expectation for continued structural declines in associated gas production. Given the ongoing focus across industry on capital discipline, including the prioritization of capital allocation on debt reduction and return of capital to shareholders over growth, we believe any future recovery in natural gas supply will be much slower than in prior cycles. And ultimately, the market will need to see higher prices to either incentivize more production or to disincentivize LNG exports and economic coal-to-gas switching. While there are certainly risks to this thesis, we remain cautiously optimistic about the natural gas market heading into this winter.
We remain acutely focused on executing on a risk management strategy for 2021 that optimistically locks in hedges to protect against potential downside risk, while also remaining exposed to potentially one of the most favorable setups we have seen for the commodity in years. While we have yet to formulate official plans for 2021, in our release yesterday, we highlighted that based on 2021 NYMEX price assumptions of $2.75 per MMBtu, which is roughly in line with the future -- current futures. We can deliver similar production levels as 2021 from a modestly lower capital program while delivering a free cash flow yield of approximately 8% and a return on capital employed between 19% and 20%. As we disclosed previously, every $0.10 improvement in NYMEX natural gas price is expected to increase our 2021 free cash flow by approximately $55 million highlighting the upside potential if the natural gas market does, in fact, reach a point of inflection this winter. As we anticipate a significant expansion in free cash flow in 2021. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation with a focus on balancing the deployment of our free cash flow next year between returning capital to shareholders and repayment of our $188 million of senior notes maturing in 2021.
Our capital return focus will be grounded in our base quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share or $0.40 annually and further supplemented by optimistic returns of capital, including special dividends and/or share repurchases. While 2020 may ultimately deliver the lowest average NYMEX price on record since 1995, I am proud of Cabot's resiliency, highlighted by our ability to deliver positive free cash flow and positive corporate returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet even in the trough of the commodity price cycle.
We will continue to execute, deliver on our plans for this year, which was formalized in February before the widespread impacts of the global pandemic, and we remain optimistic about the potential for an inflection point in natural gas markets this winter and the corresponding expansion in our free cash flow, return on capital employed and return of capital to shareholders in 2021.
And Allison, with that comment, I will be more than happy to answer any questions."

We felt like that's quite a bit of gas we go into that market. Obviously, there were some shippers that were optimistic that they'd be able to develop some more gas-fired generation down there. And I still think that's the case. But I think there's also ample supply on the Transco system to satisfy that demand. So initially, and even today, we still think that, that was too much gas in that region. We were somewhat concerned that it would saturate the market to the point that it would bleed upstream into the D.C. area where we're actively marketing gas. And so quite frankly, the cancellation of that project is -- gives us more of an optimistic view on pricing for that region."

That is a tremendous opportunity. It is out there and now in the books with the governor's signature.

And to not make this a long-winded answer, Scott has told me sometimes that I talk too long on my answers. But when you look at the full development of the Marcellus, you can really -- Upper Marcellus, you can really look at the Upper Marcellus, it's a blank piece of paper for the most part. We intend to -- particularly with the legislation that has been passed recently about longer laterals and how you drill within or across units, it is our intent to lay out the sticks for the Upper Marcellus with longer laterals on average than we've been able to drill in the Lower Marcellus program. With the drilling of the longer laterals, and I'm talking about kind of the 12,000 foot type laterals in the Upper Marcellus, there's efficiencies inherent in drilling longer laterals than shorter laterals. 
With our currently -- even in the lower, in our longer laterals, if we drill 11,000 or 12,000 foot laterals, and you look at our completion efficiencies or some represent their -- the cost of development in what the cost is per foot in our -- even in our lower, we have a, say, a 700 -- slightly over $700 per foot cost in our 11,000 foot type of lateral that we drill in the lower. And we have those as actual costs that we have seen in first and second quarter of this year. There's another thing on the efficiencies that we see in those -- in that cost Cabot also loads in -- of our cost per foot. We also load in our -- all our facilities in that cost, and we load in all the construction associated with our pad sites into those costs. That is, again, all-in cost for us. And the other thing we do is we have what we think are very efficient completions. We have 2,500 pounds of proppant we use in our completions versus, I know some other companies might use less proppant. So their cost for proppant is going to be maybe slightly less than ours, but we do like the amount of gas that we have coming in -- out of our wells and so our recipe, we think we have dialed in, is very efficient. So there is going to be, overall, considerably less cost attached to the development of our Upper Marcellus, including use of roads, reuse of pad sites. We hope reuse of some of the equipment so we would take -- even though the -- it might be a 70-plus percent comparison to the lower, we think on a return profile basis because of what I'm just mentioning, our upper development is going to be in an extremely good return profile."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our co",1382,"Thank you, Allison, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earning release. Despite the ongoing global pandemics impact on natural gas demand during the second quarter, which contributed to the lowest average quarterly NYMEX price since the third quarter of 1995, Cabot was still able to generate positive net income of $30.4 million or $0.08 per share. These results demonstrate our uniquely advantaged low-cost structure that we have continued to improve upon year after year, allowing us to deliver profitability and positive returns on capital even the very trough of the natural gas price cycle, which is where we believe we are today.
While we are seeing green shoots emerging in the natural gas market, which I will get into in more detail later in the call, I want to commend our team for delivering another profitable quarter in the face of the recent headwinds across our industry. Operationally, our team delivered another strong quarter with our daily production of 2.229 Bcf per day, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our realized prices before the impact of derivatives represents a $0.30 differential to NYMEX, which is in line with the low end of our full year guidance range and is a significant improvement relative to a $0.44 differential in the prior year comparable period. Additionally, all of our operating expenses were in line with or below our guidance ranges for the quarter, demonstrating our continued focus on cost control.
In the second quarter, we generated our first quarterly free cash flow deficit since the second quarter of 2018, but it's the only -- our second free cash flow deficit in the last 17 quarters, given the historically low natural gas price environment during the first half of this year, in addition to the combination of our first half weighted capital program and a second half weighted production profile. Our plan for 2020 was expected to generate a slight free cash flow deficit during the first 6 months of the year before turning to a free cash flow positive program in the second half of the year. Ultimately, at the current strip, we still expect our capital program for the year to be fully funded within cash flow and to generate enough free cash flow to cover the majority of our regular dividend.
Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with a net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDAX ratio of 1.2x at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we use cash on the balance sheet to repay our $87 million tranche of senior notes, which matured this month. It is important to note that while we have seen a moderate expansion in our leverage metrics this year as a result of trough natural gas prices, we anticipate a significant compression in our leverage ratio next year at the current strip. This compression is driven, not only by the expectation for higher EBITDAX resulting from improved price realizations, but also from lower absolute debt levels as we continue to pay down our near-term maturities with free cash flow. In yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our full year production guidance range of 2.35 to 2.375 Bcf per day, with the midpoint of the range implying a flat production levels year-over-year. Additionally, we have reaffirmed our capital program of $575 million. We also initiated our third quarter production guidance range of 2.4 to 2.45 Bcf per day, which represents a 9% sequential increase in daily production. Midpoint of our guidance range for the third quarter and full year imply that production volumes in the fourth quarter will be roughly flat to the fourth quarter of last year.
On the capital side, we expect spending to sequentially decline in both the third and fourth quarters, driven by a reduction in our completion activity during the second half of the year. The macro outlook for natural gas markets is obviously top of everyone's mind, especially given the stark contrast between the current market conditions and where we believe these dynamics could be during the winter withdrawal season. 
On the demand side, while LNG exports have continued to disappoint this summer, we believe that July and August will likely mark the trough for the export levels, resulting in a gradual improvement in LNG utilization rates beginning in the latter part of the third quarter as the U.S. experiences fewer cargo cancellations. Our base case expectation is that as we move into the winter, higher global gas prices will put U.S. LNG back in the money leading to significant improvements in utilization rates and a corresponding increase in export-related demand for natural gas. While we anticipate some reduction in power burn this winter due to reduced coal-to-gas switching, we would expect stronger residential and commercial demand year-over-year, assuming normal weather, which should offset any power-related demand loss.
On the supply side, we continue to see the potential for over 6 Bcf per day reduction in production year-over-year this winter, driven only -- driven not only by the sizable activity cuts in natural gas focused basins, which we think is good, but also from steeper cuts and oil-focused basins, resulting in the expectation for continued structural declines in associated gas production. Given the ongoing focus across industry on capital discipline, including the prioritization of capital allocation on debt reduction and return of capital to shareholders over growth, we believe any future recovery in natural gas supply will be much slower than in prior cycles. And ultimately, the market will need to see higher prices to either incentivize more production or to disincentivize LNG exports and economic coal-to-gas switching. While there are certainly risks to this thesis, we remain cautiously optimistic about the natural gas market heading into this winter.
We remain acutely focused on executing on a risk management strategy for 2021 that optimistically locks in hedges to protect against potential downside risk, while also remaining exposed to potentially one of the most favorable setups we have seen for the commodity in years. While we have yet to formulate official plans for 2021, in our release yesterday, we highlighted that based on 2021 NYMEX price assumptions of $2.75 per MMBtu, which is roughly in line with the future -- current futures. We can deliver similar production levels as 2021 from a modestly lower capital program while delivering a free cash flow yield of approximately 8% and a return on capital employed between 19% and 20%. As we disclosed previously, every $0.10 improvement in NYMEX natural gas price is expected to increase our 2021 free cash flow by approximately $55 million highlighting the upside potential if the natural gas market does, in fact, reach a point of inflection this winter. As we anticipate a significant expansion in free cash flow in 2021. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation with a focus on balancing the deployment of our free cash flow next year between returning capital to shareholders and repayment of our $188 million of senior notes maturing in 2021.
Our capital return focus will be grounded in our base quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share or $0.40 annually and further supplemented by optimistic returns of capital, including special dividends and/or share repurchases. While 2020 may ultimately deliver the lowest average NYMEX price on record since 1995, I am proud of Cabot's resiliency, highlighted by our ability to deliver positive free cash flow and positive corporate returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet even in the trough of the commodity price cycle.
We will continue to execute, deliver on our plans for this year, which was formalized in February before the widespread impacts of the global pandemic, and we remain optimistic about the potential for an inflection point in natural gas markets this winter and the corresponding expansion in our free cash flow, return on capital employed and return of capital to shareholders in 2021.
And Allison, with that comment, I will be more than happy to answer any questions."

We felt like that's quite a bit of gas we go into that market. Obviously, there were some shippers that were optimistic that they'd be able to develop some more gas-fired generation down there. And I still think that's the case. But I think there's also ample supply on the Transco system to satisfy that demand. So initially, and even today, we still think that, that was too much gas in that region. We were somewhat concerned that it would saturate the market to the point that it would bleed upstream into the D.C. area where we're actively marketing gas. And so quite frankly, the cancellation of that project is -- gives us more of an optimistic view on pricing for that region."

That is a tremendous opportunity. It is out there and now in the books with the governor's signature.

And we continue to talk to industries that are located in the Northeast, already have markets in the Northeast. There's been some new technology developed for some very unique projects that are good year-round loads. And so nothing to announce today.

And methane was up there in the rock prior to the oil and gas industry ever going up there.

And to not make this a long-winded answer, Scott has told me sometimes that I talk too long on my answers. But when you look at the full development of the Marcellus, you can really -- Upper Marcellus, you can really look at the Upper Marcellus, it's a blank piece of paper for the most part. We intend to -- particularly with the legislation that has been passed recently about longer laterals and how you drill within or across units, it is our intent to lay out the sticks for the Upper Marcellus with longer laterals on average than we've been able to drill in the Lower Marcellus program. With the drilling of the longer laterals, and I'm talking about kind of the 12,000 foot type laterals in the Upper Marcellus, there's efficiencies inherent in drilling longer laterals than shorter laterals. 
With our currently -- even in the lower, in our longer laterals, if we drill 11,000 or 12,000 foot laterals, and you look at our completion efficiencies or some represent their -- the cost of development in what the cost is per foot in our -- even in our lower, we have a, say, a 700 -- slightly over $700 per foot cost in our 11,000 foot type of lateral that we drill in the lower. And we have those as actual costs that we have seen in first and second quarter of this year. There's another thing on the efficiencies that we see in those -- in that cost Cabot also loads in -- of our cost per foot. We also load in our -- all our facilities in that cost, and we load in all the construction associated with our pad sites into those costs. That is, again, all-in cost for us. And the other thing we do is we have what we think are very efficient completions. We have 2,500 pounds of proppant we use in our completions versus, I know some other companies might use less proppant. So their cost for proppant is going to be maybe slightly less than ours, but we do like the amount of gas that we have coming in -- out of our wells and so our recipe, we think we have dialed in, is very efficient. So there is going to be, overall, considerably less cost attached to the development of our Upper Marcellus, including use of roads, reuse of pad sites. We hope reuse of some of the equipment so we would take -- even though the -- it might be a 70-plus percent comparison to the lower, we think on a return profile basis because of what I'm just mentioning, our upper development is going to be in an extremely good return profile."

Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
2020 has proven to be a challenging year on many fronts across the global market. I hope each of you and your families have remained safe and healthy through this unprecedented time. The natural gas industry specifically has had its fair share of challenges driven by the lowest NYMEX price on record in the last 25 years. 
However, the strategic actions we have undertaken since we first began leasing in the Marcellus shale in 2006, which includes numerous divestitures of higher cost assets with proceeds utilized to maintain a healthy financial position, have positioned our company for continued success even in the very lows of a natural gas price cycle. While we are certainly not immune to lower natural gas prices, 
our low-cost structure, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy, allow us to continue to generate corporate returns and free cash flow even in this current price environment. The good news is that we already experiencing significant tailwinds for the natural gas supply and demand outlook, driven by large declines in natural gas supplies across the U.S. coupled with an improving demand outlook heading into winter heating season. 
As a result, since our early March, we have seen over a 35% increase in the NYMEX features for 2022 to the current levels that are above $3, which would result in a material expansion of net income, free cash flow and return on capital employed next year. While we're extremely proud of our team's ability to successfully manage our operations during the ongoing pandemic while generating positive free cash flow in this low price environment, we believe better days lie ahead for Cabot in the 2021 and beyond. 
For the third quarter, specifically, we generated adjusted net income of $37.3 million or $0.09 per share and delivered a free cash flow breakeven program, despite a 26% decline in realized natural gas prices relative to the prior year comparable period. Our production for the quarter was approximately 2.4 Bcf per day, which was inside our guidance range despite price curtail curtailment during the last 13 days of the quarter that were not included in our original guidance. Our unit cost for the quarter improved relative to the prior year period, and we continue to look for opportunities to improve on our peer-leading cost structure even in a flat price -- flat production environment. On the operational front, in yesterday's release, we provided the initial results of our 5 Upper Marcellus tests this year, which have been producing for an average of 140 days. Based on the curve fit to date, these wells are tracking above the average EUR of 2.7 Bcf per 1,000 lateral feet that we reported at year-end for our 2018 and 2019 Upper Marcellus wells. We believe these results continue to demonstrate the productivity of this distinct economic interval across our [ 173,000 ] net acre position in the core of the dry gas window in Northeast PA. As a reminder, we plan to allocate a modest amount of capital to the Upper Marcellus annually as we continue to refine our well design and lateral placement across this interval.  With the intent of moving to full development of our Upper Marcellus inventory at the tail end of this decade. 
We also continue to evaluate the optimal lateral length across our asset at the -- and at this point, we expect to develop the Upper Marcellus at an average lateral length greater than 10,000 feet, which would provide significant well cost savings, further improving our economics of our Upper Marcellus inventory. Despite the questions we continue to receive on this high-quality reservoir, we have over 60 Upper Marcellus wells that, on average, have been producing for over 5 years, which continue to reinforce our confidence in the opportunity that awaits us when we move to the full development of this section. 
In yesterday's press release, we also reaffirmed our fourth quarter production guidance range, which includes the impact of previously announced price-related curtailments as well as our full year production in capital guidance. While our current year expectation for differentials in 2020 is slightly wider than originally anticipated. Which is primarily due to wider local basis in September and October, resulting from weaker shoulder season demand and the east storage levels nearing capacity. However, we are still on track to generate positive free cash flow and far exceed our return of capital target of at least 50% of our free cash flow for the fifth consecutive year. Despite reducing absolute debt earlier this year through the repayment of our maturity in July, we have seen a moderate increase in our leverage ratio due to lower EBITDAX resulting from the low price environment. However, we still ended the quarter with a healthy debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.5x and expect a significant deleveraging in 2021 through a combination of higher EBITDAX resulting from improved price realizations and lower absolute debt levels as we plan to utilize a portion of our expected free cash flow next year to retire our 2021 debt maturities. 
We also initiated a preliminary guidance for 2021. This maintenance capital program is expected to hold production levels roughly flat year-over-year at 2.35 Bcf per day from a capital program of $530 million to $540 million, representing a 7% reduction in capital spending year-over-year. 
The reduction in capital is driven by a combination of operating efficiency gains, resulting from the utilization of leading-edge technology across our operations and lower anticipated service costs. Our program for next year would generally -- would generate a sizable expansion in free cash flow year-over-year, allowing us to not only cover our base dividend and retire $188 million of maturing debt, but to also opportunistically return incremental levels of capital to our shareholders. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually, which we have far exceeded over the last 5 years and will continue to evaluate the prioritization of incremental capital return between growing the base dividend, special/variable dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. It is our belief that depending on where we sit in the commodity price cycle, certain capital allocation options offer more value creation than others and that maintaining financial flexibility is paramount, especially in a cyclical industry like ours. 
We are often ask what price level we would consider investing in growth again. While we have never believed in growth for the sake of growth, we do believe there are certain price environments that weren't disciplined investments in the expansion of operating cash flow, especially as the lowest cost producer. 
However, with the current natural gas futures in 2022 and beyond in backwardation, and well below the $3-plus environment we are anticipating in 2021, we do not believe this is the appropriate time to consider growing our production base. 
We do have new takeaway capacity coming on the Leidy South expansion project, for which a partial path in service was recently requested for as early as this December. This project will provide us additional access to premium markets in the mid-Atlantic. So if natural gas prices continue to rise in the out years, we have new outlets to support incremental value-enhancing growth. However, as we previously stated, our capital allocation priorities for next year are focused on maintaining our current production level, funding our current dividend, retiring our 2021 debt maturities and opportunistically returning incremental free cash flow to shareholders. 
In order to ensure that we are able to deliver on these strategic objectives for 2021, we have begun layering in hedges by opportunistically, locking in downside protection while maintaining some level of market price exposure if natural gas prices continue to move higher. Specifically, we have primarily targeted costless collars approach with a weighted average floor that generates a compelling return on capital employed and a level of free cash flow, while still providing the potential for upside to the ceiling if prices remain higher. Currently, we have approximately 23% of our volumes hedged through financial contracts and an additional 16% of our volumes protected through floors in our physical sales next year. We will continue to use market rallies to opportunistically add to our hedge position and improve on our current floors and ceilings. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that yesterday, we posted our inaugural SASB sustainability report to our website. At Cabot, we strive not only to be a leading independent producer of natural gas, but to also be a leader in safe, responsible operations and to minimize the impact of our operations on our employees, our community and the environment. Our success is developing a -- our success in developing abundant unconventional supplies of natural gas helps to support the goal of reducing total greenhouse gas submissions while achieving energy independence in the U.S. Cabot's legacy of corporate responsibility places high-value in operating with respect and care for people, property and the environment.

Hope you will each take a good look at our SASB report, we're extremely proud of how we measure up against peers and the desires of the investment community on all the metrics included in our report. 
In summary, Cabot's track record of disciplined capital allocation focused on generating improving corporate returns and increasing return of capital to shareholders, which is underpinned by strong free cash flow generation and an ironclad balance sheet as well as our continued focus on corporate responsibility and demonstrate our history of safe, responsible operations that support the goal of reducing total greenhouse house emissions does position us favorably, not only today, but for decades to come as it is our belief that natural gas will continue to play a significant role in the domestic energy supply going forward. And with that, Kate, I will begin to answer any questions."

And I think when you look at NYMEX and what's driving it, you see an exit rate on U.S. dry gas production close to 5 Bcf a day, less than the previous year. Obviously, that's helping NYMEX.  You also see the capital discipline in the marketplace today, particularly among the gas guys, that helps NYMEX, of course. So we're encouraged in a normal winter, and we're prepared for that to -- for these basis differentials to return to somewhat more normal [ minimal ]."

You have to look at right now the early winter season, you have to look at there is still a couple of hundred Bcf over comparison between this year's storage levels and the 5-year average and last year's storage levels. We are moving into an undersupplied market. We have uncertainty with winter out in front of us.

And what we're trying to do with our capital allocation right now with complete confidence in the distinctive nature of the zone, we have a thick per cell barrier between the Upper and the Lower. We gather data on any effects of offset wells that we've drilled. And each of these wells were drilled near previous drilled and producing Lower Marcellus wells, and we saw no effects on the Lower Marcellus wells, again, clear evidence of the distinct nature of the Upper Marcellus. But we are learning from our frac recipes and the landing position that we have been looking at in various different sections and a tweak of a frac recipe on various different landing sections to determine do we see differences in the results. So it's an early game, and we're just gathering data like every operator has done when they go into a new shale play. The Upper is a new shale play with the 60 or so wells that we've drilled in it. We're learning continuously as we go. We're not carrying the -- we learned from our Lower Marcellus and what we do there. But we also know the Upper is a distinctive reservoir to the Lower.

So for Cabot's position, $250,000 a day down to the Mid-Atlantic marketplace is -- will improve price realizations. There's no doubt about that. We're also in a unique position that the Atlantic Coast pipeline was canceled. We felt like there was a little bit of gas supply from that project that was going to compete with us. And since that's no longer there. That's another good indicator for capital realizations. Overall, though, I think the basis differentials in Northeast Pennsylvania for all the pipes will improve significantly, just like the start-up of Atlantic Sunrise project. So we're encouraged that there is, in fact, a good possibility that there will be some early service available to the shippers on that project. We're hopeful that, that could be as early as this winter. More to come on that, but it's definitely an improvement to get another major takeaway project in place."

Northeast PA, as Dan alluded to, as a focal point for us on in-basin. We've actually taken advantage of this COVID situation and surprisingly been able to participate and master up with a lot of trade associations. We've been doing a lot of webcast with manufacturers associations and industrial [ herds ] that are been very beneficial, and that was kind of a nuance in this day and age for us. We are participating in a lot of site selection, site selections include everything from power, water, rail, highway, workforce, permitting tax, et cetera. So not only are we hard and fast in that area, but other producers to Marcellus. So it's hard to judge what a growth rate could be in entire Marcellus when you have in-basin demand projects throughout West Virginia, PA and Southwest PA, Ohio and just, for example, West Virginia is getting a couple of gas-fired power plants next year that are replacing coal. So it's growth all over on the in-basin side, throughout the Marcellus. In terms of pipeline, if you look at Leidy -- excuse me, Leidy South, Mountain Valley to get 2 Bcf per day there. We are firm believers that PennEast is going to be built. Their Phase I in Pennsylvania will be -- should receive FERC certificates any day now. If it gets here, quickly, we'll see it in service late next year, if it's delayed another couple of months, that will add to the construction time there. So PennEast is important. One other connecting pipes recently approved for construction, Philadelphia. That's been in the news. So we have a new delivery point not only to the proposed PennEast delivery points on Colombia and Texas Eastern, Philadelphia will serve new markets in the Philadelphia area. So I'm a firm believer, there's going to be a number of niche projects going forward to meet the needs of the producer community throughout the Marcellus. And so I hesitate to confirm the deny of a particular growth rate for all of Marcellus, but there's a lot of stuff going on, and it's actually pretty exciting."

As a reminder, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
2020 has proven to be a challenging year on many fronts across the global market. I hope each of you and your families have remained safe and healthy through this unprecedented time. The natural gas industry specifically has had its fair share of challenges driven by the lowest NYMEX price on record in the last 25 years. 
However, the strategic actions we have undertaken since we first began leasing in the Marcellus Shale in 2006, which includes numerous divestitures of higher cost assets with proceeds utilized to maintain a healthy financial position, have positioned our company for continued success even in the very lows of a natural gas price cycle. While we are certainly not immune to lower natural gas prices, our low-cost structure, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy allow us to continue to generate corporate returns and free cash flow even in this current price environment. The good news is that we already experiencing significant tailwinds for the natural gas supply and demand outlook, driven by large declines in natural gas supplies across the U.S., coupled with an improving demand outlook heading into the winter heating season. As a result, since our early March, we have seen over a 35% increase in the NYMEX futures for 2022 to the current levels that are above $3, which would result in a material expansion of net income, free cash flow and return on capital employed next year. 
While we're extremely proud of our team's ability to successfully manage our operations during the ongoing pandemic while generating positive free cash flow in this low price environment, we believe better days lie ahead for Cabot in the 2021 and beyond. 
For the third quarter, specifically, we generated adjusted net income of $37.3 million or $0.09 per share and delivered a free cash flow breakeven program, despite a 26% decline in realized natural gas prices relative to the prior year comparable period. Our production for the quarter was approximately 2.4 Bcf per day, which was inside our guidance range despite price curtailment during the last 13 days of the quarter that were not included in our original guidance. Our unit cost for the quarter improved relative to the prior year period, and we continue to look for opportunities to improve on our peer-leading cost structure even in a flat price -- flat production environment. 
On the operational front, in yesterday's release, we provided the initial results of our 5 Upper Marcellus tests this year, which have been producing for an average of 140 days. Based on the curve fit to date, these wells are tracking above the average EUR of 2.7 Bcf per 1,000 lateral feet that we reported at year-end for our 2018 and 2019 Upper Marcellus wells. We believe these results continue to demonstrate the productivity of this distinct economic interval across our 173,000 net acre position in the core of the dry gas window in Northeast PA. As a reminder, we plan to allocate a modest amount of capital to the Upper Marcellus annually as we continue to refine our well design and lateral placement across this interval with the intent of moving to full development of our Upper Marcellus inventory at the tail end of this decade.  
We also continue to evaluate the optimal lateral length across our asset at -- and at this point, we expect to develop the Upper Marcellus at an average lateral length greater than 10,000 feet, which would provide significant well cost savings, further improving our economics of our Upper Marcellus inventory. Despite the questions we continue to receive on this high-quality reservoir, we have over 60 Upper Marcellus wells that, on average, have been producing for over 5 years, which continue to reinforce our confidence in the opportunity that awaits us when we move to the full development of this section.  
In yesterday's press release, we also reaffirmed our fourth quarter production guidance range, which includes the impact of previously announced price-related curtailments as well as our full year production and capital guidance. While our current year expectation for differentials in 2020 is slightly wider than originally anticipated, which is primarily due to wider local basis in September and October, resulting from weaker shoulder season demand and the east storage levels nearing capacity, however, we are still on track to generate positive free cash flow and far exceed our return of capital target of at least 50% of our free cash flow for the fifth consecutive year. 
Despite reducing absolute debt earlier this year through the repayment of our maturity in July, we have seen a moderate increase in our leverage ratio due to lower EBITDAX resulting from the low price environment. However, we still ended the quarter with a healthy debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.5x and expect a significant deleveraging in 2021 through a combination of higher EBITDAX resulting from improved price realizations and lower absolute debt levels as we plan to utilize a portion of our expected free cash flow next year to retire our 2021 debt maturities.  
We also initiated a preliminary guidance for 2021. This maintenance capital program is expected to hold production levels roughly flat year-over-year at 2.35 Bcf per day from a capital program of $530 million to $540 million, representing a 7% reduction in capital spending year-over-year. The reduction in capital is driven by a combination of operating efficiency gains, resulting from the utilization of leading-edge technology across our operations and lower anticipated service costs. Our program for next year would generally -- would generate a sizable expansion in free cash flow year-over-year, allowing us to not only cover our base dividend and retire $188 million of maturing debt, but to also opportunistically return incremental levels of capital to our shareholders. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually, which we have far exceeded over the last 5 years and will continue to evaluate the prioritization of incremental capital return between growing the base dividend, special/variable dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. It is our belief that depending on where we sit in the commodity price cycle, certain capital allocation options offer more value creation than others. And that maintaining financial flexibility is paramount, especially in a cyclical industry like ours.  
We are often asked what price level we would consider investing in growth again. While we have never believed in growth for the sake of growth, we do believe there are certain price environments that warrant disciplined investments in the expansion of operating cash flow, especially as the lowest cost producer.  
However, with the current natural gas futures in 2022 and beyond in backwardation, and well below the $3-plus environment we are anticipating in 2021, we do not believe this is the appropriate time to consider growing our production base.  
We do have new takeaway capacity coming on the Leidy South Expansion Project, for which a partial path in service was recently requested for as early as this December. This project will provide us additional access to premium markets in the mid-Atlantic. So if natural gas prices continue to rise in the out years, we have new outlets to support incremental value-enhancing growth. However, as we previously stated, our capital allocation priorities for next year are focused on maintaining our current production level, funding our current dividend, retiring our 2021 debt maturities and opportunistically returning incremental free cash flow to shareholders.  
In order to ensure that we are able to deliver on these strategic objectives for 2021, we have begun layering in hedges by opportunistically locking in downside protection while maintaining some level of market price exposure if natural gas prices continue to move higher. Specifically, we have primarily targeted costless collars approach with a weighted average floor that generates a compelling return on capital employed and a level of free cash flow, while still providing the potential for upside to the ceiling if prices remain higher. Currently, we have approximately 23% of our volumes hedged through financial contracts and an additional 16% of our volumes protected through floors in our physical sales next year. We will continue to use market rallies to opportunistically add to our hedge position and improve on our current floors and ceilings.  
Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that yesterday, we posted our inaugural SASB sustainability report to our website. At Cabot, we strive not only to be a leading independent producer of natural gas, but to also be a leader in safe, responsible operations and to minimize the impact of our operations on our employees, our community and the environment. Our success is developing a -- our success in developing abundant unconventional supplies of natural gas helps to support the goal of reducing total greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy independence in the U.S. 
Cabot's legacy of corporate responsibility places high-value in operating with respect and care for people, property and the environment. We believe this commitment, along with our operational success, will continue to create strong value for our shareholders and other stakeholders in our communities. We are proud to report that our greenhouse gas emissions intensity for 2019 was 1.3 tons of carbon..."

This -- significantly lower than the production weighted average intensity of 15 tons of CO2 equivalent per 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent for U.S. onshore assets, as reported by Enverus based on the 2018 publicly available data. 
We currently evaluate new opportunities and continuously do this for emissions reductions to ensure that Cabot is among the most efficient and lowest emitting domestic producers. We also believe our elimination of flaring in the Marcellus, which began in 2014, and our strong performance in water management, including recycled 100% of our water recovered in our Marcellus drilling, completion and production operations, which began in 2011, will continue to make us financially and environmentally superior as pressures for lower carbon and water conserving economies -- economics intensify. Hope you will each take a good look at our SASB report. We're extremely proud of how we measure up against peers and the desires of the investment community on all the metrics included in our report. 
In summary, Cabot's track record of disciplined capital allocation focused on generating improving corporate returns and increasing return of capital to shareholders, which is underpinned by strong free cash flow generation and an ironclad balance sheet as well as our continued focus on corporate responsibility and demonstrates our history of safe, responsible operations that support the goal of reducing total greenhouse emissions, does position us favorably, not only today, but for decades to come as it is our belief that natural gas will continue to play a significant role in the domestic energy supply going forward. 
And with that, Kate, I will begin to answer any questions."

And so with some really mild shoulder months, we did see our basis differentials widen out a bit in contrast to what NYMEX has done. And I think when you look at NYMEX and what's driving it, you see an exit rate on U.S. dry gas production, close to 5 Bcf a day, less than the previous year. Obviously, that's helping NYMEX. 
You also see the capital discipline in the marketplace today, particularly among the gas guys. That helps NYMEX, of course. So we're encouraged in a normal winter, and we're prepared for that to -- for these basis differentials to return to somewhat more normal level."

You have to look at -- right now, the early winter season, you have to look at there is still a couple of hundred Bcf over comparison between this year's storage levels and the 5-year average and last year's storage levels. We are moving into an undersupplied market. We have uncertainty with winter out in front of us.

And we saw no effects on the Lower Marcellus wells, again, clear evidence of the distinct nature of the Upper Marcellus. But we are learning from our frac recipes and the landing position that we have been looking at in various different sections and a tweak of a frac recipe on various different landing sections to determine do we see differences in the results. 
So it's an early game, and we're just gathering data like every operator has done when they go into a new shale play. The Upper is a new shale play with the 60 or so wells that we've drilled in it. We're learning continuously as we go. We're not carrying the -- we learned from our Lower Marcellus and what we do there. But we also know the Upper is a distinctive reservoir to the Lower.

For Cabot's position, [ 250,000 ] a day down to the Mid-Atlantic marketplace is -- will improve price realizations. There's no doubt about that. We're also in a unique position that the Atlantic Coast pipeline was canceled. We felt like there was a little bit of gas supply from that project that was going to compete with us. And since that's no longer there, that's another good indicator for capital realizations. 
Overall, though, I think the basis differentials in Northeast Pennsylvania for all the pipes will improve significantly, just like the start-up of Atlantic Sunrise project. So we're encouraged that there is, in fact, a good possibility that there will be some early service available to the shippers on that project. We're hopeful that, that could be as early as this winter. More to come on that, but it's definitely an improvement to get another major takeaway project in place."

David, we do that. So to your point, would we do it on basin asset? Sure. We look at it because we do that as part of our DNA."

Similar to, though we don't -- I'm not including another power plant in the -- in my expectation.

Northeast PA, as Dan alluded to, is a focal point for us on in-basin. We've actually taken advantage of this COVID situation and surprisingly, have been able to participate and muster up with a lot of trade associations. We've been doing a lot of webcast with manufacturers associations and industrial groups that are -- have been very beneficial, and that was kind of a nuance in this day and age for us. We are participating in a lot of site selection, site selections include everything from power, water, rail, highway, workforce, permitting, tax, et cetera. So not only are we hard and fast in that area, but other producers throughout the Marcellus. So it's hard to judge what a growth rate could be in our Marcellus when you have in-basin demand projects throughout West Virginia, PA and Southwest PA, Ohio and just, for example, West Virginia is getting a couple of gas-fired power plants next year that are replacing coal. So it's growth all over on the in-basin side, throughout the Marcellus. 
In terms of pipeline, if you look at Leidy South, Mountain Valley to get 2 Bcf per day there. We are firm believers that PennEast is going to be built. Their Phase I in Pennsylvania will be -- should receive FERC certificates any day now. If it gets here, quickly, we'll see it in service late next year. If it's delayed another couple of months, that will add to the construction time there. So PennEast is important. One of their connecting pipes was recently approved for construction, Adelphia. That's been in the news. So we have a new delivery point not only to the proposed PennEast delivery points on Colombia and Texas Eastern, Philadelphia will serve new markets in the Philadelphia area. So I'm a firm believer, there's going to be a number of niche projects going forward to to meet the needs of the producer community throughout the Marcellus. And so I hesitate to confirm or deny of a particular growth rate for all of Marcellus, but there's a lot of stuff going on, and it's actually pretty exciting."

As a reminder, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
2020 has proven to be a challenging year on many fronts across the global market. I hope each of you and your families have remained safe and healthy through this unprecedented time. The natural gas industry specifically has had its fair share of challenges driven by the lowest NYMEX price on record in the last 25 years. 
However, the strategic actions we have undertaken since we first began leasing in the Marcellus Shale in 2006, which includes numerous divestitures of higher cost assets with proceeds utilized to maintain a healthy financial position, have positioned our company for continued success even in the very lows of a natural gas price cycle. While we are certainly not immune to lower natural gas prices, our low-cost structure, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy allow us to continue to generate corporate returns and free cash flow even in this current price environment. The good news is that we already experiencing significant tailwinds for the natural gas supply and demand outlook, driven by large declines in natural gas supplies across the U.S., coupled with an improving demand outlook heading into the winter heating season. As a result, since our early March, we have seen over a 35% increase in the NYMEX futures for 2022 to the current levels that are above $3, which would result in a material expansion of net income, free cash flow and return on capital employed next year. 
While we're extremely proud of our team's ability to successfully manage our operations during the ongoing pandemic while generating positive free cash flow in this low price environment, we believe better days lie ahead for Cabot in the 2021 and beyond. 
For the third quarter, specifically, we generated adjusted net income of $37.3 million or $0.09 per share and delivered a free cash flow breakeven program, despite a 26% decline in realized natural gas prices relative to the prior year comparable period. Our production for the quarter was approximately 2.4 Bcf per day, which was inside our guidance range despite price curtailment during the last 13 days of the quarter that were not included in our original guidance. Our unit cost for the quarter improved relative to the prior year period, and we continue to look for opportunities to improve on our peer-leading cost structure even in a flat price -- flat production environment. 
On the operational front, in yesterday's release, we provided the initial results of our 5 Upper Marcellus tests this year, which have been producing for an average of 140 days. Based on the curve fit to date, these wells are tracking above the average EUR of 2.7 Bcf per 1,000 lateral feet that we reported at year-end for our 2018 and 2019 Upper Marcellus wells. We believe these results continue to demonstrate the productivity of this distinct economic interval across our 173,000 net acre position in the core of the dry gas window in Northeast PA. As a reminder, we plan to allocate a modest amount of capital to the Upper Marcellus annually as we continue to refine our well design and lateral placement across this interval with the intent of moving to full development of our Upper Marcellus inventory at the tail end of this decade. 
We also continue to evaluate the optimal lateral length across our asset at -- and at this point, we expect to develop the Upper Marcellus at an average lateral length greater than 10,000 feet, which would provide significant well cost savings, further improving our economics of our Upper Marcellus inventory. Despite the questions we continue to receive on this high-quality reservoir, we have over 60 Upper Marcellus wells that, on average, have been producing for over 5 years, which continue to reinforce our confidence in the opportunity that awaits us when we move to the full development of this section. 
In yesterday's press release, we also reaffirmed our fourth quarter production guidance range, which includes the impact of previously announced price-related curtailments as well as our full year production and capital guidance. While our current year expectation for differentials in 2020 is slightly wider than originally anticipated, which is primarily due to wider local basis in September and October, resulting from weaker shoulder season demand and the east storage levels nearing capacity, however, we are still on track to generate positive free cash flow and far exceed our return of capital target of at least 50% of our free cash flow for the fifth consecutive year. 
Despite reducing absolute debt earlier this year through the repayment of our maturity in July, we have seen a moderate increase in our leverage ratio due to lower EBITDAX resulting from the low price environment. However, we still ended the quarter with a healthy debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.5x and expect a significant deleveraging in 2021 through a combination of higher EBITDAX resulting from improved price realizations and lower absolute debt levels as we plan to utilize a portion of our expected free cash flow next year to retire our 2021 debt maturities. 
We also initiated a preliminary guidance for 2021. This maintenance capital program is expected to hold production levels roughly flat year-over-year at 2.35 Bcf per day from a capital program of $530 million to $540 million, representing a 7% reduction in capital spending year-over-year. The reduction in capital is driven by a combination of operating efficiency gains, resulting from the utilization of leading-edge technology across our operations and lower anticipated service costs. Our program for next year would generally -- would generate a sizable expansion in free cash flow year-over-year, allowing us to not only cover our base dividend and retire $188 million of maturing debt, but to also opportunistically return incremental levels of capital to our shareholders. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually, which we have far exceeded over the last 5 years and will continue to evaluate the prioritization of incremental capital return between growing the base dividend, special/variable dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. It is our belief that depending on where we sit in the commodity price cycle, certain capital allocation options offer more value creation than others. And that maintaining financial flexibility is paramount, especially in a cyclical industry like ours. 
We are often asked what price level we would consider investing in growth again. While we have never believed in growth for the sake of growth, we do believe there are certain price environments that warrant disciplined investments in the expansion of operating cash flow, especially as the lowest cost producer. 
However, with the current natural gas futures in 2022 and beyond in backwardation, and well below the $3-plus environment we are anticipating in 2021, we do not believe this is the appropriate time to consider growing our production base. 
We do have new takeaway capacity coming on the Leidy South Expansion Project, for which a partial path in service was recently requested for as early as this December. This project will provide us additional access to premium markets in the mid-Atlantic. So if natural gas prices continue to rise in the out years, we have new outlets to support incremental value-enhancing growth. However, as we previously stated, our capital allocation priorities for next year are focused on maintaining our current production level, funding our current dividend, retiring our 2021 debt maturities and opportunistically returning incremental free cash flow to shareholders. 
In order to ensure that we are able to deliver on these strategic objectives for 2021, we have begun layering in hedges by opportunistically locking in downside protection while maintaining some level of market price exposure if natural gas prices continue to move higher. Specifically, we have primarily targeted costless collars approach with a weighted average floor that generates a compelling return on capital employed and a level of free cash flow, while still providing the potential for upside to the ceiling if prices remain higher. Currently, we have approximately 23% of our volumes hedged through financial contracts and an additional 16% of our volumes protected through floors in our physical sales next year. We will continue to use market rallies to opportunistically add to our hedge position and improve on our current floors and ceilings. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that yesterday, we posted our inaugural SASB sustainability report to our website. At Cabot, we strive not only to be a leading independent producer of natural gas, but to also be a leader in safe, responsible operations and to minimize the impact of our operations on our employees, our community and the environment. Our success is developing a -- our success in developing abundant unconventional supplies of natural gas helps to support the goal of reducing total greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy independence in the U.S. 
Cabot's legacy of corporate responsibility places high-value in operating with respect and care for people, property and the environment. We believe this commitment, along with our operational success, will continue to create strong value for our shareholders and other stakeholders in our communities. We are proud to report that our greenhouse gas emissions intensity for 2019 was 1.3 tons of carbon..."

This -- significantly lower than the production weighted average intensity of 15 tons of CO2 equivalent per 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent for U.S. onshore assets, as reported by Enverus based on the 2018 publicly available data. 
We currently evaluate new opportunities and continuously do this for emissions reductions to ensure that Cabot is among the most efficient and lowest emitting domestic producers. We also believe our elimination of flaring in the Marcellus, which began in 2014, and our strong performance in water management, including recycled 100% of our water recovered in our Marcellus drilling, completion and production operations, which began in 2011, will continue to make us financially and environmentally superior as pressures for lower carbon and water conserving economies -- economics intensify. Hope you will each take a good look at our SASB report. We're extremely proud of how we measure up against peers and the desires of the investment community on all the metrics included in our report. 
In summary, Cabot's track record of disciplined capital allocation focused on generating improving corporate returns and increasing return of capital to shareholders, which is underpinned by strong free cash flow generation and an ironclad balance sheet as well as our continued focus on corporate responsibility and demonstrates our history of safe, responsible operations that support the goal of reducing total greenhouse emissions, does position us favorably, not only today, but for decades to come as it is our belief that natural gas will continue to play a significant role in the domestic energy supply going forward. 
And with that, Kate, I will begin to answer any questions."

The East typically builds up, of course, their storage levels. But this year, they were built quite early. And so with some really mild shoulder months, we did see our basis differentials widen out a bit in contrast to what NYMEX has done. And I think when you look at NYMEX and what's driving it, you see an exit rate on U.S. dry gas production, close to 5 Bcf a day, less than the previous year. Obviously, that's helping NYMEX. 
You also see the capital discipline in the marketplace today, particularly among the gas guys. That helps NYMEX, of course. So we're encouraged in a normal winter, and we're prepared for that to -- for these basis differentials to return to somewhat more normal level."

What I'm curious about is what levers you may have or may have set aside on your '21 plan? And as I look at your capital guide, with just a $10 million window, that looks like to me that the message is even if we do see a higher price spike, you guys aren't going to change your plan at all. And I guess my question is, is that the right read to take from your CapEx plan? 
And the follow-up being, are there other levers you could pull perhaps something like increased compression if you happen to see really strong spot prices for a couple of months?"

And that there is a point that capital efficiency would make sense to allocate. But really, the way we see the market right now, Charles, and even at a slightly higher price point than where it is right now, we think that the capital program that we've laid out in the range of $530 million to $540 million is the appropriate program. We think a maintenance program is appropriate at this stage. You have to look at -- right now, the early winter season, you have to look at there is still a couple of hundred Bcf over comparison between this year's storage levels and the 5-year average and last year's storage levels. We are moving into an undersupplied market. We have uncertainty with winter out in front of us. So I think that from our perspective, and looking at what's prudent for the health of Cabot and this industry that we are better served to stick with a maintenance capital program, and that's what we're going to do."

And what we're seeing, in my comments I made, and what we're trying to do with our capital allocation right now with complete confidence in the distinctive nature of the zone, we have a thick per cell barrier between the upper and the lower. We gather data on any effects of offset wells that we've drilled. And each of these wells were drilled near previous drilled and producing Lower Marcellus wells. And we saw no effects on the Lower Marcellus wells, again, clear evidence of the distinct nature of the Upper Marcellus. But we are learning from our frac recipes and the landing position that we have been looking at in various different sections and a tweak of a frac recipe on various different landing sections to determine do we see differences in the results. 
So it's an early game, and we're just gathering data like every operator has done when they go into a new shale play. The Upper is a new shale play with the 60 or so wells that we've drilled in it. We're learning continuously as we go. We're not carrying the -- we learned from our Lower Marcellus and what we do there. But we also know the Upper is a distinctive reservoir to the Lower. So we're going to be well educated as we roll into our full development. At the end of this decade, we'll be well educated and ready to roll forward with greater than 10,000 foot laterals and an enhanced return profile for our Upper Marcellus wells."

We have for example, gas available for the non-New York market up there in New York. That non-New York market up there last year, as a reminder, averaged about as a $1.70 premium market to NYMEX in the first quarter of '19. That also just as a footnote on what that does to an annualized differential out there. And certainly, compresses the differential that we see in the in-basin area. So to answer you specifically, I'm just going to focus on and my preference is to focus on right now, what I think is better for Cabot Oil & Gas is better to focus on our commitment to a maintenance capital program at this time.

For Cabot's position, [ 250,000 ] a day down to the Mid-Atlantic marketplace is -- will improve price realizations. There's no doubt about that. We're also in a unique position that the Atlantic Coast pipeline was canceled. We felt like there was a little bit of gas supply from that project that was going to compete with us. And since that's no longer there, that's another good indicator for capital realizations. 
Overall, though, I think the basis differentials in Northeast Pennsylvania for all the pipes will improve significantly, just like the start-up of Atlantic Sunrise project. So we're encouraged that there is, in fact, a good possibility that there will be some early service available to the shippers on that project. We're hopeful that, that could be as early as this winter. More to come on that, but it's definitely an improvement to get another major takeaway project in place."

We've been doing a lot of webcast with manufacturers associations and industrial groups that are -- have been very beneficial, and that was kind of a nuance in this day and age for us. We are participating in a lot of site selection, site selections include everything from power, water, rail, highway, workforce, permitting, tax, et cetera. So not only are we hard and fast in that area, but other producers throughout the Marcellus. So it's hard to judge what a growth rate could be in our Marcellus when you have in-basin demand projects throughout West Virginia, PA and Southwest PA, Ohio and just, for example, West Virginia is getting a couple of gas-fired power plants next year that are replacing coal. So it's growth all over on the in-basin side, throughout the Marcellus.

Their Phase I in Pennsylvania will be -- should receive FERC certificates any day now. If it gets here, quickly, we'll see it in service late next year. If it's delayed another couple of months, that will add to the construction time there. So PennEast is important. One of their connecting pipes was recently approved for construction, Adelphia. That's been in the news. So we have a new delivery point not only to the proposed PennEast delivery points on Colombia and Texas Eastern, Philadelphia will serve new markets in the Philadelphia area. So I'm a firm believer, there's going to be a number of niche projects going forward to meet the needs of the producer community throughout the Marcellus. And so I hesitate to confirm or deny of a particular growth rate for all of Marcellus, but there's a lot of stuff going on, and it's actually pretty exciting."

This is -- it's been a while since we've been able to look ahead and anticipate as optimistically as we are, the forward strip. I think the [ Street ] also is looking at it optimistically with the number of questions that we received today on growth. But we feel great about the position. We feel like the challenge of the commodity is going to have, maybe going forward, a different floor underneath it. I think, which will also reinforce Cabot's ability in a cyclical market to be able to still deliver what we've been able to deliver for the last 5 years. And that's a free cash flow, strong balance sheet and return of capital to our shareholders. 
So with that, I, again, appreciate it. Look forward to our year-end '20 call in February, and stay safe through this difficult time. Thank you very much."

As a reminder, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
2020 has proven to be a challenging year on many fronts across the global market. I hope each of you and your families have remained safe and healthy through this unprecedented time. The natural gas industry specifically has had its fair share of challenges driven by the lowest NYMEX price on record in the last 25 years. 
However, the strategic actions we have undertaken since we first began leasing in the Marcellus Shale in 2006, which includes numerous divestitures of higher cost assets with proceeds utilized to maintain a healthy financial position, have positioned our company for continued success even in the very lows of a natural gas price cycle. While we are certainly not immune to lower natural gas prices, our low-cost structure, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy allow us to continue to generate corporate returns and free cash flow even in this current price environment. The good news is that we already experiencing significant tailwinds for the natural gas supply and demand outlook, driven by large declines in natural gas supplies across the U.S., coupled with an improving demand outlook heading into the winter heating season. As a result, since our early March, we have seen over a 35% increase in the NYMEX futures for 2022 to the current levels that are above $3, which would result in a material expansion of net income, free cash flow and return on capital employed next year. 
While we're extremely proud of our team's ability to successfully manage our operations during the ongoing pandemic while generating positive free cash flow in this low price environment, we believe better days lie ahead for Cabot in the 2021 and beyond. 
For the third quarter, specifically, we generated adjusted net income of $37.3 million or $0.09 per share and delivered a free cash flow breakeven program, despite a 26% decline in realized natural gas prices relative to the prior year comparable period. Our production for the quarter was approximately 2.4 Bcf per day, which was inside our guidance range despite price curtailment during the last 13 days of the quarter that were not included in our original guidance. Our unit cost for the quarter improved relative to the prior year period, and we continue to look for opportunities to improve on our peer-leading cost structure even in a flat price -- flat production environment. 
On the operational front, in yesterday's release, we provided the initial results of our 5 Upper Marcellus tests this year, which have been producing for an average of 140 days. Based on the curve fit to date, these wells are tracking above the average EUR of 2.7 Bcf per 1,000 lateral feet that we reported at year-end for our 2018 and 2019 Upper Marcellus wells. We believe these results continue to demonstrate the productivity of this distinct economic interval across our 173,000 net acre position in the core of the dry gas window in Northeast PA. As a reminder, we plan to allocate a modest amount of capital to the Upper Marcellus annually as we continue to refine our well design and lateral placement across this interval with the intent of moving to full development of our Upper Marcellus inventory at the tail end of this decade. 
We also continue to evaluate the optimal lateral length across our asset at -- and at this point, we expect to develop the Upper Marcellus at an average lateral length greater than 10,000 feet, which would provide significant well cost savings, further improving our economics of our Upper Marcellus inventory. Despite the questions we continue to receive on this high-quality reservoir, we have over 60 Upper Marcellus wells that, on average, have been producing for over 5 years, which continue to reinforce our confidence in the opportunity that awaits us when we move to the full development of this section. 
In yesterday's press release, we also reaffirmed our fourth quarter production guidance range, which includes the impact of previously announced price-related curtailments as well as our full year production and capital guidance. While our current year expectation for differentials in 2020 is slightly wider than originally anticipated, which is primarily due to wider local basis in September and October, resulting from weaker shoulder season demand and the east storage levels nearing capacity, however, we are still on track to generate positive free cash flow and far exceed our return of capital target of at least 50% of our free cash flow for the fifth consecutive year. 
Despite reducing absolute debt earlier this year through the repayment of our maturity in July, we have seen a moderate increase in our leverage ratio due to lower EBITDAX resulting from the low price environment. However, we still ended the quarter with a healthy debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.5x and expect a significant deleveraging in 2021 through a combination of higher EBITDAX resulting from improved price realizations and lower absolute debt levels as we plan to utilize a portion of our expected free cash flow next year to retire our 2021 debt maturities. 
We also initiated a preliminary guidance for 2021. This maintenance capital program is expected to hold production levels roughly flat year-over-year at 2.35 Bcf per day from a capital program of $530 million to $540 million, representing a 7% reduction in capital spending year-over-year. The reduction in capital is driven by a combination of operating efficiency gains, resulting from the utilization of leading-edge technology across our operations and lower anticipated service costs. Our program for next year would generally -- would generate a sizable expansion in free cash flow year-over-year, allowing us to not only cover our base dividend and retire $188 million of maturing debt, but to also opportunistically return incremental levels of capital to our shareholders. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually, which we have far exceeded over the last 5 years and will continue to evaluate the prioritization of incremental capital return between growing the base dividend, special/variable dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. It is our belief that depending on where we sit in the commodity price cycle, certain capital allocation options offer more value creation than others. And that maintaining financial flexibility is paramount, especially in a cyclical industry like ours. 
We are often asked what price level we would consider investing in growth again. While we have never believed in growth for the sake of growth, we do believe there are certain price environments that warrant disciplined investments in the expansion of operating cash flow, especially as the lowest cost producer. 
However, with the current natural gas futures in 2022 and beyond in backwardation, and well below the $3-plus environment we are anticipating in 2021, we do not believe this is the appropriate time to consider growing our production base. 
We do have new takeaway capacity coming on the Leidy South Expansion Project, for which a partial path in service was recently requested for as early as this December. This project will provide us additional access to premium markets in the mid-Atlantic. So if natural gas prices continue to rise in the out years, we have new outlets to support incremental value-enhancing growth. However, as we previously stated, our capital allocation priorities for next year are focused on maintaining our current production level, funding our current dividend, retiring our 2021 debt maturities and opportunistically returning incremental free cash flow to shareholders. 
In order to ensure that we are able to deliver on these strategic objectives for 2021, we have begun layering in hedges by opportunistically locking in downside protection while maintaining some level of market price exposure if natural gas prices continue to move higher. Specifically, we have primarily targeted costless collars approach with a weighted average floor that generates a compelling return on capital employed and a level of free cash flow, while still providing the potential for upside to the ceiling if prices remain higher. Currently, we have approximately 23% of our volumes hedged through financial contracts and an additional 16% of our volumes protected through floors in our physical sales next year. We will continue to use market rallies to opportunistically add to our hedge position and improve on our current floors and ceilings. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that yesterday, we posted our inaugural SASB sustainability report to our website. At Cabot, we strive not only to be a leading independent producer of natural gas, but to also be a leader in safe, responsible operations and to minimize the impact of our operations on our employees, our community and the environment. Our success is developing a -- our success in developing abundant unconventional supplies of natural gas helps to support the goal of reducing total greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy independence in the U.S. 
Cabot's legacy of corporate responsibility places high-value in operating with respect and care for people, property and the environment. We believe this commitment, along with our operational success, will continue to create strong value for our shareholders and other stakeholders in our communities. We are proud to report that our greenhouse gas emissions intensity for 2019 was 1.3 tons of carbon..."

This -- significantly lower than the production weighted average intensity of 15 tons of CO2 equivalent per 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent for U.S. onshore assets, as reported by Enverus based on the 2018 publicly available data. 
We currently evaluate new opportunities and continuously do this for emissions reductions to ensure that Cabot is among the most efficient and lowest emitting domestic producers. We also believe our elimination of flaring in the Marcellus, which began in 2014, and our strong performance in water management, including recycled 100% of our water recovered in our Marcellus drilling, completion and production operations, which began in 2011, will continue to make us financially and environmentally superior as pressures for lower carbon and water conserving economies -- economics intensify. Hope you will each take a good look at our SASB report. We're extremely proud of how we measure up against peers and the desires of the investment community on all the metrics included in our report. 
In summary, Cabot's track record of disciplined capital allocation focused on generating improving corporate returns and increasing return of capital to shareholders, which is underpinned by strong free cash flow generation and an ironclad balance sheet as well as our continued focus on corporate responsibility and demonstrates our history of safe, responsible operations that support the goal of reducing total greenhouse emissions, does position us favorably, not only today, but for decades to come as it is our belief that natural gas will continue to play a significant role in the domestic energy supply going forward. 
And with that, Kate, I will begin to answer any questions."

The East typically builds up, of course, their storage levels. But this year, they were built quite early. And so with some really mild shoulder months, we did see our basis differentials widen out a bit in contrast to what NYMEX has done. And I think when you look at NYMEX and what's driving it, you see an exit rate on U.S. dry gas production, close to 5 Bcf a day, less than the previous year. Obviously, that's helping NYMEX. 
You also see the capital discipline in the marketplace today, particularly among the gas guys. That helps NYMEX, of course. So we're encouraged in a normal winter, and we're prepared for that to -- for these basis differentials to return to somewhat more normal level."

And we saw no effects on the Lower Marcellus wells, again, clear evidence of the distinct nature of the Upper Marcellus.

We are going to be able to generate -- with the market, what we see today in front of us, we've layered in some good floors to protect a very good program for 2021. That's going to deliver significant free cash flow greater than we've seen this year. Full coverage, we feel on our dividend and debt maturities and also incremental free cash flow above that. We think we're going to be able to see that. We're looking, again, with anticipation on the winter and what it does to the markets. We have for example, gas available for the non-New York market up there in New York. That non-New York market up there last year, as a reminder, averaged about as a $1.70 premium market to NYMEX in the first quarter of '19. That also just as a footnote on what that does to an annualized differential out there. And certainly, compresses the differential that we see in the in-basin area. So to answer you specifically, I'm just going to focus on and my preference is to focus on right now, what I think is better for Cabot Oil & Gas is better to focus on our commitment to a maintenance capital program at this time. We think that is important for the industry, and we think that our commitment and conviction to that at this point in time is the prudent position to take."

And essentially, in the Northeast area of the country, this is greater than 0.5 Bcf a day, it's [ 580,000 ] a day of new takeaway, super majority of that gas will be existing gas. It's coming off the Leidy system and maybe a little bit off of Tennessee, for example. For Cabot's position, [ 250,000 ] a day down to the Mid-Atlantic marketplace is -- will improve price realizations. There's no doubt about that. We're also in a unique position that the Atlantic Coast pipeline was canceled. We felt like there was a little bit of gas supply from that project that was going to compete with us. And since that's no longer there, that's another good indicator for capital realizations. 
Overall, though, I think the basis differentials in Northeast Pennsylvania for all the pipes will improve significantly, just like the start-up of Atlantic Sunrise project. So we're encouraged that there is, in fact, a good possibility that there will be some early service available to the shippers on that project. We're hopeful that, that could be as early as this winter. More to come on that, but it's definitely an improvement to get another major takeaway project in place."

Northeast PA, as Dan alluded to, is a focal point for us on in-basin. We've actually taken advantage of this COVID situation and surprisingly, have been able to participate and muster up with a lot of trade associations. We've been doing a lot of webcast with manufacturers associations and industrial groups that are -- have been very beneficial, and that was kind of a nuance in this day and age for us. We are participating in a lot of site selection, site selections include everything from power, water, rail, highway, workforce, permitting, tax, et cetera. So not only are we hard and fast in that area, but other producers throughout the Marcellus. So it's hard to judge what a growth rate could be in our Marcellus when you have in-basin demand projects throughout West Virginia, PA and Southwest PA, Ohio and just, for example, West Virginia is getting a couple of gas-fired power plants next year that are replacing coal. So it's growth all over on the in-basin side, throughout the Marcellus. 
In terms of pipeline, if you look at Leidy South, Mountain Valley to get 2 Bcf per day there. We are firm believers that PennEast is going to be built. Their Phase I in Pennsylvania will be -- should receive FERC certificates any day now. If it gets here, quickly, we'll see it in service late next year. If it's delayed another couple of months, that will add to the construction time there. So PennEast is important. One of their connecting pipes was recently approved for construction, Adelphia. That's been in the news. So we have a new delivery point not only to the proposed PennEast delivery points on Colombia and Texas Eastern, Philadelphia will serve new markets in the Philadelphia area. So I'm a firm believer, there's going to be a number of niche projects going forward to meet the needs of the producer community throughout the Marcellus. And so I hesitate to confirm or deny of a particular growth rate for all of Marcellus, but there's a lot of stuff going on, and it's actually pretty exciting."
