It's been less than 3 months since we completed our merger, and I'm pleased to say we're making significant progress integrating and transforming ViacomCBS as we move quickl",2601,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the first ViacomCBS earnings call. It's been less than 3 months since we completed our merger, and I'm pleased to say we're making significant progress integrating and transforming ViacomCBS as we move quickly to unlock the full power of this now unified company. This includes organizationally, where we've built a best-in-class management team and consolidated structure; operationally, as we started executing as a combined entity in a meaningful way, including through sales force consolidation or streamline groupings of networks as well as integration of digital assets and capabilities; and financially, where cost synergies are already being realized, and our target is being increased from $500 million to $750 million in annualized run rate cost savings. 
Importantly, this progress is not reflected in Q4, which, given the timing of our close, is a transitional one and overwhelmingly reflects 2 separate companies executing on separate strategies. Chris will cover our Q4 and full year results in detail, but let me highlight a few things. 
First, there are, as you'd expect, a significant set of merger-related items that were a headwind for expenses and cash flow. Second, at the operating level from a revenue perspective, certain lines reflect the impact of challenges that will be mitigated in the combined company. Affiliate is an example here while others, such as ad sales, provide insights into the potential of the company to perform more strongly as we extend capabilities across the portfolio. Lastly, our operating results reflect the impact of legacy content investment decisions at some business units. As I will explain in a few minutes, here, we are evolving our strategy to significantly improve content ROI and free cash flow. 
I'd now like to discuss our strategic vision and priorities for ViacomCBS and what we're going to deliver in 2020, a year where we anticipate delivering revenue growth in the mid-single digits; adjusted OIBDA of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion; and free cash flow, excluding integration costs, to achieve of $1.8 billion to $2 billion for 2020 with an additional $500 million in free cash flow benefit in 2021. 
Let's start at the top. ViacomCBS is one of the largest content producers and providers in the world. And that is an incredibly exciting and valuable place to be at a time when both consumer and commercial demand for premium content is only growing. We have an unrivaled ability to create value through the media ecosystem and to serve the largest addressable audience globally. We do this by operating our own platforms and by supplying others. 
Taken together, we believe ViacomCBS can be the most important content partner in the industry. Why? Because first and foremost, we have and make an incredible volume of content through our globe-spanning production capabilities, depth of IP ownership and talent relationships and underpinned by our library of more than 140,000 television episodes and 3,600 film titles, all continually refreshed and grown by over $13 billion annual cash content investment. 
In fact, we make content across every genre format, including news, sports and entertainment, both scripted and unscripted. And our television reach extends across 4.7 billion cumulative homes in over 180 countries. 
And we don't just make content. We make hits as evidenced by our #1 positions across broadcast and cable viewing in all key audience demographics and our #2 ranking in tubular social media video views in the media and entertainment category, another clear indicator of the power and appeal of our IP. 
We also have the ability and flexibility to monetize all this content in a variety of models across both owned and third-party platforms, which we believe is a distinct and important competitive advantage. And by serving the largest addressable audience across every segment and platform, we're aggressively creating new opportunities to bring our brands and IP to more audiences, extend franchises and grow revenue streams. 
Now let's talk more specifically about our 3 priorities for 2020: first, maximize the power of our content; second, unlock more value from our biggest revenue lines; and third, accelerate our momentum in streaming. 
First, content. Our content strategy isn't about spending more. It's about better aligning the combined company spending with growth potential and maximizing the value of our content, IP and franchises across our now larger asset base. That means putting the full power of the company behind our biggest priorities. This includes the massive promotional platform that we can exploit for our own benefit. 
Our leadership on and off linear TV, including the largest broadcast footprint in the world and more than 1.5 billion social fans and followers, provides an incredible opportunity to maximize the impact of our biggest priorities from franchises to football, a platform we look forward to deploying, including in support of Super Bowl LV taking place next February. 
But it's more than promotional impact. It also includes focusing on global cross-company franchise management to get the most out of our powerful IP across our brands and platforms. Take Star Trek, as an example, a globally enduring franchise that we will make even bigger. On the heels of Picard on CBS All Access, which broke our records for total streams and subscriber sign-ups, we're now taking Star Trek franchise and extending it across the house. Building on Discovery and Picard, we now have 2 additional series in production at All Access and Nickelodeon and 2 more series in development, plus a series of Picard novels being rolled out at Simon & Schuster and a highly anticipated new Star Trek feature at Paramount. 
Very importantly, we're also maximizing the power of our content by applying more rigor to managing our content mix, investment and returns. In fact, we see this as a significant opportunity to improve some of the cash softness you saw in Q4 and full year 2019. 
In 2020, that means prioritizing content investment in streaming and studio production, both of which are growth areas. At the same time, our linear TV content spend levels will remain consistent with last year, and effectiveness will increase as we shift the mix within networks and increase cross-company utilization to improve ROI. 
To demonstrate this strategy at work, I'd like to focus on Showtime, a powerful and important brand with culture-defining hits but a business that consumes significant working capital in 2019. Make no mistake, high-end scripted programming enhanced by Billions, Shameless and Homeland will continue to be a key pillar of the brand, but by shifting some of the content mix, including through new uses of ViacomCBS brands, we can attract subscribers in a more cost-effective way. 
Take VH1's RuPaul Drag Race, for example. With a large and loyal following, we believe this franchise will be additive to Showtime subscriber dynamic, which is why we will air a special new season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars on Showtime on a first-window basis. We're also confident this move will further improve the already strong ROI of this franchise, and we see an even bigger opportunity to grow Showtime subs by making better use of its Plex channels, some of which are currently underutilized. 
To that end, we will be rebranding and relaunching Showcase as Show BET this summer, featuring African-American scripted series from Showtime and BET as well as popular movies and specials. We see this as a compelling value creation play that will allow us to benefit from the growing demand for premium African-American content across platforms. 
This brings me to our second strategic priority for 2020, unlocking more value from our biggest revenue lines. With the expanded ViacomCBS asset base, we see a significant opportunity to drive growth of our own platforms, benefiting affiliate and ad revenue. This larger asset base, combined with the licensing pullback of some of our competitors, also sets the stage for growth in our content licensing and studio production businesses. 
Take distribution. ViacomCBS, with leading broadcast and entertainment brands and strength in long, local news and sports, is a must-have for any distributor. And by working with partners to deepen and extend our relationships through advanced advertising, broadband products and more, we can continue to grow share, a strategy that will drive growth in the face of macro trends within the industry. 
In fact, we've already seen the benefit of our combined portfolio with the recent renewal of our carriage agreement with Comcast, which, by the way, brings CBS All Access to set-top boxes for the first time. And it's not just TV. With a diverse and growing theatrical slate from Paramount, we are critical to theaters and the broader film distribution ecosystem, too. Q4 may have been soft for Paramount, but it came after 8 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement. 
 
And just look at the huge opening of our current film Sonic, which did approximately $70 million last weekend in the U.S. and Canada alone, and became the biggest opening ever for a video game adaptation. And we couldn't be more excited for Q2's upcoming and highly anticipated titles, including A Quiet Place Part II, Top Gun: Maverick and the next Spongebob movie, Sponge on the Run. 
So ViacomCBS is a must-have partner for all types of distributors. No question. 
We're also a must buy for advertisers. Our leadership in U.S. reach across linear and digital combined is clear. Our advanced advertising capabilities continue to scale. They are in high demand and were a key driver of our domestic cable networks ad growth in Q4 and 2019. 
Among other things, this sets us up for a strong upfront especially as we apply Viacom's advanced ad business across CBS' massive audience reach and as we continue to expand our premium digital video inventory, which is already amongst the largest in the industry. 
In content licensing too, ViacomCBS is a critical partner. I mentioned before the extensive library of IP we now have. And importantly, with a single content licensing sales force now in place, we can extract incremental benefit through the packaging of film and television, tailoring offerings to better meet client needs, helping take share while simultaneously being able to support our owned and operated platforms in both linear and streaming. 
In content licensing, we're also focused on continuing to unlock the value of our quickly scaling third-party studio production business. While there are some working capital headwinds in this business in 2020, this is a fundamentally profitable business that we expect to deliver $1.3 billion in revenue for the year with double-digit margins and virtually no risk. 
It also allows key franchises to reach more consumers and serves as a component of a multi-faceted franchise development and growth strategy. And since most of this business is essentially a rental model versus a sale, it also enables us to grow our content and IP library for the long term in an economically efficient way, which means we're also building asset value. Put it all together, and you'll begin to see why we believe ViacomCBS can become the most important content partner in the media ecosystem. 
Finally, our third strategic priority for 2020 is to accelerate our momentum in streaming. Let me explain how we're approaching the opportunities in the space. Very importantly, it starts with building on the unique and strong foundation we already have in streaming. 
In ad supported, we have the leading free streaming TV service in Pluto TV, with our 22 million monthly active users in the U.S., up 75% year-over-year. And we expect to exit 2020 with approximately 30 million MAUs domestically. 
In pay, our subscription offerings account for more than 11 million domestic subscribers, up 50% year-on-year. And we expect this to grow to approximately 16 million subscribers as we exit 2020. The growth we've achieved so far is overwhelmingly in the U.S., but we're making early strides to expand internationally. Pluto is already in the U.K., Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and it's launching in Latin America next month. 
On the pay side, All Access is available in Canada and Australia, and our Paramount Plus and products are also live in numerous territories. But our streaming foundation is not just usage. It's also financial. In 2019, our domestic streaming and digital video business, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, had approximately $1.6 billion revenue. We see this as a key metric for ViacomCBS and anticipate it growing between 35% and 40% this year with relatively modest incremental operating expenses. 
Of course, the opportunity is much, much larger. And in pursuing that opportunity, ViacomCBS will take a differentiated approach that builds on our running start, plays to our strength and fulfills unmet audience and partner needs. 
Our going-forward approach to streaming is rooted in the belief that the streaming world will evolve similarly to the linear world. That means it will have free, broad pay and premium pay segments. And just like in the linear world, we'll have streaming product for each. By having robust offerings in each segment, we will also have the ability to migrate consumers across them through promotion and bundling, which creates advantages in subscriber acquisition, retention and lifetime value. 
Our free offering is Pluto TV, and our premium pay offering is Showtime OTT. To complete our portfolio, we will take CBS All Access and expand it to be a robust and compelling offering to serve the broad pay streaming segment. This offer will reaffirm and expand the value of entertainment, news and sports content through on demand and live experiences for audiences around the world, built on the foundation of CBS Access, including the technology, content and subscriber base, adding substantial content assets in film and television, plus the power of world-renowned brands to create, in effect, a combined House of Brand product. 
More specifically, we will add significant content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, BET and Smithsonian, in addition to popular films from the Paramount library, and we will do this at scale to the tune of approximately 30,000 episodes of TV and up to 1,000 movies. This differentiated offering will provide the powerful combination of live linear via over 200 local CBS stations plus on-demand content spanning news, sports, films, drama, reality, kids and more with a global platform and infrastructure from which to market and scale it. 
Importantly, know that we have designed this offering to be compatible with the evolving distribution landscape. We see it as a value-creating opportunity to further broaden our partnerships with traditional distributors akin to our recent Comcast relationship expansion to CBS All Access. 
And we also see a robust offering for distributors in the broader OTT space, including mobile. Obviously, we'll be sharing much more information in the months ahead, but we're already hard at work across tech, content, branding, marketing and more to bring this evolved product to life, and we will soft launch the product later this year. 
As we execute on each of our priorities for 2020, maximizing the power of our content, unlocking new value from our biggest revenue lines and accelerating our momentum in streaming, we are positioning ViacomCBS to deliver significant shareholder value. At the same time, we're making nonoperating moves to unlock meaningful value. These include the divestiture of noncore assets like the sale of BlackRock, which we are in the market with as we speak, in addition to other opportunities we're currently evaluating. The proceeds of these transactions will be used to delever our balance sheet, buy back stock and further strengthen the financial position of the company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to report on our fourth quarter and full year results and to provide detailed 2020 guidance."

It's great to be here for our first ViacomCBS earnings call. 
As you know, our merger was effective December 4. So our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results largely reflect what Viacom and CBS would have delivered as a separate company. 2020 will express the power of our combination with some of the greatest assets in media and an efficient growth strategy underway, we are strongly equipped to capitalize on our position as a preeminent global content company. And by maximizing free cash flow from our traditional businesses while prudently investing in our growth areas, we will create long-term value for our shareholders and our stakeholders. 
First, I'm going to outline our reporting segments and key revenue types. Then I will give you more details about our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Finally, I will provide further context about our 2020 guidance and capital allocation strategy. 
As you can see in our earnings presentation, ViacomCBS comprises 4 business segments: TV Entertainment, Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment and Publishing. We are also presenting 5 key revenue types: advertising, affiliate, content licensing, theatrical and publishing. And we are providing a breakdown of revenue by type within each of our business segments. 
In addition, given the increased prominence of our streaming services, we are giving greater visibility into their performance by providing domestic revenue, subscribers and monthly active users for our fast-growing streaming and digital video business. 
Now let me give you more details about our fourth quarter results.  Q4 of 2019 was a transitional quarter. As a result, we had several merger-related adjustments. They include $589 million in programming charges, resulting from an evaluation by new management of our content strategies for the now combined company; $268 million in restructuring charges related to our synergy initiatives; and $191 million in other merger-related costs. 
In addition, our fourth quarter operating results were primarily affected by several items, including declines in the pay TV universe and legacy Viacom rate resets, lower political spending following record results in 2018, investments in programming and the timing of content licensing sales. Importantly, as Bob mentioned, we believe these areas of impact will be substantially mitigated in the combined company as we evolve our strategy to benefit from our collective asset base. 
We also delivered growth in a number of key areas during the fourth quarter. Affiliate revenue increased 1% despite declines in the pay TV landscape. The growth was driven by retrans and reverse comp, which was up 25% and our subscription streaming revenue, which included a record quarter for subscriber growth at CBS All Access and a record month in December for streaming sign-ups at Showtime. 
At the same time, our domestic Cable Networks advertising revenue was up a strong 9%, benefiting from Pluto, which is an integral part of our advanced advertising offering. So you can see the advantages of our streaming strategy across our company as these services continue to scale. 
On a full year basis, our 2019 revenue showed healthy gains. We delivered total revenue growth of 2% with increases in advertising, affiliate and content licensing. 
Advertising was up 2% driven by CBS' broadcast of Super Bowl LIII and the NCAA Final 4 and championship game as well as strong growth in digital advertising, led by Pluto and CBS All Access. This growth was somewhat offset by FX headwinds as well as lower political advertising. 
Affiliate revenue grew 3%, benefiting from a 20% increase in retrans and reverse comp as well as strong growth in subscription streaming revenue, which offset linear declines in the pay TV ecosystem. And content licensing was up 5% driven by growth in production for third-party streaming platform from our CBS and Paramount television studios as well as the licensing of our library programming. 
In addition, our domestic streaming and digital video revenue in 2019, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, increased approximately 60% to $1.6 billion with growth across Pluto, CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Our solid end-of-year performance across these 3 key services is a strong starting point for 2020 and provides the necessary momentum to scale the future growth of these businesses. 
Turning to free cash flow. Our 2019 adjusted free cash flow was $1.24 billion, which excludes $366 million of restructuring and merger-related payments. These results were affected by higher content investments across our businesses, including more original series produced for our own platform as well as for third parties and the expansion of a film fleet. 
In addition, we had higher cash taxes of $437 million in 2019, including $260 million that was driven by tax regulations finalized in 2019 and the absence of the cash tax benefit that we had in 2018. 
Now let me go into more detail about our 2020 outlook. As you heard in our first full year as ViacomCBS, we expect to grow across key metrics with total revenue up mid-single digits, adjusted OIBDA in the range of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.15 to $5.50. 
Our 2020 outlook also assumes the realization of about $250 million of our $750 million of cost synergy target before consideration of onetime costs to achieve them. Our new target came after 5 months of detailed work on our integration program. We now see that we will achieve more than the $500 million that we identified during our due diligence period from incremental opportunities across areas where Viacom and CBS had the most overlap, namely duplicative organizational areas, vendor sourcing and, to a lesser extent, real estate consolidation. 
We expect to achieve our cross-synergy target over 3 years, with an incremental $350 million in 2021 and the balance of $150 million to be substantially realized in 2022. 
For 2020 adjusted free cash flow, we have line of sight to significant improvement, which will enable us to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. The growth in free cash flow will be fueled by the key revenue drivers we see this year, including retrans and reverse comp as well as political advertising from the presidential election. 
We will also drive free cash flow by strategically reprioritizing our content spending to high-growth areas across our businesses, which will substantially improve our working capital. And we anticipate a cash benefit of approximately $200 million from the $250 million in cost synergies that we expect to deliver this year. 
In 2021, there are several items that will drive approximately $500 million of additional free cash flow. They include the tailwind from continued strategy driven working capital improvements, further realization of merger integration synergies and the benefit of having the Super Bowl, partly offset by the absence of political. 
Now let me give you more detail on our 2020 revenue drivers. We expect to deliver increases across all 4 of our segments and all 5 of our revenue types in 2020. 
In advertising, excluding the Super Bowl and political spending, we anticipate domestic advertising revenue to grow in the low single digits as we go-to-market with expansive U.S. reach across linear and digital platforms, scaled advanced advertising and ease of buying across our portfolio. In addition, political spending is shaping up to be a record, which will further lift our results.
In affiliate, we expect our domestic revenue to grow in the low single digits as we go-to-market with our unified broadcast and cable portfolio. We see continued strength in retrans, reverse comp and our subscription streaming services on a combined basis, which will more than offset pay TV pressures. 
In content licensing, 2020 is shaping up to be a good year. We will benefit from our deal to license South Park, and we will see more opportunities to leverage our vast library, bundle our film and TV programming for domestic and international licensing and ramp up production for third parties, backed by the growing capabilities of our studios as others pull back from the marketplace, leading to greater demand for premium content. 
In theatrical, we're thrilled with Sonic, and we feel great about our upcoming expanded film slate. 
And in publishing, we have a strong lineup of titles from best-selling big name authors, including Stephen King, Jerry Seinfeld and Ruth Ware. 
Looking at metrics beyond our reported financials, we are guiding on domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which we expect to increase by 35% to 40% in 2020, off a base of $1.6 billion in 2019. This assumes domestic streaming subscribers reach approximately 16 million and domestic Pluto MAUs reach approximately 30 million by the end of the year. 
It is important to review our 2020 quarterly cadence. This year's first quarter will be compared against last year's results, which included the Super Bowl. In the second quarter, we will realize the licensing revenue for South Park. In the third quarter, affiliate renewals that we've already completed will take effect, which will give a lift to our revenue. And in the fourth quarter, we anticipate we will have what is already looking to be a record performance for political advertising. 
Turning to capital allocation. We ended 2019 with $18.7 billion of debt. When you take into account the $750 million of full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3x. Excluding the synergies, it was 3.4x. 
Looking forward, we remain committed to our investment-grade rating with a target of achieving a leverage ratio of 2.75x taking these synergies into account. 
As Bob noted, we continue to make progress on the sale of BlackRock. We have completed the initial preparation work with CBRE and are in the market. We anticipate the sale to close in 2020, and we expect to use the proceeds from this transaction for a mix of debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Since the merger closed, we have declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share and repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock. As the year progresses, we will continue to evaluate the use of excess cash for opportunistic share buybacks. 
In regard to M&A, we remain focused on our transformational ViacomCBS deal, and we'll only consider acquisitions that are accretive and tightly linked to our strategy. This disciplined approach is exemplified by our agreement to buy 49% stake in MIRAMAX for $375 million, which gives us exclusive long-term distribution rights to MIRAMAX's catalog of 700 titles, including a number of award-winning films and will enable us to further maximize our programming library. 
So in summary, ViacomCBS is well positioned to grow for the long term. We are maximizing cash flow from our legacy businesses while driving growth in streaming and expanding our reach to new audiences. We now have an even stronger position in the pay TV landscape as well as in advertising, particularly in advanced advertising. 
In 2020, we will begin to reap the returns from the investments we have already made especially in film and our streaming offering. So as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, we will grow free cash flow, capitalize on the benefits of our combination and create value for shareholders. We are poised for a strong year in 2020, which will deliver growth across our unified company and set us up for consistently strong performance in the years to come. 
With that, we can open the line for questions."

Look, over the years, Showtime has made strong progress elevating its brand, deepening its original programming lineup, expanding its reach through OTT. That said, it was a working capital headwind for the company in '19. And the time is right to improve ROI by evolving that programming mix. 
To be clear, Showtime will continue to be an important home of scripted shows like Billions, Homeland, The L Word and Penny Dreadful. And the investments we made in 2019 will clearly pay dividends in 2020. At the same time, Showtime does have traction in other formats, shows like and Miro and Circus, and we see an opportunity to lean more in this direction. And there are new ViacomCBS assets to bring the table, starting with RuPaul and with more to come. Also, Bellator Alignment's a natural fit with Showtime's combat sports positioning and I believe a compelling value creation opportunity in its own right. 
And the Show BET Plex rebranding that we talked about, we think that's a home run in attracting incremental subs. So it's really a multifaceted approach to improving content ROI here. 
Beyond that, it is worth noting that there are some market dynamics in '20 which should be positive for Showtime. As you know, some competitors have lost key distributors. That should take -- Showtime take share, particularly in linear. As we mentioned, OTT momentum has been picking up, strong sub growth in the past 2 months, and slightly longer-term ViacomCBS broader streaming strategy will be additive to Showtime subs over time as it introduces a new consumer funnel. So we're excited about the next leg of journey of this culture-defining brand, and we look forward to it growing its contribution to ViacomCBS. 
Now just quickly in terms of how we decide where to put the product. Let me start with a high-level reminder of what our strategy is and that's to maximize the value of our content by reaching the largest addressable audience. And that's across every segment of platform using our assets and others. 
There's 4 reasons why this is the right strategy for ViacomCBS: first, it makes the most of our greatest strength, which is our content engine and our place in the content industry, which is an industry that's growing; second, it allows us to build on our leadership positions across segments, including genres, demos, formats, while giving us new opportunities to grow brand franchises and audience; third, it allows us access to the largest potential revenue pool, and that's key to balancing adjusted free cash flow delivery and asset value creation; and fourth, it gives us flexibility to adapt as the market and consumer habits continue to evolve. 
So how do we decide what goes where? Let me start with a key fact. The depth and strength of our talent base means we make must-watch content for all platforms. That said, we do have to decide where things go, and we have 3 filters that guide that: we look at financial impact, we look at strategic impact, and we take into account some partnership considerations. 
Now as you think about that, there are several other things I want to keep in mind. That starts with where we have strength, whether it's a franchise, maybe Mission Impossible or a genre like procedurals, you'll increasingly see us not license exclusively to third parties in the U.S. We do look at these things across the house, and we have a content council in place to help evaluate opportunities and make recommendations. And we look at every content decision as just one window in time. These are assets we own, and we expect to monetize them in different ways in different places over time. 
Quickly, an example, Nickelodeon. You know it's the #1 kids brand, big hits like Spongebob. The reality is our linear platform only reaches 40% of kids today, but we can reach beyond that. So what we're doing as an example with Nick is we're putting a spin-offs of Spongebob on Netflix. That will drive direct earnings but also connect these characters with new fans, benefiting the franchise and related businesses like consumer products or future theatrical films. And ultimately, the IP reverts back because remember, it's a rental, not a sale. 
So look, we give a lot of thought to this. We feel great about our strategy, both specifically for Showtime and in general, and you'll see us deliver value in it in 2020 and beyond."

Look, I'm extremely excited about our domestic ad picture. Let me start by commenting on the market. As you know, it remains very strong, both in Q4, now in Q1 with the in-scatter premiums in both broadcast and cable of 25% to 35% above upf",380,"Sure, Jessica. Look, I'm extremely excited about our domestic ad picture. Let me start by commenting on the market. As you know, it remains very strong, both in Q4, now in Q1 with the in-scatter premiums in both broadcast and cable of 25% to 35% above upfront. Broadly speaking, the issue remains supply, not demand. And related to that, we're also seeing strong and growing demand for premium digital video. 
Now if you look more at our performance, particularly in Q4, which I think is helpful to give you insight into where we see this going, overall, ad revenues, domestic ad avenues were flat. Now that's driven in part by the fact that there was not a lot of political ad spend in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of '18. That was a midterm election year. And of course, we have a little decline in impressions but very strong pricing. 
But the real thing to look at is domestic cable at 9% growth with Pluto. That is the strategy we've been pursuing over the last 1.5 years. It's a strategy of combining linear with our advanced marketing solutions. It's really resonating in the market. And as promised, it's delivering robust growth despite impression headwinds. It's allowing us to dramatically outperform all cable competitors. And it's worth noting that AMS is now almost 1/5 of our revenue in the quarter, including with CBS. So these are a real piece of business. 
Looking forward, it's why we're so excited about our position in the market as ViacomCBS. We are now the clear #1 leader. We're #1 on every demo in linear. And our AMS offering is even a merger as we add CBS branded-digital video, including CBS All Access; CBSN, which is growing super fast and more, which means our combined linear AMS cell, something we know how to bring to market, is even more robust. And as you pointed out, Jessica, our ad sales integration is moving very quickly. 
I'm thrilled with Jo Ann's leadership. John Haley is the COO, who knows the advanced ad space. I spent last weekend with the senior team. They are totally pumped and with a bunch of clients. And I'm confident we are going to be extremely well received in this next upfront."

And the fact that we have product on 2 of them, which is free and premium and very quickly, we'll get in the market with the third, really, the middle one, we think, makes a lot of sense. 
In terms of what we need to do, the reason we're so excited about this is it's not vaporware. We're building from a position of strength. As we said, we have about $1.6 billion in domestic streaming and digital ad revenue in '19. That's up 60% from 2018. We have MAUs at the end of '19 at 22 million, actually more than 22 million and over 11 million domestic subs in pay. So that's a real foundation. And we're taking that, and we're building on the experience we already have. We have the benefit in terms of lesson learned and subscriber acquisition and churn management. We understand what gets consumed in free and pay because we've been looking at it for a while. 
We're not launching something new, your question on tech. We are working off of proven platforms and models, and we know how to work with partners, both in the traditional and OTT space. 
So when we look at our plan for 2020 and our guide of 30 million MAUs for Pluto domestically and approximately 16 million subs for our U.S. pay offerings with streaming digital revenue growing 35% to 40%, we feel very good about that. And again, we're in the market today, and you're going to see us get deeper into them as the year goes on. So make no mistake, ViacomCBS will be very much in this game."

But through grouping of networks, through shifting of mixes, we're going to get more effectiveness side of that. And again, we have a proven team that's getting more responsibility in that space. So I feel very good about that. 
At the same time, we are prioritizing investments in places where there's clear growth. That's in streaming. That's in Paramount this year as we continue to ramp the slate of it and in the third-party studio business, which is a significant business with growth, essentially risk-free and long-term asset value. So that's how we're looking at it overall. 
And it's the combination, particularly managing the mature businesses much more tightly, that allows us for a much more modest cash content expense growth as on a going-forward basis, certainly, '19 to '20 and then onward than you've seen in the last couple of years. So that's how we're thinking about it. Again, I look at the combined asset base of this company, we have more than enough resource base to work with. And we are absolutely going to get more out of it."

There's product that's making for its owned and operated network, in that case, CS. And there's product that's making for third-party clients which were a range of different clients. The expense growth in cash obviously covers both. 
As we look at it on the CBS network side, I think it is worth noting that in Q4 and continuing #1 most watched network in prime, 5 of the top 10 programs, 5 of the top 6 fresh series. So the network continues to perform strongly. 
That said, I was with Navin last week, and we were talking about CBS, and they're actually spending less on pilots this year because they feel very good about where the network is, and therefore, are able to be more prudent. At the same time, whether it's the CBS studio or the Paramount studio, we continue to have ramping demand in that third-party studio production business. Yes, that consumes some cash, certainly in '19, that's a bit of a cash headwind in '20 but I want to reiterate, it's a different business. It's fundamentally profitable. It's low risk, and we do build long-term asset value. 
So on a cash basis, we are continuing to invest a bit in that, but it is really a separate business. So but rest assured, in general, we're looking at everything. 
We talked about Showtime. We're looking at CBS. We're doing a lot of work on the linear cable side.

Just wondering kind of what could you tell us about kind of your plans for the Nickelodeon network? And that sort of ties into the Charlie question, which is DISH was pretty clear yesterday in their call that if your ratings are down sharply, they are going to look for reductions in rate or they're going to simply drop programming, which they've been doing at a more -- at an increasing rate. Just wondering kind of how you think about the negotiation with DISH, which I think is coming up pretty shortly. 
And then, Chris, I think on the question that somebody asked about cable affiliates being down 8%.

And you know that the combined company adds young adult reach, both linear and streaming as well as international capabilities, both of which are key to NFL development and thus, important to the league. We are going to do some stuff around NFL in the months ahead as we prep for Super Bowl LV, leveraging our platform. That's obviously a February 21 event. 
And to be clear, as a kind company, we absolutely have the financial resources to get a deal done. And we do believe it's important to the company, and I feel good about getting a deal done. When it gets done, I don't know. We'll see. That's really more the NFL's call on timing. 
With respect to Nickelodeon, if I look at our domestic cable portfolio overall, we actually have pretty solid audience performance. 13 of our networks grew share in Q4, including comedy, BET, Paramount Networks, Smithsonian. Actually, we see sequential improvement Q1 to date. The whole portfolio is up about 4%. 
Nickelodeon continues to be a work in progress. It is far and away #1 in the space. But that is also why -- and we do feel good about the slate of shows coming, but we have pivoted to a multi-platform variant of Nickelodeon as part of building that brand for the future. That combines what we're doing in the linear network, what we're doing in our, call it, over-the-top space, what we're doing with third parties and then how we're monetizing that broader audience, including through things like consumer products, and for that matter, film. 
So we are really attacking the Nickelodeon opportunity in a multifaceted way. I feel good about the progress Brian Robbins and his team are making. I feel good about the parent partnership with Paramount, with the next Spongebob in Q2. By the way, we did a preview of that movie Spongebob Out of Water last weekend, and people are feeling very good about the film. Obviously, the Nick network and our consumer products team are totally behind it. So Nick has a bright future. 
And finally, I'd say back to the streaming discussion in our broader pay product, that's a House of Brands. Nickelodeon is going to feature prominently in that. That's going to be good for the streaming product, and it's going to be good for the Nickelodeon brand. 
Largely, I'm not going to comment on any particular renewals other than to say we have a track record of getting deals done. We have a stronger portfolio than ever, including levers we haven't pulled with some of our clients. And therefore, I feel good about our position."

And we do, as I alluded to earlier, have some big shows in Q1 like Star Trek: Picard and Homeland that are strongly performing for streaming in Q1. But then as we go toward Q2, we'll have the licensing delivery of South Park, and momentum will build from there. So again, we'll see the full power of ViacomCBS in 2020 and beyond. And I harken back to Alexia's question that we have strong conviction in the guidance, all of this is contemplated in the guidance, and we will see momentum build as we go into 2020 and beyond."

So look, if you look at the U.S. affiliate landscape, there's no question that ViacomCBS is among, if not the most important supplier to linear. Remember, we are #1 on every demographic in linear. We have must-see content in news, in sports, in entertainment. And we have a model that gets deals done, including having a range of partnership levers, whether that's in advanced ad sales, doing more and more working with them in the broadband space. We started that with Pluto. Comcast just did that with All Access, set-top box, too. So we have a lot to work with there. There may be winners and losers in the space, but we feel good about taking share and getting deals done. 
And again, you will see that track out in the year. We've already had a positive experience with one very large MVPD, who's not a walk in the park to negotiate with. 
On to streaming. Two things I'd say in relation to your question. One is, remember, we are in this business today, both in free and in the various pay segments. We have been putting original content. You look at what All Access did with Picard. So it's not like we're ramping from nowhere. In fact, we're building momentum and in particularly, as we do that, and this is definitely for the Pluto side, remember, Pluto is very capital efficient. That is essentially a rev share model, not a invest in content and build it out. So as we launch in places like Latin America, you don't have this big working capital headwind. You have a model that scales with the business. 
So I'm very excited about our streaming plan. The financials are absolutely built into the guidance, and the incremental capital is modest certainly by standards of what some other folks are doing. 
And with that, we're kind of running a little over. So I want to thank you for your questions. 
In closing, we couldn't be more excited about the road ahead, one where we will continue to unlock the power of this incredible combination, capitalizing on our position as one of the largest content producers and providers in the world, we believe becoming the most important partner in the media ecosystem, creating valuable new businesses. We have the assets. We have the plan. We have the team. We will execute and we will deliver for you. As we do, know that we're 100% share -- focused on shareholder value creation. We're committed to providing the transparency and disclosure you need to understand and track the value we're creating.

It's been less than 3 months since we completed our merger, and I'm pleased to say we're making significant progress integrating and transforming ViacomCBS as we move quickl",2608,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the first ViacomCBS earnings call. It's been less than 3 months since we completed our merger, and I'm pleased to say we're making significant progress integrating and transforming ViacomCBS as we move quickly to unlock the full power of this now unified company. This includes organizationally, where we've built a best-in-class management team and consolidated structure; operationally, as we've started executing as a combined entity in a meaningful way, including through sales force consolidation or streamlined groupings of networks as well as integration of digital assets and capabilities; and financially, where cost synergies are already being realized, and our target is being increased from $500 million to $750 million in annualized run rate cost savings. 
Importantly, this progress is not reflected in Q4, which, given the timing of our close, is a transitional one and overwhelmingly reflects 2 separate companies executing on separate strategies. Chris will cover our Q4 and full year results in detail, but let me highlight a few things. 
First, there are, as you'd expect, a significant set of merger-related items that were a headwind for expenses and cash flow. Second, at the operating level from a revenue perspective, certain lines reflect the impact of challenges that will be mitigated in the combined company. Affiliate is an example here while others, such as ad sales, provide insights into the potential of the company to perform more strongly as we extend capabilities across the portfolio. Lastly, our operating results reflect the impact of legacy content investment decisions at some business units. As I will explain in a few minutes, here we are evolving our strategy to significantly improve content ROI and free cash flow. 
I'd now like to discuss our strategic vision and priorities for ViacomCBS and what we're going to deliver in 2020, a year where we anticipate delivering revenue growth in the mid-single digits, adjusted OIBDA of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion, and free cash flow, excluding integration costs, to achieve of $1.8 billion to $2 billion for 2020 with an additional $500 million in free cash flow benefit in 2021. 
Let's start at the top. ViacomCBS is one of the largest content producers and providers in the world. And that is an incredibly exciting and valuable place to be at a time when both consumer and commercial demand for premium content is only growing. We have an unrivaled ability to create value through the media ecosystem and to serve the largest addressable audience globally. We do this by operating our own platforms and by supplying others. 
Taken together, we believe ViacomCBS can be the most important content partner in the industry. Why? Because first and foremost, we have and make an incredible volume of content through our globe-spanning production capabilities, depth of IP ownership and talent relationships and underpinned by our library of more than 140,000 television episodes and 3,600 film titles, all continually refreshed and grown by over $13 billion annual cash content investment. 
In fact, we make content across every genre and format, including news, sports and entertainment, both scripted and unscripted. And our television reach extends across 4.7 billion cumulative homes in over 180 countries. 
And we don't just make content. We make hits as evidenced by our #1 positions across broadcast and cable viewing in all key audience demographics and our #2 ranking in tubular social media video views in the media and entertainment category, another clear indicator of the power and appeal of our IP. 
We also have the ability and flexibility to monetize all this content in a variety of models across both owned and third-party platforms, which we believe is a distinct and important competitive advantage. And by serving the largest addressable audience across every segment and platform, we're aggressively creating new opportunities to bring our brands and IP to more audiences, extend franchises and grow revenue streams. 
Now let's talk more specifically about our 3 priorities for 2020: first, maximize the power of our content; second, unlock more value from our biggest revenue lines; and third, accelerate our momentum in streaming. 
First, content. Our content strategy isn't about spending more. It's about better aligning the combined company spending with growth potential and maximizing the value of our content, IP and franchises across our now larger asset base. That means putting the full power of the company behind our biggest priorities. This includes the massive promotional platform that we can exploit for our own benefit. 
Our leadership on and off linear TV, including the largest broadcast footprint in the world and more than 1.5 billion social fans and followers, provides an incredible opportunity to maximize the impact of our biggest priorities from franchises to football, a platform we look forward to deploying, including in support of Super Bowl LV taking place next February. 
But it's more than promotional impact. It also includes focusing on global cross-company franchise management to get the most out of our powerful IP across our brands and platforms. Take Star Trek as an example, a globally enduring franchise that we will make even bigger. On the heels of Picard on CBS All Access, which broke all records for total streams and subscriber sign-ups, we're now taking the Star Trek franchise and extending it across the house. Building on Discovery and Picard, we now have 2 additional series in production at All Access and Nickelodeon and 2 more series in development, plus a series of Picard novels being rolled out at Simon & Schuster and highly anticipated new Star Trek feature at Paramount. 
Very importantly, we're also maximizing the power of our content by applying more rigor to managing our content mix, investment and returns. In fact, we see this as a significant opportunity to improve some of the cash softness you saw in Q4 and full year 2019. 
In 2020, that means prioritizing content investment in streaming and studio production, both of which are growth areas. At the same time, our linear TV content spend levels will remain consistent with last year, and effectiveness will increase as we shift the mix within networks and increase cross-company utilization to improve ROI. 
To demonstrate this strategy at work, I'd like to focus on Showtime, a powerful and important brand with culture-defining hits, but a business that consumes significant working capital in 2019. Make no mistake, high-end scripted programming enhanced by Billions, Shameless and Homeland will continue to be a key pillar of the brand. But by shifting some of the content mix, including through new uses of ViacomCBS brands, we can attract subscribers in a more cost effective way. 
Take VH1's RuPaul's Drag Race, for example. With a large and loyal following, we believe this franchise will be additive to Showtime subscriber dynamic, which is why we will air a special new season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars on Showtime on a first-window basis. We're also confident this move will further improve the already strong ROI of this franchise, and we see an even bigger opportunity to grow Showtime subs by making better use of its plex channels, some of which are currently underutilized. 
To that end, we will be rebranding and relaunching Showcase as SHO*BET this summer, featuring African-American scripted series from Showtime and BET as well as popular movies and specials. We see this as a compelling value creation play that will allow us to benefit from the growing demand for premium African-American content across platforms. 
This brings me to our second strategic priority for 2020, unlocking more value from our biggest revenue lines. With the expanded ViacomCBS asset base, we see a significant opportunity to drive growth of our own platforms, benefiting affiliate and ad revenue. This larger asset base, combined with the licensing pullback of some of our competitors, also sets the stage for growth in our content licensing and studio production businesses. 
Take distribution. ViacomCBS, with leading broadcast and entertainment brands and strength in live, local news and sports, is a must-have for any distributor. And by working with partners to deepen and extend our relationships through advanced advertising, broadband products and more, we can continue to grow share, a strategy that will drive growth in the face of macro trends within the industry. 
In fact, we've already seen the benefit of our combined portfolio with the recent renewal of our carriage agreement with Comcast, which by the way, brings CBS All Access to set-top boxes for the first time. And it's not just TV. With a diverse and growing theatrical slate from Paramount, we are critical to theaters and the broader film distribution ecosystem too. Q4 may have been soft for Paramount, but it came after 8 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement. 
 
And just look at the huge opening of our current film Sonic, which did approximately $70 million last weekend in the U.S. and Canada alone, and became the biggest opening ever for a video game adaptation. And we couldn't be more excited for Q2's upcoming and highly anticipated titles, including A Quiet Place Part II, Top Gun: Maverick and the next SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run. 
So ViacomCBS is a must-have partner for all types of distributors. No question. 
We're also a must buy for advertisers. Our leadership in U.S. reach across linear and digital combined is clear. Our advanced advertising capabilities continue to scale. They are in high demand and were a key driver of our domestic cable networks ad growth in Q4 and 2019. 
Among other things, this sets us up for a strong upfront, especially as we apply Viacom's advanced ad business across CBS' massive audience reach and as we continue to expand our premium digital video inventory, which is already amongst the largest in the industry. 
In content licensing too, ViacomCBS is a critical partner. I mentioned before the extensive library of IP we now have. And importantly, with a single content licensing sales force now in place, we can extract incremental benefit through the packaging of film and television, tailoring offerings to better meet client needs, helping take share while simultaneously being able to support our owned and operated platforms in both linear and streaming. 
In content licensing, we're also focused on continuing to unlock the value of our quickly scaling third-party studio production business. While there are some working capital headwinds in this business in 2020, this is a fundamentally profitable business that we expect to deliver $1.3 billion in revenue for the year with double-digit margins and virtually no risk. 
It also allows key franchises to reach more consumers and serves as a component of a multi-faceted franchise development and growth strategy. And since most of this business is essentially a rental model versus a sale, it also enables us to grow our content and IP library for the long term in an economically efficient way, which means we're also building asset value. Put it all together, and you'll begin to see why we believe ViacomCBS can become the most important content partner in the media ecosystem. 
Finally, our third strategic priority for 2020 is to accelerate our momentum in streaming. Let me explain how we're approaching the opportunities in the space. Very importantly, it starts with building on the unique and strong foundation we already have in streaming. 
In ad supported, we have the leading free streaming TV service in Pluto TV, with over 22 million monthly active users in the U.S., up 75% year-over-year. And we expect to exit 2020 with approximately 30 million MAUs domestically. 
In pay, our subscription offerings account for more than 11 million domestic subscribers, up 50% year-on-year. And we expect this to grow to approximately 16 million subscribers as we exit 2020. The growth we've achieved so far is overwhelmingly in the U.S., but we're making early strides to expand internationally. Pluto is already in the U.K., Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and it's launching in Latin America next month. 
On the pay side, All Access is available in Canada and Australia, and our Paramount Plus and Noggin products are also live in numerous territories. But our streaming foundation is not just usage. It's also financial. In 2019, our domestic streaming and digital video business, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, had approximately $1.6 billion revenue. We see this as a key metric for ViacomCBS and anticipate it growing between 35% and 40% this year with relatively modest incremental operating expenses. 
Of course, the opportunity is much, much larger. And in pursuing that opportunity, ViacomCBS will take a differentiated approach that builds on our running start, plays to our strength and fulfills unmet audience and partner needs. 
Our going-forward approach to streaming is rooted in the belief that the streaming world will evolve similarly to the linear world. That means it will have free, broad pay and premium pay segments. And just like in the linear world, we'll have streaming product for each. By having robust offerings in each segment, we will also have the ability to migrate consumers across them through promotion and bundling, which creates advantages in subscriber acquisition, retention and lifetime value. 
Our free offering is Pluto TV, and our premium pay offering is Showtime OTT. To complete our portfolio, we will take CBS All Access and expand it to be a robust and compelling offering to serve the broad pay streaming segment. This offer will reaffirm and expand the value of entertainment, news and sports content through on demand and live experiences for audiences around the world, built on the foundation of CBS All Access, including the technology, content and subscriber base, adding substantial content assets in film and television, plus the power of world renowned brands to create, in effect, a combined House of Brands product. 
More specifically, we will add significant content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, BET and Smithsonian, in addition to popular films from the Paramount library, and we will do this at scale to the tune of approximately 30,000 episodes of TV and up to 1,000 movies. This differentiated offering will provide the powerful combination of live linear via over 200 local CBS stations plus on-demand content spanning news, sports, films, drama, reality, kids and more with a global platform and infrastructure from which to market and scale it. 
Importantly, know that we have designed this offering to be compatible with the evolving distribution landscape. We see it as a value-creating opportunity to further broaden our partnerships with traditional distributors akin to our recent Comcast relationship expansion to CBS All Access. 
And we also see it as a robust offering for distributors in the broader OTT space, including mobile. Obviously, we'll be sharing much more information in the months ahead, but we're already hard at work across tech, content, branding, marketing and more to bring this evolved product to life, and we will soft launch the product later this year. 
As we execute on each of our priorities for 2020, maximizing the power of our content, unlocking new value from our biggest revenue lines and accelerating our momentum in streaming, we are positioning ViacomCBS to deliver significant shareholder value. At the same time, we're making nonoperating moves to unlock meaningful value. These include the divestiture of noncore assets like the sale of Black Rock, which we are in the market with as we speak, in addition to other opportunities we're currently evaluating. The proceeds of these transactions will be used to delever our balance sheet, buy back stock and further strengthen the financial position of the company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to report on our fourth quarter and full year results and to provide detailed 2020 guidance."

It's great to be here for our first ViacomCBS earnings call. 
As you know, our merger was effective December 4. So our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results largely reflect what Viacom and CBS would have delivered as a separate company. 2020 will express the power of our combination with some of the greatest assets in media and an efficient growth strategy underway, we are strongly equipped to capitalize on our position as a preeminent global content company. And by maximizing free cash flow from our traditional businesses while prudently investing in our growth areas, we will create long-term value for our shareholders and our stakeholders. 
First, I'm going to outline our reporting segments and key revenue types. Then I will give you more details about our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Finally, I will provide further context about our 2020 guidance and capital allocation strategy. 
As you can see in our earnings presentation, ViacomCBS comprises 4 business segments: TV Entertainment, Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment and Publishing. We are also presenting 5 key revenue types: advertising, affiliate, content licensing, theatrical and publishing. And we are providing a breakdown of revenue by type within each of our business segments. 
In addition, given the increased prominence of our streaming services, we are giving greater visibility into their performance by providing domestic revenue, subscribers and monthly active users for our fast-growing streaming and digital video business. 
Now let me give you more details about our fourth quarter results. Q4 of 2019 was a transitional quarter. As a result, we had several merger-related adjustments. They include $589 million in programming charges, resulting from an evaluation by new management of our content strategies for the now combined company; $268 million in restructuring charges related to our synergy initiatives; and $191 million in other merger-related costs. 
In addition, our fourth quarter operating results were primarily affected by several items, including declines in the pay TV universe and legacy Viacom rate resets, lower political spending following our record results in 2018, investments in programming and the timing of content licensing sales. Importantly, as Bob mentioned, we believe these areas of impact will be substantially mitigated in the combined company as we evolve our strategy to benefit from our collective asset base. 
We also delivered growth in a number of key areas during the fourth quarter. Affiliate revenue increased 1% despite declines in the pay TV landscape. The growth was driven by retrans and reverse comp, which was up 25% and our subscription streaming revenue, which included a record quarter for subscriber growth at CBS All Access and a record month in December for streaming sign-ups at Showtime. 
At the same time, our domestic Cable Networks advertising revenue was up a strong 9%, benefiting from Pluto, which is an integral part of our advanced advertising offering. So you can see the advantages of our streaming strategy across our company as these services continue to scale. 
On a full year basis, our 2019 revenue showed healthy gains. We delivered total revenue growth of 2% with increases in advertising, affiliate and content licensing. 
Advertising was up 2%, driven by CBS' broadcast of Super Bowl LIII and the NCAA Final Four and championship game as well as strong growth in digital advertising, led by Pluto and CBS All Access. This growth was somewhat offset by FX headwinds as well as lower political advertising. 
Affiliate revenue grew 3%, benefiting from a 20% increase in retrans and reverse comp as well as strong growth in subscription streaming revenue, which offset linear declines in the pay TV ecosystem. And content licensing was up 5%, driven by growth in production for third-party streaming platform from our CBS and Paramount television studios as well as the licensing of our library programming. 
In addition, our domestic streaming and digital video revenue in 2019, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, increased approximately 60% to $1.6 billion with growth across Pluto, CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Our solid end-of-year performance across these 3 key services is the strong starting point for 2020 and provides the necessary momentum to scale the future growth of these businesses. 
Turning to free cash flow. Our 2019 adjusted free cash flow was $1.24 billion, which excludes $366 million of restructuring and merger related payments. These results were affected by higher content investments across our businesses, including more original series produced for our own platform as well as for third parties and the expansion of our film fleet. 
In addition, we had higher cash taxes of $437 million in 2019, including $260 million that was driven by tax regulations finalized in 2019 and the absence of the cash tax benefit that we had in 2018. 
Now let me go into more detail about our 2020 outlook. As you heard in our first full year as ViacomCBS, we expect to grow across key metrics with total revenue up mid-single digits, adjusted OIBDA in the range of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.15 to $5.50. 
Our 2020 outlook also assumes the realization of about $250 million of our $750 million of cost synergy target before consideration of onetime costs to achieve them. Our new target came after 5 months of detailed work on our integration program. We now see that we will achieve more than the $500 million that we identified during our due diligence period from incremental opportunities across areas where Viacom and CBS had the most overlap, namely duplicative organizational areas, vendor sourcing and, to a lesser extent, real estate consolidation. 
We expect to achieve our cost synergy target over 3 years, with an incremental $350 million in 2021 and the balance of $150 million to be substantially realized in 2022. 
For 2020 adjusted free cash flow, we have line of sight to significant improvement, which will enable us to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. The growth in free cash flow will be fueled by the key revenue drivers we see this year, including retrans and reverse comp as well as political advertising from the presidential election. 
We will also drive free cash flow by strategically reprioritizing our content spending to high growth areas across our businesses, which will substantially improve our working capital. And we anticipate a cash benefit of approximately $200 million from the $250 million in cost synergies that we expect to deliver this year. 
In 2021, there are several items that will drive approximately $500 million of additional free cash flow. They include the tailwind from continued strategy driven working capital improvements, further realization of merger integration synergies and the benefit of having the Super Bowl, partly offset by the absence of political. 
Now let me give you more detail on our 2020 revenue drivers. We expect to deliver increases across all 4 of our segments and all 5 of our revenue types in 2020. 
In advertising, excluding the Super Bowl and political spending, we anticipate domestic advertising revenue to grow in the low single digits as we go-to-market with expansive U.S. reach across linear and digital platforms, scaled advanced advertising and ease of buying across our portfolio. In addition, political spending is shaping up to be a record, which will further lift our results.
In affiliate, we expect our domestic revenue to grow in the low single digits as we go-to-market with our unified broadcast and cable portfolio. We see continued strength in retrans, reverse comp and our subscription streaming services on a combined basis, which will more than offset pay TV pressures. 
In content licensing, 2020 is shaping up to be a good year. We will benefit from our deal to license South Park, and we will see more opportunities to leverage our vast library, bundle our film and TV programming for domestic and international licensing and ramp up production for third parties, backed by the growing capabilities of our studios as others pull back from the marketplace, leading to greater demand for premium content. 
In theatrical, we're thrilled with Sonic, and we feel great about our upcoming expanded film slate. 
And in publishing, we have a strong lineup of titles from best selling and big name authors, including Stephen King, Jerry Seinfeld and Ruth Ware. 
Looking at metrics beyond our reported financials, we are guiding on domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which we expect to increase by 35% to 40% in 2020, off a base of $1.6 billion in 2019. This assumes domestic streaming subscribers reach approximately 16 million and domestic Pluto MAUs reach approximately 30 million by the end of the year. 
It is important to review our 2020 quarterly cadence. This year's first quarter will be compared against last year's results, which included the Super Bowl. In the second quarter, we will realize the licensing revenue for South Park. In the third quarter, affiliate renewals that we've already completed will take effect, which will give a lift to our revenue. And in the fourth quarter, we anticipate we will have what is already looking to be a record performance for political advertising. 
Turning to capital allocation. We ended 2019 with $18.7 billion of debt. When you take into account the $750 million of full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3x. Excluding the synergies, it was 3.4x. 
Looking forward, we remain committed to our investment grade rating with a target of achieving a leverage ratio of 2.75x taking these synergies into account. 
As Bob noted, we continue to make progress on the sale of Black Rock. We have completed the initial preparation work with CBRE and are in the market. We anticipate the sale to close in 2020, and we expect to use the proceeds from this transaction for a mix of debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Since the merger closed, we have declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share and repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock. As the year progresses, we will continue to evaluate the use of excess cash for opportunistic share buybacks. 
In regard to M&A, we remain focused on our transformational ViacomCBS deal, and we'll only consider acquisitions that are accretive and tightly linked to our strategy. This disciplined approach is exemplified by our agreement to buy a 49% stake in MIRAMAX for $375 million, which gives us exclusive long term distribution rights to MIRAMAX's catalog of 700 titles, including a number of award-winning films and will enable us to further maximize our programming library. 
So in summary, ViacomCBS is well positioned to grow for the long term. We are maximizing cash flow from our legacy businesses while driving growth in streaming and expanding our reach to new audiences. We now have an even stronger position in the pay TV landscape as well as in advertising, particularly in advanced advertising. 
And in 2020, we will begin to reap the returns from the investments we have already made, especially in film and our streaming offering. So as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, we will grow free cash flow, capitalize on the benefits of our combination and create value for shareholders. 
We are poised for a strong year in 2020, which will deliver growth across our unified company and set us up for consistently strong performance in the years to come. 
With that, we can open the line for questions."

So as you said, that's actually 2 part -- that makes the 3-part question. But let me take Showtime and then talk about the general question. Look, over the years, Showtime has made strong progress elevating its brand, deepening its original program",770,"Yes. So as you said, that's actually 2 part -- that makes the 3-part question. But let me take Showtime and then talk about the general question. 
Look, over the years, Showtime has made strong progress elevating its brand, deepening its original programming lineup, expanding its reach through OTT. That said, it was a working capital headwind for the company in '19. And the time is right to improve ROI by evolving that programming mix. 
To be clear, Showtime will continue to be an important home of scripted shows like Billions, Homeland, The L Word, Penny Dreadful. And the investments we made in 2019 will clearly pay dividends in 2020. At the same time, Showtime does have traction in other format, shows like Desus and Mero and Circus, and we see an opportunity to lean more in this direction. And there are new ViacomCBS assets to bring to table, starting with RuPaul and with more to come. Also, Bellator's alignment is a natural fit with Showtime's combat sports positioning, and I believe a compelling value creation opportunity in its own right. 
And the SHO*BET plex rebranding that we talked about, we think that's a home run in attracting incremental subs. So it's really a multifaceted approach to improving content ROI here. 
Beyond that, it is worth noting that there are some market dynamics in '20 which should be positive for Showtime. As you know, some competitors have lost key distributors. That should hint Showtime take share, particularly in linear. As we mentioned, OTT momentum has been picking up, strong sub growth in the past 2 months, and slightly longer term ViacomCBS broader streaming strategy will be additive to Showtime subs over time as it introduces a new consumer funnel. So we're excited about the next leg of journey of this culture-defining brand, and we look forward to it growing its contribution to ViacomCBS. 
Now just quickly in terms of how we decide where to put the product. Let me start with a high-level reminder of what our strategy is and that's to maximize the value of our content by reaching the largest addressable audience. And that's across every segment of platform using our assets and others. 
There's 4 reasons why this is the right strategy for ViacomCBS: first, it makes the most of our greatest strength, which is our content engine and our place in the content industry, which is an industry that's growing; second, it allows us to build on our leadership positions across segments, including genres, demos, formats, while giving us new opportunities to grow brand franchises and audience; third, it allows us access to the largest potential revenue pool, and that's key to balancing adjusted free cash flow delivery and asset value creation; and fourth, it gives us flexibility to adapt as the market and consumer habits continue to evolve. 
So how do we decide what goes where? Let me start with a key fact. The depth and strength of our talent base means we make must-watch content for all platforms. That said, we do have to decide where things go, and we have 3 filters that guide that. We look at financial impact, we look at strategic impact, and we take into account some partnership considerations. 
Now as you think about that, there's several other things I want you to keep in mind. That starts with where we have strength, whether it's a franchise, maybe Mission: Impossible or a genre like procedurals, you'll increasingly see us not license exclusively to third parties in the U.S. We do look at these things across the house, and we have a content council in place to help evaluate opportunities and make recommendations. And we look at every content decision as just one window in time. These are assets we own, and we expect to monetize them in different ways in different places over time. 
Quickly, an example, Nickelodeon. You know it's #1 kids brand, big hits like SpongeBob. The reality is our linear platform only reaches 40% of kids today, but we can reach beyond that. So what we're doing as an example with Nick is we're putting a spin-offs of SpongeBob on Netflix. That will drive direct earnings, but also connect these characters with new fans, benefiting the franchise and related businesses like consumer products or future theatrical films. And ultimately, the IP reverts back because remember, it's a rental, not a sale. 
So look, we give a lot of thought to this. We feel great about our strategy, both specifically for Showtime and in general, and you'll see us deliver value in it in 2020 and beyond."

Look, I'm extremely excited about our domestic ad picture. Let me start by commenting on the market.

Look, I'm extremely excited about our domestic ad picture. Let me start by commenting on the market. As you know, it remains very strong, both in Q4, now in Q1 with the in-scatter premiums in both broadcast and cable of 25% to 35% above upfront. Broadly speaking, the issue remains supply, not demand. And related to that, we're also seeing strong and growing demand for premium digital video. 
Now if you look more at our performance, particularly in Q4, which I think is helpful to give you insight into where we see this going, overall, ad revenues, domestic ad avenues were flat. Now that's driven in part by the fact that there was not a lot of political ad spend in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of '18. That was a midterm election year. And of course, we have a little decline in impressions but very strong pricing. 
But the real thing to look at is domestic cable at 9% growth with Pluto. That is the strategy we've been pursuing over the last 1.5 years. It's a strategy of combining linear with our advanced marketing solutions. It's really resonating in the market. And as promised, it's delivering robust growth despite impression headwinds. It's allowing us to dramatically outperform all cable competitors. And it's worth noting that AMS is now almost 1/5 of our revenue in the quarter, including with CBS. So this is a real piece of business. 
Looking forward, it's why we're so excited about our position in the market as ViacomCBS. We are now the clear #1 leader. We're #1 on every demo in linear. And our AMS offering is even larger as we add CBS branded digital video, including CBS All Access, CBSN, which is growing super fast and more, which means our combined linear AMS cell, something we know how to bring to market, is even more robust. And as you pointed out, Jessica, our ad sales integration is moving very quickly. 
I'm thrilled with Jo Ann's leadership. John Halley is the COO, who knows the advanced ad space. I spent last weekend with the senior team. They are totally pumped and with a bunch of clients. And I'm confident we are going to be extremely well received in this next upfront."

And the fact that we have product in 2 of them, which is free and premium and very quickly, we'll get in the market with the third, rather the middle one, we think, makes a lot of sense. 
In terms of what we need to do, the reason we're so excited about this is it's not vaporware. We're building from a position of strength. As we said, we have about $1.6 billion in domestic streaming and digital ad revenue in '19. That's up 60% from 2018. We have MAUs at the end of '19 at 22 million, actually more than 22 million and over 11 million domestic subs in pay. So that's a real foundation. And we're taking that, and we're building on the experience we already have. We have the benefit in terms of lesson learned in subscriber acquisition, insurance management. We understand what gets consumed in free and pay because we've been looking at it for a while. 
We're not launching something new, your question on tech. We are working off of proven platforms and models, and we know how to work with partners, both in the traditional and OTT space. 
So when we look at our plan for 2020 and our guide of 30 million MAUs for Pluto domestically and approximately 16 million subs for our U.S. pay offerings with streaming digital revenue growing 35% to 40%, we feel very good about that. And again, we're in the market today, and you're going to see us get deeper into the market as the year goes on. So make no mistake, ViacomCBS will be very much in this game."

But through grouping of networks, through shifting of mixes, we're going to get more effectiveness side of that. And again, we have a proven team that's getting more responsibility in that space. So I feel very good about that. 
At the same time, we are prioritizing investments in places where there's clear growth. That's in streaming. That's in Paramount this year as we continue to ramp the slate of it and in the third-party studio business, which is a significant business with growth, essentially risk-free and long-term asset value. So that's how we're looking at it overall. 
And it's the combination, particularly managing the mature businesses much more tightly, that allows us for much more modest cash content expense growth as on a going-forward basis, certainly, '19 to '20 and then onward than you've seen in the last couple of years. So that's how we're thinking about it. Again, I look at the combined asset base of this company, we have more than enough resource base to work with.

The expense growth in cash obviously covers both. 
As we look at it on the CBS network side, I think it is worth noting that in Q4 and continuing #1 most watched network in prime, 5 of the top 10 programs, 5 of the top 6 freshman series. So the network continues to perform strongly. 
That said, I was with Navin last week, and we were talking about CBS, and they're actually spending less on pilots this year because they feel very good about where the network is, and therefore, are able to be more prudent. At the same time, whether it's the CBS studio or the Paramount studio, we continue to have ramping demand in that third-party studio production business. Yes, that consumes some cash, certainly in '19, that's a bit of a cash headwind in '20. But I want to reiterate, it's a different business. It's fundamentally profitable. It's low risk, and we do build long term asset value. 
So on a cash basis, we are continuing to invest a bit in that, but it is really a separate business. So -- but rest assured, in general, we're looking at everything.

First, your peers are -- have been doing some uneconomic deals if you look at what ESPN just did for the SEC and UFC.

First, your peers are -- have been doing some uneconomic deals if you look at what ESPN just did for the SEC and UFC. Wondering as you think about kind of the NFL negotiation that will play out this year, sort of are you prepared to do something that is ""uneconomic?"" Two, on Nickelodeon, I think your ratings were down somewhere around 20% last year. And it looked like it got a lot worse in Q4 and into early 2020 since the launch of Disney+. 
Just wondering kind of what could you tell us about kind of your plans for the Nickelodeon network? And that sort of ties into the Charlie Ergen question, which is DISH was pretty clear yesterday in their call that if your ratings are down sharply, they are going to look for reductions in rate or they're going to simply drop programming, which they've been doing at a more -- at an increasing rate. Just wondering kind of how you think about the negotiation with DISH, which I think is coming up pretty shortly. 
And then, Chris, I think on the question that somebody asked about cable affiliates being down 8%. You kind of talked about what was in the press release, but could you give some clarity of like what were subs down? What was the rate reset? Just adding some actual numbers to the decline would be helpful. I think that's what the follow-up I was trying to ask."

As a combined company, ViacomCBS is even better positioned to deliver value to that franchise. You know the NFL values our broadcast reach and high-quality production. And you know that the combined company adds young adult reach, both linear and streaming as well as international capabilities, both of which are key to NFL development and thus, important to the league. We are going to do some stuff around the NFL in the months ahead as we prep for Super Bowl LV, leveraging our platform. That's obviously a February 21 event. 
And to be clear, as a kind company, we absolutely have the financial resources to get a deal done. And we do believe it's important to the company, and I feel good about getting a deal done. When it gets done? I don't know. We'll see. That's really more the NFL's call on timing. 
With respect to Nickelodeon, if I look at our domestic cable portfolio overall, we actually have pretty solid audience performance. 13 of our networks grew share in Q4, including comedy, BET, Paramount Networks, Smithsonian. Actually, we see sequential improvement Q1 to date. The whole portfolio is up about 4%. 
Nickelodeon continues to be a work in progress. It is far and away #1 in the space. But that is also why -- and we do feel good about the slate of shows coming, but we have pivoted to a multi-platform variant of Nickelodeon as part of building that brand for the future. That combines what we're doing in the linear network, what we're doing in our, call it, over-the-top space, what we're doing with third parties and then how we're monetizing that broader audience, including through things like consumer products, and for that matter, film. 
So we are really attacking the Nickelodeon opportunity in a multifaceted way. I feel good about the progress Brian Robbins and his team are making. I feel good about the partnership with Paramount, with the next SpongeBob movie coming in Q2. By the way, we did a preview of that movie SpongeBob Out of Water last weekend, and people are feeling very good about the film. Obviously, the Nick Network and our consumer products team are totally behind it. So Nick has a bright future. 
And finally, I'd say back to the streaming discussion in our broader pay product, that's a House of Brands. Nickelodeon is going to feature prominently in that. That's going to be good for the streaming product, and it's going to be good for the Nickelodeon brand. 
Largely, I'm not going to comment on any particular renewals other than to say we have a track record of getting deals done. We have a stronger portfolio than ever, including levers we haven't pulled with some of our clients. And therefore, I feel good about our position."

But when we look at how our quarters will build, Q4, we had a tough quarter. As we head into Q1 and we think through Q2, our momentum will build. So Q1, we are going to see some more of the affiliate headwinds we've experienced. We also will have some timing of licensing considerations. And we do, as I alluded to earlier, have some big shows in Q1 like Star Trek: Picard and Homeland that are strongly performing for streaming in Q1. But then as we go toward Q2, we'll have the licensing delivery of South Park, and momentum will build from there. So again, we'll see the full power of ViacomCBS in 2020 and beyond.

So look, if you look at the U.S. affiliate landscape, there's no question that ViacomCBS is among, if not the most important supplier to linear. Remember, we are #1 on every demographic in linear. We have must-see content in news, in sports, in entertainment. And we have a model that gets deals done, including having a range of partnership levers, whether that's in advanced ad sales, doing more and more working with them in the broadband space. We started that with Pluto. Comcast just did that with All Access, set-top box too. So we have a lot to work with there. There may be winners and losers in this space, but we feel good about taking share and getting deals done. 
And again, you will see that track out in the year. We've already had a positive experience with one very large MVPD, who's not a walk in the park to negotiate with. 
On to streaming. Two things I'd say in relation to your question. One is, remember, we are in this business today, both in free and in the various pay segments. We have been putting original content. You look at what All Access did with Picard. So it's not like we're ramping from nowhere. In fact, we're building momentum and in particularly, as we do that, and this is definitely on the Pluto side, remember, Pluto is very capital efficient. That is essentially a rev share model, not a invest in content and build it out. So as we launch in places like Latin America, you don't have this big working capital headwind. You have a model that scales with the business. 
So I'm very excited about our streaming plan. The financials are absolutely built into the guidance, and the incremental capital is modest certainly by standards of what some other folks are doing. 
And with that, we're kind of running a little over. So I want to thank you for your questions. 
In closing, we couldn't be more excited about the road ahead, one where we will continue to unlock the power of this incredible combination, capitalizing on our position as one of the largest content producers and providers in the world, we believe becoming the most important partner in the media ecosystem, creating valuable new businesses. We have the assets. We have the plan. We have the team. We will execute and we will deliver for you. As we do, know that we're 100% share -- focused on shareholder value creation. We're committed to providing the transparency and disclosure you need to understand and track the value we're creating.

It's been less than 3 months since we completed our merger, and I'm pleased to say we're making significant progress integrating and transforming ViacomCBS as we move quickl",2608,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the first ViacomCBS earnings call. It's been less than 3 months since we completed our merger, and I'm pleased to say we're making significant progress integrating and transforming ViacomCBS as we move quickly to unlock the full power of this now unified company. This includes organizationally, where we've built a best-in-class management team and consolidated structure; operationally, as we've started executing as a combined entity in a meaningful way, including through sales force consolidation or streamlined groupings of networks as well as integration of digital assets and capabilities; and financially, where cost synergies are already being realized, and our target is being increased from $500 million to $750 million in annualized run rate cost savings. 
Importantly, this progress is not reflected in Q4, which, given the timing of our close, is a transitional one and overwhelmingly reflects 2 separate companies executing on separate strategies. Chris will cover our Q4 and full year results in detail, but let me highlight a few things. 
First, there are, as you'd expect, a significant set of merger-related items that were a headwind for expenses and cash flow. Second, at the operating level from a revenue perspective, certain lines reflect the impact of challenges that will be mitigated in the combined company. Affiliate is an example here while others, such as ad sales, provide insights into the potential of the company to perform more strongly as we extend capabilities across the portfolio. Lastly, our operating results reflect the impact of legacy content investment decisions at some business units. As I will explain in a few minutes, here we are evolving our strategy to significantly improve content ROI and free cash flow. 
I'd now like to discuss our strategic vision and priorities for ViacomCBS and what we're going to deliver in 2020, a year where we anticipate delivering revenue growth in the mid-single digits, adjusted OIBDA of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion, and free cash flow, excluding integration costs, to achieve of $1.8 billion to $2 billion for 2020 with an additional $500 million in free cash flow benefit in 2021. 
Let's start at the top. ViacomCBS is one of the largest content producers and providers in the world. And that is an incredibly exciting and valuable place to be at a time when both consumer and commercial demand for premium content is only growing. We have an unrivaled ability to create value through the media ecosystem and to serve the largest addressable audience globally. We do this by operating our own platforms and by supplying others. 
Taken together, we believe ViacomCBS can be the most important content partner in the industry. Why? Because first and foremost, we have and make an incredible volume of content through our globe-spanning production capabilities, depth of IP ownership and talent relationships and underpinned by our library of more than 140,000 television episodes and 3,600 film titles, all continually refreshed and grown by over $13 billion annual cash content investment. 
In fact, we make content across every genre and format, including news, sports and entertainment, both scripted and unscripted. And our television reach extends across 4.7 billion cumulative homes in over 180 countries. 
And we don't just make content. We make hits as evidenced by our #1 positions across broadcast and cable viewing in all key audience demographics and our #2 ranking in tubular social media video views in the media and entertainment category, another clear indicator of the power and appeal of our IP. 
We also have the ability and flexibility to monetize all this content in a variety of models across both owned and third-party platforms, which we believe is a distinct and important competitive advantage. And by serving the largest addressable audience across every segment and platform, we're aggressively creating new opportunities to bring our brands and IP to more audiences, extend franchises and grow revenue streams. 
Now let's talk more specifically about our 3 priorities for 2020: first, maximize the power of our content; second, unlock more value from our biggest revenue lines; and third, accelerate our momentum in streaming. 
First, content. Our content strategy isn't about spending more. It's about better aligning the combined company spending with growth potential and maximizing the value of our content, IP and franchises across our now larger asset base. That means putting the full power of the company behind our biggest priorities. This includes the massive promotional platform that we can exploit for our own benefit. 
Our leadership on and off linear TV, including the largest broadcast footprint in the world and more than 1.5 billion social fans and followers, provides an incredible opportunity to maximize the impact of our biggest priorities from franchises to football, a platform we look forward to deploying, including in support of Super Bowl LV taking place next February. 
But it's more than promotional impact. It also includes focusing on global cross-company franchise management to get the most out of our powerful IP across our brands and platforms. Take Star Trek as an example, a globally enduring franchise that we will make even bigger. On the heels of Picard on CBS All Access, which broke all records for total streams and subscriber sign-ups, we're now taking the Star Trek franchise and extending it across the house. Building on Discovery and Picard, we now have 2 additional series in production at All Access and Nickelodeon and 2 more series in development, plus a series of Picard novels being rolled out at Simon & Schuster and a highly anticipated new Star Trek feature at Paramount. 
Very importantly, we're also maximizing the power of our content by applying more rigor to managing our content mix, investment and returns. In fact, we see this as a significant opportunity to improve some of the cash softness you saw in Q4 and full year 2019. 
In 2020, that means prioritizing content investment in streaming and studio production, both of which are growth areas. At the same time, our linear TV content spend levels will remain consistent with last year, and effectiveness will increase as we shift the mix within networks and increase cross-company utilization to improve ROI. 
To demonstrate this strategy at work, I'd like to focus on Showtime, a powerful and important brand with culture-defining hits, but a business that consumed significant working capital in 2019. Make no mistake, high-end scripted programming enhanced by Billions, Shameless and Homeland will continue to be a key pillar of the brand. But by shifting some of the content mix, including through new uses of ViacomCBS brands, we can attract subscribers in a more cost effective way. 
Take VH1's RuPaul's Drag Race, for example. With a large and loyal following, we believe this franchise will be additive to Showtime subscriber dynamic, which is why we will air a special new season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars on Showtime on a first-window basis. We're also confident this move will further improve the already strong ROI of this franchise. And we see an even bigger opportunity to grow Showtime subs by making better use of its plex channels, some of which are currently underutilized. 
To that end, we will be rebranding and relaunching Showcase as SHO*BET this summer, featuring African-American scripted series from Showtime and BET as well as popular movies and specials. We see this as a compelling value-creation play that will allow us to benefit from the growing demand for premium African-American content across platforms. 
This brings me to our second strategic priority for 2020, unlocking more value from our biggest revenue lines. With the expanded ViacomCBS asset base, we see a significant opportunity to drive growth of our own platforms, benefiting affiliate and ad revenue. This larger asset base, combined with the licensing pullback of some of our competitors, also sets the stage for growth in our content licensing and studio production businesses. 
Take distribution. ViacomCBS, with leading broadcast and entertainment brands and strength in live local news and sports, is a must-have for any distributor. And by working with partners to deepen and extend our relationships through advanced advertising, broadband products and more, we can continue to grow share, a strategy that will drive growth in the face of macro trends within the industry. 
In fact, we've already seen the benefit of our combined portfolio with the recent renewal of our carriage agreement with Comcast, which, by the way, brings CBS All Access to set-top boxes for the first time. And it's not just TV. With a diverse and growing theatrical slate from Paramount, we are critical to theaters and the broader film distribution ecosystem too. Q4 may have been soft for Paramount, but it came after 8 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement. 
 
And just look at the huge opening of our current film Sonic, which did approximately $70 million last weekend in the U.S. and Canada alone, and became the biggest opening ever for a video game adaptation. And we couldn't be more excited for Q2's upcoming and highly anticipated titles, including A Quiet Place Part II, Top Gun: Maverick and the next SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run. 
So ViacomCBS is a must-have partner for all types of distributors. No question. 
We're also a must-buy for advertisers. Our leadership in U.S. reach across linear and digital combined is clear. Our advanced advertising capabilities continue to scale. They are in high demand and were a key driver of our domestic cable networks ad growth in Q4 and 2019. 
Among other things, this sets us up for a strong upfront, especially as we apply Viacom's advanced ad business across CBS' massive audience reach and as we continue to expand our premium digital video inventory, which is already amongst the largest in the industry. 
In content licensing too, ViacomCBS is a critical partner. I mentioned before, the extensive library of IP we now have. And importantly, with a single content licensing sales force now in place, we can extract incremental benefit through the packaging of film and television, tailoring offerings to better meet client needs, helping take share while simultaneously being able to support our owned and operated platforms in both linear and streaming. 
In content licensing, we're also focused on continuing to unlock the value of our quickly scaling third-party studio production business. While there are some working capital headwinds in this business in 2020, this is a fundamentally profitable business that we expect to deliver $1.3 billion in revenue for the year with double-digit margins and virtually no risk. 
It also allows key franchises to reach more consumers and serves as a component of a multi-faceted franchise development and growth strategy. And since most of this business is essentially a rental model versus a sale, it also enables us to grow our content and IP library for the long term in an economically efficient way, which means we're also building asset value. Put it all together, and you'll begin to see why we believe ViacomCBS can become the most important content partner in the media ecosystem. 
Finally, our third strategic priority for 2020 is to accelerate our momentum in streaming. Let me explain how we're approaching the opportunities in the space. Very importantly, it starts with building on the unique and strong foundation we already have in streaming. 
In ad supported, we have the leading free streaming TV service in Pluto TV, with over 22 million monthly active users in the U.S., up 75% year-over-year. And we expect to exit 2020 with approximately 30 million MAUs domestically. 
In pay, our subscription offerings account for more than 11 million domestic subscribers, up 50% year-on-year. And we expect this to grow to approximately 16 million subscribers as we exit 2020. The growth we've achieved so far is overwhelmingly in the U.S., but we're making early strides to expand internationally. Pluto is already in the U.K., Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and it's launching in Latin America next month. 
On the pay side, All Access is available in Canada and Australia, and our Paramount Plus and Noggin products are also live in numerous territories. But our streaming foundation is not just usage, it's also financial. In 2019, our domestic streaming and digital video business, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, had approximately $1.6 billion in revenue. We see this as a key metric for ViacomCBS and anticipate it growing between 35% and 40% this year with relatively modest incremental operating expenses. 
Of course, the opportunity is much, much larger. And in pursuing that opportunity, ViacomCBS will take a differentiated approach that builds on our running start, plays to our strength and fulfills unmet audience and partner needs. 
Our going-forward approach to streaming is rooted in the belief that the streaming world will evolve similarly to the linear world. That means it will have free, broad pay and premium pay segments. And just like in the linear world, we'll have streaming product for each. By having robust offerings in each segment, we will also have the ability to migrate consumers across them through promotion and bundling, which creates advantages in subscriber acquisition, retention and lifetime value. 
Our free offering is Pluto TV, and our premium pay offering is Showtime OTT. To complete our portfolio, we will take CBS All Access and expand it to be a robust and compelling offering to serve the broad pay streaming segment. This offer will reaffirm and expand the value of entertainment, news and sports content through on demand and live experiences for audiences around the world, built on the foundation of CBS All Access, including the technology, content and subscriber base, adding substantial content assets in film and television, plus the power of world renowned brands to create, in effect, a combined House of Brands product. 
More specifically, we will add significant content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, BET and Smithsonian, in addition to popular films from the Paramount library, and we will do this at scale to the tune of approximately 30,000 episodes of TV and up to 1,000 movies. This differentiated offering will provide the powerful combination of live linear via over 200 local CBS stations plus on-demand content spanning news, sports, films, drama, reality, kids and more with a global platform and infrastructure from which to market and scale it. 
Importantly, know that we have designed this offering to be compatible with the evolving distribution landscape. We see it as a value-creating opportunity to further broaden our partnerships with traditional distributors akin to our recent Comcast relationship expansion to CBS All Access. And we also see it as a robust offering for distributors in the broader OTT space, including mobile. Obviously, we'll be sharing much more information in the months ahead, but we're already hard at work across tech, content, branding, marketing and more to bring this evolved product to life, and we will soft launch the product later this year. 
As we execute on each of our priorities for 2020, maximizing the power of our content, unlocking new value from our biggest revenue lines and accelerating our momentum in streaming, we are positioning ViacomCBS to deliver significant shareholder value. At the same time, we're making nonoperating moves to unlock meaningful value. These include the divestiture of noncore assets like the sale of Black Rock, which we are in the market with as we speak, in addition to other opportunities we're currently evaluating. The proceeds of these transactions will be used to delever our balance sheet, buy back stock and further strengthen the financial position of the company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to report on our fourth quarter and full year results and to provide detailed 2020 guidance."

First, I'm going to outline our reporting segments and key revenue types. Then I will give you more details about our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Finally, I will provide further context about our 2020 guidance and capital allocation strategy. 
As you can see in our earnings presentation, ViacomCBS comprises 4 business segments: TV Entertainment, Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment and Publishing. We are also presenting 5 key revenue types: advertising, affiliate, content licensing, theatrical and publishing. And we are providing a breakdown of revenue by type within each of our business segments. 
In addition, given the increased prominence of our streaming services, we are giving greater visibility into their performance by providing domestic revenue, subscribers and monthly active users for our fast-growing streaming and digital video business. 
Now let me give you more details about our fourth quarter results. Q4 of 2019 was a transitional quarter. As a result, we had several merger-related adjustments. They include $589 million in programming charges, resulting from an evaluation by new management of our content strategies for the now combined company; $268 million in restructuring charges related to our synergy initiatives; and $191 million in other merger-related costs. 
In addition, our fourth quarter operating results were primarily affected by several items, including declines in the pay TV universe and legacy Viacom rate resets, lower political spending following our record results in 2018, investments in programming and the timing of content licensing sales. Importantly, as Bob mentioned, we believe these areas of impact will be substantially mitigated in the combined company as we evolve our strategy to benefit from our collective asset base. 
We also delivered growth in a number of key areas during the fourth quarter. Affiliate revenue increased 1% despite declines in the pay TV landscape. The growth was driven by retrans and reverse comp, which was up 25% and our subscription streaming revenue, which included a record quarter for subscriber growth at CBS All Access and a record month in December for streaming sign-ups at Showtime. 
At the same time, our domestic Cable Networks advertising revenue was up a strong 9%, benefiting from Pluto, which is an integral part of our advanced advertising offering. So you can see the advantages of our streaming strategy across our company as these services continue to scale. 
On a full year basis, our 2019 revenue showed healthy gains. We delivered total revenue growth of 2% with increases in advertising, affiliate and content licensing. 
Advertising was up 2%, driven by CBS' broadcast of Super Bowl LIII and the NCAA Final Four and championship game as well as strong growth in digital advertising, led by Pluto and CBS All Access. This growth was somewhat offset by FX headwinds as well as lower political advertising. 
Affiliate revenue grew 3%, benefiting from a 20% increase in retrans and reverse comp as well as strong growth in subscription streaming revenue, which offset linear declines in the pay TV ecosystem. And content licensing was up 5%, driven by growth in production for third-party streaming platform from our CBS and Paramount television studios as well as the licensing of our library programming. 
In addition, our domestic streaming and digital video revenue in 2019, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, increased approximately 60% to $1.6 billion with growth across Pluto, CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Our solid end-of-year performance across these 3 key services is a strong starting point for 2020 and provides the necessary momentum to scale the future growth of these businesses. 
Turning to free cash flow. Our 2019 adjusted free cash flow was $1.24 billion, which excludes $366 million of restructuring and merger-related payments. These results were affected by higher content investments across our businesses, including more original series produced for our own platform as well as for third parties and the expansion of our film fleet. 
In addition, we had higher cash taxes of $437 million in 2019, including $260 million that was driven by tax regulations finalized in 2019 and the absence of a cash tax benefit that we had in 2018. 
Now let me go into more detail about our 2020 outlook. As you heard, in our first full year as ViacomCBS, we expect to grow across key metrics with total revenue up mid-single digits, adjusted OIBDA in the range of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.15 to $5.50. 
Our 2020 outlook also assumes the realization of about $250 million of our $750 million of cost synergy target before consideration of onetime costs to achieve them. Our new target came after 5 months of detailed work on our integration program. We now see that we will achieve more than the $500 million that we identified during our due diligence period from incremental opportunities across areas where Viacom and CBS have the most overlap, namely duplicative organizational areas, vendor sourcing and, to a lesser extent, real estate consolidation. 
We expect to achieve our cost synergy target over 3 years, with an incremental $350 million in 2021 and the balance of $150 million to be substantially realized in 2022. 
For 2020 adjusted free cash flow, we have line of sight to significant improvement, which will enable us to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. The growth in free cash flow will be fueled by the key revenue drivers we see this year, including retrans and reverse comp as well as political advertising from the presidential election. 
We will also drive free cash flow by strategically reprioritizing our content spending to high growth areas across our businesses, which will substantially improve our working capital. And we anticipate a cash benefit of approximately $200 million from the $250 million in cost synergies that we expect to deliver this year. 
In 2021, there are several items that will drive approximately $500 million of additional free cash flow. They include the tailwind from continued strategy-driven working capital improvements, further realization of merger integration synergies and the benefit of having the Super Bowl, partly offset by the absence of political. 
Now let me give you more detail on our 2020 revenue drivers. We expect to deliver increases across all 4 of our segments and all 5 of our revenue types in 2020. 
In advertising, excluding the Super Bowl and political spending, we anticipate domestic advertising revenue to grow in the low single digits as we go-to-market with expansive U.S. reach across linear and digital platforms, scaled advanced advertising and ease of buying across our portfolio. In addition, political spending is shaping up to be a record, which will further lift our results.
In affiliate, we expect our domestic revenue to grow in the low single digits as we go-to-market with our unified broadcast and cable portfolio. We see continued strength in retrans, reverse comp and our subscription streaming services on a combined basis, which will more than offset pay TV pressures. 
In content licensing, 2020 is shaping up to be a good year. We will benefit from our deal to license South Park, and we will see more opportunities to leverage our vast library, bundle our film and TV programming for domestic and international licensing and ramp up production for third parties, backed by the growing capabilities of our studios as others pull back from the marketplace, leading to greater demand for premium content. 
In theatrical, we're thrilled with Sonic, and we feel great about our upcoming expanded film slate. 
And in Publishing, we have a strong lineup of titles from best selling and big name authors, including Stephen King, Jerry Seinfeld and Ruth Ware. 
Looking at metrics beyond our reported financials, we are guiding on domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which we expect to increase by 35% to 40% in 2020 off a base of $1.6 billion in 2019. This assumes domestic streaming subscribers reach approximately 16 million and domestic Pluto MAUs reach approximately 30 million by the end of the year. 
It is important to review our 2020 quarterly cadence. This year's first quarter will be compared against last year's results, which included the Super Bowl. In the second quarter, we will realize the licensing revenue for South Park. In the third quarter, affiliate renewals that we've already completed will take effect, which will give a lift to our revenue. And in the fourth quarter, we anticipate we will have what is already looking to be a record performance for political advertising. 
Turning to capital allocation. We ended 2019 with $18.7 billion of debt. When you take into account the $750 million of full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3x. Excluding the synergies, it was 3.4x. 
Looking forward, we remain committed to our investment grade rating with a target of achieving a leverage ratio of 2.75x taking these synergies into account. 
As Bob noted, we continue to make progress on the sale of Black Rock. We have completed the initial preparation work with CBRE and are in the market. We anticipate the sale to close in 2020, and we expect to use the proceeds from this transaction for a mix of debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Since the merger closed, we have declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share and repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock. As the year progresses, we will continue to evaluate the use of excess cash for opportunistic share buybacks. 
In regard to M&A, we remain focused on our transformational ViacomCBS deal, and we'll only consider acquisitions that are accretive and tightly linked to our strategy. This disciplined approach is exemplified by our agreement to buy a 49% stake in MIRAMAX for $375 million, which gives us exclusive long-term distribution rights to MIRAMAX' catalog of 700 titles, including a number of award-winning films and will enable us to further maximize our programming library. 
So in summary, ViacomCBS is well positioned to grow for the long term. We are maximizing cash flow from our legacy businesses while driving growth in streaming and expanding our reach to new audiences. We now have an even stronger position in the pay TV landscape as well as in advertising, particularly in advanced advertising. 
And in 2020, we will begin to reap the returns from the investments we have already made, especially in film and our streaming offering. So as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, we will grow free cash flow, capitalize on the benefits of our combination and create value for shareholders. 
We are poised for a strong year in 2020, which will deliver growth across our unified company and set us up for consistently strong performance in the years to come. 
With that, we can open the line for questions."

So as you said, that's actually 2 part -- that makes a 3-part question. But let me take Showtime and then talk about the general question.

But let me take Showtime and then talk about the general question. 
Look, over the years, Showtime has made strong progress elevating its brand, deepening its original programming lineup, expanding its reach through OTT. That said, it was a working capital headwind for the company in '19. And the time is right to improve ROI by evolving that programming mix. 
To be clear, Showtime will continue to be an important home of scripted shows like Billions, Homeland, The L Word, Penny Dreadful. And the investments we made in 2019 will clearly pay dividends in 2020. At the same time, Showtime does have traction in other format, shows like Desus and Mero and Circus, and we see an opportunity to lean more in this direction. And there are new ViacomCBS assets to bring to the table, starting with RuPaul and with more to come. Also, Bellator's alignment is a natural fit with Showtime's combat sports positioning, and I believe a compelling value-creation opportunity in its own right. 
And the SHO*BET plex rebranding that we talked about, we think that's a home run in attracting incremental subs. So it's really a multifaceted approach to improving content ROI here. 
Beyond that, it is worth noting that there are some market dynamics in '20 which should be positive for Showtime. As you know, some competitors have lost key distributors. That should help Showtime take share, particularly in linear. As we mentioned, OTT momentum has been picking up, strong sub growth in the past 2 months. And slightly longer term, ViacomCBS' broader streaming strategy will be additive to Showtime subs over time as it introduces a new consumer funnel. So we're excited about the next leg of journey of this culture-defining brand, and we look forward to it growing its contribution to ViacomCBS. 
Now just quickly in terms of how we decide where to put the product. Let me start with a high-level reminder of what our strategy is and that's to maximize the value of our content by reaching the largest addressable audience. And that's across every segment of platform using our assets and others. 
There's 4 reasons why this is the right strategy for ViacomCBS: first, it makes the most of our greatest strength, which is our content engine and our place in the content industry, which is an industry that's growing; second, it allows us to build on our leadership positions across segments, including genres, demos, formats, while giving us new opportunities to grow brand, franchises and audience; third, it allows us access to the largest potential revenue pool, and that's key to balancing adjusted free cash flow delivery and asset value creation; and fourth, it gives us flexibility to adapt as the market and consumer habits continue to evolve. 
So how do we decide what goes where? Let me start with a key fact. The depth and strength of our talent base means we make must-watch content for all platforms. That said, we do have to decide where things go, and we have 3 filters that guide that. We look at financial impact, we look at strategic impact, and we take into account some partnership considerations. 
Now as you think about that, there's several other things I want you to keep in mind. That starts with where we have strength, whether it's a franchise, maybe Mission: Impossible or a genre like procedurals, you'll increasingly see us not license exclusively to third parties in the U.S. We do look at these things across the house, and we have a content council in place to help evaluate opportunities and make recommendations. And we look at every content decision as just one window in time. These are assets we own, and we expect to monetize them in different ways, in different places over time. 
Quickly, an example, Nickelodeon. You know it's the #1 kids brand, big hits like SpongeBob. The reality is our linear platform only reaches 40% of kids today, but we can reach beyond that. So what we're doing as an example with Nick is we're putting spin-offs of SpongeBob on Netflix. That will drive direct earnings, but also connect these characters with new fans, benefiting the franchise and related businesses like consumer products or future theatrical films. And ultimately, the IP reverts back because remember, it's a rental, not a sale. 
So look, we give a lot of thought to this. We feel great about our strategy, both specifically for Showtime and in general, and you'll see us deliver value in it in 2020 and beyond."

Look, I'm extremely excited about our domestic ad picture. Let me start by commenting on the market. As you know, it remains very strong, both in Q4, now in Q1. We're seeing scatter premiums in both broadcast and cable of 25% to 35% above u",380,"Sure, Jessica. Look, I'm extremely excited about our domestic ad picture. Let me start by commenting on the market. As you know, it remains very strong, both in Q4, now in Q1. We're seeing scatter premiums in both broadcast and cable of 25% to 35% above upfront. Broadly speaking, the issue remains supply, not demand. And related to that, we're also seeing strong and growing demand for premium digital video. 
Now if you look more at our performance, particularly in Q4, which I think is helpful to give you insight into where we see this going, overall, ad revenues, domestic ad avenues were flat. Now that's driven in part by the fact that there was not a lot of political ad spend in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of '18. That was a midterm election year. And of course, we have a little decline in impressions but very strong pricing. 
But the real thing to look at is domestic cable at 9% growth with Pluto. That is the strategy we've been pursuing over the last 1.5 years. It's a strategy of combining linear with our advanced marketing solutions. It's really resonating in the market. And as promised, it's delivering robust growth despite impression headwinds. It's allowing us to dramatically outperform all cable competitors. And it's worth noting that AMS is now almost 1/5 of our revenue in the quarter, including with CBS. So this is a real piece of business. 
Looking forward, it's why we're so excited about our position in the market as ViacomCBS. We are now the clear #1 leader. We're #1 on every demo in linear. And our AMS offering is even larger as we add CBS branded digital video, including CBS All Access, CBSN, which is growing super fast and more, which means our combined linear AMS cell, something we know how to bring to market, is even more robust. And as you pointed out, Jessica, our ad sales integration is moving very quickly. 
I'm thrilled with Jo Ann's leadership. John Halley is the COO, who knows the advanced ad space. I spent last weekend with the senior team. They are totally pumped and with a bunch of clients. And I'm confident we are going to be extremely well received in this next upfront."

And then second, on cable affiliates, in the fourth quarter, revenue was down about 8%. Can you break down for us a little bit of what the drivers were there?

And the fact that we have product in 2 of them, which is free and premium and very quickly, we'll get in the market with the third, rather the middle one, we think, makes a lot of sense. 
In terms of what we need to do, the reason we're so excited about this is it's not vaporware. We're building from a position of strength. As we said, we have about $1.6 billion in domestic streaming and digital ad revenue in '19. That's up 60% from 2018. We have MAUs at the end of '19 at 22 million, actually more than 22 million, and over 11 million domestic subs in pay. So that's a real foundation. And we're taking that, and we're building on the experience we already have. We have the benefit in terms of lesson learned in subscriber acquisition, in churn management. We understand what gets consumed in free and pay because we've been looking at it for a while. 
We're not launching something new, to your question on tech. We are working off of proven platforms and models, and we know how to work with partners, both in the traditional and OTT space. 
So when we look at our plan for 2020 and our guide of 30 million MAUs for Pluto domestically and approximately 16 million subs for our U.S. pay offerings with streaming and digital revenue growing 35% to 40%, we feel very good about that. And again, we're in the market today, and you're going to see us get deeper into the market as the year goes on. So make no mistake, ViacomCBS will be very much in this game."

You see that split in terms of linear television, where, as I said, our cash content spend is essentially flat 2019. But through grouping of networks, through shifting of mixes, we're going to get more effect in the side of that. And again, we have a proven team that's getting more responsibility in that space. So I feel very good about that. 
At the same time, we are prioritizing investments in places where there's clear growth. That's in streaming, that's in Paramount this year as we continue to ramp the slate of it and in the third-party studio business, which is a significant business with growth, essentially risk-free and long-term asset value. So that's how we're looking at it overall. 
And it's the combination, particularly managing the mature businesses much more tightly, that allows us for much more modest cash content expense growth as on a going-forward basis, certainly, '19 to '20 and then onward than you've seen in the last couple of years. So that's how we're thinking about it. Again, I look at the combined asset base of this company, we have more than enough resource base to work with, and we are absolutely going to get more out of it."

There's product that's making for its owned and operated network, in that case, CBS. And there's product that's making for third-party clients, which were a range of different clients. The expense growth in cash obviously covers both. 
As we look at it on the CBS network side, I think it is worth noting that in Q4 and continuing, #1 most watched network in prime, 5 of the top 10 programs, 5 of the top 6 freshman series. So the network continues to perform strongly. 
That said, I was with Nevins last week, and we were talking about CBS, and they're actually spending less on pilots this year because they feel very good about where the network is, and therefore, are able to be more prudent. At the same time, whether it's the CBS studio or the Paramount studio, we continue to have ramping demand in that third-party studio production business. Yes, that consumed some cash, certainly in '19, and it's a bit of a cash headwind in '20. But I want to reiterate, it's a different business. It's fundamentally profitable. It's low risk, and we do build long-term asset value. 
So on a cash basis, we are continuing to invest a bit in that, but it is really a separate business. So -- but rest assured, in general, we're looking at everything. 
We've talked about Showtime. We're looking at CBS. We're doing a lot of work on the linear cable side. And as we're doing all that, we see a lot of opportunity on the streaming side, and we are focused on improving content ROI and getting more out of this asset, and that is what we will deliver in 2020."

Wondering as you think about kind of the NFL negotiation that will play out this year, sort of are you prepared to do something that is ""uneconomic?"" 
Two, on Nickelodeon, I think your ratings were down somewhere around 20% last year. And it looked like it got a lot worse in Q4 and into early 2020 since the launch of Disney+. Just wondering kind of what could you tell us about kind of your plans for the Nickelodeon network? And that sort of ties into the Charlie Ergen question, which is DISH was pretty clear yesterday in their call that if your ratings are down sharply, they are going to look for reductions in rate or they're going to simply drop programming, which they've been doing at a more -- at an increasing rate. Just wondering kind of how you think about the negotiation with DISH, which I think is coming up pretty shortly. 
And then, Chris, I think on the question that somebody asked about cable affiliates being down 8%. You kind of talked about what was in the press release, but could you give some clarity of like what were subs down? What was the rate reset? Just adding some actual numbers to the decline would be helpful. I think that's what the follow-up was trying to ask."

As a combined company, ViacomCBS is even better positioned to deliver value to that franchise. You know the NFL values our broadcast reach and high-quality production. And you know that the combined company adds young adult reach, both linear and streaming as well as international capabilities, both of which are key to NFL development and thus, important to the league. We are going to do some stuff around the NFL in the months ahead as we prep for Super Bowl LV, leveraging our platform. That's obviously a February 21 event. And to be clear, as a combined company, we absolutely have the financial resources to get a deal done. And we do believe it's important to the company, and I feel good about getting a deal done. When it gets done? I don't know. We'll see. That's really more the NFL's call on timing. 
With respect to Nickelodeon, if I look at our domestic cable portfolio overall, we actually have pretty solid audience performance. 13 of our networks grew share in Q4, including Comedy, BET, Paramount Networks, Smithsonian. Actually, we see sequential improvement. Q1 to date, the whole portfolio is up about 4%. 
Nickelodeon continues to be a work in progress. It is far and away #1 in the space. But that is also why -- and we do feel good about the slate of shows coming, but we have pivoted to a multi-platform variant of Nickelodeon as part of building that brand for the future. That combines what we're doing in the linear network, what we're doing in our, call it, over-the-top space, what we're doing with third parties and then how we're monetizing that broader audience, including through things like consumer products, and for that matter, film. 
So we are really attacking the Nickelodeon opportunity in a multifaceted way. I feel good about the progress Brian Robbins and his team are making, I feel good about the partnership with Paramount, with the next SpongeBob movie coming in Q2. By the way, we did a preview of that movie, SpongeBob Out of Water (sic) [ Sponge Out of Water ], last weekend, and people are feeling very good about the film. Obviously, the Nick Network and our consumer products team are totally behind it. So Nick has a bright future. 
And finally, I'd say back to the streaming discussion in our broader pay product, that's a House of Brands. Nickelodeon is going to feature prominently in that. That's going to be good for the streaming product, and it's going to be good for the Nickelodeon brand. 
Largely, I'm not going to comment on any particular renewals other than to say we have a track record of getting deals done. We have a stronger portfolio than ever, including levers we haven't pulled with some of our clients. And therefore, I feel good about our position."

So Q1, we are going to see some more of the affiliate headwinds we've experienced. We also will have some timing of licensing considerations. And we do, as I alluded to earlier, have some big shows in Q1 like Star Trek: Picard and Homeland that are strongly performing for streaming in Q1. But then as we go toward Q2, we'll have the licensing delivery of South Park, and momentum will build from there. So again, we'll see the full power of ViacomCBS in 2020 and beyond.

So look, if you look at the U.S. affiliate landscape, there's no question that ViacomCBS is among if not the most important supplier to linear. Remember, we are #1 on every demographic in linear. We have must-see content in news, in sports, in entertainment. And we have a model that gets deals done, including having a range of partnership levers, whether that's in advanced ad sales, doing more and more working with them in the broadband space. We started that with Pluto and Comcast, just did that with All Access, set-top box too. So we have a lot to work with there. There may be winners and losers in this space, but we feel good about taking share and getting deals done. And again, you will see that track out in the year. We've already had a positive experience with one very large MVPD, who's not a walk in the park to negotiate with. 
On to streaming. Two things I'd say in relation to your question. One is, remember, we are in this business today, both in free and in the various pay segments. We have been putting original content. You look at what All Access did with Picard. So it's not like we're ramping from nowhere. In fact, we're building momentum and in particularly, as we do that, and this is definitely true on the Pluto side, remember, Pluto is very capital efficient. That is essentially a rev share model, not a invest in content and build it out. So as we launch in places like Latin America, you don't have this big working capital headwind. You have a model that scales with the business. 
So I'm very excited about our streaming plan. The financials are absolutely built into the guidance, and the incremental capital is modest certainly by standards of what some other folks are doing. 
And with that, we're kind of running a little over. So I want to thank you for your questions. 
In closing, we couldn't be more excited about the road ahead, one where we will continue to unlock the power of this incredible combination, capitalizing on our position as one of the largest content producers and providers in the world, we believe, becoming the most important partner in the media ecosystem, creating valuable new businesses. We have the assets. We have the plan. We have the team. We will execute and we will deliver for you. As we do, know that we're 100% share -- focused on shareholder value creation. We're committed to providing the transparency and disclosure you need to understand and track the value we're creating.

It's been less than 3 months since we completed our merger, and I'm pleased to say we're making significant progress integrating and transforming ViacomCBS as we move quickl",2608,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the first ViacomCBS earnings call. It's been less than 3 months since we completed our merger, and I'm pleased to say we're making significant progress integrating and transforming ViacomCBS as we move quickly to unlock the full power of this now unified company. This includes organizationally, where we've built a best-in-class management team and consolidated structure; operationally, as we've started executing as a combined entity in a meaningful way, including through sales force consolidation or streamlined groupings of networks as well as integration of digital assets and capabilities; and financially, where cost synergies are already being realized, and our target is being increased from $500 million to $750 million in annualized run rate cost savings. 
Importantly, this progress is not reflected in Q4, which, given the timing of our close, is a transitional one and overwhelmingly reflects 2 separate companies executing on separate strategies. Chris will cover our Q4 and full year results in detail, but let me highlight a few things. 
First, there are, as you'd expect, a significant set of merger-related items that were a headwind for expenses and cash flow. Second, at the operating level from a revenue perspective, certain lines reflect the impact of challenges that will be mitigated in the combined company. Affiliate is an example here while others, such as ad sales, provide insights into the potential of the company to perform more strongly as we extend capabilities across the portfolio. Lastly, our operating results reflect the impact of legacy content investment decisions at some business units. As I will explain in a few minutes, here we are evolving our strategy to significantly improve content ROI and free cash flow. 
I'd now like to discuss our strategic vision and priorities for ViacomCBS and what we're going to deliver in 2020, a year where we anticipate delivering revenue growth in the mid-single digits, adjusted OIBDA of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion, and free cash flow, excluding integration costs, to achieve of $1.8 billion to $2 billion for 2020 with an additional $500 million in free cash flow benefit in 2021. 
Let's start at the top. ViacomCBS is one of the largest content producers and providers in the world. And that is an incredibly exciting and valuable place to be at a time when both consumer and commercial demand for premium content is only growing. We have an unrivaled ability to create value through the media ecosystem and to serve the largest addressable audience globally. We do this by operating our own platforms and by supplying others. 
Taken together, we believe ViacomCBS can be the most important content partner in the industry. Why? Because first and foremost, we have and make an incredible volume of content through our globe-spanning production capabilities, depth of IP ownership and talent relationships and underpinned by our library of more than 140,000 television episodes and 3,600 film titles, all continually refreshed and grown by over $13 billion annual cash content investment. 
In fact, we make content across every genre and format, including news, sports and entertainment, both scripted and unscripted. And our television reach extends across 4.7 billion cumulative homes in over 180 countries. 
And we don't just make content. We make hits as evidenced by our #1 positions across broadcast and cable viewing in all key audience demographics and our #2 ranking in tubular social media video views in the media and entertainment category, another clear indicator of the power and appeal of our IP. 
We also have the ability and flexibility to monetize all this content in a variety of models across both owned and third-party platforms, which we believe is a distinct and important competitive advantage. And by serving the largest addressable audience across every segment and platform, we're aggressively creating new opportunities to bring our brands and IP to more audiences, extend franchises and grow revenue streams. 
Now let's talk more specifically about our 3 priorities for 2020: first, maximize the power of our content; second, unlock more value from our biggest revenue lines; and third, accelerate our momentum in streaming. 
First, content. Our content strategy isn't about spending more. It's about better aligning the combined company spending with growth potential and maximizing the value of our content, IP and franchises across our now larger asset base. That means putting the full power of the company behind our biggest priorities. This includes the massive promotional platform that we can exploit for our own benefit. 
Our leadership on and off linear TV, including the largest broadcast footprint in the world and more than 1.5 billion social fans and followers, provides an incredible opportunity to maximize the impact of our biggest priorities from franchises to football, a platform we look forward to deploying, including in support of Super Bowl LV taking place next February. 
But it's more than promotional impact. It also includes focusing on global cross-company franchise management to get the most out of our powerful IP across our brands and platforms. Take Star Trek as an example, a globally enduring franchise that we will make even bigger. On the heels of Picard on CBS All Access, which broke all records for total streams and subscriber sign-ups, we're now taking the Star Trek franchise and extending it across the house. Building on Discovery and Picard, we now have 2 additional series in production at All Access and Nickelodeon and 2 more series in development, plus a series of Picard novels being rolled out at Simon & Schuster and a highly anticipated new Star Trek feature at Paramount. 
Very importantly, we're also maximizing the power of our content by applying more rigor to managing our content mix, investment and returns. In fact, we see this as a significant opportunity to improve some of the cash softness you saw in Q4 and full year 2019. 
In 2020, that means prioritizing content investment in streaming and studio production, both of which are growth areas. At the same time, our linear TV content spend levels will remain consistent with last year, and effectiveness will increase as we shift the mix within networks and increase cross-company utilization to improve ROI. 
To demonstrate this strategy at work, I'd like to focus on Showtime, a powerful and important brand with culture-defining hits, but a business that consumed significant working capital in 2019. Make no mistake, high-end scripted programming enhanced by Billions, Shameless and Homeland will continue to be a key pillar of the brand. But by shifting some of the content mix, including through new uses of ViacomCBS brands, we can attract subscribers in a more cost effective way. 
Take VH1's RuPaul's Drag Race, for example. With a large and loyal following, we believe this franchise will be additive to Showtime subscriber dynamic, which is why we will air a special new season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars on Showtime on a first-window basis. We're also confident this move will further improve the already strong ROI of this franchise. And we see an even bigger opportunity to grow Showtime subs by making better use of its plex channels, some of which are currently underutilized. 
To that end, we will be rebranding and relaunching Showcase as SHO*BET this summer, featuring African-American scripted series from Showtime and BET as well as popular movies and specials. We see this as a compelling value-creation play that will allow us to benefit from the growing demand for premium African-American content across platforms. 
This brings me to our second strategic priority for 2020, unlocking more value from our biggest revenue lines. With the expanded ViacomCBS asset base, we see a significant opportunity to drive growth of our own platforms, benefiting affiliate and ad revenue. This larger asset base, combined with the licensing pullback of some of our competitors, also sets the stage for growth in our content licensing and studio production businesses. 
Take distribution. ViacomCBS, with leading broadcast and entertainment brands and strength in live local news and sports, is a must-have for any distributor. And by working with partners to deepen and extend our relationships through advanced advertising, broadband products and more, we can continue to grow share, a strategy that will drive growth in the face of macro trends within the industry. 
In fact, we've already seen the benefit of our combined portfolio with the recent renewal of our carriage agreement with Comcast, which, by the way, brings CBS All Access to set-top boxes for the first time. And it's not just TV. With a diverse and growing theatrical slate from Paramount, we are critical to theaters and the broader film distribution ecosystem too. Q4 may have been soft for Paramount, but it came after 8 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement. 
 
And just look at the huge opening of our current film Sonic, which did approximately $70 million last weekend in the U.S. and Canada alone, and became the biggest opening ever for a video game adaptation. And we couldn't be more excited for Q2's upcoming and highly anticipated titles, including A Quiet Place Part II, Top Gun: Maverick and the next SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run. 
So ViacomCBS is a must-have partner for all types of distributors. No question. 
We're also a must-buy for advertisers. Our leadership in U.S. reach across linear and digital combined is clear. Our advanced advertising capabilities continue to scale. They are in high demand and were a key driver of our domestic cable networks ad growth in Q4 and 2019. 
Among other things, this sets us up for a strong upfront, especially as we apply Viacom's advanced ad business across CBS' massive audience reach and as we continue to expand our premium digital video inventory, which is already amongst the largest in the industry. 
In content licensing too, ViacomCBS is a critical partner. I mentioned before, the extensive library of IP we now have. And importantly, with a single content licensing sales force now in place, we can extract incremental benefit through the packaging of film and television, tailoring offerings to better meet client needs, helping take share while simultaneously being able to support our owned and operated platforms in both linear and streaming. 
In content licensing, we're also focused on continuing to unlock the value of our quickly scaling third-party studio production business. While there are some working capital headwinds in this business in 2020, this is a fundamentally profitable business that we expect to deliver $1.3 billion in revenue for the year with double-digit margins and virtually no risk. 
It also allows key franchises to reach more consumers and serves as a component of a multi-faceted franchise development and growth strategy. And since most of this business is essentially a rental model versus a sale, it also enables us to grow our content and IP library for the long term in an economically efficient way, which means we're also building asset value. Put it all together, and you'll begin to see why we believe ViacomCBS can become the most important content partner in the media ecosystem. 
Finally, our third strategic priority for 2020 is to accelerate our momentum in streaming. Let me explain how we're approaching the opportunities in the space. Very importantly, it starts with building on the unique and strong foundation we already have in streaming. 
In ad supported, we have the leading free streaming TV service in Pluto TV, with over 22 million monthly active users in the U.S., up 75% year-over-year. And we expect to exit 2020 with approximately 30 million MAUs domestically. 
In pay, our subscription offerings account for more than 11 million domestic subscribers, up 50% year-on-year. And we expect this to grow to approximately 16 million subscribers as we exit 2020. The growth we've achieved so far is overwhelmingly in the U.S., but we're making early strides to expand internationally. Pluto is already in the U.K., Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and it's launching in Latin America next month. 
On the pay side, All Access is available in Canada and Australia, and our Paramount Plus and Noggin products are also live in numerous territories. But our streaming foundation is not just usage, it's also financial. In 2019, our domestic streaming and digital video business, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, had approximately $1.6 billion in revenue. We see this as a key metric for ViacomCBS and anticipate it growing between 35% and 40% this year with relatively modest incremental operating expenses. 
Of course, the opportunity is much, much larger. And in pursuing that opportunity, ViacomCBS will take a differentiated approach that builds on our running start, plays to our strength and fulfills unmet audience and partner needs. 
Our going-forward approach to streaming is rooted in the belief that the streaming world will evolve similarly to the linear world. That means it will have free, broad pay and premium pay segments. And just like in the linear world, we'll have streaming product for each. By having robust offerings in each segment, we will also have the ability to migrate consumers across them through promotion and bundling, which creates advantages in subscriber acquisition, retention and lifetime value. 
Our free offering is Pluto TV, and our premium pay offering is Showtime OTT. To complete our portfolio, we will take CBS All Access and expand it to be a robust and compelling offering to serve the broad pay streaming segment. This offer will reaffirm and expand the value of entertainment, news and sports content through on demand and live experiences for audiences around the world, built on the foundation of CBS All Access, including the technology, content and subscriber base, adding substantial content assets in film and television, plus the power of world renowned brands to create, in effect, a combined House of Brands product. 
More specifically, we will add significant content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, BET and Smithsonian, in addition to popular films from the Paramount library, and we will do this at scale to the tune of approximately 30,000 episodes of TV and up to 1,000 movies. This differentiated offering will provide the powerful combination of live linear via over 200 local CBS stations plus on-demand content spanning news, sports, films, drama, reality, kids and more with a global platform and infrastructure from which to market and scale it. 
Importantly, know that we have designed this offering to be compatible with the evolving distribution landscape. We see it as a value-creating opportunity to further broaden our partnerships with traditional distributors akin to our recent Comcast relationship expansion to CBS All Access. And we also see it as a robust offering for distributors in the broader OTT space, including mobile. Obviously, we'll be sharing much more information in the months ahead, but we're already hard at work across tech, content, branding, marketing and more to bring this evolved product to life, and we will soft launch the product later this year. 
As we execute on each of our priorities for 2020, maximizing the power of our content, unlocking new value from our biggest revenue lines and accelerating our momentum in streaming, we are positioning ViacomCBS to deliver significant shareholder value. At the same time, we're making nonoperating moves to unlock meaningful value. These include the divestiture of noncore assets like the sale of Black Rock, which we are in the market with as we speak, in addition to other opportunities we're currently evaluating. The proceeds of these transactions will be used to delever our balance sheet, buy back stock and further strengthen the financial position of the company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to report on our fourth quarter and full year results and to provide detailed 2020 guidance."

It's great to be here for our first ViacomCBS earnings call. 
As you know, our merger was effective December 4. So our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results largely reflect what Viacom and CBS would have delivered as a separate company. 2020 will express the power of our combination with some of the greatest assets in media and an efficient growth strategy underway, we are strongly equipped to capitalize on our position as a preeminent global content company. And by maximizing free cash flow from our traditional businesses while prudently investing in our growth areas, we will create long-term value for our shareholders and our stakeholders. 
First, I'm going to outline our reporting segments and key revenue types. Then I will give you more details about our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Finally, I will provide further context about our 2020 guidance and capital allocation strategy. 
As you can see in our earnings presentation, ViacomCBS comprises 4 business segments: TV Entertainment, Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment and Publishing. We are also presenting 5 key revenue types: advertising, affiliate, content licensing, theatrical and publishing. And we are providing a breakdown of revenue by type within each of our business segments. 
In addition, given the increased prominence of our streaming services, we are giving greater visibility into their performance by providing domestic revenue, subscribers and monthly active users for our fast-growing streaming and digital video business. 
Now let me give you more details about our fourth quarter results. Q4 of 2019 was a transitional quarter. As a result, we had several merger-related adjustments. They include $589 million in programming charges, resulting from an evaluation by new management of our content strategies for the now combined company; $268 million in restructuring charges related to our synergy initiatives; and $191 million in other merger-related costs. 
In addition, our fourth quarter operating results were primarily affected by several items, including declines in the pay TV universe and legacy Viacom rate resets, lower political spending following our record results in 2018, investments in programming and the timing of content licensing sales. Importantly, as Bob mentioned, we believe these areas of impact will be substantially mitigated in the combined company as we evolve our strategy to benefit from our collective asset base. 
We also delivered growth in a number of key areas during the fourth quarter. Affiliate revenue increased 1% despite declines in the pay TV landscape. The growth was driven by retrans and reverse comp, which was up 25% and our subscription streaming revenue, which included a record quarter for subscriber growth at CBS All Access and a record month in December for streaming sign-ups at Showtime. 
At the same time, our domestic Cable Networks advertising revenue was up a strong 9%, benefiting from Pluto, which is an integral part of our advanced advertising offering. So you can see the advantages of our streaming strategy across our company as these services continue to scale. 
On a full year basis, our 2019 revenue showed healthy gains. We delivered total revenue growth of 2% with increases in advertising, affiliate and content licensing. 
Advertising was up 2%, driven by CBS' broadcast of Super Bowl LIII and the NCAA Final Four and championship game as well as strong growth in digital advertising, led by Pluto and CBS All Access. This growth was somewhat offset by FX headwinds as well as lower political advertising. 
Affiliate revenue grew 3%, benefiting from a 20% increase in retrans and reverse comp as well as strong growth in subscription streaming revenue, which offset linear declines in the pay TV ecosystem. And content licensing was up 5%, driven by growth in production for third-party streaming platform from our CBS and Paramount television studios as well as the licensing of our library programming. 
In addition, our domestic streaming and digital video revenue in 2019, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, increased approximately 60% to $1.6 billion with growth across Pluto, CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Our solid end-of-year performance across these 3 key services is a strong starting point for 2020 and provides the necessary momentum to scale the future growth of these businesses. 
Turning to free cash flow. Our 2019 adjusted free cash flow was $1.24 billion, which excludes $366 million of restructuring and merger-related payments. These results were affected by higher content investments across our businesses, including more original series produced for our own platform as well as for third parties and the expansion of our film fleet. 
In addition, we had higher cash taxes of $437 million in 2019, including $260 million that was driven by tax regulations finalized in 2019 and the absence of a cash tax benefit that we had in 2018. 
Now let me go into more detail about our 2020 outlook. As you heard, in our first full year as ViacomCBS, we expect to grow across key metrics with total revenue up mid-single digits, adjusted OIBDA in the range of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.15 to $5.50. 
Our 2020 outlook also assumes the realization of about $250 million of our $750 million of cost synergy target before consideration of onetime costs to achieve them. Our new target came after 5 months of detailed work on our integration program. We now see that we will achieve more than the $500 million that we identified during our due diligence period from incremental opportunities across areas where Viacom and CBS have the most overlap, namely duplicative organizational areas, vendor sourcing and, to a lesser extent, real estate consolidation. 
We expect to achieve our cost synergy target over 3 years, with an incremental $350 million in 2021 and the balance of $150 million to be substantially realized in 2022. 
For 2020 adjusted free cash flow, we have line of sight to significant improvement, which will enable us to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. The growth in free cash flow will be fueled by the key revenue drivers we see this year, including retrans and reverse comp as well as political advertising from the presidential election. 
We will also drive free cash flow by strategically reprioritizing our content spending to high growth areas across our businesses, which will substantially improve our working capital. And we anticipate a cash benefit of approximately $200 million from the $250 million in cost synergies that we expect to deliver this year. 
In 2021, there are several items that will drive approximately $500 million of additional free cash flow. They include the tailwind from continued strategy-driven working capital improvements, further realization of merger integration synergies and the benefit of having the Super Bowl, partly offset by the absence of political. 
Now let me give you more detail on our 2020 revenue drivers. We expect to deliver increases across all 4 of our segments and all 5 of our revenue types in 2020. 
In advertising, excluding the Super Bowl and political spending, we anticipate domestic advertising revenue to grow in the low single digits as we go-to-market with expansive U.S. reach across linear and digital platforms, scaled advanced advertising and ease of buying across our portfolio. In addition, political spending is shaping up to be a record, which will further lift our results.
In affiliate, we expect our domestic revenue to grow in the low single digits as we go-to-market with our unified broadcast and cable portfolio. We see continued strength in retrans, reverse comp and our subscription streaming services on a combined basis, which will more than offset pay TV pressures. 
In content licensing, 2020 is shaping up to be a good year. We will benefit from our deal to license South Park, and we will see more opportunities to leverage our vast library, bundle our film and TV programming for domestic and international licensing and ramp up production for third parties, backed by the growing capabilities of our studios as others pull back from the marketplace, leading to greater demand for premium content. 
In theatrical, we're thrilled with Sonic, and we feel great about our upcoming expanded film slate. 
And in Publishing, we have a strong lineup of titles from best selling and big name authors, including Stephen King, Jerry Seinfeld and Ruth Ware. 
Looking at metrics beyond our reported financials, we are guiding on domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which we expect to increase by 35% to 40% in 2020 off a base of $1.6 billion in 2019. This assumes domestic streaming subscribers reach approximately 16 million and domestic Pluto MAUs reach approximately 30 million by the end of the year. 
It is important to review our 2020 quarterly cadence. This year's first quarter will be compared against last year's results, which included the Super Bowl. In the second quarter, we will realize the licensing revenue for South Park. In the third quarter, affiliate renewals that we've already completed will take effect, which will give a lift to our revenue. And in the fourth quarter, we anticipate we will have what is already looking to be a record performance for political advertising. 
Turning to capital allocation. We ended 2019 with $18.7 billion of debt. When you take into account the $750 million of full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3x. Excluding the synergies, it was 3.4x. 
Looking forward, we remain committed to our investment grade rating with a target of achieving a leverage ratio of 2.75x taking these synergies into account. 
As Bob noted, we continue to make progress on the sale of Black Rock. We have completed the initial preparation work with CBRE and are in the market. We anticipate the sale to close in 2020, and we expect to use the proceeds from this transaction for a mix of debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Since the merger closed, we have declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share and repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock. As the year progresses, we will continue to evaluate the use of excess cash for opportunistic share buybacks. 
In regard to M&A, we remain focused on our transformational ViacomCBS deal, and we'll only consider acquisitions that are accretive and tightly linked to our strategy. This disciplined approach is exemplified by our agreement to buy a 49% stake in MIRAMAX for $375 million, which gives us exclusive long-term distribution rights to MIRAMAX' catalog of 700 titles, including a number of award-winning films and will enable us to further maximize our programming library. 
So in summary, ViacomCBS is well positioned to grow for the long term. We are maximizing cash flow from our legacy businesses while driving growth in streaming and expanding our reach to new audiences. We now have an even stronger position in the pay TV landscape as well as in advertising, particularly in advanced advertising. 
And in 2020, we will begin to reap the returns from the investments we have already made, especially in film and our streaming offering. So as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, we will grow free cash flow, capitalize on the benefits of our combination and create value for shareholders. 
We are poised for a strong year in 2020, which will deliver growth across our unified company and set us up for consistently strong performance in the years to come. 
With that, we can open the line for questions."

So as you said, that's actually 2 part -- that makes a 3-part question. But let me take Showtime and then talk about the general question.

But let me take Showtime and then talk about the general question. 
Look, over the years, Showtime has made strong progress elevating its brand, deepening its original programming lineup, expanding its reach through OTT. That said, it was a working capital headwind for the company in '19. And the time is right to improve ROI by evolving that programming mix. 
To be clear, Showtime will continue to be an important home of scripted shows like Billions, Homeland, The L Word, Penny Dreadful. And the investments we made in 2019 will clearly pay dividends in 2020. At the same time, Showtime does have traction in other format, shows like Desus and Mero and Circus, and we see an opportunity to lean more in this direction. And there are new ViacomCBS assets to bring to the table, starting with RuPaul and with more to come. Also, Bellator's alignment is a natural fit with Showtime's combat sports positioning, and I believe a compelling value-creation opportunity in its own right. 
And the SHO*BET plex rebranding that we talked about, we think that's a home run in attracting incremental subs. So it's really a multifaceted approach to improving content ROI here. 
Beyond that, it is worth noting that there are some market dynamics in '20 which should be positive for Showtime. As you know, some competitors have lost key distributors. That should help Showtime take share, particularly in linear. As we mentioned, OTT momentum has been picking up, strong sub growth in the past 2 months. And slightly longer term, ViacomCBS' broader streaming strategy will be additive to Showtime subs over time as it introduces a new consumer funnel. So we're excited about the next leg of journey of this culture-defining brand, and we look forward to it growing its contribution to ViacomCBS. 
Now just quickly in terms of how we decide where to put the product. Let me start with a high-level reminder of what our strategy is and that's to maximize the value of our content by reaching the largest addressable audience. And that's across every segment of platform using our assets and others. 
There's 4 reasons why this is the right strategy for ViacomCBS: first, it makes the most of our greatest strength, which is our content engine and our place in the content industry, which is an industry that's growing; second, it allows us to build on our leadership positions across segments, including genres, demos, formats, while giving us new opportunities to grow brand, franchises and audience; third, it allows us access to the largest potential revenue pool, and that's key to balancing adjusted free cash flow delivery and asset value creation; and fourth, it gives us flexibility to adapt as the market and consumer habits continue to evolve. 
So how do we decide what goes where? Let me start with a key fact. The depth and strength of our talent base means we make must-watch content for all platforms. That said, we do have to decide where things go, and we have 3 filters that guide that. We look at financial impact, we look at strategic impact, and we take into account some partnership considerations. 
Now as you think about that, there's several other things I want you to keep in mind. That starts with where we have strength, whether it's a franchise, maybe Mission: Impossible or a genre like procedurals, you'll increasingly see us not license exclusively to third parties in the U.S. We do look at these things across the house, and we have a content council in place to help evaluate opportunities and make recommendations. And we look at every content decision as just one window in time. These are assets we own, and we expect to monetize them in different ways, in different places over time. 
Quickly, an example, Nickelodeon. You know it's the #1 kids brand, big hits like SpongeBob. The reality is our linear platform only reaches 40% of kids today, but we can reach beyond that. So what we're doing as an example with Nick is we're putting spin-offs of SpongeBob on Netflix. That will drive direct earnings, but also connect these characters with new fans, benefiting the franchise and related businesses like consumer products or future theatrical films. And ultimately, the IP reverts back because remember, it's a rental, not a sale. 
So look, we give a lot of thought to this. We feel great about our strategy, both specifically for Showtime and in general, and you'll see us deliver value in it in 2020 and beyond."

Look, I'm extremely excited about our domestic ad picture. Let me start by commenting on the market. As you know, it remains very strong, both in Q4, now in Q1. We're seeing scatter premiums in both broadcast and cable of 25% to 35% above u",380,"Sure, Jessica. Look, I'm extremely excited about our domestic ad picture. Let me start by commenting on the market. As you know, it remains very strong, both in Q4, now in Q1. We're seeing scatter premiums in both broadcast and cable of 25% to 35% above upfront. Broadly speaking, the issue remains supply, not demand. And related to that, we're also seeing strong and growing demand for premium digital video. 
Now if you look more at our performance, particularly in Q4, which I think is helpful to give you insight into where we see this going, overall, ad revenues, domestic ad avenues were flat. Now that's driven in part by the fact that there was not a lot of political ad spend in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of '18. That was a midterm election year. And of course, we have a little decline in impressions but very strong pricing. 
But the real thing to look at is domestic cable at 9% growth with Pluto. That is the strategy we've been pursuing over the last 1.5 years. It's a strategy of combining linear with our advanced marketing solutions. It's really resonating in the market. And as promised, it's delivering robust growth despite impression headwinds. It's allowing us to dramatically outperform all cable competitors. And it's worth noting that AMS is now almost 1/5 of our revenue in the quarter, including with CBS. So this is a real piece of business. 
Looking forward, it's why we're so excited about our position in the market as ViacomCBS. We are now the clear #1 leader. We're #1 on every demo in linear. And our AMS offering is even larger as we add CBS branded digital video, including CBS All Access, CBSN, which is growing super fast and more, which means our combined linear AMS cell, something we know how to bring to market, is even more robust. And as you pointed out, Jessica, our ad sales integration is moving very quickly. 
I'm thrilled with Jo Ann's leadership. John Halley is the COO, who knows the advanced ad space. I spent last weekend with the senior team. They are totally pumped and with a bunch of clients. And I'm confident we are going to be extremely well received in this next upfront."

In terms of what we need to do, the reason we're so excited about this is it's not vaporware. We're building from a position of strength. As we said, we have about $1.6 billion in domestic streaming and digital ad revenue in '19. That's up 60% from 2018. We have MAUs at the end of '19 at 22 million, actually more than 22 million, and over 11 million domestic subs in pay. So that's a real foundation. And we're taking that, and we're building on the experience we already have. We have the benefit in terms of lesson learned in subscriber acquisition, in churn management. We understand what gets consumed in free and pay because we've been looking at it for a while. 
We're not launching something new, to your question on tech. We are working off of proven platforms and models, and we know how to work with partners, both in the traditional and OTT space. 
So when we look at our plan for 2020 and our guide of 30 million MAUs for Pluto domestically and approximately 16 million subs for our U.S. pay offerings with streaming and digital revenue growing 35% to 40%, we feel very good about that. And again, we're in the market today, and you're going to see us get deeper into the market as the year goes on. So make no mistake, ViacomCBS will be very much in this game."

I'm not sure if that's exactly right, but it was up a lot. I know you're talking about reallocating, reprioritizing, maximizing content ROI. But can you just help us understand if you look at the entire company over a multiyear period, what is the right level of investment growth you think the business needs to achieve your goal? So I think that would help the market understand sort of where the longer-term cash flow opportunity is in the business."

So our strategy is about taking advantage of this now larger portfolio of assets to improve content ROI and ensure that we're investing against growth opportunities and maximizing share and margins in more mature businesses. You see that split in terms of linear television, where, as I said, our cash content spend is essentially flat 2019. But through grouping of networks, through shifting of mixes, we're going to get more effect in the side of that. And again, we have a proven team that's getting more responsibility in that space. So I feel very good about that. 
At the same time, we are prioritizing investments in places where there's clear growth. That's in streaming, that's in Paramount this year as we continue to ramp the slate of it and in the third-party studio business, which is a significant business with growth, essentially risk-free and long-term asset value. So that's how we're looking at it overall. 
And it's the combination, particularly managing the mature businesses much more tightly, that allows us for much more modest cash content expense growth as on a going-forward basis, certainly, '19 to '20 and then onward than you've seen in the last couple of years. So that's how we're thinking about it. Again, I look at the combined asset base of this company, we have more than enough resource base to work with, and we are absolutely going to get more out of it."

There's product that's making for its owned and operated network, in that case, CBS. And there's product that's making for third-party clients, which were a range of different clients. The expense growth in cash obviously covers both. 
As we look at it on the CBS network side, I think it is worth noting that in Q4 and continuing, #1 most watched network in prime, 5 of the top 10 programs, 5 of the top 6 freshman series. So the network continues to perform strongly. 
That said, I was with Nevins last week, and we were talking about CBS, and they're actually spending less on pilots this year because they feel very good about where the network is, and therefore, are able to be more prudent. At the same time, whether it's the CBS studio or the Paramount studio, we continue to have ramping demand in that third-party studio production business. Yes, that consumed some cash, certainly in '19, and it's a bit of a cash headwind in '20. But I want to reiterate, it's a different business. It's fundamentally profitable. It's low risk, and we do build long-term asset value. 
So on a cash basis, we are continuing to invest a bit in that, but it is really a separate business. So -- but rest assured, in general, we're looking at everything. 
We've talked about Showtime. We're looking at CBS. We're doing a lot of work on the linear cable side. And as we're doing all that, we see a lot of opportunity on the streaming side, and we are focused on improving content ROI and getting more out of this asset, and that is what we will deliver in 2020."

Two, on Nickelodeon, I think your ratings were down somewhere around 20% last year. And it looked like it got a lot worse in Q4 and into early 2020 since the launch of Disney+. Just wondering kind of what could you tell us about kind of your plans for the Nickelodeon network? And that sort of ties into the Charlie Ergen question, which is DISH was pretty clear yesterday in their call that if your ratings are down sharply, they are going to look for reductions in rate or they're going to simply drop programming, which they've been doing at a more -- at an increasing rate. Just wondering kind of how you think about the negotiation with DISH, which I think is coming up pretty shortly. 
And then, Chris, I think on the question that somebody asked about cable affiliates being down 8%. You kind of talked about what was in the press release, but could you give some clarity of like what were subs down? What was the rate reset? Just adding some actual numbers to the decline would be helpful. I think that's what the follow-up was trying to ask."

As a combined company, ViacomCBS is even better positioned to deliver value to that franchise. You know the NFL values our broadcast reach and high-quality production. And you know that the combined company adds young adult reach, both linear and streaming as well as international capabilities, both of which are key to NFL development and thus, important to the league. We are going to do some stuff around the NFL in the months ahead as we prep for Super Bowl LV, leveraging our platform. That's obviously a February 21 event. And to be clear, as a combined company, we absolutely have the financial resources to get a deal done. And we do believe it's important to the company, and I feel good about getting a deal done. When it gets done? I don't know. We'll see. That's really more the NFL's call on timing. 
With respect to Nickelodeon, if I look at our domestic cable portfolio overall, we actually have pretty solid audience performance. 13 of our networks grew share in Q4, including Comedy, BET, Paramount Networks, Smithsonian. Actually, we see sequential improvement. Q1 to date, the whole portfolio is up about 4%. 
Nickelodeon continues to be a work in progress. It is far and away #1 in the space. But that is also why -- and we do feel good about the slate of shows coming, but we have pivoted to a multi-platform variant of Nickelodeon as part of building that brand for the future. That combines what we're doing in the linear network, what we're doing in our, call it, over-the-top space, what we're doing with third parties and then how we're monetizing that broader audience, including through things like consumer products, and for that matter, film. 
So we are really attacking the Nickelodeon opportunity in a multifaceted way. I feel good about the progress Brian Robbins and his team are making, I feel good about the partnership with Paramount, with the next SpongeBob movie coming in Q2. By the way, we did a preview of that movie, SpongeBob Out of Water (sic) [ Sponge Out of Water ], last weekend, and people are feeling very good about the film. Obviously, the Nick Network and our consumer products team are totally behind it. So Nick has a bright future. 
And finally, I'd say back to the streaming discussion in our broader pay product, that's a House of Brands. Nickelodeon is going to feature prominently in that. That's going to be good for the streaming product, and it's going to be good for the Nickelodeon brand. 
Largely, I'm not going to comment on any particular renewals other than to say we have a track record of getting deals done. We have a stronger portfolio than ever, including levers we haven't pulled with some of our clients. And therefore, I feel good about our position."

But when we look at how our quarters will build, Q4, we had a tough quarter. As we head into Q1 and we think through Q2, our momentum will build. So Q1, we are going to see some more of the affiliate headwinds we've experienced. We also will have some timing of licensing considerations. And we do, as I alluded to earlier, have some big shows in Q1 like Star Trek: Picard and Homeland that are strongly performing for streaming in Q1. But then as we go toward Q2, we'll have the licensing delivery of South Park, and momentum will build from there. So again, we'll see the full power of ViacomCBS in 2020 and beyond.

So look, if you look at the U.S. affiliate landscape, there's no question that ViacomCBS is among if not the most important supplier to linear. Remember, we are #1 on every demographic in linear. We have must-see content in news, in sports, in entertainment. And we have a model that gets deals done, including having a range of partnership levers, whether that's in advanced ad sales, doing more and more working with them in the broadband space. We started that with Pluto and Comcast, just did that with All Access, set-top box too. So we have a lot to work with there. There may be winners and losers in this space, but we feel good about taking share and getting deals done. And again, you will see that track out in the year. We've already had a positive experience with one very large MVPD, who's not a walk in the park to negotiate with. 
On to streaming. Two things I'd say in relation to your question. One is, remember, we are in this business today, both in free and in the various pay segments. We have been putting original content. You look at what All Access did with Picard. So it's not like we're ramping from nowhere. In fact, we're building momentum and in particularly, as we do that, and this is definitely true on the Pluto side, remember, Pluto is very capital efficient. That is essentially a rev share model, not a invest in content and build it out. So as we launch in places like Latin America, you don't have this big working capital headwind. You have a model that scales with the business. 
So I'm very excited about our streaming plan. The financials are absolutely built into the guidance, and the incremental capital is modest certainly by standards of what some other folks are doing. 
And with that, we're kind of running a little over. So I want to thank you for your questions. 
In closing, we couldn't be more excited about the road ahead, one where we will continue to unlock the power of this incredible combination, capitalizing on our position as one of the largest content producers and providers in the world, we believe, becoming the most important partner in the media ecosystem, creating valuable new businesses. We have the assets. We have the plan. We have the team. We will execute and we will deliver for you. As we do, know that we're 100% share -- focused on shareholder value creation. We're committed to providing the transparency and disclosure you need to understand and track the value we're creating.

I also want to thank ViacomCBS employees around the world for their adaptive creativity and continued focus on serving our audiences, commercial partners and shareholders amid these unprecedented times. 
Let me now dive into our first quarter earnings call. Today, there are 3 headlines. First, ViacomCBS delivered a solid quarter with clear operating momentum and sequential improvement on key financial metrics. Second, we're proactively managing through the COVID-19 crisis, supporting our employees and communities while strengthening our financial flexibility, reducing costs and ensuring business continuity. And third, we remain consistently focused on value creation and are acting swiftly to execute against cost and revenue opportunities that will create both immediate and lasting benefits. 
I'll start with Q1 2020, our first full quarter as a combined company, one where we made significant progress unlocking the value of our must-watch content across multiple platforms globally and at scale. We integrated our commercial teams to provide partners the strength of our combined asset base. We made progress capturing the run rate merger-related cost synergies we committed to, and we saw strong momentum in streaming, momentum we will build on. 
Examples of our progress include key operating wins. Among them, the continued strength of our domestic media networks, which held the highest share of TV viewing in all key audience demos. This leadership starts with broadcast. CBS will finish the season as America's most-watched network for the 12th straight year. CBS was #1 in all key day parts in the quarter, with 5 of the 6 top comedies, the top 2 dramas, the #1 news program and the #1 late-night show, plus 5 of the top 6 freshman series. In sports, the 2019 season of the NFL on CBS delivered its largest audience in 3 years. 
We also maintained our leadership as the #1-rated cable portfolio in total day, owning nearly half of the top 30 original series in the key 18 to 34 demographic and 9 of the top 10 kids series, thanks to Nickelodeon. Of note, Comedy Central marked its 12th straight quarter of year-over-year share growth, driven by the #1 late-night talk show with Millennials. And Showtime scored the top 2 scripted shows on premium cable, including the #1 comedy and the #1 drama. 
Internationally, we continue to build on a global footprint that includes 192 million broadcast homes, the largest in the world. Our broadcast cornerstones Network 10 in Australia and Telefe in Argentina have each produced strong year-over-year share gains. 
This was also our strongest streaming quarter ever, a milestone that was on track even before the COVID-19 crisis, putting us well on our way to meet the subscriber and user targets we laid out last quarter. Pluto TV continues to lead the U.S. in free streaming TV as the platform delivered its best quarter ever. Pluto domestic monthly active users grew 55% year-over-year to more than 24 million as of quarter end, with even stronger gains in total consumption. 
On top of that, our domestic pay streaming offerings also grew robustly, with subscribers totaling 13.5 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of 50% year-over-year driven by original hit programming from CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Both services broke their own records for sign-ups, streams and time watched in the quarter. Overall, this growth in both pay and free drove a strong increase in domestic streaming and digital revenue in the quarter, which was up more than 50% versus a year ago. 
And the appeal of our streaming and digital offerings has been made even more clear over the last 6 weeks, where we've seen a strong acceleration in momentum across both free and pay as audiences follow stay-at-home guidelines. 
We also demonstrated the strength of the ViacomCBS portfolio by striking new agreements with our partners in the quarter and in the weeks since. For example, CBS reached a deal with the NFL to broadcast one additional wildcard game in 2021 as part of the NFL's playoff expansion with a live stream on CBS All Access and a separately produced telecast on Nickelodeon, tailored for a younger audience. This is a perfect example of how our partners are using our combined asset base to grow the footprint and reach a diverse audience. 
We've also made important strides in domestic distribution, where we struck significant carriage agreements. Earlier this year, we announced that Comcast would become the first MVPD to launch CBS All Access. I'm pleased to share that we actually began rolling out on their Xfinity platform today. And in March, we reached multiyear CBS renewals with 2 of our largest affiliates, Nexstar and Meredith. 
In April, we closed our first true combined company affiliate deal with Verizon. This, despite the fact that Viacom and CBS deals were not coterminous going in. This agreement marks a truly comprehensive, multi-platform partnership spanning pay TV, connected TV and mobile. And it will drive a tremendous expansion of Pluto's distribution footprint. 
And today, we're announcing a new deal with YouTube TV. This deal not only renewed CBS and Showtime early but will shortly bring Viacom's Cable Networks to the high-growth YouTube TV platform. To state the obvious, this fills in a key white space for our Cable Networks distribution and is a clear proof point for the ViacomCBS combination. 
Meanwhile, in film, Paramount scored a bonafide hit with Sonic the Hedgehog, which means we have a new franchise to build on. Worldwide, the film earned more than $300 million at the box office and was made available for digital on demand March 31, setting Paramount's record for first-day digital sales and became the studio's all-time record holder in less than 3 weeks. The title has now sold nearly 2 million EFT units worldwide, and it's also exceeding expectations on VOD. 
These operational highlights and more drove key financial wins in the quarter. Chris will cover our results in detail in a moment, but I do want to highlight a few items. 
On the revenue side, excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, advertising grew 2% year-over-year. Affiliate revenue also increased year-over-year. And we improved the rate of change in domestic Cable Networks affiliate revenue by 270 basis points sequentially. 
In addition, ViacomCBS delivered sequential improvement across all key earnings and cash flow-related metrics, including operating income, adjusted OIBDA, reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow, which is back to a material positive of almost $0.5 billion, again indicating the progress we made in our first full quarter and demonstrating our commitment to strengthening our financial position and creating shareholder value. 
Just as the quarter was ending, we were, of course, faced with the COVID-19 crisis. I want to spend a few minutes sharing with you how we are proactively managing through this. As COVID spread to the U.S., we quickly moved to ensure we have the financial flexibility and balance sheet strength to weather a sustained crisis. 
To that end, we issued $2.5 billion of bonds in April. Add in our strong cash flow in the quarter and our undrawn committed $3.5 billion revolver, and it means we are in excellent shape from a liquidity perspective. 
We have also taken a series of significant cost-reduction measures to mitigate COVID-related revenue impacts for the year. At the same time, we ramped up our focus on business continuity, including significantly adjusting operations around the 3 most affected areas: production, ad sales and film. 
Like most media companies, we have seen an almost total shutdown in production, but we are managing through employing alternate virtual models in some cases and leveraging current and library products from across the company and others. Because of this, we continue to have captivating content on air, and there will be substantial near-term cash flow savings. 
As we look to the balance of the year on the production side, we expect little impact to our on-air product, particularly given the stability of our schedules assuming we can get back in production, albeit with modifications by mid-summer. In ad sales, we've seen advertisers in significantly affected categories temporarily pull back spend. But we are working closely with our clients to mitigate the impact. 
At this point, we know there will be a significant impact on ad sales in Q2. But based on what we're seeing today, we will -- we believe there will be an improvement in advertising in the third and fourth quarters, assuming businesses begin to reopen at scale. 
In terms of the upfront, we expect it to be later and longer than normal. But we're ready whenever our clients are, and deals will get done. In fact, this week, we invited more than 5,000 agency and marketing executives to our virtual presentation on May 18 and 19. 
Regarding film, we have shifted our slate later into '20 and '21 to preserve its value. We also sold The Lovebirds to Netflix, where we saw an attractive monetization opportunity in the early COVID environment. 
And while our film business will, of course, be dependent on theaters reopening in major markets, from a cash perspective, the delay in revenues is substantially offset by the COVID-driven production shutdown. 
Finally, I want to highlight the support we are providing for our employees, audiences and communities amidst this pandemic. A key priority is the health and well-being of our employees and their families. In March, we moved the vast majority of our employee base to work from home, something that has worked incredibly well with very limited exceptions for critical operations and facility staff, who continue to work on-site under strict safety protocols. 
We've also committed $100 million for relief for nonstaff employees and freelancers, whose livelihoods have been especially affected by the pause in our production. And I'm proud of how ViacomCBS has come together to deploy our platforms for COVID-19 consumer education and relief from our enormously successful PFA convenience like #AloneTogether to the specials we've aired to help raise money for the cause. 
All of this to say, I'm enormously grateful to all our employees for their initiative, creativity and courage at this time and adapting and thriving under the toughest of circumstances to ensure we can continue to entertain and inform audiences everywhere. It goes without saying that we are all looking forward to getting on the other side of this crisis. But through it all, we are focused on creating value by executing our strategy and looking to continued cost and revenue opportunities that will create both immediate and lasting benefit. 
This starts with what we see as an even larger cost opportunity for the company. In addition to onetime COVID-related cost reductions I mentioned earlier, we remain on track with our committed annualized run rate synergy target of $750 million over the next 3 years. In fact, we now see a greater opportunity to create sustained financial benefit on top of the $750 million, informed by how we've had to rethink our operations over the past 6 weeks. 
We have proven we can do more with less and can operate without being physically co-located. As a result, we are now exploring opportunities to further consolidate facilities, migrate more activities to lower-cost locations and increase sharing of capabilities, all to further leverage our scale. 
Beyond cost, we are unlocking revenue opportunities across the combined company. In distribution, we've only scratched the surface of what ViacomCBS can do on an integrated basis to unlock additional opportunities with both traditional and new distributors. 
On the advertising front, the combination of our #1 linear position and our high-growth advanced ad solutions, all delivered through an efficient single point of customer contact, means we are extremely well positioned for the rebound associated with the return to business. Importantly, we overwhelmingly serve national advertisers, a segment that should rebound first. 
In sports, we will benefit from the enormous pent-up viewer demand, starting with the return of golf as the PGA Tour plans to resume its schedule in June. And at Paramount, we will be ready with a set of amazing films, including A Quiet Place Part II, Spongebob: Sponge on the Run and Top Gun: Maverick that will be big hits once they're released. 
Finally, there's no question the crisis has proven the power of streaming, and we are moving quickly to seize this significant revenue opportunity. We know fundamental consumer needs around quality, convenience and cost are driving changes in how they consume content, and we're focused on addressing all 3 needs. Building off our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our platforms, we will capitalize on our positions across free and pay, adding substantial content assets and user experience enhancements supported by marketing to serve consumers with a robust, differentiated suite of link streaming offering. 
We will continue to build on Pluto TV's #1 position in free streaming. Pluto TV is a great platform for consumers who want a free high-quality TV experience, whether on a smart TV or a mobile device. In March, we rolled out Pluto's most significant product upgrade ever, delivering new features and design changes that further enhance the platform's ease of use. And with the continued addition of new content partners, it offers consumers a superior experience relative to the other free services and are entering the marketplace. 
And we are expanding Pluto's reach, both in the U.S. and internationally, including through important deals with not only Verizon but also with Xbox and Roku. Pluto now has a growing presence in the U.K., Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as in Latin America, where Pluto's April launch brought over 12,000 hours of content to 17 countries. And over the next 12 months, we expect to roll out Pluto in Brazil, Spain, France and Italy. 
The Pluto TV platform is powerful, and the world is quickly embracing it. But you shouldn't just think of it as a stand-alone service. It is also key to our integrated streaming strategy, where it will serve as an important complement to and funnel for our pay services. 
In June, we will introduce click-through ad units on Pluto, embedded in relevant content to allow users to subscribe to CBS All Access. As time goes on, this integration will continue to evolve as we create an owned and operated streaming ecosystem with a massive free point of entry combined with upsell pay option. 
And speaking of pay, we are accelerating our plans for an expanded subscription service, building off our CBS All Access platform with major changes coming this summer as we track towards the rebrand and relaunch of a transformed product. We believe audiences want their entertainment on demand and their news, sports and events live. And through our expanded offering, we will be the service that gives them what they want, how they want it, all in one place and at a great value. 
This will be a compelling foundational service for some consumers and a differentiated complement to what some other consumers already have. On the entertainment side, we start with what All Access has today: CBS network programming, a very deep CBS on-demand library and an expanding slate of originals, add to that content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, Missoni, MTV, BET and Paramount. This starts with over 100 Paramount films launched this week on the platform as well as thousands of additional hours across TV and film arriving in current and coming months. 
And we will build on this incredible base of content, a catalog multiple times larger than many of the new SVOD entrants by expanding our original slate across the portfolio. This will bring first-window content from each of our brands to this platform. Our biggest franchises will be key to this strategy as well our broad programming strength across genres, from animation to sci-fi, comedy, reality, kids, crime procedurals and more. Add to that, national and local news from over 200 CBS affiliates, available both live and on-demand and a critical mass of live sports, including CBS network-delivered NFL, NCAA, PGA and more plus exclusive streaming rights to major properties like women's soccer and UEFA. 
And we're doing all of this in a targeted, capital-efficient way. First, we are working from an already developed tech platform in CBS All Access. We are not building from scratch. Second, almost every dollar we invest in linear content across the company will benefit the service with varying windows. Third, our original strategy is designed to leverage our massive library of IP, fueling growth through a consistent and growing cadence of tent-pole series. 
Our experience makes clear that we can acquire new customers in a disciplined and economically efficient way while reducing churn and driving customer retention with a deep volume of entertainment, news and sports. 
Fourth, our distribution strategy benefits from existing, growing relationships. Across our pay and free products, we already have distribution deals with the likes of Comcast, AT&T and Verizon as well as with Amazon, Roku and other tech players. And we are in ongoing discussions with a broad range of partners to expand our streaming footprint in the coming months. 
And fifth and finally, we will leverage our ability to cross-promote at scale, where we will benefit from our #1 TV share in every demo as well as our strong digital reach, enabling ViacomCBS to promote to and draw customers into our offering in an impactful and cost-effective way. 
And going back to where I started, the promotional platform includes Pluto TV, a fast growth, broad reach gateway to the ViacomCBS streaming world. 
In addition to our domestic strategy, I should add that internationally, we will launch a broad pay streaming product in multiple markets over the next 12 months. This service will harness the full power of the ViacomCBS portfolio, creating a meaningful brand presence in streaming video in key markets around the world. 
So in sum, we are full speed ahead on streaming, seeing strong demand for our services today, with a strategy to achieve accelerated growth domestically and internationally in the months and years to come. For all those reasons and more, we're extremely excited about the future of ViacomCBS. We are unlocking the very substantial value of this extraordinary company, and the best is yet to come. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris."

I would first like to say that our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this pandemic. I want to acknowledge and thank the employees at ViacomCBS for their extreme care for well-being and resilience in this unprecedented time. I am proud to be a part of the tremendous team work currently taking place across our company, our industry and our communities. 
Specific to ViacomCBS, we are faced with a much different financial environment for this earnings call than just a quarter ago when we closed year-end 2019. We did realize solid results in Q1 2020, our first full quarter as a united company. Then at the end of the quarter, we pivoted to manage the risk from COVID-19, while continuing to focus on unlocking the value of ViacomCBS. 
Today, I will first take you through the actions taken to strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. Then I will walk you through our first quarter 2020 results, which demonstrate early evidence of the power of ViacomCBS. And finally, I will provide you with some insights into what we are seeing today stemming from COVID-19 effects and the actions we are taking to mitigate them. 
We are proactively managing through this crisis with the security of increased liquidity, while aggressively controlling our costs and preserving cash. At the same time, we are accelerating the momentum we are seeing in our streaming businesses to position ViacomCBS well for the future. 
Let's start with ViacomCBS' liquidity and balance sheet. Early on, we prioritized taking the necessary steps to ensure we have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to manage through this crisis. On April 1, we accessed the credit market and issued $2.5 billion of debt. Using the proceeds from this bond issuance, on May 4, we redeemed all of our $300 million of notes that were due in February 2021. And on May 18, we will redeem all of our $500 million of notes that are due in March 2021. The remaining $1.7 billion in proceeds from the bond issuance bolsters our liquidity in order to help us weather the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses. We also continue to have access to a $3.5 billion revolver, which remains undrawn and provides us with even more financial flexibility. 
As of March 31, 2020, when you take into account the $750 million of full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.1x. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and reaching our target leverage of 2.75x, including the benefit of full run rate synergies. 
We plan to use excess cash flow, after dividend payments, to delever the balance sheet until we reach that leverage ratio. We will not repurchase any of our shares until we complete our planned noncore asset sale. 
Let me update you on our 2 noncore asset sales. Our previously announced sale of BlackRock is temporarily on hold until we can allow potential buyers to continue to tour the building. We are also in the process of preparing for a sale of Simon & Schuster so that the asset is ready for divestiture when the market stabilizes. We are encouraged by the significant interest we have seen for both of these assets and look forward to proceeding as market conditions allow. 
Now turning to our financial performance. We achieved solid results for our first full quarter as a united company. Total company revenue was $6.67 billion, adjusted OIBDA was $1.26 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.13. The comparison to last year for all 3 metrics was affected by the broadcast of the Super Bowl and the NCAA men's basketball tournament in Q1 2019. Adjusted free cash flow of $478 million, which excludes $173 million of restructuring and merger-related payments, was a material improvement from Q4 2019 and a strong start to the year. 
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter, total company advertising was down 19% versus a year ago. However, advertising was up 2% after adjusting for a 21-point headwind resulting from comparisons to the Super Bowl and the COVID-related cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, which were in the year-ago period. Advertising growth was also impacted by a 100 basis point headwind from FX. 
The ad market was robust throughout the majority of the first quarter, with strength in prime time, news, political and cable as well as the benefit of historically high scatter pricing. We also saw continued strength in digital advertising across our ad-based streaming platforms. 
Affiliate revenue increased 1%, benefiting from strong retrans, reverse comp and subscription streaming revenue, which more than offset declines in cable network affiliate revenue and a 100 basis point headwind from FX. Importantly, the year-over-year change in Cable Network affiliate revenue in Q1 improved sequentially from Q4, with the domestic Cable Network affiliate rate of decline improving 270 basis points. 
Domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, was up an impressive 51% versus a year ago to $471 million. We reached new records in Q1 in sign-ups and streams on CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and in monthly active user growth in minutes viewed on Pluto. 
Turning to content licensing. Revenue grew 9% driven by growth in original studio production for third parties. Paramount Television Studios, CBS Television Studios and Cable Network Studios all benefited from strong deliveries during the quarter. Theatrical revenue was down 3% as strong results from Sonic the Hedgehog were more than offset by prior quarter revenues, which included carryover performance from Bumblebee. Theatrical revenue would have been higher had we released The Quiet Place Part II as scheduled on March 18. 
For publishing, revenue increased 4% and reflecting growth from digital book and audio sales. Key titles in the quarter included Stephen King's If It Bleeds and The Outsider and Cassandra Clare's Chain of Gold. On the expense front, we benefited from merger-related cost synergies in the first quarter and are on track to realize $250 million in savings for the full year of 2020 before consideration of onetime cost to achieve them. 
Overall, we are pleased with the strong start for ViacomCBS' results in the first quarter of 2020. I would now like to give you some insight to the impact COVID-19 is having on our business. I will update you on what we are currently seeing in each of our revenue streams and explain the cost actions we have taken to partly offset the revenue headwinds. 
Based on our current assessment of the near-term impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses and assuming the U.S. economy begins to reopen early in the second half of 2020, we anticipate the second quarter will be the most significantly affected. 
Starting with advertising. While we are seeing material increases in ratings and engagement across all of our platforms, linear and digital alike, the COVID-19 shutdown is currently resulting in significantly lower ad demand in Q2 of 2020. The reduction in demand in the marketplace is being driven by macro uncertainty and temporary business closures as well as the postponement and cancellation of sporting events. Importantly, we continue to expect to benefit from political advertising later in 2020. 
Moving to affiliate revenue. As Bob discussed, we have had a productive quarter with several new distribution deals signed. While we expect some acceleration in linear subscriber declines in the near term, we will benefit from our recent affiliate deals and from the materially higher sign-ups and engagement we are experiencing across all of our streaming platforms. We expect domestic streaming subscribers to reach at least 16 million and domestic monthly active users on Pluto to reach at least 30 million by the end of 2020. 
In Q2, content licensing revenue in the cable segment will benefit from our South Park deal. However, the timing of deliveries and significant activity in the year-ago quarter in the TV entertainment segment will be a substantial offset. 
In regard to theatrical revenue, we had one significant film that was scheduled to be released at the end of Q1 2020, A Quiet Place Part II, which is now scheduled for September 4. Our 2 largest films that were scheduled to release in the second quarter have also been rescheduled. The Spongebob movie, Sponge on the Run has been moved from May 22 to August 7, and Top Gun: Maverick has been moved from June 26 to December 23. We do not expect to release any new movies in the second quarter or until theaters reopen broadly. And we'll adjust release dates, if necessary, to maximize returns on our film content investments. 
In light of the impact of this crisis, we are highly focused on reducing our costs and preserving cash. The cost reductions fall into 3 areas. First, timing-related expense reductions from the lack of distribution or events. For example, this includes the absence of sports rights amortization for sports that have been canceled, the elimination of production costs associated with the current production shutdown and a delay in P&A for films not released. 
Secondly, we continue to make progress against the $750 million in annualized run rate cost synergies we identified as a result of our merger, including $250 million, which will be realized in 2020. 
And third, we are taking additional cost-cutting actions and implementing initiatives to reduce discretionary expenses. We are learning from this crisis and finding ways that we can operate even more efficiently. We see significant opportunities to realize sustainable financial benefits over the long term. 
In summary, we believe the steps we are taking, bolstering our liquidity, strengthening our commercial partnerships and streaming scale, all while aggressively managing our cost base will enable us to weather the financial effects of this crisis, emerging better positioned to build upon our strong consumer relevance, thereby creating significant shareholder value. 
With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

In terms of advertising, as I said in my remarks, we are seeing a significant impact in Q2, and but we do see Q3 and Q4 improving, assuming businesses reopen. And we're well positioned to capitalize on that and gain share. Now with re",631,"Yes. Thanks, Alexia. In terms of advertising, as I said in my remarks, we are seeing a significant impact in Q2, and but we do see Q3 and Q4 improving, assuming businesses reopen. And we're well positioned to capitalize on that and gain share. Now with respect to Q2 specifically, on a relative basis, broadcast is strongest, then cable then digital. Local's weakest. Interestingly, though, the weakness is dominated by 5 categories, and these are categories you would expect: auto, restaurants, retail, travel, movies. So they're all significantly impacted by COVID. 
Now as we've seen some decline in demand, we also have been using some of that inventory to benefit our own products, including promoting SVOD, digital books and cross [indiscernible] our schedules. So that inventory hasn't gone to waste. We've also, in some cases, reduced load to improve the viewing environment and to maintain strong pricing. 
On positive note, one of our largest clients came to market in Q2 with scatter dollars, and we know we got the largest share. So that's a good reflection on the power of the portfolio. It's also worth noting that we've seen in May and June scatter improve relative to April. So that's a good sign. And we do see categories continuing to be active in the market, pharmaceuticals, CBG, financial services, tech. And as we look to Q3, in particular, we'll also see live sports beginning to return. For us, the PGA starts on June 11 in Texas. We're seeing very strong demand for that and golf. And as you know, the NFL is releasing their schedule later today. So that's all a positive. 
Again, we're very well positioned against this backdrop, given our #1 position on linear television as well as our AMS portfolio. And the fact that through the integration we've done, we can now deliver all that to our customers on a single point of contact, which is important to the extent that some of our counterparties have either furloughed or reduced staffing. 
So we feel good. I mean so advertising's tough, but we do see some green shoots and feel good about our ability to maximize that as they grow. 
With respect to YouTube, yes, thank you. We are very happy about that deal. But the quarter was not just about YouTube. We've had very strong activity in terms of renewals in the quarter and subsequent to the quarter's end, Comcast, Verizon, YouTube, all examples of the power of the combination, something we're quickly beginning to unlock. 
Big picture, we're seeing very strong consumption that underscores consumer demand for our products across platforms. On linear, remember, #1 in TV share, #1 in all key demos, that is -- and in this COVID time, in particular, very strong consumption, benefiting brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., BET, Comedy Central, obviously underscores the value of our product and also great momentum on streaming. We talked about that in my prepared remarks, real positive trends in sign-ups and actually conversions on All Access and Showtime OTT. So the portfolio is very strong. 
In terms of the deals, Comcast, first MVPD to add All Access. We're actually launching that today on Xfinity. Verizon, our first true cross-company, cross-portfolio MVPD deal, very happy with the economics. And that Pluto component is very significant in terms of Verizon wireless distribution and now YouTube, multiyear deal, includes an extension for CBS and Showtime and the addition of Viacom Media Networks very soon, 14 networks. That fills a key VMVPD white space for our company. That's obviously important. But it's also a win for them because it brings our #1 TV portfolio to their platform. And as they look at the next leg of their sub growth, that will benefit them. So very happy with all that."

That includes current production through Paramount, CBS, Viacom Media Networks as well as a huge library. And the $13 billion cash content spend that we've referred to in the past is a very material number. Relative to that number, we expect COVID to result in some reduction in overall content expenses in 2020. Now that's driven by the cancellation of certain events, say, the NCAAs, as an example, the reduction in number of episodes of certain seasons series, so CBS prime. A lot of those series only delivered 18 episodes versus the planned 22 because we have to shut down production early. And we did move some films out of 2020. So all those things will reduce the 13, but that's really a 2020 issue. It's not a planned change in run rate. 
Now in terms of that aggregate spend, we continue to prioritize investments in our owned and operated platforms. And that includes streaming with a growth emphasis on streaming as we shift mix from lower- to higher-growth sectors. With respect to streaming, our biggest franchises will be key to that strategy as well as our broad programming strength really across genres, genres being kids, animations, crime procedurals, et cetera. And so we will be prioritizing those programming areas for our owned and operated platforms. 
That said, we will continue to selectively license to third parties. It's a big market. Playing in that market has multiple benefits, not just revenue, but also expanding the reach of IP to new fans that benefits the franchise and related businesses like consumer products, like setting up for theatricals, et cetera. We're doing that in a very strategic way. So we're not going to license critical mass of any of our key programming areas, kids, procedurals, et cetera, to any single player. 
Likewise, again, we're prioritizing franchise IP to our owned platforms. And regardless of what we do in the licensing space, remember, ultimately, these deals are rentals. The IP does revert back. So that's how we're thinking about it, Mike. 
In terms of Pluto, I referenced that digital was weaker, but digital is an aggregation of a lot of different things. We continue to see fantastic advertiser reception for the Pluto product. It really is the closest thing to linear television on the planet. And if you've seen Pluto in the last month with our Venetia upgrade, the product is fantastic. The presentation is improved. And by the way, the ad guts behind it are also upgraded. So we continue to see strong demand, certainly strong demand in the first quarter. We're doing fine in the second quarter, again, against a general softer backdrop, which everybody is seeing. But we continue to love the asset and advertisers do, too."

And we do anticipate that, that sale will complete in 2020. For Simon & Schuster, we're currently preparing to make available for sale when the market conditions allow. 
So as we look at our capital allocation plan relative to thinking about how we use our cash, it's organic free cash flow generation, which we will benefit from the near-term production shutdown. It will be a benefit near term to free cash flow. But then also with the proceeds we get from the asset sales, we will look to pay down our debt to achieve 2.75x leverage ratio."

And those are studios, networks and streaming. And that gives us a very clear lens to look through to consider where the assets fit or not. Based on that, again, it's clear that BlackRock, which is an iconic office building in New York, but doesn't fit any of those 3 categories, and Simon & Schuster, which is a preeminent publisher and an extraordinary company, again, doesn't fit any of those segments. So those are noncore, even though they're super high-quality assets. And again, we've had lots of interest in them. 
But when you look at that framework through the rest of the assets we own, the company really has a pretty compelling combination. So COVID hasn't changed our view on strategic asset composition in anything -- if anything, it's reinforced it. We believe the combination of studios, networks and streaming makes enormous synergistic sense together."

So in terms of affiliate, I think probably the best way to think about it is, if you look at pay subs, we saw stable trends in Q1 relative to Q4. That said, given what we're hearing and people are talking about in Q2, we do expect some modest incremental cord cutting. But importantly, our deal with YouTube will more than offset that when it kicks in this summer. So that's to your question of outperformance. 
Also on the domestic cable affiliate revenue side, as you know, we got a nice improvement in rate of change between Q4 and Q1. Q2 might move back a bit given what I just mentioned on sub trends. Again, we don't know what that actually is, but there's possibility. But given the deals we have locked in as of today, we see further improvement in the second half of the year on the domestic cable affiliate revenue trend line. So that's to your question on outperformance. 
Look, on streaming profitability, again, we're not giving guidance, certainly not into 2020 COVID environment. I can tell you that we are -- it really it's all about the mix of content expenditures across the company and continuing to remix from investment towards higher-growth areas that includes streaming. In the short term, there's a lot of incremental content that we're bringing to the platform that is existing content. And then over time, there'll be growing original content on the streaming side. But again, that's largely a mix. And again, as we look at a business plan for streaming, both in free and pay and more importantly, on this integrated linked ecosystem, we're very excited about what we see tracking out over the coming years. 
Finally, on Q3 ad sales, again, based on everything we see today, we believe Q3 ad sales will be better than Q2. And again, right now, May and June scatter looked better than April. So that's a good sign. We do see categories active in the market, again, pharma, CPG, financial services, tech. We do see for sure demand for sports, starting with this June 11 PGA event. And these PGA events are sort of staggered in kind of more open states, if you will, in locations. So we feel good about that. We have a very specific production plan for those, which we believe mitigates risk. And we're definitely seeing strong demand for that. 
So -- and again, it speaks to the power of the portfolio, the fact that we can serve advertisers through our #1 linear position across really all genres, add in Pluto and other high-quality digital assets and importantly, deliver it through a single point of customer contact. I think that will be even more important as we negotiate, say, this virtual upfront. So that's what I'm seeing."

I think there's a lot of investors on this call who probably thought that Charlie Ergen was going to give you a very hard time in that renewal. I'm wondering with literally no sports on TV, does the leverage with distributors sort of shift a little bit? At least until sports come back, it would seem like Viacom is a pretty large portion of overall content on the air right now. Then on the movie business, you're talking about putting up movies later this year. Some of your peers have moved films into literally a year, if not more. Do you really plan to put out movies if they can't generate hundreds of millions of dollars of box office? Like how are you going to make the decision of whether to really put things out in August, September versus delay until August or September of '21? And just because everyone is literally asking me to ask, Bob, could you just be very specific? Fox said ad sales are down 50%; AMC, down 30%.

But with that caveat, so we are seeing incredible consumption of ViacomCBS content in the current environment. And that's both our broadcast linear CBS, that is our cable assets, including like Nick Jr. and Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, Trevor's Killing It, et cetera. So yes, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. And by the way, as I said, our streaming services, which we also increasingly, call it, package into our relationship with our distributors are performing very well. So does that tilt in our favor at the moment? Yes, probably. We, by the way, also look forward to bringing live sports back, and we're going to be one of the first with golf, the nature of golf probably makes that a little bit simpler than some of the other sports. By the way, we set up a sound stage in Radford, the CBS lot to film both boxing and Bellator events, which we're going to use that soundstage to sequentially alternately produce those, albeit with no audience for the moment. So we're going to do some sports stuff around the edges. 
But yes, look, I like our position. I think the portfolio is very powerful. You see that starting to come to life with the deals I've already talked about, and I feel good about our trajectory going forward. 
With respect to movies, yes, we moved them later. We thought that was the right thing to do to preserve asset value. We obviously look at the market and look at what it will be at a point in time, and we'll make a decision if there's sufficient critical mass of screens, if you will, theaters to warrant opening a film. Our first film on the schedule is Spongebob at the beginning of August. I think it's August 7. So it's too far out to call if that's definitely going to be released or it's definitely not going to be released. We hope it will release, but we will continue to look at and make the right decision in terms of the return on those assets because we got great films. I mean, whether it's Quiet Place Part II, which we premiered in New York 2 weeks before the crisis, and we pulled at the last minute, thank God we did because the film is incredible. And we didn't waste it. We saved it. Likewise, Top Gun: Maverick is off the chart. So -- but we're going to open them when it makes sense to open them, Rich. 
Lastly, on ad sales, look, we're not going to -- I'm not going to give you a domestic number. I can tell you it's not as bad as what Fox is saying, that's for sure, but it's not pretty either. But as far as a specific number, no, I'm not going to do that."

So international, I'd say, overall, the dynamics are similar to the U.S. And what I mean by that is escalated content consumption, both linear and streamed, soft ad market and us focusing on cost management. 
In terms of advertising, Q1 was really a story of U.K. market under pressure. Spain also, Australia was actually up. Q2 is pretty soft across the board. And I would say that international is softer than domestic. And probably a way to think about it is we talked about this 2% growth number in Q1. The domestic number is better than that. The international number was a headwind for it. 
Importantly, in international, we are -- we now have 2 offices open, Beijing and Hong Kong. So things are moving forward. And that is both a light at the end of the tunnel but also a great way for us to get experience with facility reopening, which we have a big kind of working group on that. So we're prepped for it. 
And then on the international side, importantly, we continue to see new opportunities coming out of the merger when we think big picture. It might take us a little longer to realize them, but they're definitely there, things like bringing operating expertise from Channel 5 and Telefe to Network 10, things like bringing CBS' massive television library and production to Viacom International Media Networks distribution across MVPDS, OTT, mobile partners. And as we move forward on streaming, again, we see a real international opportunity, which leverages the combined company asset base, and it's more than seeing it. We have plans to go after it, as I said, in multiple markets over the next 12 months. 
With respect to production, we have a multifaceted plan in place for restarting production, which we believe will leave us well positioned with fresh product in the fall in both TV and film. And we also have a range of contingencies we can deploy. 
To your question on CBS, CBS has a very strong and stable schedule. We announced a renewal of over 80% of that slate yesterday. That's got a bunch of benefits, including the fact that in this virtual upfront time whenever it moves, advertisers will know what they're buying from us, and some of the other networks are not in that place. 
In terms of our return to production, a couple of things I'd highlight. One is because there was a possibility of a writer strike, we ensured we had a backlog of shows ready to go. So that's an asset we can draw on. In addition, if you start segmenting different kinds of production, sound stage-based productions, things like sitcoms, that's a more controllable environment. So we feel good about that. Dramas, again, if you look at it, there will likely be limitations. We can probably front-load production the components that are on sound stages and leave location to later. That's how we're thinking about it, if need be. On the unscripted side, we can also modify production to include more controllable environments. 
In terms of sports, we believe live sports will return. I talked about golf and the NFL probably in a modified form, but we believe they'll be there. And so we're optimistic that our fall schedule won't be materially disrupted, again, assuming we can get back in production sometime this summer. 
Know that in the interim, we continue to operate in a modified model. That includes using virtual productions. You've seen a bunch of those on air to keep news, late night and other shows going. To the extent we see gaps in production volume, we do have broad and deep libraries, including the recent addition of Miramax, which we can deploy on our platforms. Current example of this is the use of Paramount titles for a new CBS Sunday night at the movies, which started in May. That's filling in for a shortened season of MCIS derivatives back to the 18 episodes versus 22. 
On the Paramount side, we've completed principal photography on 8 films right before the crisis. Those include Snake Eyes, Clifford, Coming to America, Top Gun, Infinite Tomorrow World and Spell. So those are all being worked on remotely in post production. So we will be in good shape when things open up. Likewise, showtime is currently set and solid through Q3. So it's a bit of a fluid situation, but we spent a lot of time looking at not only return to facilities, but return to production, and we're confident that we'll have compelling content on in the fall."

One is it for sure, fits in the strategic paradigm that I outlined of studios, networks and streaming. In fact, it's all 3. And the second thing I'd say on Showtime is we talked about some issues with Showtime circa '19, but our 2020 plan is all about turning around the performance with respect to earnings and cash flow, and we feel good about our trajectory there. And it's important to note that it has real momentum on subscribers, particularly over the top. Showtime had its best quarter ever in sign-ups and consumption in Q1. And we've seen acceleration in sign-ups, time watched and total streams in April. And the conversion of free to pay as it's accelerated, i.e., more trials, we're seeing the same or better conversion rates. So that's all good, and we do have a lot of momentum on the programming side. 
With respect to streaming, I talked about our strategy a bit in my prepared remarks. And from a content perspective, again, we're very excited about where we're taking this. 
If you look at Pluto, it's a massive free gateway to our streaming ecosystem. We are going to continue to build that out. That has both owned and operated and third-party content on it. The content offering in ours is definitely weighted towards third party. Our content on it is definitely library, and that's working well. 
In respect to our pay product, which is more where your question would show up, we're in the middle of transforming CBS All Access into this much more compelling product that includes news, live sports and on-demand entertainment. So your question would really apply largely to on-demand entertainment. Again, we put over 100 Paramount films there this week. You will see a major move this summer, where we'll introduce a fundamentally new UI and add substantial content assets. As we do that, we are prioritizing franchises and importantly, critical mass of programming in genres, whether it's animation and kids or it's crime, et cetera, for O&O. 
We will continue to selectively license outside of that. So we may put a little kids somewhere on one platform, a little bit on another. But in terms of critical mass and in terms of big franchises, we're going to increasingly lean into that for our owned and operated platforms. We think that's a strategy that will create a very compelling streaming product and sort of trajectory for that element -- that portion of our business as well as allow us to continue to participate in a licensing market where there continues to be a lot of demand.
Look, guys, I really want to thank you for your questions and taking time with us in this strange time we're all living in. I want to close by saying ViacomCBS is a resilient company. We are well positioned to navigate the crisis, and we're really just beginning to tap the potential of our combined assets. 
To that end, you look at Q1, you look at the time since then, remember, we only closed this deal in December, but there are already multiple proof points to the power of the ViacomCBS combination. That includes recent affiliate deals. We talked about them today. Our cross-company use of content, we talked about today and very material cost synergies, which will probably increase as we move forward, leveraging our experience in COVID. 
Again, the first quarter and the weeks following demonstrated that our content is in demand in all kinds of formats. We did take aggressive steps to reduce costs, improve financial flexibility and frankly, strengthen our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Our growing scale, audience reach and earnings power will become more apparent as this market rebounds, and we put the full power of our portfolio behind the company, including behind our streaming strategy. 
So look, thanks, everyone, for your continued support. Stay well, and we look forward to seeing you in person, hopefully, sometime soon."

Our thoughts are with all who are affected worldwide and especially those who have lost loved ones. To the heroes on the front line of first response in health care and to all the essential workers, we owe you a debt of thanks. I also want to thank ViacomCBS employees around the world for their adaptive creativity and continued focus on serving our audiences, commercial partners and shareholders amid these unprecedented times. 
Let me now dive into our first quarter earnings call. Today, there are 3 headlines. First, ViacomCBS delivered a solid quarter with clear operating momentum and sequential improvement on key financial metrics. Second, we're proactively managing through the COVID-19 crisis, supporting our employees and communities while strengthening our financial flexibility, reducing costs and ensuring business continuity. And third, we remain consistently focused on value creation and are acting swiftly to execute against cost and revenue opportunities that will create both immediate and lasting benefits.
I'll start with Q1 2020, our first full quarter as a combined company, one where we made significant progress unlocking the value of our must-watch content across multiple platforms globally and at scale. We integrated our commercial teams to provide partners the strength of our combined asset base. We made progress capturing the run rate merger-related cost synergies we committed to, and we saw strong momentum in streaming, momentum we will build on. 
Examples of our progress include key operating wins. Among them, the continued strength of our domestic media networks, which held the highest share of TV viewing in all key audience demos. This leadership starts with broadcast. CBS will finish the season as America's most-watched network for the 12th straight year. CBS was #1 in all key day parts in the quarter, with 5 of the 6 top comedies, the top 2 dramas, the #1 news program and the #1 late-night show, plus 5 of the top 6 freshman series. In sports, the 2019 season of the NFL on CBS delivered its largest audience in 3 years. 
We also maintained our leadership as the #1-rated cable portfolio in total day, owning nearly half of the top 30 original series in the key 18 to 34 demographic and 9 of the top 10 kids series, thanks to Nickelodeon. Of note, Comedy Central marked its 12th straight quarter of year-over-year share growth, driven by the #1 late-night talk show with millennials. And Showtime scored the top 2 scripted shows on premium cable, including the #1 comedy and the #1 drama. 
Internationally, we continue to build on a global footprint that includes 192 million broadcast homes, the largest in the world. Our broadcast cornerstones Network Ten in Australia and Telefe in Argentina have each produced strong year-over-year share gains. 
This was also our strongest streaming quarter ever, a milestone that was on track even before the COVID-19 crisis, putting us well on our way to meet the subscriber and user targets we laid out last quarter. Pluto TV continues to lead the U.S. in free streaming TV as the platform delivered its best quarter ever. Pluto domestic monthly active users grew 55% year-over-year to more than 24 million as of quarter end, with even stronger gains in total consumption. 
On top of that, our domestic pay streaming offerings also grew robustly, with subscribers totaling 13.5 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of 50% year-over-year driven by original hit programming from CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Both services broke their own records for sign-ups, streams and time watched in the quarter. Overall, this growth in both pay and free drove a strong increase in domestic streaming and digital revenue in the quarter, which was up more than 50% versus a year ago. 
And the appeal of our streaming and digital offerings has been made even more clear over the last 6 weeks, where we've seen a strong acceleration in momentum across both free and pay as audiences follow stay-at-home guidelines. 
We also demonstrated the strength of the ViacomCBS portfolio by striking new agreements with our partners in the quarter and in the weeks since. For example, CBS reached a deal with the NFL to broadcast one additional wildcard game in 2021 as part of the NFL's playoff expansion with a live stream on CBS All Access and a separately produced telecast on Nickelodeon, tailored for a younger audience. This is a perfect example of how our partners are using our combined asset base to grow the footprint and reach a diverse audience. 
We've also made important strides in domestic distribution, where we struck significant carriage agreements. Earlier this year, we announced that Comcast would become the first MVPD to launch CBS All Access. I'm pleased to share that we actually began rolling out on their Xfinity platform today. And in March, we reached multiyear CBS renewals with 2 of our largest affiliates, Nexstar and Meredith. 
In April, we closed our first true combined company affiliate deal with Verizon. This, despite the fact that Viacom and CBS deals were not coterminous going in. This agreement marks a truly comprehensive, multi-platform partnership spanning pay TV, connected TV and mobile. And it will drive a tremendous expansion of Pluto's distribution footprint. 
And today, we're announcing a new deal with YouTube TV. This deal not only renews CBS and Showtime early but will shortly bring Viacom's Cable Networks to the high-growth YouTube TV platform. To state the obvious, this fills in a key white space for our Cable Networks distribution and is a clear proof point for the ViacomCBS combination. 
Meanwhile, in film, Paramount scored a bona fide hit with Sonic the Hedgehog, which means we have a new franchise to build on. Worldwide, the film earned more than $300 million at the box office and was made available for digital on demand March 31, setting Paramount's record for first-day digital sales and became the studio's all-time record holder in less than 3 weeks. The title has now sold nearly 2 million [ EFT ] units worldwide, and it's also exceeding expectations on VOD. 
These operational highlights and more drove key financial wins in the quarter. Chris will cover our results in detail in a moment, but I do want to highlight a few items. 
On the revenue side, excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, advertising grew 2% year-over-year. Affiliate revenue also increased year-over-year. And we improved the rate of change in domestic Cable Networks affiliate revenue by 270 basis points sequentially. 
In addition, ViacomCBS delivered sequential improvement across all key earnings and cash flow-related metrics, including operating income, adjusted OIBDA, reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow, which is back to a material positive of almost $0.5 billion, again indicating the progress we made in our first full quarter and demonstrating our commitment to strengthening our financial position and creating shareholder value. 
Just as the quarter was ending, we were, of course, faced with the COVID-19 crisis. I want to spend a few minutes sharing with you how we are proactively managing through this. As COVID spread to the U.S., we quickly moved to ensure we had the financial flexibility and balance sheet strength to weather a sustained crisis. 
To that end, we issued $2.5 billion of bonds in April. Add in our strong cash flow in the quarter and our undrawn committed $3.5 billion revolver, and it means we are in excellent shape from a liquidity perspective. 
We have also taken a series of significant cost-reduction measures to mitigate COVID-related revenue impacts for the year. At the same time, we ramped up our focus on business continuity, including significantly adjusting operations around the 3 most affected areas: production, ad sales and film. 
Like most media companies, we have seen an almost total shutdown in production, but we are managing through employing alternate virtual models in some cases and leveraging current and library products from across the company in others. Because of this, we continue to have captivating content on air, and there will be substantial near-term cash flow savings. 
As we look to the balance of the year on the production side, we expect little impact to our on-air product, particularly given the stability of our schedules assuming we can get back in production, albeit with modifications by mid-summer. In ad sales, we've seen advertisers in significantly affected categories temporarily pull back spend. But we are working closely with our clients to mitigate the impact. 
At this point, we know there will be a significant impact on ad sales in Q2. But based on what we're seeing today, we will -- we believe there will be an improvement in advertising in the third and fourth quarters, assuming businesses begin to reopen at scale. 
In terms of the upfront, we expect it to be later and longer than normal. But we're ready whenever our clients are, and deals will get done. In fact, this week, we invited more than 5,000 agency and marketing executives to our virtual presentation on May 18 and 19. 
Regarding film, we have shifted our slate later into '20 and '21 to preserve its value. We also sold The Lovebirds to Netflix, where we saw an attractive monetization opportunity in the early COVID environment. 
And while our film business will, of course, be dependent on theaters reopening in major markets, from a cash perspective, the delay in revenues is substantially offset by the COVID-driven production shutdown. 
Finally, I want to highlight the support we are providing for our employees, audiences and communities amidst this pandemic. A key priority is the health and well-being of our employees and their families. In March, we moved the vast majority of our employee base to work from home, something that has worked incredibly well with very limited exceptions for critical operations and facility staff, who continue to work on-site under strict safety protocols. 
We've also committed $100 million for relief for non-staff employees and freelancers, whose livelihoods have been especially affected by the pause in our production. And I'm proud of how ViacomCBS has come together to deploy our platforms for COVID-19 consumer education and relief from our enormously successful PSA campaigns like #AloneTogether to the specials we've aired to help raise money for the cause. 
All of this to say, I'm enormously grateful to all our employees for their initiative, creativity and courage at this time in adapting and thriving under the toughest of circumstances to ensure we can continue to entertain and inform audiences everywhere. It goes without saying that we are all looking forward to getting on the other side of this crisis. But through it all, we are focused on creating value by executing our strategy and looking to continued cost and revenue opportunities that will create both immediate and lasting benefit. 
This starts with what we see as an even larger cost opportunity for the company. In addition to onetime COVID-related cost reductions I mentioned earlier, we remain on track with our committed annualized run rate synergy target of $750 million over the next 3 years. In fact, we now see a greater opportunity to create sustained financial benefit on top of the $750 million, informed by how we've had to rethink our operations over the past 6 weeks. 
We have proven we can do more with less and can operate without being physically co-located. As a result, we are now exploring opportunities to further consolidate facilities, migrate more activities to lower-cost locations and increase sharing of capabilities, all to further leverage our scale. 
Beyond cost, we are unlocking revenue opportunities across the combined company. In distribution, we've only scratched the surface of what ViacomCBS can do on an integrated basis to unlock additional opportunities with both traditional and new distributors. 
On the advertising front, the combination of our #1 linear position and our high-growth advanced ad solutions, all delivered through an efficient single point of customer contact, means we are extremely well positioned for the rebound associated with the return to business. Importantly, we overwhelmingly serve national advertisers, a segment that should rebound first. 
In sports, we will benefit from the enormous pent-up viewer demand, starting with the return of golf as the PGA Tour plans to resume its schedule in June. And at Paramount, we will be ready with a set of amazing films, including A Quiet Place Part II, SpongeBob: Sponge on the Run and Top Gun: Maverick that will be big hits once they're released. 
Finally, there's no question the crisis has proven the power of streaming, and we are moving quickly to seize this significant revenue opportunity. We know fundamental consumer needs around quality, convenience and cost are driving changes in how they consume content, and we're focused on addressing all 3 needs. Building off our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our platforms, we will capitalize on our positions across free and pay, adding substantial content assets and user experience enhancements supported by marketing to serve consumers with a robust, differentiated suite of link streaming offering. 
We will continue to build on Pluto TV's #1 position in free streaming. Pluto TV is a great platform for consumers who want a free high-quality TV experience, whether on a smart TV or a mobile device. In March, we rolled out Pluto's most significant product upgrade ever, delivering new features and design changes that further enhanced the platform's ease of use. And with the continued addition of new content partners, it offers consumers a superior experience relative to the other free services in or entering the marketplace. 
And we are expanding Pluto's reach, both in the U.S. and internationally, including through important deals with not only Verizon but also with Xbox and Roku. Pluto now has a growing presence in the U.K., Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as in Latin America, where Pluto's April launch brought over 12,000 hours of content to 17 countries. And over the next 12 months, we expect to roll out Pluto in Brazil, Spain, France and Italy. 
The Pluto TV platform is powerful, and the world is quickly embracing it. But you shouldn't just think of it as a standalone service. It is also key to our integrated streaming strategy, where it will serve as an important complement to and funnel for our pay services. 
In June, we will introduce click-through ad units on Pluto, embedded in relevant content to allow users to subscribe to CBS All Access. As time goes on, this integration will continue to evolve as we create an owned and operated streaming ecosystem with a massive free point of entry combined with upsell pay option. 
And speaking of pay, we are accelerating our plans for an expanded subscription service, building off our CBS All Access platform with major changes coming this summer as we track towards the rebrand and relaunch of a transformed product. We believe audiences want their entertainment on demand and their news, sports and events live. And through our expanded offering, we will be the service that gives them what they want, how they want it, all in one place and at a great value. 
This will be a compelling foundational service for some consumers and a differentiated complement to what some other consumers already have. On the entertainment side, we start with what All Access has today: CBS network programming, a very deep CBS on-demand library and an expanding slate of originals, add to that content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, Smithsonian, MTV, BET and Paramount. This starts with over 100 Paramount films launched this week on the platform as well as thousands of additional hours across TV and film arriving in current and coming months. 
And we will build on this incredible base of content, a catalog multiple times larger than many of the new SVOD entrants by expanding our original slate across the portfolio. This will bring first-window content from each of our brands to this platform. Our biggest franchises will be key to this strategy as will our broad programming strength across genres, from animation to sci-fi, comedy, reality, kids, crime procedurals and more. Add to that, national and local news from over 200 CBS affiliates, available both live and on-demand and a critical mass of live sports, including CBS network-delivered NFL, NCAA, PGA and more, plus exclusive streaming rights to major properties like women's soccer and UEFA. 
And we're doing all of this in a targeted, capital-efficient way. First, we are working from an already developed tech platform in CBS All Access. We are not building from scratch. Second, almost every dollar we invest in linear content across the company will benefit the service with varying windows. Third, our original strategy is designed to leverage our massive library of IP, fueling growth through a consistent and growing cadence of tent-pole series. 
Our experience makes clear that we can acquire new customers in a disciplined and economically efficient way while reducing churn and driving customer retention with a deep volume of entertainment, news and sports. 
Fourth, our distribution strategy benefits from existing, growing relationships. Across our pay and free products, we already have distribution deals with the likes of Comcast, AT&T and Verizon as well as with Amazon, Roku and other tech players. And we are in ongoing discussions with a broad range of partners to expand our streaming footprint in the coming months. 
And fifth and finally, we will leverage our ability to cross-promote at scale, where we will benefit from our #1 TV share in every demo as well as our strong digital reach, enabling ViacomCBS to promote to and draw customers into our offering in an impactful and cost-effective way. 
And going back to where I started, the promotional platform includes Pluto TV, a fast growth, broad reach gateway to the ViacomCBS streaming world. 
In addition to our domestic strategy, I should add that internationally, we will launch a broad pay streaming product in multiple markets over the next 12 months. This service will harness the full power of the ViacomCBS portfolio, creating a meaningful brand presence in streaming video in key markets around the world. 
So in sum, we are full speed ahead on streaming, seeing strong demand for our services today, with a strategy to achieve accelerated growth domestically and internationally in the months and years to come. For all those reasons and more, we're extremely excited about the future of ViacomCBS. We are unlocking the very substantial value of this extraordinary company, and the best is yet to come. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris."

I would first like to say that our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this pandemic. I want to acknowledge and thank the employees at ViacomCBS for their extreme care for well-being and resilience in this unprecedented time. I am proud to be a part of the tremendous team work currently taking place across our company, our industry and our communities. 
Specific to ViacomCBS, we are faced with a much different financial environment for this earnings call than just a quarter ago when we closed year-end 2019. We did realize solid results in Q1 2020, our first full quarter as a united company. Then at the end of the quarter, we pivoted to manage the risk from COVID-19, while continuing to focus on unlocking the value of ViacomCBS. 
Today, I will first take you through the actions taken to strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. Then I will walk you through our first quarter 2020 results, which demonstrate early evidence of the power of ViacomCBS. And finally, I will provide you with some insights into what we are seeing today stemming from COVID-19 effects and the actions we are taking to mitigate them. 
We are proactively managing through this crisis with the security of increased liquidity, while aggressively controlling our costs and preserving cash. At the same time, we are accelerating the momentum we are seeing in our streaming businesses to position ViacomCBS well for the future. 
Let's start with ViacomCBS' liquidity and balance sheet. Early on, we prioritized taking the necessary steps to ensure we have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to manage through this crisis. On April 1, we accessed the credit market and issued $2.5 billion of debt. Using the proceeds from this bond issuance, on May 4, we redeemed all of our $300 million of notes that were due in February 2021. And on May 18, we will redeem all of our $500 million of notes that are due in March 2021. The remaining $1.7 billion in proceeds from the bond issuance bolsters our liquidity in order to help us weather the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses. We also continue to have access to a $3.5 billion revolver, which remains undrawn and provides us with even more financial flexibility. 
As of March 31, 2020, when you take into account the $750 million of full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.1x. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and reaching our target leverage of 2.75x, including the benefit of full run rate synergies. 
We plan to use excess cash flow, after dividend payments, to delever the balance sheet until we reach that leverage ratio. We will not repurchase any of our shares until we complete our planned noncore asset sale. 
Let me update you on our 2 noncore asset sales. Our previously announced sale of Black Rock is temporarily on hold until we can allow potential buyers to continue to tour the building. We are also in the process of preparing for a sale of Simon & Schuster so that the asset is ready for divestiture when the market stabilizes. We are encouraged by the significant interest we have seen for both of these assets and look forward to proceeding as market conditions allow. 
Now turning to our financial performance. We achieved solid results for our first full quarter as a united company. Total company revenue was $6.67 billion, adjusted OIBDA was $1.26 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.13. The comparison to last year for all 3 metrics was affected by the broadcast of the Super Bowl and the NCAA men's basketball tournament in Q1 2019. Adjusted free cash flow of $478 million, which excludes $173 million of restructuring and merger-related payments, was a material improvement from Q4 2019 and a strong start to the year. 
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter, total company advertising was down 19% versus a year ago. However, advertising was up 2% after adjusting for a 21-point headwind resulting from comparisons to the Super Bowl and the COVID-related cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, which were in the year-ago period. Advertising growth was also impacted by a 100 basis point headwind from FX. 
The ad market was robust throughout the majority of the first quarter, with strength in prime time, news, political and cable as well as the benefit of historically high scatter pricing. We also saw continued strength in digital advertising across our ad-based streaming platforms. 
Affiliate revenue increased 1%, benefiting from strong retrans, reverse comp and subscription streaming revenue, which more than offset declines in cable network affiliate revenue and a 100 basis point headwind from FX. Importantly, the year-over-year change in Cable Network affiliate revenue in Q1 improved sequentially from Q4, with the domestic Cable Network affiliate rate of decline improving 270 basis points. 
Domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, was up an impressive 51% versus a year ago to $471 million. We reached new records in Q1 in sign-ups and streams on CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and in monthly active user growth in minutes viewed on Pluto. 
Turning to content licensing. Revenue grew 9% driven by growth in original studio production for third parties. Paramount Television Studios, CBS Television Studios and Cable Network Studios all benefited from strong deliveries during the quarter. Theatrical revenue was down 3% as strong results from Sonic the Hedgehog were more than offset by prior quarter revenues, which included carryover performance from Bumblebee. Theatrical revenue would have been higher had we released The Quiet Place Part II as scheduled on March 18. 
For publishing, revenue increased 4% reflecting growth from digital book and audio sales. Key titles in the quarter included Stephen King's If It Bleeds and The Outsider and Cassandra Clare's Chain of Gold. On the expense front, we benefited from merger-related cost synergies in the first quarter and are on track to realize $250 million in savings for the full year of 2020 before consideration of onetime cost to achieve them. 
Overall, we are pleased with the strong start for ViacomCBS' results in the first quarter of 2020. I would now like to give you some insight to the impact COVID-19 is having on our business. I will update you on what we are currently seeing in each of our revenue streams and explain the cost actions we had taken to partly offset the revenue headwinds. 
Based on our current assessment of the near-term impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses and assuming the U.S. economy begins to reopen early in the second half of 2020, we anticipate the second quarter will be the most significantly affected. 
Starting with advertising. While we are seeing material increases in ratings and engagement across all of our platforms, linear and digital alike, the COVID-19 shutdown is currently resulting in significantly lower ad demand in Q2 of 2020. The reduction in demand in the marketplace is being driven by macro uncertainty and temporary business closures as well as the postponement and cancellation of sporting events. Importantly, we continue to expect to benefit from political advertising later in 2020. 
Moving to affiliate revenue. As Bob discussed, we have had a productive quarter with several new distribution deals signed. While we expect some acceleration in linear subscriber declines in the near term, we will benefit from our recent affiliate deals and from the materially higher sign-ups and engagement we are experiencing across all of our streaming platforms. We expect domestic streaming subscribers to reach at least 16 million and domestic monthly active users on Pluto to reach at least 30 million by the end of 2020. 
In Q2, content licensing revenue in the cable segment will benefit from our South Park deal. However, the timing of deliveries and significant activity in the year-ago quarter in the TV entertainment segment will be a substantial offset. 
In regard to theatrical revenue, we had one significant film that was scheduled to be released at the end of Q1 2020, A Quiet Place Part II, which is now scheduled for September 4. Our 2 largest films that were scheduled to release in the second quarter have also been rescheduled. The SpongeBob movie, Sponge on the Run has been moved from May 22 to August 7, and Top Gun: Maverick has been moved from June 26 to December 23. We do not expect to release any new movies in the second quarter or until theaters reopen broadly. And we'll adjust release dates, if necessary, to maximize returns on our film content investments. 
In light of the impact of this crisis, we are highly focused on reducing our costs and preserving cash. The cost reductions fall into 3 areas. First, timing-related expense reductions from the lack of distribution or events. For example, this includes the absence of sports rights amortization for sports that have been canceled, the elimination of production costs associated with the current production shutdown and a delay in P&A for films not released. 
Secondly, we continue to make progress against the $750 million in annualized run rate cost synergies we identified as a result of our merger, including $250 million, which will be realized in 2020. 
And third, we are taking additional cost-cutting actions and implementing initiatives to reduce discretionary expenses. We are learning from this crisis and finding ways that we can operate even more efficiently. We see significant opportunities to realize sustainable financial benefits over the long term. 
In summary, we believe the steps we are taking, bolstering our liquidity, strengthening our commercial partnerships and streaming scale, all while aggressively managing our cost base will enable us to weather the financial effects of this crisis, emerging better positioned to build upon our strong consumer relevance, thereby creating significant shareholder value. 
With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

So that inventory hasn't gone to waste. We've also, in some cases, reduced load to improve the viewing environment and to maintain strong pricing. 
On a positive note, one of our largest clients came to market in Q2 with scatter dollars, and we know we got the largest share. So that's a good reflection on the power of the portfolio. It's also worth noting that we've seen in May and June scatter improve relative to April. So that's a good sign. And we do see categories continuing to be active in the market: pharmaceuticals, CPG, financial services, tech. And as we look to Q3, in particular, we'll also see live sports beginning to return. For us, the PGA starts on June 11 in Texas. We're seeing very strong demand for that and golf. And as you know, the NFL is releasing their schedule later today. So that's all a positive. 
Again, we're very well positioned against this backdrop, given our #1 position on linear television as well as our AMS portfolio. And the fact that through the integration we've done, we can now deliver all that to our customers on a single point of contact, which is important to the extent that some of our counterparties have either furloughed or reduced staffing. 
So we feel good. I mean -- so advertising's tough, but we do see some green shoots and feel good about our ability to maximize that as they grow. 
With respect to YouTube, yes, thank you. We are very happy about that deal. But the quarter was not just about YouTube. We've had very strong activity in terms of renewals in the quarter and subsequent to the quarter's end, Comcast, Verizon, YouTube, all examples of the power of the combination, something we're quickly beginning to unlock. 
Big picture, we're seeing very strong consumption that underscores consumer demand for our products across platforms. On linear, remember, #1 in TV share, #1 in all key demos, that is -- and in this COVID time, in particular, very strong consumption, benefiting brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., BET, Comedy Central, obviously underscores the value of our product and also great momentum on streaming. We talked about that in my prepared remarks, real positive trends in sign-ups and actually conversions on All Access and Showtime OTT. So the portfolio is very strong. 
In terms of the deals, Comcast, first MVPD to add All Access. We're actually launching that today on Xfinity. Verizon, our first true cross-company, cross-portfolio MVPD deal, very happy with the economics. And that Pluto component is very significant in terms of Verizon wireless distribution and now YouTube, multiyear deal, includes an extension for CBS and Showtime and the addition of Viacom Media Networks very soon, 14 networks. That fills a key vMVPD white space for our company. That's obviously important. But it's also a win for them because it brings our #1 TV portfolio to their platform. And as they look at the next leg of their sub growth, that will benefit them. So very happy with all that."

I'm wondering if you have any updated thought on that level of spend. And any updates on how you're thinking of sort of the evolution of how you allocate that given the breadth of distribution options that you have, any place you're putting more to work or maybe pulling back any? And then second, I'm curious about the advertising pacing at Pluto TV in particular. You guys disclosed each of your digital metrics were up 50% plus in the quarter if I sort of parse that a little bit. Can you talk about how Pluto is pacing on a relative basis and whether you've seen any -- whether it's held up better or maybe been a little softer in the sort of COVID-driven disruption?"
27763231,662460208,1976622,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes. Sure, Michael. So on content, the company has a very substantial content asset. That includes current production through Paramount, CBS, Viacom Media Networks as well as a huge library. And the $13 billion cash content spend that we've referred to in",472,"Yes. Sure, Michael. So on content, the company has a very substantial content asset. That includes current production through Paramount, CBS, Viacom Media Networks as well as a huge library. And the $13 billion cash content spend that we've referred to in the past is a very material number. Relative to that number, we expect COVID to result in some reduction in overall content expenses in 2020. Now that's driven by the cancellation of certain events, say, the NCAAs, as an example, the reduction in number of episodes of certain seasons -- series, so CBS prime. A lot of those series only delivered 18 episodes versus the planned 22 because we have to shut down production early. And we did move some films out of 2020. So all those things will reduce the 13, but that's really a 2020 issue. It's not a planned change in run rate. 
Now in terms of that aggregate spend, we continue to prioritize investments in our owned and operated platforms. And that includes streaming with a growth emphasis on streaming as we shift mix from lower- to higher-growth sectors. With respect to streaming, our biggest franchises will be key to that strategy as well as our broad programming strength really across genres, genres being kids, animations, crime procedurals, et cetera. And so we will be prioritizing those programming areas for our owned and operated platforms. 
That said, we will continue to selectively license to third parties. It's a big market. Playing in that market has multiple benefits, not just revenue, but also expanding the reach of IP to new fans, it benefits the franchise and related businesses like consumer products, like setting up for theatricals, et cetera. We're doing that in a very strategic way. So we're not going to license critical mass of any of our key programming areas, kids, procedurals, et cetera, to any single player. 
Likewise, again, we're prioritizing franchise IP to our owned platforms. And regardless of what we do in the licensing space, remember, ultimately, these deals are rentals. The IP does revert back. So that's how we're thinking about it, Mike. 
In terms of Pluto, I referenced that digital was weaker, but digital is an aggregation of a lot of different things. We continue to see fantastic advertiser reception for the Pluto product. It really is the closest thing to linear television on the planet. And if you've seen Pluto in the last month with our Venetia upgrade, the product is fantastic. The presentation is improved. And by the way, the ad guts behind it are also upgraded. So we continue to see strong demand, certainly strong demand in the first quarter. We're doing fine in the second quarter, again, against a general softer backdrop, which everybody is seeing. But we continue to love the asset and advertisers do, too."

And we do anticipate that, that sale will complete in 2020. For Simon & Schuster, we're currently preparing to make available for sale when the market conditions allow. 
So as we look at our capital allocation plan relative to thinking about how we use our cash, it's organic free cash flow generation, which we will benefit from the near-term production shutdown. It will be a benefit near term to free cash flow. But then also with the proceeds we get from the asset sales, we will look to pay down our debt to achieve the 2.75x leverage ratio."

And those are studios, networks and streaming. And that gives us a very clear lens to look through to consider whether assets fit or not. Based on that, again, it's clear that Black Rock, which is an iconic office building in New York, but doesn't fit any of those 3 categories, and Simon & Schuster, which is a preeminent publisher and an extraordinary company, again, doesn't fit any of those segments. So those are noncore, even though they're super high-quality assets. And again, we've had lots of interest in them. 
But when you look at that framework through the rest of the assets we own, the company really has a pretty compelling combination. So COVID hasn't changed our view on strategic asset composition in anything -- if anything, it's reinforced it. We believe the combination of studios, networks and streaming makes enormous synergistic sense together."

So in terms of affiliate, I think probably the best way to think about it is, if you look at pay subs, we saw stable trends in Q1 relative to Q4. That said, given what we're hearing and people are talking about in Q2, we do expect some modest incremental cord cutting. But importantly, our deal with YouTube will more than offset that when it kicks in this summer. So that's to your question of outperformance. 
Also on the domestic cable affiliate revenue side, as you know, we got a nice improvement in rate of change between Q4 and Q1. Q2 might move back a bit given what I just mentioned on sub trends. Again, we don't know what that actually is, but there's possibility. But given the deals we have locked in as of today, we see further improvement in the second half of the year on the domestic cable affiliate revenue trend line. So that's to your question on outperformance. 
Look, on streaming profitability, again, we're not giving guidance, certainly not into 2020 COVID environment. I can tell you that we are -- it really it's all about the mix of content expenditures across the company and continuing to remix from investment towards higher-growth areas that includes streaming. In the short term, there's a lot of incremental content that we're bringing to the platform that is existing content. And then over time, there'll be growing original content on the streaming side. But again, that's largely a mix. And again, as we look at a business plan for streaming, both in free and pay and more importantly, on this integrated linked ecosystem, we're very excited about what we see tracking out over the coming years. 
Finally, on Q3 ad sales, again, based on everything we see today, we believe Q3 ad sales will be better than Q2. And again, right now, May and June scatter looked better than April. So that's a good sign. We do see categories active in the market, again, pharma, CPG, financial services, tech. We do see for sure demand for sports, starting with this June 11 PGA event. And these PGA events are sort of staggered in kind of more open states, if you will, and locations. So we feel good about that. We have a very specific production plan for those, which we believe mitigates risk. And we're definitely seeing strong demand for that. 
So -- and again, it speaks to the power of the portfolio, the fact that we can serve advertisers through our #1 linear position across really all genres, add in Pluto and other high-quality digital assets and importantly, deliver it through a single point of customer contact. I think that will be even more important as we negotiate, say, this virtual upfronts. So that's what I'm seeing."

I'm wondering with literally no sports on TV, does the leverage with distributors sort of shift a little bit? At least until sports come back, it would seem like Viacom is a pretty large portion of overall content on the air right now. Then on the movie business, you're talking about putting up movies later this year. Some of your peers have moved films into literally a year, if not more. Do you really plan to put out movies if they can't generate hundreds of millions of dollars of box office? Like how are you going to make the decision of whether to really put things out in August, September versus delay until August or September of '21?

But with that caveat, so we are seeing incredible consumption of ViacomCBS content in the current environment. And that's both our broadcast linear CBS, that is our cable assets, including like Nick Jr. and Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, [ Trevor's Killing It ], et cetera. So yes, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. And by the way, as I said, our streaming services, which we also increasingly, call it, package into our relationship with our distributors are performing very well. So does that tilt in our favor at the moment? 
Yes, probably. We, by the way, also look forward to bringing live sports back, and we're going to be one of the first with golf, the nature of golf probably makes that a little bit simpler than some of the other sports. By the way, we set up a sound stage in Radford, the CBS lot to film both boxing and Bellator events, which we're going to use that soundstage to sequentially alternately produce those, albeit with no audience for the moment. So we're going to do some sports stuff around the edges. 
But yes, look, I like our position. I think the portfolio is very powerful. You see that starting to come to life with the deals I've already talked about, and I feel good about our trajectory going forward. 
With respect to movies, yes, we moved them later. We thought that was the right thing to do to preserve asset value. We obviously look at the market and look at what it will be at a point in time, and we'll make a decision if there's sufficient critical mass of screens, if you will, theaters to warrant opening a film. Our first film on the schedule is SpongeBob at the beginning of August. I think it's August 7. So it's too far out to call if that's definitely going to be released or it's definitely not going to be released. 
We hope it will release, but we will continue to look at and make the right decision in terms of the return on those assets because we got great films. I mean, whether it's Quiet Place Part II, which we premiered in New York 2 weeks before the crisis, and we pulled at the last minute, thank God we did because the film is incredible. And we didn't waste it. We saved it. Likewise, Top Gun: Maverick is off the chart. So -- but we're going to open them when it makes sense to open them, Rich. 
Lastly, on ad sales, look, we're not going to -- I'm not going to give you a domestic number. I can tell you it's not as bad as what Fox is saying, that's for sure, but it's not pretty either. But as far as a specific number, no, I'm not going to do that."

So international, I'd say, overall, the dynamics are similar to the U.S. And what I mean by that is escalated content consumption, both linear and streamed, soft ad market and us focusing on cost management.

So international, I'd say, overall, the dynamics are similar to the U.S. And what I mean by that is escalated content consumption, both linear and streamed, soft ad market and us focusing on cost management. 
In terms of advertising, Q1 was really a story of U.K. market under pressure. Spain also, Australia was actually up. Q2 is pretty soft across the board. And I would say that international is softer than domestic. And probably a way to think about it is we talk about this 2% growth number in Q1. The domestic number is better than that. The international number was a headwind for it. 
Importantly, in international, we are -- we now have 2 offices open, Beijing and Hong Kong. So things are moving forward. And that is both a light at the end of the tunnel but also a great way for us to get experience with facility reopening, which we have a big kind of working group on that. So we're prepped for it. 
And then on the international side, importantly, we continue to see new opportunities coming out of the merger when we think big picture. It might take us a little longer to realize them, but they're definitely there, things like bringing operating expertise from Channel 5 and Telefe to Network 10, things like bringing CBS' massive television library and production to Viacom International Media Networks distribution across MVPDs, OTT, mobile partners. And as we move forward on streaming, again, we see a real international opportunity, which leverages the combined company asset base, and it's more than seeing it. We have plans to go after it, as I said, in multiple markets over the next 12 months. 
With respect to production, we have a multifaceted plan in place for restarting production, which we believe will leave us well positioned with fresh product in the fall in both TV and film. And we also have a range of contingencies we can deploy. 
To your question on CBS, CBS has a very strong and stable schedule. We announced a renewal of over 80% of that slate yesterday. That's got a bunch of benefits, including the fact that in this virtual upfront time whenever it moves, advertisers will know what they're buying from us, and some of the other networks are not in that place. 
In terms of our return to production, a couple of things I'd highlight. One is because there was a possibility of a writer strike, we ensured we had a backlog of shows ready to go. So that's an asset we can draw on. In addition, if you start segmenting different kinds of production, sound stage-based productions, things like sitcoms, that's a more controllable environment. So we feel good about that. Dramas, again, if you look at it, there will likely be limitations. We can probably front-load production the components that are on sound stages and leave location to later. That's how we're thinking about it if need be. On the unscripted side, we can also modify productions to include more controllable environments. 
In terms of sports, we believe live sports will return. I talked about golf and the NFL probably in a modified form, but we believe they'll be there. And so we're optimistic that our fall schedule won't be materially disrupted, again, assuming we can get back in production sometime this summer. 
Know that in the interim, we continue to operate in a modified model. That includes using virtual productions. You've seen a bunch of those on air to keep news, late night and other shows going. To the extent we see gaps in production volume, we do have broad and deep libraries, including the recent addition of Miramax, which we can deploy on our platforms. Current example of this is the use of Paramount titles for a new CBS Sunday night at the movies, which started in May. That's filling in for a shortened season of NCIS derivatives back to the 18 episodes versus 22. 
On the Paramount side, we've completed principal photography on 8 films right before the crisis. Those include Without Remorse, Snake Eyes, Clifford, Coming to America, Top Gun, [ Infinite Tomorrow World ] and Spell. So those are all being worked on remotely in post production. So we will be in good shape when things open up. Likewise, Showtime is currently set and solid through Q3. So it's a bit of a fluid situation, but we spent a lot of time looking at not only return to facilities, but return to production, and we're confident that we'll have compelling content on in the fall."

It's not global, no advertising capabilities like your other businesses. I wonder is it a long-term core asset? One of the moves you made at Viacom was selling EPIX right away. So how does Showtime fit into your long-term vision? And secondly, if you look at your competitors in streaming, they all pulled back some big titles Peacock, Office, Friends, HBO MAX. I wondered, will you pull back some of the big library content that sits on Netflix or in a perfect world, would have you pulled back South Park from licensing that. So just give me a sense of that philosophy."

One is it for sure, fits in the strategic paradigm that I outlined of studios, networks and streaming. In fact, it's all 3. And the second thing I'd say on Showtime is we talked about some issues with Showtime circa '19, but our 2020 plan is all about turning around the performance with respect to earnings and cash flow, and we feel good about our trajectory there. And it's important to note it has real momentum on subscribers, particularly over the top. Showtime had its best quarter ever in sign-ups and consumption in Q1. And we've seen acceleration in sign-ups, time watched and total streams in April. And the conversion of free to pay as it's accelerated, i.e., more trials, we're seeing the same or better conversion rates. So that's all good, and we do have a lot of momentum on the programming side. 
With respect to streaming, I talked about our strategy a bit in my prepared remarks. And from a content perspective, again, we're very excited about where we're taking this. 
If you look at Pluto, it's a massive free gateway to our streaming ecosystem. We are going to continue to build that out. That has both owned and operated and third-party content on it. The content offering in ours is definitely weighted towards third party. Our content on it is definitely library, and that's working well. 
In respect to our pay product, which is more where your question would show up, we're in the middle of transforming CBS All Access into this much more compelling product that includes news, live sports and on-demand entertainment. So your question would really apply largely to on-demand entertainment. Again, we put over 100 Paramount films there this week. You will see a major move this summer, where we'll introduce a fundamentally new UI and add substantial content assets. As we do that, we are prioritizing franchises and importantly, critical mass of programming in genres, whether it's animation and kids or it's crime, et cetera, for O&O. 
We will continue to selectively license outside of that. So we may put a little kids somewhere on one platform, a little bit on another. But in terms of critical mass and in terms of big franchises, we're going to increasingly lean into that for our owned and operated platforms. We think that's a strategy that will create a very compelling streaming product and sort of trajectory for that element -- that portion of our business as well as allow us to continue to participate in a licensing market where there continues to be a lot of demand.
Look, guys, I really want to thank you for your questions and taking time with us in this strange time we're all living in. I want to close by saying ViacomCBS is a resilient company. We are well positioned to navigate the crisis, and we're really just beginning to tap the potential of our combined assets. 
To that end, you look at Q1, you look at the time since then, remember, we only closed this deal in December, but there are already multiple proof points to the power of the ViacomCBS combination. That includes recent affiliate deals. We talked about them today. Our cross-company use of content, we talked about today and very material cost synergies, which will probably increase as we move forward, leveraging our experience in COVID. 
Again, the first quarter and the weeks following demonstrated that our content is in demand in all kinds of formats. We did take aggressive steps to reduce costs, improve financial flexibility and frankly, strengthen our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Our growing scale, audience reach and earnings power will become more apparent as this market rebounds, and we put the full power of our portfolio behind the company, including behind our streaming strategy. 
So look, thanks, everyone, for your continued support. Stay well, and we look forward to seeing you in person, hopefully, sometime soon."

Our thoughts are with all who are affected worldwide and especially those who have lost loved ones. To the heroes on the front line of first response in healthcare and to all the essential workers, we owe you a debt of thanks. I also want to thank ViacomCBS employees around the world for their adaptive creativity and continued focus on serving our audiences, commercial partners and shareholders amid these unprecedented times.
Let me now dive into our first quarter earnings call. Today, there are 3 headlines. First, ViacomCBS delivered a solid quarter with clear operating momentum and sequential improvement on key financial metrics. Second, we're proactively managing through the COVID-19 crisis, supporting our employees and communities while strengthening our financial flexibility, reducing costs and ensuring business continuity. And third, we remain consistently focused on value creation and are acting swiftly to execute against cost and revenue opportunities that will create both immediate and lasting benefits.
I'll start with Q1 2020, our first full quarter as a combined company, one where we made significant progress unlocking the value of our must-watch content across multiple platforms globally and at scale. We integrated our commercial teams to provide partners the strength of our combined asset base. We made progress capturing the run rate merger-related cost synergies we committed to, and we saw strong momentum in streaming, momentum we will build on.
Examples of our progress include key operating wins. Among them, the continued strength of our domestic media networks, which held the highest share of TV viewing in all key audience demos. This leadership starts with broadcast. CBS will finish the season as America's most-watched network for the 12th straight year. CBS was #1 in all key day parts in the quarter, with 5 of the 6 top comedies, the top 2 dramas, the #1 news program and the #1 late-night show, plus 5 of the top 6 freshman series. In sports, the 2019 season of the NFL on CBS delivered its largest audience in 3 years.
We also maintained our leadership as the #1-rated cable portfolio in total day, owning nearly half of the top 30 original series in the key 18 to 34 demographic and 9 of the top 10 kids series, thanks to Nickelodeon. Of note, Comedy Central marked its 12th straight quarter of year-over-year share growth, driven by the #1 late-night talk show with millennials. And Showtime scored the top 2 scripted shows on premium cable, including the #1 comedy and the #1 drama.
Internationally, we continue to build on a global footprint that includes 192 million broadcast homes, the largest in the world. Our broadcast cornerstones Network Ten in Australia and Telefe in Argentina have each produced strong year-over-year share gains.
This was also our strongest streaming quarter ever, a milestone that was on track even before the COVID-19 crisis, putting us well on our way to meet the subscriber and user targets we laid out last quarter. Pluto TV continues to lead the U.S. in free streaming TV as the platform delivered its best quarter ever. Pluto domestic monthly active users grew 55% year-over-year to more than 24 million as of quarter end, with even stronger gains in total consumption.
On top of that, our domestic pay streaming offerings also grew robustly, with subscribers totaling 13.5 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of 50% year-over-year driven by original hit programming from CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Both services broke their own records for sign-ups, streams and time watched in the quarter. Overall, this growth in both pay and free drove a strong increase in domestic streaming and digital revenue in the quarter, which was up more than 50% versus a year ago.
And the appeal of our streaming and digital offerings has been made even more clear over the last 6 weeks, where we've seen a strong acceleration in momentum across both free and pay as audiences follow stay-at-home guidelines.
We also demonstrated the strength of the ViacomCBS portfolio by striking new agreements with our partners in the quarter and in the weeks since. For example, CBS reached a deal with the NFL to broadcast one additional wildcard game in 2021 as part of the NFL's playoff expansion with a live stream on CBS All Access and a separately produced telecast on Nickelodeon, tailored for a younger audience. This is a perfect example of how our partners are using our combined asset base to grow the footprint and reach a diverse audience.
We've also made important strides in domestic distribution, where we struck significant carriage agreements. Earlier this year, we announced that Comcast would become the first MVPD to launch CBS All Access. I'm pleased to share that we actually began rolling out on their Xfinity platform today. And in March, we reached multiyear CBS renewals with 2 of our largest affiliates, Nexstar and Meredith.
In April, we closed our first true combined company affiliate deal with Verizon. This, despite the fact that Viacom and CBS deals were not coterminous going in. This agreement marks a truly comprehensive, multi-platform partnership spanning pay TV, connected TV and mobile. And it will drive a tremendous expansion of Pluto's distribution footprint.
And today, we're announcing a new deal with YouTube TV. This deal not only renews CBS and Showtime early but will shortly bring Viacom's Cable Networks to the high-growth YouTube TV platform. To state the obvious, this fills in a key white space for our Cable Networks distribution and is a clear proof point for the ViacomCBS combination.
Meanwhile, in film, Paramount scored a bona fide hit with Sonic the Hedgehog, which means we have a new franchise to build on. Worldwide, the film earned more than $300 million at the box office and was made available for digital on demand March 31, setting Paramount's record for first-day digital sales and became the studio's all-time record holder in less than 3 weeks. The title has now sold nearly 2 million EFT units worldwide, and it's also exceeding expectations on VOD.
These operational highlights and more drove key financial wins in the quarter. Chris will cover our results in detail in a moment, but I do want to highlight a few items.
On the revenue side, excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, advertising grew 2% year-over-year. Affiliate revenue also increased year-over-year. And we improved the rate of change in domestic Cable Networks affiliate revenue by 270 basis points sequentially.
In addition, ViacomCBS delivered sequential improvement across all key earnings and cash flow-related metrics, including operating income, adjusted OIBDA, reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow, which is back to a material positive of almost $0.5 billion, again indicating the progress we made in our first full quarter and demonstrating our commitment to strengthening our financial position and creating shareholder value.
Just as the quarter was ending, we were, of course, faced with the COVID-19 crisis. I want to spend a few minutes sharing with you how we are proactively managing through this. As COVID spread to the U.S., we quickly moved to ensure we had the financial flexibility and balance sheet strength to weather a sustained crisis. 
To that end, we issued $2.5 billion of bonds in April. Add in our strong cash flow in the quarter and our undrawn committed $3.5 billion revolver, and it means we are in excellent shape from a liquidity perspective.
We have also taken a series of significant cost-reduction measures to mitigate COVID-related revenue impacts for the year. At the same time, we ramped up our focus on business continuity, including significantly adjusting operations around the 3 most affected areas: production, ad sales and film.
Like most media companies, we have seen an almost total shutdown in production, but we are managing through employing alternate virtual models in some cases and leveraging current and library products from across the company in others. Because of this, we continue to have captivating content on air, and there will be substantial near-term cash flow savings.
As we look to the balance of the year on the production side, we expect little impact to our on-air product, particularly given the stability of our schedules assuming we can get back in production, albeit with modifications by mid-summer.
In ad sales, we've seen advertisers in significantly affected categories temporarily pull back spend. But we are working closely with our clients to mitigate the impact. At this point, we know there will be a significant impact on ad sales in Q2. But based on what we're seeing today, we will -- we believe there will be an improvement in advertising in the third and fourth quarters, assuming businesses begin to reopen at scale.
In terms of the upfront, we expect it to be later and longer than normal. But we're ready whenever our clients are, and deals will get done. In fact, this week, we invited more than 5,000 agency and marketing executives to our virtual presentation on May 18 and 19.
Regarding film, we have shifted our slate later into '20 and '21 to preserve its value. We also sold The Lovebirds to Netflix, where we saw an attractive monetization opportunity in the early COVID environment. And while our film business will, of course, be dependent on theaters reopening in major markets, from a cash perspective, the delay in revenues is substantially offset by the COVID-driven production shutdown.
Finally, I want to highlight the support we are providing for our employees, audiences and communities amidst this pandemic. A key priority is the health and well-being of our employees and their families. In March, we moved the vast majority of our employee base to work from home, something that has worked incredibly well with very limited exceptions for critical operations and facility staff, who continue to work on-site under strict safety protocols.
We've also committed $100 million for relief for non-staff employees and freelancers, whose livelihoods have been especially affected by the pause in our production. And I'm proud of how ViacomCBS has come together to deploy our platforms for COVID-19 consumer education and relief from our enormously successful PSA campaigns like #AloneTogether to the specials we've aired to help raise money for the cause.
All of this to say, I'm enormously grateful to all our employees for their initiative, creativity and courage at this time in adapting and thriving under the toughest of circumstances to ensure we can continue to entertain and inform audiences everywhere. It goes without saying that we are all looking forward to getting on the other side of this crisis. But through it all, we are focused on creating value by executing our strategy and looking to continued cost and revenue opportunities that will create both immediate and lasting benefit.
This starts with what we see as an even larger cost opportunity for the company. In addition to onetime COVID-related cost reductions I mentioned earlier, we remain on track with our committed annualized run rate synergy target of $750 million over the next 3 years. In fact, we now see a greater opportunity to create sustained financial benefit on top of the $750 million, informed by how we've had to rethink our operations over the past 6 weeks.
We have proven we can do more with less and can operate without being physically co-located. As a result, we are now exploring opportunities to further consolidate facilities, migrate more activities to lower-cost locations and increase sharing of capabilities, all to further leverage our scale.
Beyond cost, we are unlocking revenue opportunities across the combined company. In distribution, we've only scratched the surface of what ViacomCBS can do on an integrated basis to unlock additional opportunities with both traditional and new distributors.
On the advertising front, the combination of our #1 linear position and our high-growth advanced ad solutions, all delivered through an efficient single point of customer contact, means we are extremely well positioned for the rebound associated with the return to business. Importantly, we overwhelmingly serve national advertisers, a segment that should rebound first.
In sports, we will benefit from the enormous pent-up viewer demand, starting with the return of golf as the PGA Tour plans to resume its schedule in June. And at Paramount, we will be ready with a set of amazing films, including A Quiet Place Part II, SpongeBob: Sponge on the Run and Top Gun: Maverick that will be big hits once they're released.
Finally, there's no question the crisis has proven the power of streaming, and we are moving quickly to seize this significant revenue opportunity. We know fundamental consumer needs around quality, convenience and cost are driving changes in how they consume content, and we're focused on addressing all 3 needs. Building off our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our platforms, we will capitalize on our positions across free and pay, adding substantial content assets and user experience enhancements supported by marketing to serve consumers with a robust, differentiated suite of link streaming offering.
We will continue to build on Pluto TV's #1 position in free streaming. Pluto TV is a great platform for consumers who want a free high-quality TV experience, whether on a smart TV or a mobile device. In March, we rolled out Pluto's most significant product upgrade ever, delivering new features and design changes that further enhanced the platform's ease of use. And with the continued addition of new content partners, it offers consumers a superior experience relative to the other free services in or entering the marketplace. 
And we are expanding Pluto's reach, both in the U.S. and internationally, including 2 important deals with not only Verizon but also with Xbox and Roku. Pluto now has a growing presence in the U.K., Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as in Latin America, where Pluto's April launch brought over 12,000 hours of content to 17 countries. And over the next 12 months, we expect to roll out Pluto in Brazil, Spain, France and Italy.
The Pluto TV platform is powerful, and the world is quickly embracing it. But you shouldn't just think of it as a standalone service. It is also key to our integrated streaming strategy, where it will serve as an important complement to and funnel for our pay services. 
In June, we will introduce click-through ad units on Pluto embedded in relevant content to allow users to subscribe to CBS All Access. As time goes on, this integration will continue to evolve as we create an owned and operated streaming ecosystem with a massive free point of entry combined with upsell pay option. 
And speaking of pay, we are accelerating our plans for an expanded subscription service, building off our CBS All Access platform with major changes coming this summer as we track towards the rebrand and relaunch of a transformed product. We believe audiences want their entertainment on demand and their news, sports and events live. And through our expanded offering, we will be the service that gives them what they want, how they want it, all in one place and at a great value. 
This will be a compelling foundational service for some consumers and a differentiated complement to what some other consumers already have. On the entertainment side, we start with what All Access has today: CBS network programming, a very deep CBS on-demand library and an expanding slate of originals, add to that content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, Smithsonian, MTV, BET and Paramount. This starts with over 100 Paramount films launched this week on the platform as well as thousands of additional hours across TV and film arriving in current and coming months. 
And we will build on this incredible base of content, a catalog multiple times larger than many of the new SVOD entrants by expanding our original slate across the portfolio. This will bring first-window content from each of our brands to this platform. Our biggest franchises will be key to this strategy as will our broad programming strength across genres, from animation to sci-fi, comedy, reality, kids, crime procedurals and more. Add to that, national and local news from over 200 CBS affiliates, available both live and on-demand and a critical mass of live sports, including CBS network-delivered NFL, NCAA, PGA and more, plus exclusive streaming rights to major properties like women's soccer and UEFA. 
And we're doing all of this in a targeted, capital-efficient way. First, we are working from an already developed tech platform in CBS All Access. We are not building from scratch. Second, almost every dollar we invest in linear content across the company will benefit the service with varying windows. Third, our original strategy is designed to leverage our massive library of IP, fueling growth through a consistent and growing cadence of tent-pole series. 
Our experience makes clear that we can acquire new customers in a disciplined and economically efficient way while reducing churn and driving customer retention with a deep volume of entertainment, news and sports. 
Fourth, our distribution strategy benefits from existing, growing relationships. Across our pay and free products, we already have distribution deals with the likes of Comcast, AT&T and Verizon as well as with Amazon, Roku and other tech players. And we are in ongoing discussions with a broad range of partners to expand our streaming footprint in the coming months. 
And fifth and finally, we will leverage our ability to cross-promote at scale, where we will benefit from our #1 TV share in every demo as well as our strong digital reach, enabling ViacomCBS to promote to and draw customers into our offering in an impactful and cost-effective way. 
And going back to where I started, the promotional platform includes Pluto TV, a fast growth, broad reach gateway to the ViacomCBS streaming world. 
In addition to our domestic strategy, I should add that internationally, we will launch a broad pay streaming product in multiple markets over the next 12 months. This service will harness the full power of the ViacomCBS portfolio, creating a meaningful brand presence in streaming video in key markets around the world. 
So in sum, we are full speed ahead on streaming, seeing strong demand for our services today, with a strategy to achieve accelerated growth domestically and internationally in the months and years to come. For all those reasons and more, we're extremely excited about the future of ViacomCBS. We are unlocking the very substantial value of this extraordinary company, and the best is yet to come. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris."

I would first like to say that our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this pandemic. I want to acknowledge and thank the employees at ViacomCBS for their extreme care for well-being and resilience in this unprecedented time. I am proud to be a part of the tremendous team work currently taking place across our company, our industry and our communities. 
Specific to ViacomCBS, we are faced with a much different financial environment for this earnings call than just a quarter ago when we closed year-end 2019. We did realize solid results in Q1 2020, our first full quarter as a united company. Then at the end of the quarter, we pivoted to manage the risk from COVID-19, while continuing to focus on unlocking the value of ViacomCBS.
Today, I will first take you through the actions taken to strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. Then I will walk you through our first quarter 2020 results, which demonstrate early evidence of the power of ViacomCBS. And finally, I will provide you with some insights into what we are seeing today stemming from COVID-19 effects and the actions we are taking to mitigate them. 
We are proactively managing through this crisis with the security of increased liquidity, while aggressively controlling our costs and preserving cash. At the same time, we are accelerating the momentum we are seeing in our streaming businesses to position ViacomCBS well for the future. 
Let's start with ViacomCBS' liquidity and balance sheet. Early on, we prioritized taking the necessary steps to ensure we have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to manage through this crisis. On April 1, we accessed the credit market and issued $2.5 billion of debt. Using the proceeds from this bond issuance, on May 4, we redeemed all of our $300 million of notes that were due in February 2021. And on May 18, we will redeem all of our $500 million of notes that are due in March 2021. The remaining $1.7 billion in proceeds from the bond issuance bolsters our liquidity in order to help us weather the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses. We also continue to have access to a $3.5 billion revolver, which remains undrawn and provides us with even more financial flexibility. 
As of March 31, 2020, when you take into account the $750 million of full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.1x. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and reaching our target leverage of 2.75x, including the benefit of full run rate synergies. 
We plan to use excess cash flow, after dividend payments, to delever the balance sheet until we reach that leverage ratio. We will not repurchase any of our shares until we complete our planned noncore asset sale. 
Let me update you on our 2 noncore asset sales. Our previously announced sale of Black Rock is temporarily on hold until we can allow potential buyers to continue to tour the building. We are also in the process of preparing for a sale of Simon & Schuster so that the asset is ready for divestiture when the market stabilizes. We are encouraged by the significant interest we have seen for both of these assets and look forward to proceeding as market conditions allow.
Now turning to our financial performance. We achieved solid results for our first full quarter as a united company. Total company revenue was $6.67 billion, adjusted OIBDA was $1.26 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.13. The comparison to last year for all 3 metrics was affected by the broadcast of the Super Bowl and the NCAA men's basketball tournament in Q1 2019. Adjusted free cash flow of $478 million, which excludes $173 million of restructuring and merger-related payments, was a material improvement from Q4 2019 and a strong start to the year. 
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter, total company advertising was down 19% versus a year ago. However, advertising was up 2% after adjusting for a 21-point headwind resulting from comparisons to the Super Bowl and the COVID-related cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, which were in the year-ago period. Advertising growth was also impacted by a 100 basis point headwind from FX. 
The ad market was robust throughout the majority of the first quarter, with strength in prime time, news, political and cable as well as the benefit of historically high scatter pricing. We also saw continued strength in digital advertising across our ad-based streaming platforms. 
Affiliate revenue increased 1%, benefiting from strong retrans, reverse comp and subscription streaming revenue, which more than offset declines in cable network affiliate revenue and a 100 basis point headwind from FX. Importantly, the year-over-year change in Cable Network affiliate revenue in Q1 improved sequentially from Q4, with the domestic Cable Network affiliate rate of decline improving 270 basis points. 
Domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, was up an impressive 51% versus a year ago to $471 million. We reached new records in Q1 in sign-ups and streams on CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and in monthly active user growth in minutes viewed on Pluto. 
Turning to content licensing. Revenue grew 9% driven by growth in original studio production for third parties. Paramount Television Studios, CBS Television Studios and Cable Network Studios all benefited from strong deliveries during the quarter. Theatrical revenue was down 3% as strong results from Sonic the Hedgehog were more than offset by prior quarter revenues, which included carryover performance from Bumblebee. Theatrical revenue would have been higher had we released The Quiet Place Part II as scheduled on March 18. 
For publishing, revenue increased 4% reflecting growth from digital book and audio sales. Key titles in the quarter included Stephen King's If It Bleeds and The Outsider and Cassandra Clare's Chain of Gold. On the expense front, we benefited from merger-related cost synergies in the first quarter and are on track to realize $250 million in savings for the full year of 2020 before consideration of onetime cost to achieve them. 
Overall, we are pleased with the strong start for ViacomCBS' results in the first quarter of 2020. I would now like to give you some insight to the impact COVID-19 is having on our business. I will update you on what we are currently seeing in each of our revenue streams and explain the cost actions we had taken to partly offset the revenue headwinds. 
Based on our current assessment of the near-term impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses and assuming the U.S. economy begins to reopen early in the second half of 2020, we anticipate the second quarter will be the most significantly affected. 
Starting with advertising. While we are seeing material increases in ratings and engagement across all of our platforms, linear and digital alike, the COVID-19 shutdown is currently resulting in significantly lower ad demand in Q2 of 2020. The reduction in demand in the marketplace is being driven by macro uncertainty and temporary business closures as well as the postponement and cancellation of sporting events. Importantly, we continue to expect to benefit from political advertising later in 2020. 
Moving to affiliate revenue. As Bob discussed, we have had a productive quarter with several new distribution deals signed. While we expect some acceleration in linear subscriber declines in the near term, we will benefit from our recent affiliate deals and from the materially higher sign-ups and engagement we are experiencing across all of our streaming platforms. We expect domestic streaming subscribers to reach at least 16 million and domestic monthly active users on Pluto to reach at least 30 million by the end of 2020. 
In Q2, content licensing revenue in the cable segment will benefit from our South Park deal. However, the timing of deliveries and significant activity in the year ago quarter in the TV entertainment segment will be a substantial offset. 
In regard to theatrical revenue, we had one significant film that was scheduled to be released at the end of Q1 2020, A Quiet Place Part II, which is now scheduled for September 4. Our 2 largest films that were scheduled to release in the second quarter have also been rescheduled. The SpongeBob movie, Sponge on the Run has been moved from May 22 to August 7, and Top Gun: Maverick has been moved from June 26 to December 23. We do not expect to release any new movies in the second quarter or until theaters reopen broadly. And we'll adjust release dates, if necessary, to maximize returns on our film content investments. 
In light of the impact of this crisis, we are highly focused on reducing our costs and preserving cash. The cost reductions fall into 3 areas. First, timing-related expense reductions from the lack of distribution or events. For example, this includes the absence of sports rights amortization for sports that have been canceled, the elimination of production costs associated with the current production shutdown and a delay in P&A for films not released. 
Secondly, we continue to make progress against the $750 million in annualized run rate cost synergies we identified as a result of our merger, including $250 million, which will be realized in 2020. 
And third, we are taking additional cost-cutting actions and implementing initiatives to reduce discretionary expenses. We are learning from this crisis and finding ways that we can operate even more efficiently. We see significant opportunities to realize sustainable financial benefits over long term. 
In summary, we believe the steps we are taking, bolstering our liquidity, strengthening our commercial partnerships and streaming scale, all while aggressively managing our cost base will enable us to weather the financial effects of this crisis, emerging better positioned to build upon our strong consumer relevance, thereby creating significant shareholder value.
With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

27763231,662460208,2015830,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Alexia. In terms of advertising, as I said in my remarks, we are seeing a significant impact in Q2, and but we do see Q3 and Q4 improving, assuming businesses reopen. And we're well positioned to capitalize on that and gain share. Now with re",632,"Yes. Thanks, Alexia. In terms of advertising, as I said in my remarks, we are seeing a significant impact in Q2, and but we do see Q3 and Q4 improving, assuming businesses reopen. And we're well positioned to capitalize on that and gain share. Now with respect to Q2 specifically, on a relative basis, broadcast is strongest, then cable then digital. Local's weakest. Interestingly, though, the weakness is dominated by 5 categories, and they are categories you would expect: auto, restaurants, retail, travel, movies. So they're all significantly impacted by COVID. 
Now as we've seen some decline in demand, we also have been using some of that inventory to benefit our own products, including promoting SVOD, digital books and cross-promoting our schedules. So that inventory hasn't gone to waste. We've also, in some cases, reduced load to improve the viewing environment and to maintain strong pricing. 
On a positive note, one of our largest clients came to market in Q2 with scatter dollars, and we know we got the largest share. So that's a good reflection on the power of the portfolio. It's also worth noting that we've seen in May and June scatter improved relative to April. So that's a good sign. And we do see categories continuing to be active in the market: pharmaceuticals, CPG, financial services, tech. And as we look to Q3, in particular, we'll also see live sports beginning to return. For us, the PGA starts on June 11 in Texas. We're seeing very strong demand for that and golf. And as you know, the NFL is releasing their schedule later today. So that's all a positive. 
Again, we're very well positioned against this backdrop, given our #1 position on linear television as well as our AMS portfolio. And the fact that through the integration we've done, we can now deliver all that to our customers on a single point of contact, which is important to the extent that some of our counterparties have either furloughed or reduced staffing. 
So we feel good. I mean -- so advertising's tough, but we do see some green shoots and feel good about our ability to maximize that as they grow. 
With respect to YouTube, yes, thank you. We are very happy about that deal. But the quarter was not just about YouTube. We've had very strong activity in terms of renewals in the quarter and subsequent to the quarter's end, Comcast, Verizon, YouTube, all examples of the power of the combination, something we're quickly beginning to unlock. 
Big picture, we're seeing very strong consumption that underscores consumer demand for our products across platforms. On linear, remember, #1 in TV share, #1 in all key demos, that is -- and in this COVID time, in particular, very strong consumption, benefiting brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., BET, Comedy Central, obviously underscores the value of our product and also great momentum on streaming. We talked about that in my prepared remarks, real positive trends in sign-ups and actually conversions on All Access and Showtime OTT. So the portfolio is very strong. 
In terms of the deals, Comcast, first MVPD to add All Access. We're actually launching that today on Xfinity. Verizon, our first true cross-company, cross-portfolio MVPD deal, very happy with the economics. And that Pluto component is very significant in terms of Verizon wireless distribution and now YouTube, multiyear deal, includes an extension for CBS and Showtime and the addition of Viacom Media Networks very soon, 14 networks. That fills a key vMVPD white space for our company. That's obviously important. But it's also a win for them because it brings our #1 TV portfolio to their platform. And as they look at the next leg of their sub growth, that will benefit them. So very happy with all that."

And any updates on how you're thinking of sort of the evolution of how you allocate that given the breadth of distribution options that you have, any place you're putting more to work or maybe pulling back any? And then second, I'm curious about the advertising pacing at Pluto TV in particular. You guys disclosed each of your digital metrics were up 50%-plus in the quarter if I sort of parse that a little bit. Can you talk about how Pluto is pacing on a relative basis and whether you've seen any -- whether it's held up better or maybe been a little softer in the sort of COVID-driven disruption?"
27763231,662460208,2015830,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes. Sure, Michael. So on content, the company has a very substantial content asset. That includes current production through Paramount, CBS, Viacom Media Networks as well as a huge library.And the $13 billion cash content spend that we've referred to in",471,"Yes. Sure, Michael. So on content, the company has a very substantial content asset. That includes current production through Paramount, CBS, Viacom Media Networks as well as a huge library.And the $13 billion cash content spend that we've referred to in the past is a very material number. Relative to that number, we expect COVID to result in some reduction in overall content expenses in 2020. Now that's driven by the cancellation of certain events, say, the NCAAs, as an example, the reduction in number of episodes of certain seasons -- series, so CBS prime. A lot of those series only delivered 18 episodes versus the planned 22 because we have to shut down production early. And we did move some films out of 2020. So all those things will reduce the 13, but that's really a 2020 issue. It's not a planned change in run rate. 
Now in terms of that aggregate spend, we continue to prioritize investments in our owned and operated platforms. And that includes streaming with a growth emphasis on streaming as we shift mix from lower- to higher-growth sectors. With respect to streaming, our biggest franchises will be key to that strategy as well as our broad programming strength really across genres, genres being kids, animations, crime procedurals, et cetera. And so we will be prioritizing those programming areas for our owned and operated platforms. 
That said, we will continue to selectively license to third parties. It's a big market. Playing in that market has multiple benefits, not just revenue, but also expanding the reach of IP to new fans that benefits the franchise and related businesses like consumer products, like setting up for theatricals, et cetera. We're doing that in a very strategic way. So we're not going to license critical mass of any of our key programming areas, kids, procedurals, et cetera, to any single player. 
Likewise, again, we're prioritizing franchise IP to our owned platforms. And regardless of what we do in the licensing space, remember, ultimately, these deals are rentals. The IP does revert back. So that's how we're thinking about it, Mike.
In terms of Pluto, I referenced that digital was weaker, but digital is an aggregation of a lot of different things. We continue to see fantastic advertiser reception for the Pluto product. It really is the closest thing to linear television on the planet. And if you've seen Pluto in the last month with our Venetia upgrade, the product is fantastic. The presentation is improved. And by the way, the ad guts behind it are also upgraded. So we continue to see strong demand, certainly strong demand in the first quarter. We're doing fine in the second quarter, again, against a general softer backdrop, which everybody is seeing. But we continue to love the asset and advertisers do, too."

So as we look at our capital allocation plan relative to thinking about how we use our cash, it's organic free cash flow generation, which we will benefit from the near-term production shutdown. It will be a benefit near term to free cash flow. But then also with the proceeds we get from the asset sales, we will look to pay down our debt to achieve the 2.75x leverage ratio."

And those are studios, networks and streaming. And that gives us a very clear lens to look through to consider whether assets fit or not. Based on that, again, it's clear that Black Rock, which is an iconic office building in New York, but doesn't fit any of those 3 categories, and Simon & Schuster, which is a preeminent publisher and an extraordinary company, again, doesn't fit any of those segments. So those are noncore, even though they're super high-quality assets. And again, we've had lots of interest in them. 
But when you look at that framework through the rest of the assets we own, the company really has a pretty compelling combination. So COVID hasn't changed our view on strategic asset composition in anything -- if anything, it's reinforced it. We believe the combination of studios, networks and streaming makes enormous synergistic sense together."

So in terms of affiliate, I think probably the best way to think about it is, if you look at pay subs, we saw stable trends in Q1 relative to Q4. That said, given what we're hearing and people are talking about in Q2, we do expect some modest incremental cord cutting. But importantly, our deal with YouTube will more than offset that when it kicks in this summer. So that's to your question of outperformance. 
Also on the domestic cable affiliate revenue side, as you know, we got a nice improvement in rate of change between Q4 and Q1. Q2 might move back a bit given what I just mentioned on sub trends. Again, we don't know what that actually is, but there's possibility. But given the deals we have locked in as of today, we see further improvement in the second half of the year on the domestic cable affiliate revenue trend line. So that's to your question on outperformance. 
Look, on streaming profitability, again, we're not giving guidance, certainly not into 2020 COVID environment. I can tell you that we are -- it really it's all about the mix of content expenditures across the company and continuing to remix from investment towards higher-growth areas that includes streaming. In the short term, there's a lot of incremental content that we're bringing to the platform that is existing content. And then over time, there'll be growing original content on the streaming side. But again, that's largely a mix. And again, as we look at a business plan for streaming, both in free and pay and more importantly, on this integrated linked ecosystem, we're very excited about what we see tracking out over the coming years. 
Finally, on Q3 ad sales, again, based on everything we see today, we believe Q3 ad sales will be better than Q2. And again, right now, May and June scatter looked better than April. So that's a good sign. We do see categories active in the market, again, pharma, CPG, financial services, tech. We do see for sure demand for sports, starting with this June 11 PGA event. And these PGA events are sort of staggered in kind of more open states, if you will, and locations. So we feel good about that. We have a very specific production plan for those, which we believe mitigates risk. And we're definitely seeing strong demand for that. 
So -- and again, it speaks to the power of the portfolio, the fact that we can serve advertisers through our #1 linear position across really all genres, add in Pluto and other high-quality digital assets and importantly, deliver it through a single point of customer contact. I think that will be even more important as we negotiate, say, this virtual upfronts. So that's what I'm seeing."

I'm wondering with literally no sports on TV, does the leverage with distributors sort of shift a little bit? At least until sports come back, it would seem like Viacom is a pretty large portion of overall content on the air right now. Then on the movie business, you're talking about putting up movies later this year. Some of your peers have moved films into literally a year, if not more.

So yes, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. And by the way, as I said, our streaming services, which we also increasingly, call it, package into our relationship with our distributors are performing very well. So does that tilt in our favor at the moment? 
Yes, probably. We, by the way, also look forward to bringing live sports back, and we're going to be one of the first with golf, the nature of golf probably makes that a little bit simpler than some of the other sports. By the way, we set up a sound stage in Radford, the CBS lot to film both boxing and Bellator events, which we're going to use that soundstage to sequentially alternately produce those, albeit with no audience for the moment. So we're going to do some sports stuff around the edges. 
But yes, look, I like our position. I think the portfolio is very powerful. You see that starting to come to life with the deals I've already talked about, and I feel good about our trajectory going forward. 
With respect to movies, yes, we moved them later. We thought that was the right thing to do to preserve asset value. We obviously look at the market and look at what it will be at a point in time, and we'll make a decision if there's sufficient critical mass of screens, if you will, theaters to warrant opening a film. Our first film on the schedule is SpongeBob at the beginning of August. I think it's August 7. So it's too far out to call if that's definitely going to be released or it's definitely not going to be released. 
We hope it will release, but we will continue to look at and make the right decision in terms of the return on those assets because we got great films. I mean, whether it's Quiet Place Part II, which we premiered in New York 2 weeks before the crisis, and we pulled at the last minute, thank God we did because the film is incredible. And we didn't waste it. We saved it. Likewise, Top Gun: Maverick is off the chart. So -- but we're going to open them when it makes sense to open them, Rich. 
Lastly, on ad sales, look, we're not going to -- I'm not going to give you a domestic number. I can tell you it's not as bad as what Fox is saying, that's for sure, but it's not pretty either. But as far as a specific number, no, I'm not going to do that."

And I would say that international is softer than domestic. And probably a way to think about it is we talk about this 2% growth number in Q1. The domestic number is better than that. The international number was a headwind for it. 
Importantly, in international, we are -- we now have 2 offices open, Beijing and Hong Kong. So things are moving forward. And that is both a light at the end of the tunnel but also a great way for us to get experience with facility reopening, which we have a big kind of working group on that. So we're prepped for it. 
And then on the international side, importantly, we continue to see new opportunities coming out of the merger when we think big picture. It might take us a little longer to realize them, but they're definitely there, things like bringing operating expertise from Channel 5 and Telefe to Network 10, things like bringing CBS' massive television library and production to Viacom International Media Networks distribution across MVPDs, OTT, mobile partners. And as we move forward on streaming, again, we see a real international opportunity, which leverages the combined company asset base, and it's more than seeing it. We have plans to go after it, as I said, in multiple markets over the next 12 months. 
With respect to production, we have a multifaceted plan in place for restarting production, which we believe will leave us well positioned with fresh product in the fall in both TV and film. And we also have a range of contingencies we can deploy. 
To your question on CBS, CBS has a very strong and stable schedule. We announced a renewal of over 80% of that slate yesterday. That's got a bunch of benefits, including the fact that in this virtual upfront time whenever it moves, advertisers will know what they're buying from us, and some of the other networks are not in that place. 
In terms of our return to production, a couple of things I'd highlight. One is because there was a possibility of a writer strike, we ensured we had a backlog of shows ready to go. So that's an asset we can draw on. In addition, if you start segmenting different kinds of production, sound stage-based productions, things like sitcoms, that's a more controllable environment. So we feel good about that. Dramas, again, if you look at it, there will likely be limitations. We can probably front-load production the components that are on sound stages and leave location to later. That's how we're thinking about it if need be. On the unscripted side, we can also modify productions to include more controllable environments. 
In terms of sports, we believe live sports will return. I talked about golf and the NFL probably in a modified form, but we believe they'll be there. And so we're optimistic that our fall schedule won't be materially disrupted, again, assuming we can get back in production sometime this summer. 
Know that in the interim, we continue to operate in a modified model. That includes using virtual productions. You've seen a bunch of those on air to keep news, late night and other shows going. To the extent we see gaps in production volume, we do have broad and deep libraries, including the recent addition of Miramax, which we can deploy on our platforms. Current example of this is the use of Paramount titles for a new CBS Sunday night at the movies, which started in May. That's filling in for a shortened season of NCIS derivatives back to the 18 episodes versus 22. 
On the Paramount side, we've completed principal photography on 8 films right before the crisis. Those include Without Remorse, Snake Eyes, Clifford, Coming to America, Top Gun, Infinite, Tomorrow World ] and Spell. So those are all being worked on remotely in post-roduction. So we will be in good shape when things open up. Likewise, Showtime is currently set and solid through Q3. So it's a bit of a fluid situation, but we spent a lot of time looking at not only return to facilities, but return to production, and we're confident that we'll have compelling content on in the fall."

So how does Showtime fit into your long-term vision? And secondly, if you look at your competitors in streaming, they all pulled back some big titles Peacock, Office, Friends, HBO MAX. I wondered, will you pull back some of the big library content that sits on Netflix or in a perfect world, would have you pulled back South Park from licensing that. So just give me a sense of that philosophy."

One is it for sure, fits in the strategic paradigm that I outlined of studios, networks and streaming. In fact, it's all 3. And the second thing I'd say on Showtime is we talked about some issues with Showtime circa '19, but our 2020 plan is all about turning around the performance with respect to earnings and cash flow, and we feel good about our trajectory there. And it's important to note it has real momentum on subscribers, particularly over the top. Showtime had its best quarter ever in sign-ups and consumption in Q1. And we've seen acceleration in sign-ups, time watched and total streams in April. And the conversion of free to pay as it's accelerated, i.e., more trials, we're seeing the same or better conversion rates. So that's all good, and we do have a lot of momentum on the programming side. 
With respect to streaming, I talked about our strategy a bit in my prepared remarks. And from a content perspective, again, we're very excited about where we're taking this. 
If you look at Pluto, it's a massive free gateway to our streaming ecosystem. We are going to continue to build that out. That has both owned and operated and third-party content on it. The content offering in ours is definitely weighted towards third party. Our content on it is definitely library, and that's working well. 
In respect to our pay product, which is more where your question would show up, we're in the middle of transforming CBS All Access into this much more compelling product that includes news, live sports and on-demand entertainment. So your question would really apply largely to on-demand entertainment. Again, we put over 100 Paramount films there this week. You will see a major move this summer, where we'll introduce a fundamentally new UI and add substantial content assets. As we do that, we are prioritizing franchises and importantly, critical mass of programming in genres, whether it's animation and kids or it's crime, et cetera, for O&O. 
We will continue to selectively license outside of that. So we may put a little kids somewhere on one platform, a little bit on another. But in terms of critical mass and in terms of big franchises, we're going to increasingly lean into that for our owned and operated platforms. We think that's a strategy that will create a very compelling streaming product and sort of trajectory for that element -- that portion of our business as well as allow us to continue to participate in a licensing market where there continues to be a lot of demand.
Look, guys, I really want to thank you for your questions and taking time with us in this strange time we're all living in. I want to close by saying ViacomCBS is a resilient company. We are well positioned to navigate the crisis, and we're really just beginning to tap the potential of our combined assets. 
To that end, you look at Q1, you look at the time since then, remember, we only closed this deal in December, but there are already multiple proof points to the power of the ViacomCBS combination. That includes recent affiliate deals. We talked about them today. Our cross-company use of content, we talked about today and very material cost synergies, which will probably increase as we move forward, leveraging our experience in COVID. 
Again, the first quarter and the weeks following demonstrated that our content is in demand in all kinds of formats. We did take aggressive steps to reduce costs, improve financial flexibility and frankly, strengthen our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Our growing scale, audience reach and earnings power will become more apparent as this market rebounds, and we put the full power of our portfolio behind the company, including behind our streaming strategy. 
So look, thanks, everyone, for your continued support. Stay well, and we look forward to seeing you in person, hopefully, sometime soon."

Our thoughts are with all who are affected worldwide and especially those who have lost loved ones. To the heroes on the front line of first response in healthcare and to all the essential workers, we owe you a debt of thanks. I also want to thank ViacomCBS employees around the world for their adaptive creativity and continued focus on serving our audiences, commercial partners and shareholders amid these unprecedented times.
Let me now dive into our first quarter earnings call. Today, there are 3 headlines. First, ViacomCBS delivered a solid quarter with clear operating momentum and sequential improvement on key financial metrics. Second, we're proactively managing through the COVID-19 crisis, supporting our employees and communities while strengthening our financial flexibility, reducing costs and ensuring business continuity. And third, we remain consistently focused on value creation and are acting swiftly to execute against cost and revenue opportunities that will create both immediate and lasting benefits.
I'll start with Q1 2020, our first full quarter as a combined company, one where we made significant progress unlocking the value of our must-watch content across multiple platforms globally and at scale. We integrated our commercial teams to provide partners the strength of our combined asset base. We made progress capturing the run rate merger-related cost synergies we committed to, and we saw strong momentum in streaming, momentum we will build on.
Examples of our progress include key operating wins. Among them, the continued strength of our domestic media networks, which held the highest share of TV viewing in all key audience demos. This leadership starts with broadcast. CBS will finish the season as America's most-watched network for the 12th straight year. CBS was #1 in all key day parts in the quarter, with 5 of the 6 top comedies, the top 2 dramas, the #1 news program and the #1 late-night show, plus 5 of the top 6 freshman series. In sports, the 2019 season of the NFL on CBS delivered its largest audience in 3 years.
We also maintained our leadership as the #1-rated cable portfolio in total day, owning nearly half of the top 30 original series in the key 18 to 34 demographic and 9 of the top 10 kids series, thanks to Nickelodeon. Of note, Comedy Central marked its 12th straight quarter of year-over-year share growth, driven by the #1 late-night talk show with millennials. And Showtime scored the top 2 scripted shows on premium cable, including the #1 comedy and the #1 drama.
Internationally, we continue to build on a global footprint that includes 192 million broadcast homes, the largest in the world. Our broadcast cornerstones Network Ten in Australia and Telefe in Argentina have each produced strong year-over-year share gains.
This was also our strongest streaming quarter ever, a milestone that was on track even before the COVID-19 crisis, putting us well on our way to meet the subscriber and user targets we laid out last quarter. Pluto TV continues to lead the U.S. in free streaming TV as the platform delivered its best quarter ever. Pluto domestic monthly active users grew 55% year-over-year to more than 24 million as of quarter end, with even stronger gains in total consumption.
On top of that, our domestic pay streaming offerings also grew robustly, with subscribers totaling 13.5 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of 50% year-over-year driven by original hit programming from CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Both services broke their own records for sign-ups, streams and time watched in the quarter. Overall, this growth in both pay and free drove a strong increase in domestic streaming and digital revenue in the quarter, which was up more than 50% versus a year ago.
And the appeal of our streaming and digital offerings has been made even more clear over the last 6 weeks, where we've seen a strong acceleration in momentum across both free and pay as audiences follow stay-at-home guidelines.
We also demonstrated the strength of the ViacomCBS portfolio by striking new agreements with our partners in the quarter and in the weeks since. For example, CBS reached a deal with the NFL to broadcast one additional wildcard game in 2021 as part of the NFL's playoff expansion with a live stream on CBS All Access and a separately produced telecast on Nickelodeon, tailored for a younger audience. This is a perfect example of how our partners are using our combined asset base to grow the footprint and reach a diverse audience.
We've also made important strides in domestic distribution, where we struck significant carriage agreements. Earlier this year, we announced that Comcast would become the first MVPD to launch CBS All Access. I'm pleased to share that we actually began rolling out on their Xfinity platform today. And in March, we reached multiyear CBS renewals with 2 of our largest affiliates, Nexstar and Meredith.
In April, we closed our first true combined company affiliate deal with Verizon. This, despite the fact that Viacom and CBS deals were not coterminous going in. This agreement marks a truly comprehensive, multi-platform partnership spanning pay TV, connected TV and mobile. And it will drive a tremendous expansion of Pluto's distribution footprint.
And today, we're announcing a new deal with YouTube TV. This deal not only renews CBS and Showtime early but will shortly bring Viacom's Cable Networks to the high-growth YouTube TV platform. To state the obvious, this fills in a key white space for our Cable Networks distribution and is a clear proof point for the ViacomCBS combination.
Meanwhile, in film, Paramount scored a bona fide hit with Sonic the Hedgehog, which means we have a new franchise to build on. Worldwide, the film earned more than $300 million at the box office and was made available for digital on demand March 31, setting Paramount's record for first-day digital sales and became the studio's all-time record holder in less than 3 weeks. The title has now sold nearly 2 million EFT units worldwide, and it's also exceeding expectations on VOD.
These operational highlights and more drove key financial wins in the quarter. Chris will cover our results in detail in a moment, but I do want to highlight a few items.
On the revenue side, excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, advertising grew 2% year-over-year. Affiliate revenue also increased year-over-year. And we improved the rate of change in domestic Cable Networks affiliate revenue by 270 basis points sequentially.
In addition, ViacomCBS delivered sequential improvement across all key earnings and cash flow-related metrics, including operating income, adjusted OIBDA, reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow, which is back to a material positive of almost $0.5 billion, again indicating the progress we made in our first full quarter and demonstrating our commitment to strengthening our financial position and creating shareholder value.
Just as the quarter was ending, we were, of course, faced with the COVID-19 crisis. I want to spend a few minutes sharing with you how we are proactively managing through this. As COVID spread to the U.S., we quickly moved to ensure we had the financial flexibility and balance sheet strength to weather a sustained crisis. 
To that end, we issued $2.5 billion of bonds in April. Add in our strong cash flow in the quarter and our undrawn committed $3.5 billion revolver, and it means we are in excellent shape from a liquidity perspective.
We have also taken a series of significant cost-reduction measures to mitigate COVID-related revenue impacts for the year. At the same time, we ramped up our focus on business continuity, including significantly adjusting operations around the 3 most affected areas: production, ad sales and film.
Like most media companies, we have seen an almost total shutdown in production, but we are managing through employing alternate virtual models in some cases and leveraging current and library products from across the company in others. Because of this, we continue to have captivating content on air, and there will be substantial near-term cash flow savings.
As we look to the balance of the year on the production side, we expect little impact to our on-air product, particularly given the stability of our schedules assuming we can get back in production, albeit with modifications by mid-summer.
In ad sales, we've seen advertisers in significantly affected categories temporarily pull back spend. But we are working closely with our clients to mitigate the impact. At this point, we know there will be a significant impact on ad sales in Q2. But based on what we're seeing today, we will -- we believe there will be an improvement in advertising in the third and fourth quarters, assuming businesses begin to reopen at scale.
In terms of the upfront, we expect it to be later and longer than normal. But we're ready whenever our clients are, and deals will get done. In fact, this week, we invited more than 5,000 agency and marketing executives to our virtual presentation on May 18 and 19.
Regarding film, we have shifted our slate later into '20 and '21 to preserve its value. We also sold The Lovebirds to Netflix, where we saw an attractive monetization opportunity in the early COVID environment. And while our film business will, of course, be dependent on theaters reopening in major markets, from a cash perspective, the delay in revenues is substantially offset by the COVID-driven production shutdown.
Finally, I want to highlight the support we are providing for our employees, audiences and communities amidst this pandemic. A key priority is the health and well-being of our employees and their families. In March, we moved the vast majority of our employee base to work from home, something that has worked incredibly well with very limited exceptions for critical operations and facility staff, who continue to work on-site under strict safety protocols.
We've also committed $100 million for relief for non-staff employees and freelancers, whose livelihoods have been especially affected by the pause in our production. And I'm proud of how ViacomCBS has come together to deploy our platforms for COVID-19 consumer education and relief from our enormously successful PSA campaigns like #AloneTogether to the specials we've aired to help raise money for the cause.
All of this to say, I'm enormously grateful to all our employees for their initiative, creativity and courage at this time in adapting and thriving under the toughest of circumstances to ensure we can continue to entertain and inform audiences everywhere. It goes without saying that we are all looking forward to getting on the other side of this crisis. But through it all, we are focused on creating value by executing our strategy and looking to continued cost and revenue opportunities that will create both immediate and lasting benefit.
This starts with what we see as an even larger cost opportunity for the company. In addition to onetime COVID-related cost reductions I mentioned earlier, we remain on track with our committed annualized run rate synergy target of $750 million over the next 3 years. In fact, we now see a greater opportunity to create sustained financial benefit on top of the $750 million, informed by how we've had to rethink our operations over the past 6 weeks.
We have proven we can do more with less and can operate without being physically co-located. As a result, we are now exploring opportunities to further consolidate facilities, migrate more activities to lower-cost locations and increase sharing of capabilities, all to further leverage our scale.
Beyond cost, we are unlocking revenue opportunities across the combined company. In distribution, we've only scratched the surface of what ViacomCBS can do on an integrated basis to unlock additional opportunities with both traditional and new distributors.
On the advertising front, the combination of our #1 linear position and our high-growth advanced ad solutions, all delivered through an efficient single point of customer contact, means we are extremely well positioned for the rebound associated with the return to business. Importantly, we overwhelmingly serve national advertisers, a segment that should rebound first.
In sports, we will benefit from the enormous pent-up viewer demand, starting with the return of golf as the PGA Tour plans to resume its schedule in June. And at Paramount, we will be ready with a set of amazing films, including A Quiet Place Part II, SpongeBob: Sponge on the Run and Top Gun: Maverick that will be big hits once they're released.
Finally, there's no question the crisis has proven the power of streaming, and we are moving quickly to seize this significant revenue opportunity. We know fundamental consumer needs around quality, convenience and cost are driving changes in how they consume content, and we're focused on addressing all 3 needs. Building off our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our platforms, we will capitalize on our positions across free and pay, adding substantial content assets and user experience enhancements supported by marketing to serve consumers with a robust, differentiated suite of link streaming offering.
We will continue to build on Pluto TV's #1 position in free streaming. Pluto TV is a great platform for consumers who want a free high-quality TV experience, whether on a smart TV or a mobile device. In March, we rolled out Pluto's most significant product upgrade ever, delivering new features and design changes that further enhanced the platform's ease of use. And with the continued addition of new content partners, it offers consumers a superior experience relative to the other free services in or entering the marketplace. 
And we are expanding Pluto's reach, both in the U.S. and internationally, including 2 important deals with not only Verizon but also with Xbox and Roku. Pluto now has a growing presence in the U.K., Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as in Latin America, where Pluto's April launch brought over 12,000 hours of content to 17 countries. And over the next 12 months, we expect to roll out Pluto in Brazil, Spain, France and Italy.
The Pluto TV platform is powerful, and the world is quickly embracing it. But you shouldn't just think of it as a standalone service. It is also key to our integrated streaming strategy, where it will serve as an important complement to and funnel for our pay services. 
In June, we will introduce click-through ad units on Pluto embedded in relevant content to allow users to subscribe to CBS All Access. As time goes on, this integration will continue to evolve as we create an owned and operated streaming ecosystem with a massive free point of entry combined with upsell pay option. 
And speaking of pay, we are accelerating our plans for an expanded subscription service, building off our CBS All Access platform with major changes coming this summer as we track towards the rebrand and relaunch of a transformed product. We believe audiences want their entertainment on demand and their news, sports and events live. And through our expanded offering, we will be the service that gives them what they want, how they want it, all in one place and at a great value. 
This will be a compelling foundational service for some consumers and a differentiated complement to what some other consumers already have. On the entertainment side, we start with what All Access has today: CBS network programming, a very deep CBS on-demand library and an expanding slate of originals, add to that content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, Smithsonian, MTV, BET and Paramount. This starts with over 100 Paramount films launched this week on the platform as well as thousands of additional hours across TV and film arriving in current and coming months. 
And we will build on this incredible base of content, a catalog multiple times larger than many of the new SVOD entrants by expanding our original slate across the portfolio. This will bring first-window content from each of our brands to this platform. Our biggest franchises will be key to this strategy as will our broad programming strength across genres, from animation to sci-fi, comedy, reality, kids, crime procedurals and more. Add to that, national and local news from over 200 CBS affiliates, available both live and on-demand and a critical mass of live sports, including CBS network-delivered NFL, NCAA, PGA and more, plus exclusive streaming rights to major properties like women's soccer and UEFA. 
And we're doing all of this in a targeted, capital-efficient way. First, we are working from an already developed tech platform in CBS All Access. We are not building from scratch. Second, almost every dollar we invest in linear content across the company will benefit the service with varying windows. Third, our original strategy is designed to leverage our massive library of IP, fueling growth through a consistent and growing cadence of tent-pole series. 
Our experience makes clear that we can acquire new customers in a disciplined and economically efficient way while reducing churn and driving customer retention with a deep volume of entertainment, news and sports. 
Fourth, our distribution strategy benefits from existing, growing relationships. Across our pay and free products, we already have distribution deals with the likes of Comcast, AT&T and Verizon as well as with Amazon, Roku and other tech players. And we are in ongoing discussions with a broad range of partners to expand our streaming footprint in the coming months. 
And fifth and finally, we will leverage our ability to cross-promote at scale, where we will benefit from our #1 TV share in every demo as well as our strong digital reach, enabling ViacomCBS to promote to and draw customers into our offering in an impactful and cost-effective way. 
And going back to where I started, the promotional platform includes Pluto TV, a fast growth, broad reach gateway to the ViacomCBS streaming world. 
In addition to our domestic strategy, I should add that internationally, we will launch a broad pay streaming product in multiple markets over the next 12 months. This service will harness the full power of the ViacomCBS portfolio, creating a meaningful brand presence in streaming video in key markets around the world. 
So in sum, we are full speed ahead on streaming, seeing strong demand for our services today, with a strategy to achieve accelerated growth domestically and internationally in the months and years to come. For all those reasons and more, we're extremely excited about the future of ViacomCBS. We are unlocking the very substantial value of this extraordinary company, and the best is yet to come. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris."

I would first like to say that our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this pandemic. I want to acknowledge and thank the employees at ViacomCBS for their extreme care for well-being and resilience in this unprecedented time. I am proud to be a part of the tremendous team work currently taking place across our company, our industry and our communities. 
Specific to ViacomCBS, we are faced with a much different financial environment for this earnings call than just a quarter ago when we closed year-end 2019. We did realize solid results in Q1 2020, our first full quarter as a united company. Then at the end of the quarter, we pivoted to manage the risk from COVID-19, while continuing to focus on unlocking the value of ViacomCBS.
Today, I will first take you through the actions taken to strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. Then I will walk you through our first quarter 2020 results, which demonstrate early evidence of the power of ViacomCBS. And finally, I will provide you with some insights into what we are seeing today stemming from COVID-19 effects and the actions we are taking to mitigate them. 
We are proactively managing through this crisis with the security of increased liquidity, while aggressively controlling our costs and preserving cash. At the same time, we are accelerating the momentum we are seeing in our streaming businesses to position ViacomCBS well for the future. 
Let's start with ViacomCBS' liquidity and balance sheet. Early on, we prioritized taking the necessary steps to ensure we have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to manage through this crisis. On April 1, we accessed the credit market and issued $2.5 billion of debt. Using the proceeds from this bond issuance, on May 4, we redeemed all of our $300 million of notes that were due in February 2021. And on May 18, we will redeem all of our $500 million of notes that are due in March 2021. The remaining $1.7 billion in proceeds from the bond issuance bolsters our liquidity in order to help us weather the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses. We also continue to have access to a $3.5 billion revolver, which remains undrawn and provides us with even more financial flexibility. 
As of March 31, 2020, when you take into account the $750 million of full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.1x. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and reaching our target leverage of 2.75x, including the benefit of full run rate synergies. 
We plan to use excess cash flow, after dividend payments, to delever the balance sheet until we reach that leverage ratio. We will not repurchase any of our shares until we complete our planned noncore asset sale. 
Let me update you on our 2 noncore asset sales. Our previously announced sale of Black Rock is temporarily on hold until we can allow potential buyers to continue to tour the building. We are also in the process of preparing for a sale of Simon & Schuster so that the asset is ready for divestiture when the market stabilizes. We are encouraged by the significant interest we have seen for both of these assets and look forward to proceeding as market conditions allow.
Now turning to our financial performance. We achieved solid results for our first full quarter as a united company. Total company revenue was $6.67 billion, adjusted OIBDA was $1.26 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.13. The comparison to last year for all 3 metrics was affected by the broadcast of the Super Bowl and the NCAA men's basketball tournament in Q1 2019. Adjusted free cash flow of $478 million, which excludes $173 million of restructuring and merger-related payments, was a material improvement from Q4 2019 and a strong start to the year. 
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter, total company advertising was down 19% versus a year ago. However, advertising was up 2% after adjusting for a 21-point headwind resulting from comparisons to the Super Bowl and the COVID-related cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, which were in the year-ago period. Advertising growth was also impacted by a 100 basis point headwind from FX. 
The ad market was robust throughout the majority of the first quarter, with strength in prime time, news, political and cable as well as the benefit of historically high scatter pricing. We also saw continued strength in digital advertising across our ad-based streaming platforms. 
Affiliate revenue increased 1%, benefiting from strong retrans, reverse comp and subscription streaming revenue, which more than offset declines in cable network affiliate revenue and a 100 basis point headwind from FX. Importantly, the year-over-year change in Cable Network affiliate revenue in Q1 improved sequentially from Q4, with the domestic Cable Network affiliate rate of decline improving 270 basis points. 
Domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscription revenue and digital video advertising, was up an impressive 51% versus a year ago to $471 million. We reached new records in Q1 in sign-ups and streams on CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and in monthly active user growth in minutes viewed on Pluto. 
Turning to content licensing. Revenue grew 9% driven by growth in original studio production for third parties. Paramount Television Studios, CBS Television Studios and Cable Network Studios all benefited from strong deliveries during the quarter. Theatrical revenue was down 3% as strong results from Sonic the Hedgehog were more than offset by prior quarter revenues, which included carryover performance from Bumblebee. Theatrical revenue would have been higher had we released The Quiet Place Part II as scheduled on March 18. 
For publishing, revenue increased 4% reflecting growth from digital book and audio sales. Key titles in the quarter included Stephen King's If It Bleeds and The Outsider and Cassandra Clare's Chain of Gold. On the expense front, we benefited from merger-related cost synergies in the first quarter and are on track to realize $250 million in savings for the full year of 2020 before consideration of onetime cost to achieve them. 
Overall, we are pleased with the strong start for ViacomCBS' results in the first quarter of 2020. I would now like to give you some insight to the impact COVID-19 is having on our business. I will update you on what we are currently seeing in each of our revenue streams and explain the cost actions we had taken to partly offset the revenue headwinds. 
Based on our current assessment of the near-term impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses and assuming the U.S. economy begins to reopen early in the second half of 2020, we anticipate the second quarter will be the most significantly affected. 
Starting with advertising. While we are seeing material increases in ratings and engagement across all of our platforms, linear and digital alike, the COVID-19 shutdown is currently resulting in significantly lower ad demand in Q2 of 2020. The reduction in demand in the marketplace is being driven by macro uncertainty and temporary business closures as well as the postponement and cancellation of sporting events. Importantly, we continue to expect to benefit from political advertising later in 2020. 
Moving to affiliate revenue. As Bob discussed, we have had a productive quarter with several new distribution deals signed. While we expect some acceleration in linear subscriber declines in the near term, we will benefit from our recent affiliate deals and from the materially higher sign-ups and engagement we are experiencing across all of our streaming platforms. We expect domestic streaming subscribers to reach at least 16 million and domestic monthly active users on Pluto to reach at least 30 million by the end of 2020. 
In Q2, content licensing revenue in the cable segment will benefit from our South Park deal. However, the timing of deliveries and significant activity in the year ago quarter in the TV entertainment segment will be a substantial offset. 
In regard to theatrical revenue, we had one significant film that was scheduled to be released at the end of Q1 2020, A Quiet Place Part II, which is now scheduled for September 4. Our 2 largest films that were scheduled to release in the second quarter have also been rescheduled. The SpongeBob movie, Sponge on the Run has been moved from May 22 to August 7, and Top Gun: Maverick has been moved from June 26 to December 23. We do not expect to release any new movies in the second quarter or until theaters reopen broadly. And we'll adjust release dates, if necessary, to maximize returns on our film content investments. 
In light of the impact of this crisis, we are highly focused on reducing our costs and preserving cash. The cost reductions fall into 3 areas. First, timing-related expense reductions from the lack of distribution or events. For example, this includes the absence of sports rights amortization for sports that have been canceled, the elimination of production costs associated with the current production shutdown and a delay in P&A for films not released. 
Secondly, we continue to make progress against the $750 million in annualized run rate cost synergies we identified as a result of our merger, including $250 million, which will be realized in 2020. 
And third, we are taking additional cost-cutting actions and implementing initiatives to reduce discretionary expenses. We are learning from this crisis and finding ways that we can operate even more efficiently. We see significant opportunities to realize sustainable financial benefits over long term. 
In summary, we believe the steps we are taking, bolstering our liquidity, strengthening our commercial partnerships and streaming scale, all while aggressively managing our cost base will enable us to weather the financial effects of this crisis, emerging better positioned to build upon our strong consumer relevance, thereby creating significant shareholder value.
With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

In terms of advertising, as I said in my remarks, we are seeing a significant impact in Q2, and but we do see Q3 and Q4 improving, assuming businesses reopen. And we're well positioned to capitalize on that and gain share. Now with re",632,"Yes. Thanks, Alexia. In terms of advertising, as I said in my remarks, we are seeing a significant impact in Q2, and but we do see Q3 and Q4 improving, assuming businesses reopen. And we're well positioned to capitalize on that and gain share. Now with respect to Q2 specifically, on a relative basis, broadcast is strongest, then cable then digital. Local's weakest. Interestingly, though, the weakness is dominated by 5 categories, and they are categories you would expect: auto, restaurants, retail, travel, movies. So they're all significantly impacted by COVID. 
Now as we've seen some decline in demand, we also have been using some of that inventory to benefit our own products, including promoting SVOD, digital books and cross-promoting our schedules. So that inventory hasn't gone to waste. We've also, in some cases, reduced load to improve the viewing environment and to maintain strong pricing. 
On a positive note, one of our largest clients came to market in Q2 with scatter dollars, and we know we got the largest share. So that's a good reflection on the power of the portfolio. It's also worth noting that we've seen in May and June scatter improved relative to April. So that's a good sign. And we do see categories continuing to be active in the market: pharmaceuticals, CPG, financial services, tech. And as we look to Q3, in particular, we'll also see live sports beginning to return. For us, the PGA starts on June 11 in Texas. We're seeing very strong demand for that and golf. And as you know, the NFL is releasing their schedule later today. So that's all a positive. 
Again, we're very well positioned against this backdrop, given our #1 position on linear television as well as our AMS portfolio. And the fact that through the integration we've done, we can now deliver all that to our customers on a single point of contact, which is important to the extent that some of our counterparties have either furloughed or reduced staffing. 
So we feel good. I mean -- so advertising's tough, but we do see some green shoots and feel good about our ability to maximize that as they grow. 
With respect to YouTube, yes, thank you. We are very happy about that deal. But the quarter was not just about YouTube. We've had very strong activity in terms of renewals in the quarter and subsequent to the quarter's end, Comcast, Verizon, YouTube, all examples of the power of the combination, something we're quickly beginning to unlock. 
Big picture, we're seeing very strong consumption that underscores consumer demand for our products across platforms. On linear, remember, #1 in TV share, #1 in all key demos, that is -- and in this COVID time, in particular, very strong consumption, benefiting brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., BET, Comedy Central, obviously underscores the value of our product and also great momentum on streaming. We talked about that in my prepared remarks, real positive trends in sign-ups and actually conversions on All Access and Showtime OTT. So the portfolio is very strong. 
In terms of the deals, Comcast, first MVPD to add All Access. We're actually launching that today on Xfinity. Verizon, our first true cross-company, cross-portfolio MVPD deal, very happy with the economics. And that Pluto component is very significant in terms of Verizon wireless distribution and now YouTube, multiyear deal, includes an extension for CBS and Showtime and the addition of Viacom Media Networks very soon, 14 networks. That fills a key vMVPD white space for our company. That's obviously important. But it's also a win for them because it brings our #1 TV portfolio to their platform. And as they look at the next leg of their sub growth, that will benefit them. So very happy with all that."

And any updates on how you're thinking of sort of the evolution of how you allocate that given the breadth of distribution options that you have, any place you're putting more to work or maybe pulling back any? And then second, I'm curious about the advertising pacing at Pluto TV in particular. You guys disclosed each of your digital metrics were up 50%-plus in the quarter if I sort of parse that a little bit. Can you talk about how Pluto is pacing on a relative basis and whether you've seen any -- whether it's held up better or maybe been a little softer in the sort of COVID-driven disruption?"
27763231,662460208,2015837,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes. Sure, Michael. So on content, the company has a very substantial content asset. That includes current production through Paramount, CBS, Viacom Media Networks as well as a huge library. And the $13 billion cash content spend that we've referred to in",472,"Yes. Sure, Michael. So on content, the company has a very substantial content asset. That includes current production through Paramount, CBS, Viacom Media Networks as well as a huge library. And the $13 billion cash content spend that we've referred to in the past is a very material number. Relative to that number, we expect COVID to result in some reduction in overall content expenses in 2020. Now that's driven by the cancellation of certain events, say, the NCAAs, as an example, the reduction in number of episodes of certain seasons -- series, so CBS prime. A lot of those series only delivered 18 episodes versus the planned 22 because we have to shut down production early. And we did move some films out of 2020. So all those things will reduce the 13, but that's really a 2020 issue. It's not a planned change in run rate. 
Now in terms of that aggregate spend, we continue to prioritize investments in our owned and operated platforms. And that includes streaming with a growth emphasis on streaming as we shift mix from lower- to higher-growth sectors. With respect to streaming, our biggest franchises will be key to that strategy as well as our broad programming strength really across genres, genres being kids, animations, crime procedurals, et cetera. And so we will be prioritizing those programming areas for our owned and operated platforms. 
That said, we will continue to selectively license to third parties. It's a big market. Playing in that market has multiple benefits, not just revenue, but also expanding the reach of IP to new fans that benefits the franchise and related businesses like consumer products, like setting up for theatricals, et cetera. We're doing that in a very strategic way. So we're not going to license critical mass of any of our key programming areas, kids, procedurals, et cetera, to any single player. 
Likewise, again, we're prioritizing franchise IP to our owned platforms. And regardless of what we do in the licensing space, remember, ultimately, these deals are rentals. The IP does revert back. So that's how we're thinking about it, Mike.
In terms of Pluto, I referenced that digital was weaker, but digital is an aggregation of a lot of different things. We continue to see fantastic advertiser reception for the Pluto product. It really is the closest thing to linear television on the planet. And if you've seen Pluto in the last month with our Venetia upgrade, the product is fantastic. The presentation is improved. And by the way, the ad guts behind it are also upgraded. So we continue to see strong demand, certainly strong demand in the first quarter. We're doing fine in the second quarter, again, against a general softer backdrop, which everybody is seeing. But we continue to love the asset and advertisers do, too."

I know it's hard to give guidance given visibility. And are you thinking, Bob, about additional asset sales and monetization opportunities even beyond the Black Rock building and Simon & Schuster? And then I had a follow-up on Paramount."

And we do anticipate that, that sale will complete in 2020. For Simon & Schuster, we're currently preparing to make available for sale when the market conditions allow. 
So as we look at our capital allocation plan relative to thinking about how we use our cash, it's organic free cash flow generation, which we will benefit from the near-term production shutdown. It will be a benefit near term to free cash flow. But then also with the proceeds we get from the asset sales, we will look to pay down our debt to achieve the 2.75x leverage ratio."

And those are studios, networks and streaming. And that gives us a very clear lens to look through to consider whether assets fit or not. Based on that, again, it's clear that Black Rock, which is an iconic office building in New York, but doesn't fit any of those 3 categories, and Simon & Schuster, which is a preeminent publisher and an extraordinary company, again, doesn't fit any of those segments. So those are noncore, even though they're super high-quality assets. And again, we've had lots of interest in them. 
But when you look at that framework through the rest of the assets we own, the company really has a pretty compelling combination. So COVID hasn't changed our view on strategic asset composition in anything -- if anything, it's reinforced it. We believe the combination of studios, networks and streaming makes enormous synergistic sense together."

So in terms of affiliate, I think probably the best way to think about it is, if you look at pay subs, we saw stable trends in Q1 relative to Q4. That said, given what we're hearing and people are talking about in Q2, we do expect some modest incremental cord cutting. But importantly, our deal with YouTube will more than offset that when it kicks in this summer. So that's to your question of outperformance. 
Also on the domestic cable affiliate revenue side, as you know, we got a nice improvement in rate of change between Q4 and Q1. Q2 might move back a bit given what I just mentioned on sub trends. Again, we don't know what that actually is, but there's possibility. But given the deals we have locked in as of today, we see further improvement in the second half of the year on the domestic cable affiliate revenue trend line. So that's to your question on outperformance. 
Look, on streaming profitability, again, we're not giving guidance, certainly not into 2020 COVID environment. I can tell you that we are -- it really it's all about the mix of content expenditures across the company and continuing to remix from investment towards higher-growth areas that includes streaming. In the short term, there's a lot of incremental content that we're bringing to the platform that is existing content. And then over time, there'll be growing original content on the streaming side. But again, that's largely a mix. And again, as we look at a business plan for streaming, both in free and pay and more importantly, on this integrated linked ecosystem, we're very excited about what we see tracking out over the coming years. 
Finally, on Q3 ad sales, again, based on everything we see today, we believe Q3 ad sales will be better than Q2. And again, right now, May and June scatter looked better than April. So that's a good sign. We do see categories active in the market, again, pharma, CPG, financial services, tech. We do see for sure demand for sports, starting with this June 11 PGA event. And these PGA events are sort of staggered in kind of more open states, if you will, and locations. So we feel good about that. We have a very specific production plan for those, which we believe mitigates risk. And we're definitely seeing strong demand for that. 
So -- and again, it speaks to the power of the portfolio, the fact that we can serve advertisers through our #1 linear position across really all genres, add in Pluto and other high-quality digital assets and importantly, deliver it through a single point of customer contact. I think that will be even more important as we negotiate, say, this virtual upfronts. So that's what I'm seeing."

So yes, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. And by the way, as I said, our streaming services, which we also increasingly, call it, package into our relationship with our distributors are performing very well. So does that tilt in our favor at the moment? 
Yes, probably. We, by the way, also look forward to bringing live sports back, and we're going to be one of the first with golf, the nature of golf probably makes that a little bit simpler than some of the other sports. By the way, we set up a sound stage in Radford, the CBS lot to film both boxing and Bellator events, which we're going to use that soundstage to sequentially alternately produce those, albeit with no audience for the moment. So we're going to do some sports stuff around the edges. 
But yes, look, I like our position. I think the portfolio is very powerful. You see that starting to come to life with the deals I've already talked about, and I feel good about our trajectory going forward. 
With respect to movies, yes, we moved them later. We thought that was the right thing to do to preserve asset value. We obviously look at the market and look at what it will be at a point in time, and we'll make a decision if there's sufficient critical mass of screens, if you will, theaters to warrant opening a film. Our first film on the schedule is SpongeBob at the beginning of August. I think it's August 7. So it's too far out to call if that's definitely going to be released or it's definitely not going to be released. 
We hope it will release, but we will continue to look at and make the right decision in terms of the return on those assets because we got great films. I mean, whether it's Quiet Place Part II, which we premiered in New York 2 weeks before the crisis, and we pulled at the last minute, thank God we did because the film is incredible. And we didn't waste it. We saved it. Likewise, Top Gun: Maverick is off the chart. So -- but we're going to open them when it makes sense to open them, Rich. 
Lastly, on ad sales, look, we're not going to -- I'm not going to give you a domestic number. I can tell you it's not as bad as what Fox is saying, that's for sure, but it's not pretty either. But as far as a specific number, no, I'm not going to do that."

So international, I'd say, overall, the dynamics are similar to the U.S. And what I mean by that is escalated content consumption, both linear and streamed, soft ad market and us focusing on cost management. In terms of advertising, Q1",768,"Yes. Sure, John. So international, I'd say, overall, the dynamics are similar to the U.S. And what I mean by that is escalated content consumption, both linear and streamed, soft ad market and us focusing on cost management. 
In terms of advertising, Q1 was really a story of U.K. market under pressure. Spain also, Australia was actually up. Q2 is pretty soft across the board. And I would say that international is softer than domestic. And probably a way to think about it is we talk about this 2% growth number in Q1. The domestic number is better than that. The international number was a headwind for it. 
Importantly, in international, we are -- we now have 2 offices open, Beijing and Hong Kong. So things are moving forward. And that is both a light at the end of the tunnel but also a great way for us to get experience with facility reopening, which we have a big kind of working group on that. So we're prepped for it. 
And then on the international side, importantly, we continue to see new opportunities coming out of the merger when we think big picture. It might take us a little longer to realize them, but they're definitely there, things like bringing operating expertise from Channel 5 and Telefe to Network 10, things like bringing CBS' massive television library and production to Viacom International Media Networks distribution across MVPDs, OTT, mobile partners. And as we move forward on streaming, again, we see a real international opportunity, which leverages the combined company asset base, and it's more than seeing it. We have plans to go after it, as I said, in multiple markets over the next 12 months. 
With respect to production, we have a multifaceted plan in place for restarting production, which we believe will leave us well positioned with fresh product in the fall in both TV and film. And we also have a range of contingencies we can deploy. 
To your question on CBS, CBS has a very strong and stable schedule. We announced a renewal of over 80% of that slate yesterday. That's got a bunch of benefits, including the fact that in this virtual upfront time whenever it moves, advertisers will know what they're buying from us, and some of the other networks are not in that place. 
In terms of our return to production, a couple of things I'd highlight. One is because there was a possibility of a writer strike, we ensured we had a backlog of shows ready to go. So that's an asset we can draw on. In addition, if you start segmenting different kinds of production, sound stage-based productions, things like sitcoms, that's a more controllable environment. So we feel good about that. Dramas, again, if you look at it, there will likely be limitations. We can probably front-load production the components that are on sound stages and leave location to later. That's how we're thinking about it if need be. On the unscripted side, we can also modify productions to include more controllable environments. 
In terms of sports, we believe live sports will return. I talked about golf and the NFL probably in a modified form, but we believe they'll be there. And so we're optimistic that our fall schedule won't be materially disrupted, again, assuming we can get back in production sometime this summer. 
Know that in the interim, we continue to operate in a modified model. That includes using virtual productions. You've seen a bunch of those on air to keep news, late night and other shows going. To the extent we see gaps in production volume, we do have broad and deep libraries, including the recent addition of Miramax, which we can deploy on our platforms. Current example of this is the use of Paramount titles for a new CBS Sunday night at the movies, which started in May. That's filling in for a shortened season of NCIS derivatives back to the 18 episodes versus 22. 
On the Paramount side, we've completed principal photography on 8 films right before the crisis. Those include Without Remorse, Snake Eyes, Clifford, Coming to America, Top Gun, Infinite, Tomorrow World ] and Spell. So those are all being worked on remotely in post-production. So we will be in good shape when things open up. Likewise, Showtime is currently set and solid through Q3. So it's a bit of a fluid situation, but we spent a lot of time looking at not only return to facilities, but return to production, and we're confident that we'll have compelling content on in the fall."

I wondered, will you pull back some of the big library content that sits on Netflix or in a perfect world, would have you pulled back South Park from licensing that. So just give me a sense of that philosophy."

One is it for sure, fits in the strategic paradigm that I outlined of studios, networks and streaming. In fact, it's all 3. And the second thing I'd say on Showtime is we talked about some issues with Showtime circa '19, but our 2020 plan is all about turning around the performance with respect to earnings and cash flow, and we feel good about our trajectory there. And it's important to note it has real momentum on subscribers, particularly over the top. Showtime had its best quarter ever in sign-ups and consumption in Q1. And we've seen acceleration in sign-ups, time watched and total streams in April. And the conversion of free to pay as it's accelerated, i.e., more trials, we're seeing the same or better conversion rates. So that's all good, and we do have a lot of momentum on the programming side. 
With respect to streaming, I talked about our strategy a bit in my prepared remarks. And from a content perspective, again, we're very excited about where we're taking this. 
If you look at Pluto, it's a massive free gateway to our streaming ecosystem. We are going to continue to build that out. That has both owned and operated and third-party content on it. The content offering in ours is definitely weighted towards third party. Our content on it is definitely library, and that's working well. 
In respect to our pay product, which is more where your question would show up, we're in the middle of transforming CBS All Access into this much more compelling product that includes news, live sports and on-demand entertainment. So your question would really apply largely to on-demand entertainment. Again, we put over 100 Paramount films there this week. You will see a major move this summer, where we'll introduce a fundamentally new UI and add substantial content assets. As we do that, we are prioritizing franchises and importantly, critical mass of programming in genres, whether it's animation and kids or it's crime, et cetera, for O&O. 
We will continue to selectively license outside of that. So we may put a little kids somewhere on one platform, a little bit on another. But in terms of critical mass and in terms of big franchises, we're going to increasingly lean into that for our owned and operated platforms. We think that's a strategy that will create a very compelling streaming product and sort of trajectory for that element -- that portion of our business as well as allow us to continue to participate in a licensing market where there continues to be a lot of demand.
Look, guys, I really want to thank you for your questions and taking time with us in this strange time we're all living in. I want to close by saying ViacomCBS is a resilient company. We are well positioned to navigate the crisis, and we're really just beginning to tap the potential of our combined assets. 
To that end, you look at Q1, you look at the time since then, remember, we only closed this deal in December, but there are already multiple proof points to the power of the ViacomCBS combination. That includes recent affiliate deals. We talked about them today. Our cross-company use of content, we talked about today and very material cost synergies, which will probably increase as we move forward, leveraging our experience in COVID. 
Again, the first quarter and the weeks following demonstrated that our content is in demand in all kinds of formats. We did take aggressive steps to reduce costs, improve financial flexibility and frankly, strengthen our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Our growing scale, audience reach and earnings power will become more apparent as this market rebounds, and we put the full power of our portfolio behind the company, including behind our streaming strategy. 
So look, thanks, everyone, for your continued support. Stay well, and we look forward to seeing you in person, hopefully, sometime soon."

I'm pleased to report that ViacomCBS' second quarter delivered a continuation of, and in many respects, an acceleration of the 3 key themes we outlined on our Q1 call. First, despite headwinds",3043,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that ViacomCBS' second quarter delivered a continuation of, and in many respects, an acceleration of the 3 key themes we outlined on our Q1 call. 
First, despite headwinds from COVID-19, ViacomCBS delivered another solid quarter with sequential improvement in key earnings and cash flow metrics and clear operational momentum. Second, we continue to proactively manage through the pandemic, taking significant steps to strengthen our business, preserve the value of our assets, increase our financial flexibility and further reduce costs. And third, we continue to focus on and deliver on value creation, unlocking the power of ViacomCBS and specifically, our synergistic combination of studios, networks and streaming. 
In the quarter, we continued to integrate the company and increased our projection for cost savings, both in year and overall. We made significant progress in distribution, and we rapidly accelerated our streaming business. Here, we achieved record users in revenue in free and pay, all while simultaneously making material progress towards the relaunch of our diversified super service. 
So there's a lot to talk about. Let me start with an overview of the financials and some key operating highlights from the quarter. Financially, ViacomCBS posted the combined companies' second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in operating income, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow, this on both an absolute dollar and rate of change basis. 
While advertising revenue declined 27% in the quarter, overwhelmingly due to COVID, we continue to expect Q2 to be the bottom in terms of year-over-year decline. To that end, we've seen sequential improvement month-over-month since April. June was strong, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far in Q3. We believe this reflects not only economic optimism for a gradual recovery but also the power of our portfolio and the significant value we bring to advertisers. 
Affiliate revenue grew 2% in the quarter, with growth in pricing, retrans, reverse comp and streaming revenues more than offsetting pay TV subscriber declines. We anticipate this momentum to continue in the second half of the year. In addition, we increased domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes streaming subscription and digital video advertising revenue by 25%, reflecting record user growth in our streaming products, including 52% growth in subscription revenue. 
Moving to earnings. Cost-cutting initiatives and proactive cash management helped offset COVID- and timing-related revenue impacts. Here, the company reported 8% adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter and generated $892 million of adjusted free cash flow, bringing year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to nearly $1.4 billion, up 19% year-on-year. 
Keep in mind that the second quarter free cash flow includes a significant working capital benefit for COVID-related programming shifts and production delays. As film and TV production builds in the second half, we do anticipate some reversal of the working capital benefit. 
Operationally, the enduring strength of our brands and IP is enabling us to successfully navigate this landscape. During the quarter, our domestic media networks held the highest share of TV viewing in all key audience demos. 
In broadcast, CBS finished the season as America's most watched network for the 12th straight year. CBS was #1 in all key dayparts for the third season, with the most watched drama and most watched news program in prime, the top 5 comedies and the #1 late night show plus 7 of the top 8 new series. We also maintained our leadership as the #1 cable portfolio and share of TV viewing across all key demos, with more top 30 cable networks than any other media family. 
Nickelodeon was #1 with kids 2 to 11 for the 20th consecutive quarter and owned all of the top 10 original series. MTV had its best second quarter ratings performance in 2 years, and Comedy Central marked its 13th straight quarter of year-over-year share growth. And Showtime had the top show on premium cable for 2 consecutive quarters and the top 3 premium scripted series so far this year. 
Internationally, we continue to build on a global footprint that includes 190 million broadcast homes, the biggest in the world, and 2.7 billion cumulative TV homes. Our international linear share of viewing across countries increased 11% year-over-year. 
And I'm very proud to announce that for the first time in June, Tubular Labs ranked ViacomCBS the #1 media entertainment company in social. Not only does this reinforce our popularity and the relevance of our brands and IP in the digital space, but our huge social platform is also an important marketing tool, particularly as we gear up for the relaunch of our streaming super service. 
And speaking of streaming, we have continued our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our streaming platforms as we increasingly lean into this opportunity. In free, Pluto TV's domestic MAUs grew 61% to 26.5 million, and we remain confident that Pluto will achieve its 30 million domestic MAU target by year-end. And Pluto TV is also ramping up outside the U.S., something I'll come back to shortly. 
And in pay, we ended the quarter with 16.2 million subscribers, up 74% year-on-year, reaching our year-end goal 6 months ahead of plan. Here, CBS All Access had a great quarter, and you'll hear more about where that product is going in a minute. And Showtime OTT had its best quarter ever in subscriber growth. And in the last 6 months alone, Showtime OTT has grown more than the previous 2.5 years combined. 
As we rapidly grow and evolve our streaming business, we're now increasing our domestic pay streaming subscriber guidance to 18 million by year-end. This growth, in addition to the revenue growth I mentioned earlier, supports our conviction in the growth potential of our streaming offering, and we're just getting started. 
The combined strengths of our networks and streaming offerings also enabled us to make important strides in domestic distribution, where we struck significant carriage agreements. In April, we signed a truly comprehensive multi-platform partnership with Verizon, spanning pay TV, connected TV and mobile. One particularly exciting component of this deal is the significant expansion of Pluto TV footprint that it enables, one which is rolling out on Verizon Wireless as we speak. 
Then in May, we announced a new deal with YouTube TV. This deal renewed CBS and Showtime early and importantly, brought Viacom's cable networks to the fast-growing service. Viacom's brands went live on YouTube in late June, and we're thrilled to now provide MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET and more to its customers. 
More recently, July, we announced a multiyear renewal with DISH and Sling TV. This was our third cross-company renewal, further demonstrating the power of our brand and content. And we continue to benefit from strong reverse comp, recently signing agreements with Sinclair and Cox, in addition to Nexstar [indiscernible] earlier in the year. 
This deal-making and more is reflective of the fact that ViacomCBS is a cornerstone content provider to a broad range of distributors. The combination here is powerful. And I'm happy to say we expect sequential improvement in year-over-year growth rates for domestic cable networks and total company affiliate revenue in Q3 and Q4. 
Now turning from performance in the quarter to the second theme, how we've been managing through COVID. Here, there are a couple of points worth mentioning. 
First, we continue to fortify our balance sheet, enabling us to navigate the pandemic from a position of continued financial strength. During the quarter, we issued 2 debt transactions totaling $4.5 billion and used the proceeds to pay down $2.8 billion of upcoming maturities, including a $340 million redemption that settled in July. As a result, we don't have any maturities due until 2022. And we also have access to a committed and undrawn $3.5 billion revolver. 
Simultaneously, we have taken action to preserve and maximize the value of our assets, particularly in the film space. This starts with moving marquee film releases to 2021, when we believe the theatrical market will be stronger. In addition, we decided to take The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run and deploy this asset as part of our rebrand and relaunch of CBS All Access early in 2021, when we'll also have a short PVOD window leading into it. 
Paramount continues to be an incredible asset for the company. And while there weren't any new titles released in the quarter, we were able to capitalize on the strength and breadth of the studio's massive library of product as well as from our recently established joint venture with Miramax. And we remain excited about our film slate and look forward to opening fantastic films as the market stabilizes. 
Broadly speaking, everyone knows that COVID has presented material production challenges, but despite that, through alternate models, ViacomCBS continues to present consumers with fresh content in news, late night and selected unscripted areas. 
And in the quarter, we also resumed sports production with PGA Golf on CBS. It goes without saying that there is tremendous pent-up demand for live sports. Ratings for the Charles Schwab challenge, the Travelers Championship and the Rocket Mortgage Classic have all been very strong. In fact, since returning to live golf, CBS Sports' overall viewership is up 25% from comparable events last year. 
And building on that, we're excited to have Bellator and Showtime Boxing back on air, along with UEFA soccer premiering on CBS and CBS All Access this week. And we look forward to the return of football in the fall, including last week's announcement that the SEC has confirmed its in-conference game schedule, and we continue to be optimistic about the NFL 2, given all the work they're doing. 
With respect to entertainment product, we have already started to resume production activity, albeit on a smaller scale. Our priority is to restart our production safely and in compliance with local health and safety standards. There are, of course, a lot of moving parts to manage returning to production, and we've been collaborating with our industry partners on industry-wide recommendations. We're using a phased approach based on geography, show format, in-studio versus location-based productions, along with other considerations. 
But against this backdrop, things are ramping up. As examples, Tyler Perry just wrapped production on the new season of [ systems ] for BET. We're in production and close to completing Yellowstone in Utah and are about to start filming season 4 in Wyoming. And we recently started shooting a live-action show for Nickelodeon in Canada. Add to that, we have a series of unscripted productions underway, including Big Brother, which debuted this week. And we're excited about Love Island, which will be broadcasting 7 days a week once it debuts in late summer. 
Looking forward, we have a pipeline of productions moving towards starting. And we're optimistic that volume will grow, ensuring we have fresh product on air in the fall. 
And third, through it all, we continue to be focused on value creation. Value creation starts with delivering on the material cost savings opportunity associated with the integration of Viacom and CBS. Here, we continue to make quick progress. In fact, we are increasing our expected 2020 merger-related cost synergies from $250 million to $300 million. And we expect to achieve annualized run rate cost synergies of $800 million, up from our prior $750 million by the end of 2022. 
And of course, we continue to look for additional opportunity, including based on how we've had to rethink our operations since March. While it's premature to put a number on this, the experience sets the stage for further transformation and cost savings. 
But the combination of ViacomCBS is not only about value creation through cost savings. It's even more about value creation through revenue generation. I already spoke about the very material progress we've made on the distribution side and how that will lead to further sequential improvement in affiliate revenue this year. Here, the merger thesis is clearly coming to life. 
Streaming is another area where the power of the ViacomCBS combination is beginning to come to life, and this is critical since streaming is probably the most material value creation opportunity in media today. Building off our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our streaming platforms, we will capitalize on our positions across free and pay. This includes adding substantial content efforts and user experience enhancements, broadening distribution and leaning into marketing to serve consumers with a robust differentiated suite of linked streaming offering. In short, by providing consumers with the broadest video experience, spanning news, sports, entertainment, local and live across free and pay, we will be a global leader in freemium streaming. 
Let me unpack that a bit. In free, we continue to build on Pluto TV's position as the #1 free streaming TV service in the United States. During the quarter, Pluto saw strong growth and numerous product enhancements. This starts with content, where we continue to add more and more high-quality IP to our market-leading service. 
In fact, Pluto now has over 100,000 hours of compelling content available on it. As part of that, we gave you nightly South Park airings on Comedy Central Pluto TV, we launched CSI and Star Trek next-generation channels, and we plan to debut more than 40 other CBS shows, including Survivor, Amazing Race, JAG, America's Top Model, MacGyver and more. 
And of course, we continue to add a broad range of compelling third-party content in both entertainment and sports, including renewals with the NFL and Major League soccer. We also ramped up Pluto TV's distribution across multiple devices and services. I mentioned Verizon's first-of-its-kind deal earlier, but we also had major distribution expansions with TiVo and LG, which, on a combined basis, will shortly bring the Pluto TV service to well over 80 million new devices, setting the stage for the next leg of material growth. 
And this growth is not just about Pluto. It will also benefit our pay streaming strategy as we progressively build a linked ecosystem of free and pay D2C services that will fulfill fundamental consumer needs around quality, convenience and cost. Here, Pluto will serve as an important complement to and funnel for our pay services. 
In pay, we've progressed materially in the past few months, including being firmly on track with our CBS All Access transformation. On our last call, I said we'd preview a transformed service this summer. Last week, we did just that, adding the company's flagship brands, Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Smithsonian and 3,500 episodes from their libraries, bringing CBS All Access' offering to more than 20,000 episodes. This, in addition to the 150-plus Paramount movies we added roughly 2 months ago. 
Apart from its vast library, the new service will continue to have compelling live offerings, spanning CBS local affiliates, tentpole events and a critical mass of live sports from golf to football to basketball, plus exclusive streaming rights for major sports properties, including some of the world's biggest and most popular soccer leagues, adding a massive volume of compelling live sports content at just the right time. And as we get into 2021, expect to see a significant expansion of first run originals, including originals from all the brands. 
This will be a truly differentiated streaming product, and we are very excited about the opportunity. And I want to reiterate that we're doing all this in a targeted, capital-efficient way. We already have developed and scaled technology in the form of CBS All Access. We have a robust slate of exclusive originals from which we continue to build. Almost every dollar we invest in linear content across the company will benefit the service with varying windows. 
We have established distribution points across all major platforms and high user engagement. And we're not starting from zero. Existing customers will benefit from the expanded library, service enhancements and product development, further reducing churn and driving greater value. 
Outside the U.S., we also see a tremendous runway for growth in both free and pay streaming, and we're moving quickly. Pluto entered selected markets in Europe last year, and in April, entered into 17 Spanish-speaking Latin American markets. 
In fact, on a global basis, Pluto TV now has 33 million MAUs. Looking ahead, our goal is to expand our channel lineup in Latin America to reach more than 70 channels by the end of the year and to continue expanding our content offering in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the U.K. 
We'll also add more distribution platforms to accelerate the expansion. And our geographic expansion will continue, with plans underway to launch new local versions of Pluto TV in a number of additional priority markets, including Brazil and Spain this year and France and Italy in 2021. Importantly, these are all markets where ViacomCBS has strong local operations, including a large pipeline of local language content in place and ready to go. The Pluto TV platform is powerful, and the world is quickly embracing it. 
And in pay, we're targeting early '21 for the launch of our international streaming service, a super-sized offering of truly compelling content with first run originals and library from all ViacomCBS brands, including Showtime. We will focus next year's initial rollout on a set of high-value territories where we see an opportunity to become the market leader. These territories include Australia, Latin America and the Nordics. 
Our streaming strategy is working, and it's really just getting going. As you can see, it's about value creation on a global scale for the short and long term. And I look forward to updating you as we pass key milestones in the coming quarters. 
Now before I turn it over, I want to thank Chris for her relentless hard work and dedication to CBS and now ViacomCBS. Over the past 23 years, she's been a critical financial operator. And over the past year, she's played an integral role in helping combine and integrate ViacomCBS. On a personal level, I'm so grateful for her dedication, contributions, and I really look forward to watching her future endeavors. From all of management and from the ViacomCBS Board, thank you, Chris. 
With that, I'll hand it over to provide additional financial detail on the quarter."

It has been an amazing journey to be with ViacomCBS, and I do believe the best is yet to come for our united company based upon the strong performance momentum taking hold. 
As you can see in our results for the second quarter, COVID-19 did have an anticipated negative impact to our top line revenue performance. However, in preparing for this downturn in early March, we quickly pivoted to more disciplined expense management for Q2 and 2020 to ensure we maximize our financial performance in light of the lower top line trends. 
We delivered solid results in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow all improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row, evidence of ViacomCBS' ability to manage through COVID-19 and demonstrating the power of our united company. 
Today, I will first take you through our second quarter results in more detail. Then I will update you on the actions we have taken to strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility, and finally, I will provide you with some insights on the remainder of the year. 
Let's start with our financial performance in the quarter. As a result of COVID-19 and our ongoing restructuring plans, we have made several adjustments to our results. These adjustments include $121 million in programming charges associated with the abandonment of incomplete programs resulting from COVID-related production shutdown and $134 million in restructuring charges related to our synergy initiatives. 
In light of the ongoing COVID pandemic, we achieved solid results in Q2 2020. Total company revenue was $6.28 billion, down 12% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.69 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and adjusted EPS was $1.25. Adjusted free cash flow was a strong $892 million in the quarter, which excludes $178 million of restructuring and merger-related payments. 
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter, affiliate revenue increased 2%, benefiting from strong retrans, reverse and subscription streaming revenue growth, which more than offset the decline in Cable Network affiliate revenue. Cable Network affiliate revenue declined 6% in Q2, in line with the decline in Q1 2020. 
Advertising revenue was down 27% versus a year ago, overwhelmingly affected by COVID-19, which resulted in a significant pullback by advertisers. The comparison to the NCAA championship and Final 4 games in the year-ago period resulted in a 4-point headwind in the quarter. 
Domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscription and digital video advertising revenue, was up 25% versus a year ago to $489 million. Q2 benefited from significant growth in sign-ups and streams on CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and in monthly active users and minutes viewed on Pluto. Domestic streaming subscription revenue was up 52% in the second quarter, accelerating from the rate of growth in the first quarter driven by the continued momentum we are experiencing across all of our streaming products. 
Turning to content licensing. Revenue was comparable with the prior year. Revenue associated with the licensing of South Park was offset by significant licensing activity in the year-ago quarter as well as the timing of deliveries, which have been affected by COVID-related production delays. 
Theatrical revenue was immaterial in the quarter as most theaters remain closed in the U.S. and internationally. 
For Publishing, revenue declined 8%. Strong growth in digital book and audio sales was more than offset by declines in print sales. These titles in the quarter included John Bolton's The Room Where It Happened and Stephen King's If It Bleeds. 
On the expense front, we are highly focused on strategically reducing our costs. We continue to benefit from merger-related cost synergies in the second quarter and are on track to realize $300 million in savings for the full year of 2020 before consideration of onetime cost to achieve them, up from our previous expectation of $250 million. 
In addition, we are benefiting from COVID-related cost savings, which helped offset the impact of revenue declines and drove adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. A portion of these cost savings are timing related and will come back as we return to live sports and production. However, we expect to realize sustainable cost savings as we take learnings from this crisis and find ways to operate more efficiently over the long term. 
In addition, we now expect to achieve $800 million in annualized merger-related cost synergies by the end of 2022, up from our prior $750 million target as we remain highly disciplined in managing our costs. Overall, we are very pleased with ViacomCBS' results in the second quarter for 2020. 
Turning to the balance sheet and ViacomCBS' liquidity. In the second quarter, we completed 2 debt transactions totaling $4.5 billion. We used the proceeds to pay down $2.8 billion of our upcoming maturities, including a $340 million redemption that settled on July 10. And we added $1.7 billion to our cash balance, providing us with additional liquidity. 
These transactions significantly strengthen the financial position of the company, enabling us to effectively weather the current economic uncertainty. We now have no debt maturities until 2022. And in addition to our cash balance, we have our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. 
As of June 30, 2020, when you take into account the benefit of our full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.3x. On a net basis, taking into consideration our $2.3 billion cash balance as of June 30, our leverage ratio is 2.9x, unchanged from the end of 2019. We remain committed to our 2.75x leverage target, including the benefit of full run rate synergies and plan to use cash on hand proceeds from our noncore asset sales as well as excess cash flow after dividend payments to reduce our debt balance in order to achieve our leverage target. 
I would now like to provide you with some insights on the remainder of the year. Starting with affiliate revenue. As Bob discussed, we had an impressive quarter for distribution with several new agreements secured, including Verizon, YouTube TV, DISH, Sling TV, Sinclair and Cox. And as Bob mentioned, we now forecast domestic streaming subscribers to reach 18 million by year-end 2020, up from our previous 16 million expectations, which we have achieved ahead of plan. 
While we expect to be affected by industry pay TV subscriber trends, we will benefit from our recent affiliate deal, increased distribution on YouTube and the strong growth we are experiencing across our subscription streaming platforms. Taken together, we expect the year-over-year rate of change in domestic cable network affiliate revenue and total company affiliate revenue to improve in Q3 and again in Q4. 
Moving to advertising. We believe Q2 marked the bottom in the year-over-year rate of change in total company advertising revenue and expect to see sequential improvement in the year-over-year rate of change in advertising revenue in Q3 and again in Q4. 
A few other things to note for the third quarter and adjusted free cash flow in the back half of the year. First, on content licensing revenue. We expect COVID-related production delays will continue to affect content licensing deliveries in the third quarter. 
Second, on theatrical revenue. We have no movies scheduled to be released in the third quarter as we are saving valuable IP to be released in the theatrical window. That said, we strategically decided to deploy The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run to the relaunch of our super service in early 2021. 
And third, on adjusted free cash flow. We had a strong Q2. Our free cash flow benefited from disciplined COVID-related expense management, which will continue to positively impact cash in the balance of the year, given the natural lag between expenses and cash. 
In addition, our free cash flow benefited significantly from the delay in the timing of production. As we get back to production, spend will return, impacting free cash flow in the second half of the year. Looking beyond this year, we are laser-focused on optimizing working capital for ViacomCBS, which will drive improved free cash flow in 2021 and beyond. 
In closing, the first half results of the united ViacomCBS have many proof points of tremendous momentum that will benefit the company over the long term. Although COVID-19 has affected our short-term revenue trends, we remain focused on ensuring that we optimize our cost structure and investment strategy to maximize revenue growth and financial performance for the long term. 
On a personal note, it has been a true honor to be a part of the ViacomCBS team during the past 23 years. To Sherry, Bob, the Board of Directors and Naveen, I wish you much continued success as you lead this phenomenal company. 
To me, the company is really all of our talented people. So to the entire ViacomCBS team, I wish you the very best for the future. 
Lastly, I would like to commend and thank the amazing finance team of ViacomCBS. You are second to none, and I am most proud of all that we have accomplished together. 
With that, we can open the line for questions."

If you could give us a bit more detail about how it progressed through the second quarter with respect to your platforms, really looking from your linear cable networks all the way to AVOD, how it differed, I guess, throughout the second quarter on those platforms? But I think you said June was better, but I'm curious if you have any early thoughts on July if that improvement continued? 
And then my follow-up is just on Paramount, just really regarding the shortening window, theatrical windows and the agreement that we saw between AMC and Universal. Are you looking to reach sort of some agreements for Paramount?"
27763231,676138434,2062428,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Sure. So on advertising, let me reiterate that we believe Q2 is the bottom, and we expect to see continued sequential improvement in the rate of change in Q3 and again in Q4. With that, let me say a couple things to add some additional color. First, our",671,"Sure. So on advertising, let me reiterate that we believe Q2 is the bottom, and we expect to see continued sequential improvement in the rate of change in Q3 and again in Q4. 
With that, let me say a couple things to add some additional color. First, our total company advertising, obviously down in the quarter, and that was, as you heard, overwhelmingly and not surprisingly due to COVID. Beyond COVID, there is some lack of comparability to prior year, and that specifically is because we had the NCAA championship and Final 4 game in 2019, but Turner would have had that this year. So that's worth about 400 basis points if you're doing math. 
Second and really more to your question, the quarter turned out better than we thought early. And that was because we did see sequential improvement in each month of the quarter and simultaneously because scatter pricing held strong, 25%, really greater than that versus the upfront. 
The softness we did see is very concentrated in terms of categories. But at the same time, we saw some early signs of strength from some others, notably pharma, insurance and financial. 
And to the other specific question you asked, segments have been impacted differently. So broadcast in the mix is relatively strong. Cable's seen more relative softness. But in the cable side, we did take the opportunity to produce ad loads to improve the experience. Local has also been tough, but things are getting better. In particular, auto's coming back in Q3 as factories have reopened, and we continue to look forward to political being a significant driver in the second half. 
Digital also was impacted, but high-quality digital remains super strong. In fact, Pluto TV quickly returned to prepandemic growth rates and pricing and was very strong in Q2. So we like what we're seeing in terms of green shoots and look to continue to see that momentum. 
On the Paramount side, let me start by saying that while the studio was obviously unable to release films in the quarter due to COVID, it is an incredible asset to ViacomCBS. It has a powerful collection of IP, which we continue to develop for film, TV and streaming purposes. It's got a massive library, which benefits our networks and more recently, our streaming services. And its library is obviously a critical component of our licensing business. 
In this COVID time, which is really a time where theaters are shut down, we are focused on protecting asset value and really benefiting from optionality that our company and this environment presents. And that's driven us to do a number of things. 
First, we do continue to move films later to save them for what we believe will be a healthier environment in '21. You saw us do that most recently with A Quiet Place Part 2 and Top Gun: Maverick. We've also monetized some films, yes, with streamers, which allows us to get a return on our investment now. But importantly, it allows us to avoid putting even more product into a '21 that's starting to look pretty full. You saw that Lovebirds as an example. We also decided to use a film franchise strategically, and that's deploying SpongeBob, Sponge on the Run exclusively in the U.S. against our super service relaunch in early '21 after a short PVOD window. 
And then to your questions about PVOD, we really are in sort of a COVID rules phase of the business right now, where studios, including Paramount, are doing some things they wouldn't normally do because theaters are closed. Now we remain committed to theatrical and believe a lot of this reverts once the world normalizes. But we do believe the actual windows will probably shorten. And some of these new monetization paths, including both strategic ones and others, probably will become more confident. 
But as I look at the whole thing, it continues to make me highly confident that despite COVID, Paramount is incredibly valuable to us, both strategically and financially."

First, on streaming, streaming TV, connected TV advertising clearly have strong secular growth. You're investing into it with All Access and Pluto. But it's also a pretty complicated and fragmented market for advertisers. So Bob, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you see that developing, how products like [ i2 ] give CBS an advantage, ViacomCBS, an advantage and why advertisers are spending with you rather than, say, a platform like an Amazon Fire or Roku TV? 
And then second, just on costs. There's a number of puts and takes as we look forward with the synergies and timing. But as you go through this transition and invest in this transition to streaming, can you talk about how we should think about margins for the business maybe into the sort of like launch period? And then over the longer term, this is margin-expanding initiative?"
27763231,676138434,2062428,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes, sure, Michael. Thanks. So look, I couldn't be happier that we acquired Pluto TV last year. When we announced that acquisition, the market was confused. Most people didn't know what it was. And since then, AVOD, or now what people call FAST, has been",701,"Yes, sure, Michael. Thanks. So look, I couldn't be happier that we acquired Pluto TV last year. When we announced that acquisition, the market was confused. Most people didn't know what it was. And since then, AVOD, or now what people call FAST, has been accepted as a legitimate and important part of the streaming ecosystem, and others have followed us. 
But we haven't let up, not even close, like we leaned into its content, into enhancing the platform, into expanding distribution, into building the brand and into monetizing that inventory and most recently, global expansion. And as a result, we've grown Pluto TV dramatically and arguably extended our leadership position. 
The reality is no other U.S. FAST asset can touch the combination of Pluto's 100,000-plus hours of high-quality content, which we built through a combination of assets we own and these innovative revenue share-based models that we use with third parties. It's on over 30 devices and platforms. You name it. If it's significant, Pluto's there. 
We're rapidly expanding the distribution. We talked about these 80 million devices that are coming through new partnerships with Verizon, TiVo and LG not only adds to the expansive base we're already building through Amazon, Roku, Comcast, [ Vivo ] and more. And many of those have preferred placement and/or built-in carriage. And by the way, we got more deals coming in the pipeline, which are going to take these numbers up higher. 
Importantly, we're -- to the ad question, we're rapidly monetizing it. Pluto TV benefits both from programmatic flow and from direct ViacomCBS ad relationships. As a result, that business has grown dramatically. And as I said, it's bounced back to pre-COVID growth levels already. And now we're building an integrated ecosystem where Pluto's platform will feed our pay offerings. 
Now to your question on [ i2 ], it's worth noting that Pluto TV is really a cornerstone of [ i2 ], which for those of you that missed it, we announced this week. [ i2 ] is a new app platform, which will reach premium viewing audiences across the Viacom CBS portfolio. And here, we're talking about over 50 million monthly full episode users. So super high-quality advertising base. 
And by the way, to your question on live from us versus other people, you will only be able to buy that product direct from ViacomCBS. So we're in addition to being a broader solution provider, which, of course, we are, in this video space, we've really taken the next step in providing turnkey access to high-quality product to solve advertisers' problems. And that's just another example of the power of ViacomCBS in the ad marketplace. 
On the cost side, I think your costs were largely, if not fully related to the impact of streaming and scaling that service. So on investment, I guess, a couple of points. One is we have very significant amount of content that we've already invested in across the company that we can deploy against the asset, and we saw us do that -- some last week in the preview launch. 
Second thing I'd say is we understand the math of content investment. On CBS All Access alone, we have 5 years of LTV data, which we use to drive content decision-making, what we commission, what we renew, et cetera. 
And third, we're obviously leveraging live events and sports, which we already have that are a real driver of subscribers and usage of service in our experience. Now as the original slate grows over time and gets comprehensive across the full suite of brands, there will be some increase in cash content investment. However, we do intend to fund that as the mix shift from lower growth areas. And remember, we're also going to benefit from a larger subscriber base, which will generate even more revenue and help fund it. 
Lastly, I'd say we are going to market this in 2021 as part of a relaunch. But again, here, we'll significantly benefit from the power of our existing media assets and the appeal of our IP, including in social. So again, this is -- it's going to be ultimately additive to our financials, and we'll track through."

Just anything you can do to help us think about cash content spend this year and into next year. 
And then I wanted to ask you as you think about the super service and evolving All Access, sports is obviously something that is a huge driver of consumption and pricing power. Think you guys have a unique opportunity already in how you use sports and All Access, but that's something you're certainly leaning into. Can you just talk about your sports strategy on All Access and how you think about leveraging sports content on streaming versus linear and sort of the trade-offs of that strategic decision?"

So you're right, it's too early to provide 2021 guidance, and we're not going to do that. But I will say with respect to your question on return to production, which obviously is critical, particularly when you get to a cash basis, you saw our very strong cash flow delivery in Q2, close to $900 million on an adjusted basis. Certainly, that number benefited from working capital implications of our sort of production, I'd say, radical decline. It's not totally shut down, but certainly radically declined. And you should expect that as we move forward in Q3 but more likely Q4 at scale, that, that working cap benefit begin to go the other way a bit. 
And just to give you a little more color on the return to production because I think it's a topic everyone is interested in, we are currently executing a multifaceted return to production. Obviously, we're focused on health and safety of all involved in front of and behind the screen. And we have a real commitment to evolving approaches, locations, even storylines to deliver that fresh product, the customer and ultimately, consumer needs on a timely basis. 
And as we do that, by the way, we are finding some ways that we can operate less extensively. We've learned a lot through this COVID phase from the productions that are on. And we're rolling that through -- whether it's entertainment or sports, and we're rolling that through. 
We are dealing with all this to essentially managed process so we can ensure application of best practices, mitigate risk, and we have the whole portfolio going through it. That has led us to having a whole bunch of fresh content on or coming to air shortly, Unscripted, like Big Brother, which is on and now. We're shooting Love island in a hotel in Vegas, where the cast and crew are actually quarantine together. That will air later this month. Daytime soaps are back in production. In late night, Colbert and Cordon are scheduled to return to their buildings next week, albeit without audiences. Animation production continues to move forward. And by the way, I don't know how many of you saw it, but we made a series of announcements that were picked up last week about our path in adult animation. And that's really a building area of activity for us that I'm super excited about. 
On the scripted side, we have a whole set of things in motion. We do have scripts on all series. We are putting shows through the restart process I mentioned. Our third-party production studios are also beginning to move forward. And we got a range of contingency plans in place, which include additional unscripted, library movies and some other things. 
So a lot of options here as we work to serve consumers and customers. To the cash flow point in particular, I think you should expect Q3, there's more production spend in Q4, it builds there. And then we'll transition into 2021."

Let me take that from the angle of the overall -- where we're going with the overall super service, and I'll deal with each of your questions within that. 
So our guiding objective for a super service is to have a broad differentiated product at a compelling price point. And to get a real sense of that, take a good look at the preview launch we did last week, where we materially broadened CBS All Access. The entertainment offering is now far wider. We added 3,500 episodes from 70 series from our flagship brands. It unquestionably widens the demographic appeal because we now have a real offering for kids, young adults, millennials and more. And look at the sports offering, now including UEFA. In fact, if you look at the collection of football, basketball, golf, soccer and more on the platform, we really are the first that have taken sports over-the-top in a meaningful way. And we believe there's real appeal here as part of a broad streaming service. 
We obviously have events like The Grammys, The Tony's, Super Bowl. There's news, which is something people need these days or maybe not, I don't know. And then there are originals, to your other part of your question. Today, all access has a baseline of compelling originals. Shows like Star Trek: Picard, Discovery and now Lower Decks, which is animated, The Good Fight, Twilight Zone and The Stand. 
Starting in '21, and that slate will greatly expand to include all flagship brands. And as an indicator, really a taste, we announced last week that Kamp Koral, which is a SpongeBob spin-off, will join the super service as the first Nickelodeon original. And that will be on the back of the exclusive availability of the latest SpongeBob film, Sponge on the Run. 
So that's the kind of way we're using franchises. We have an original plan that goes through '22 quarterly. And I'm super excited about it, and you're going to hear more about that at another time. But that gives you a sense. The originals are going to be important, and they're going to be defining as well as the sports."

And if the AAV of the contract moves from sort of around 1 billion upwards towards 2 billion a year, your subscribers, and this is not a Viacom issue, this is an industry issue, subscribers will have dropped from mid-90s into somewhere probably in the 60s by the time you get to the next contract. How do you think about the return on investment of the NFL, like how does anyone essentially stay in the NFL business as subs are falling with the cost of the content going up so much? Like just how do you frame it? Or how do you think about it? And maybe how does CBS All Access or the new super service fit into the equation?"

Obviously, affiliate revenue advertising, to your point, streaming, and that's both subscription streaming and ad-supported streaming and potentially international revenue.

And for ViacomCBS, we believe, obviously, as part of that, there's substantial international opportunity. We believe that's true both in free and pay. You look at our global operating footprint, which includes our linear reach, the content we own, including local content, on the ground resources and relationships. We really see that as a powerful go-to-market advantage and feel we're well positioned to succeed. You look at where we are today on the free side, we're already in Europe and Latin America, Spanish-speaking Latin America with Pluto. We've seen very strong growth today to date, particularly in Latin America, which we've always been there a couple of months. We do have almost 7 million international MAUs, 33 million global. 
And we got -- we're just getting going there. We got plans to enhance our product, expanding our channel lineup. We're adding a bunch of distribution partners. We will enter Brazil and Spain later this year, France and Italy in early '21. So there's real growth ahead. And obviously, we're thinking about other things or Pluto as well. 
On the pay side, we're targeting early '21 for the launch of our international streaming service. The exact product details and pricing, which we haven't announced, will vary by individual markets. But broadly speaking, the new service will feature exclusive first run premier. So we're going to get those from the slate we're using with CBS All Access in the U.S. from Showtime and from Viacom International Studios. And alongside that, we'll use Paramount movies, box sets from CBS and Viacom media networks. 
If you want to just compare it at a high level to what we're doing in the U.S., it will be a much more entertainment-focused product. It doesn't really have a sports, a material sports lane to it. And it will have an output deal from Showtime because we don't operate Showtime networks outside the United States. We will be rolling it in multiple markets next year, including Australia, Latin America and the Nordics. You'll probably see some press about that. But we're really excited about the opportunity. 
And again, this is another place where the power of ViacomCBS is really going to show through. The power of the combination of content, the power of the international footprint we have that's really differentiated from others. 
So look, thanks, everyone, for making time in this COVID day coming to us probably from your home. I'd sum it up to say, despite the COVID-19 headwinds, we did deliver another solid quarter, reaffirming the strength and optionality of our combined operations. We're executing against key objectives and pushing ViacomCBS to emerge stronger. 
As you see, the key earnings and cash flow metrics improved sequentially as we continue to make progress on our integration, and we are now nicely ahead of our run rate and 2020 merger-related cost synergies that we committed to. Our deal-making and execution is underscoring the benefits of our increased scale. And that, obviously, you see in the significant distribution agreements we struck with Verizon, YouTube and others. 
And importantly, we're ahead of schedule in building our streaming business. Pluto TV is really cranking, and we're progressively moving towards the relaunch of our diversified super service early next year. And by the way, we just debuted our latest original [ Startrak ] Lower Decks on CBS All Access. It's a great piece of adult animation. I hope you all go and check it out. 
And lastly, to the employees of ViacomCBS, I want to thank you for your amazing passion, dedication and tenacity at this challenging point in time. You're all making a difference, helping drive our company forward. So thanks again for your time today and stay well."

I'm pleased to report that ViacomCBS' second quarter delivered a continuation of, and in many respects an acceleration of, the 3 key themes we outlined on our Q1 call.First, despite headwinds f",3043,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that ViacomCBS' second quarter delivered a continuation of, and in many respects an acceleration of, the 3 key themes we outlined on our Q1 call.
First, despite headwinds from COVID-19, ViacomCBS delivered another solid quarter with sequential improvement in key earnings and cash flow metrics and clear operational momentum. Second, we continue to proactively manage through the pandemic, taking significant steps to strengthen our business, preserve the value of our assets, increase our financial flexibility and further reduce costs. And third, we continue to focus on and deliver on value creation, unlocking the power of ViacomCBS and, specifically, our synergistic combination of studios, networks and streaming.
In the quarter, we continued to integrate the company and increased our projection for cost savings, both in year and overall. We made significant progress in distribution, and we rapidly accelerated our streaming business. Here, we achieved record users in revenue in free and pay, all while simultaneously making material progress towards the relaunch of our diversified super service.
So there's a lot to talk about. Let me start with an overview of the financials and some key operating highlights from the quarter. Financially, ViacomCBS posted the combined company's second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in operating income, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow, this on both an absolute dollar and rate of change basis.
While advertising revenue declined 27% in the quarter, overwhelmingly due to COVID, we continue to expect Q2 to be the bottom in terms of year-over-year decline. To that end, we've seen sequential improvement month-over-month since April, June was strong, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far in Q3. We believe this reflects not only economic optimism for a gradual recovery but also the power of our portfolio and the significant value we bring to advertisers.
Affiliate revenue grew 2% in the quarter, with growth in pricing, retrans, reverse comp and streaming revenues more than offsetting pay TV subscriber declines. We anticipate this momentum to continue in the second half of the year. In addition, we increased domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes streaming subscription and digital video advertising revenue by 25%, reflecting record user growth in our streaming products, including 52% growth in subscription revenue.
Moving to earnings. Cost-cutting initiatives and proactive cash management helped offset COVID- and timing-related revenue impacts. Here, the company reported 8% adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter and generated $892 million of adjusted free cash flow, bringing year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to nearly $1.4 billion, up 19% year-on-year.
Keep in mind that the second quarter free cash flow includes a significant working capital benefit from COVID-related programming shifts and production delays. As film and TV production builds in the second half, we do anticipate some reversal of the working capital benefit.
Operationally, the enduring strength of our brands and IP is enabling us to successfully navigate this landscape. During the quarter, our domestic media networks held the highest share of TV viewing in all key audience demos.
In broadcast, CBS finished the season as America's most watched network for the 12th straight year. CBS was #1 in all key dayparts for the third season, with the most watched drama and most watched news program in prime, the top 5 comedies and the #1 late night show, plus 7 of the top 8 new series. We also maintained our leadership as the #1 cable portfolio and share of TV viewing across all key demos, with more top 30 cable networks than any other media family.
Nickelodeon was #1 with kids 2 to 11 for the 20th consecutive quarter and owned all of the top 10 original series. MTV had its best second quarter ratings performance in 2 years, and Comedy Central marked its 13th straight quarter of year-over-year share growth. And Showtime had the top show on premium cable for 2 consecutive quarters and the top 3 premium scripted series so far this year.
Internationally, we continue to build on a global footprint that includes 190 million broadcast homes, the biggest in the world, and 2.7 billion cumulative TV homes. Our international linear share of viewing across countries increased 11% year-over-year.
And I'm very proud to announce that for the first time, in June, Tubular Labs ranked ViacomCBS the #1 media entertainment company in social. Not only does this reinforce our popularity and the relevance of our brands and IP in the digital space, but our huge social platform is also an important marketing tool, particularly as we gear up for the relaunch of our streaming super service.
And speaking of streaming, we have continued our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our streaming platforms as we increasingly lean into this opportunity. In free, Pluto TV's domestic MAUs grew 61% to 26.5 million, and we remain confident that Pluto will achieve its 30 million domestic MAU target by year-end. And Pluto TV is also ramping up outside the U.S., something I'll come back to shortly.
And in pay, we ended the quarter with 16.2 million subscribers, up 74% year-on-year, reaching our year-end goal 6 months ahead of plan. Here, CBS All Access had a great quarter, and you'll hear more about where that product is going in a minute. And Showtime OTT had its best quarter ever in subscriber growth. And in the last 6 months alone, Showtime OTT has grown more than the previous 2.5 years combined.
As we rapidly grow and evolve our streaming business, we're now increasing our domestic pay streaming subscriber guidance to 18 million by year-end. This growth, in addition to the revenue growth I mentioned earlier, supports our conviction in the growth potential of our streaming offering, and we're just getting started.
The combined strengths of our networks and streaming offerings also enabled us to make important strides in domestic distribution, where we struck significant carriage agreements. In April, we signed a truly comprehensive multi-platform partnership with Verizon, spanning pay TV, connected TV and mobile. One particularly exciting component of this deal is the significant expansion of Pluto TV footprint that it enables, one which is rolling out on Verizon Wireless as we speak.
Then in May, we announced a new deal with YouTube TV. This deal renewed CBS and Showtime early and, importantly, brought Viacom's cable networks to the fast-growing service. Viacom's brands went live on YouTube in late June, and we're thrilled to now provide MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET and more to its customers.
More recently, in July, we announced a multiyear renewal with DISH and Sling TV. This was our third cross-company renewal, further demonstrating the power of our brands and content. And we continue to benefit from strong reverse comp, recently signing agreements with Sinclair and Cox, in addition to Nexstar and Meredith earlier in the year.
This deal-making and more is reflective of the fact that ViacomCBS is a cornerstone content provider to a broad range of distributors. The combination here is powerful. And I'm happy to say we expect sequential improvement in year-over-year growth rates for domestic cable networks and total company affiliate revenue in Q3 and Q4.
Now turning from performance in the quarter to the second theme: how we've been managing through COVID. Here, there are a couple of points worth mentioning.
First, we continue to fortify our balance sheet, enabling us to navigate the pandemic from a position of continued financial strength. During the quarter, we issued 2 debt transactions totaling $4.5 billion and used the proceeds to pay down $2.8 billion of upcoming maturities, including a $340 million redemption that settled in July. As a result, we don't have any maturities due until 2022. And we also have access to a committed and undrawn $3.5 billion revolver.
Simultaneously, we have taken action to preserve and maximize the value of our assets, particularly in the film space. This starts with moving marquee film releases to 2021 when we believe the theatrical market will be stronger. In addition, we decided to take The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run and deploy this asset as part of our rebrand and relaunch of CBS All Access early in 2021 when we'll also have a short PVOD window leading into it.
Paramount continues to be an incredible asset for the company. And while there weren't any new titles released in the quarter, we were able to capitalize on the strength and breadth of the studio's massive library of product as well as from our recently established joint venture with Miramax. And we remain excited about our film slate and look forward to opening fantastic films as the market stabilizes.
Broadly speaking, everyone knows that COVID has presented material production challenges, but despite that, through alternate models, ViacomCBS continues to present consumers with fresh content in news, late night and selected unscripted areas. And in the quarter, we also resumed sports production with PGA Golf on CBS. It goes without saying that there is tremendous pent-up demand for live sports. Ratings for the Charles Schwab Challenge, the Travelers Championship and the Rocket Mortgage Classic have all been very strong. In fact, since returning to live golf, CBS Sports' overall viewership is up 25% from comparable events last year.
And building on that, we're excited to have Bellator and Showtime Boxing back on air, along with UEFA soccer premiering on CBS and CBS All Access this week. And we look forward to the return of football in the fall, including last week's announcement that the SEC has confirmed its in-conference game schedule, and we continue to be optimistic about the NFL 2 given all the work they are doing.
With respect to entertainment product, we have already started to resume production activity, albeit on a smaller scale. Our priority is to restart our production safely and in compliance with local health and safety standards. There are, of course, a lot of moving parts to manage returning to production, and we've been collaborating with our industry partners on industry-wide recommendations. We're using a phased approach based on geography, show format, in-studio versus location-based productions, along with other considerations.
But against this backdrop, things are ramping up. As examples, Tyler Perry just wrapped production on the new season of Sistas for BET. We're in production and close to completing Yellowstone in Utah and are about to start filming season 4 in Wyoming. And we recently started shooting a live action show for Nickelodeon in Canada. Add to that, we have a series of unscripted productions underway, including Big Brother, which debuted this week. And we're excited about Love Island, which will be broadcasting 7 days a week once it debuts in late summer.
Looking forward, we have a pipeline of productions moving towards starting. And we're optimistic that volume will grow, ensuring we have fresh product on air in the fall.
And third, through it all, we continue to be focused on value creation. Value creation starts with delivering on the material cost savings opportunity associated with the integration of Viacom and CBS. Here, we continue to make quick progress. In fact, we are increasing our expected 2020 merger-related cost synergies from $250 million to $300 million. And we expect to achieve annualized run rate cost synergies of $800 million, up from our prior $750 million by the end of 2022.
And of course, we continue to look for additional opportunity, including based on how we've had to rethink our operations since March. While it's premature to put a number on this, the experience sets the stage for further transformation and cost savings.
But the combination of ViacomCBS is not only about value creation through cost savings. It's even more about value creation through revenue generation. I already spoke about the very material progress we've made on the distribution side and how that will lead to further sequential improvement in affiliate revenue this year. Here, the merger thesis is clearly coming to life. Streaming is another area where the power of the ViacomCBS combination is beginning to come to life. And this is critical since streaming is probably the most material value creation opportunity in media today.
Building off our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our streaming platforms, we will capitalize on our positions across free and pay. This includes adding substantial content assets and user experience enhancements, broadening distribution and leaning into marketing to serve consumers with a robust differentiated suite of linked streaming offering. In short, by providing consumers with the broadest video experience, spanning news, sports, entertainment, local and live across free and pay, we will be a global leader in freemium streaming.
Let me unpack that a bit. In free, we continue to build on Pluto TV's position as the #1 free streaming TV service in the United States. During the quarter, Pluto saw strong growth and numerous product enhancements. This starts with content, where we continue to add more and more high-quality IP to our market-leading service.
In fact, Pluto now has over 100,000 hours of compelling content available on it. As part of that, we gave you nightly South Park airings on Comedy Central Pluto TV, we launched CSI and Star Trek next-generation channels, and we plan to debut more than 40 other CBS shows, including Survivor, Amazing Race, JAG, America's Top Model, MacGyver and more. And of course, we continue to add a broad range of compelling third-party content in both entertainment and sports, including renewals with the NFL and Major League soccer. 
We also ramped up Pluto TV's distribution across multiple devices and services. I mentioned Verizon's first-of-its-kind deal earlier, but we also had major distribution expansions with TiVo and LG, which, on a combined basis, will shortly bring the Pluto TV service to well over 80 million new devices, setting the stage for the next leg of material growth.
And this growth is not just about Pluto. It will also benefit our pay streaming strategy as we progressively build a linked ecosystem of free and pay D2C services that will fulfill fundamental consumer needs around quality, convenience and cost. Here, Pluto will serve as an important complement to and funnel for our pay services.
In pay, we've progressed materially in the past few months, including being firmly on track with our CBS All Access transformation. On our last call, I said we'd preview a transformed service this summer. Last week, we did just that, adding the company's flagship brands, Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Smithsonian and 3,500 episodes from their libraries, bringing CBS All Access' offering to more than 20,000 episodes. This, in addition to the 150-plus Paramount movies we added roughly 2 months ago.
Apart from its vast library, the new service will continue to have compelling live offerings, spanning CBS local affiliates, tentpole events and a critical mass of live sports, from golf to football to basketball, plus exclusive streaming rights for major sports properties, including some of the world's biggest and most popular soccer leagues, adding a massive volume of compelling live sports content at just the right time. And as we get into 2021, expect to see a significant expansion of first-run originals, including originals from all the brands. This will be a truly differentiated streaming product, and we are very excited about the opportunity.
And I want to reiterate that we're doing all this in a targeted, capital-efficient way. We already have developed and scaled technology in the form of CBS All Access. We have a robust slate of exclusive originals from which we continue to build. Almost every dollar we invest in linear content across the company will benefit the service with varying windows.
We have established distribution points across all major platforms and high user engagement. And we're not starting from zero. Existing customers will benefit from the expanded library, service enhancements and product development, further reducing churn and driving greater value.
Outside the U.S., we also see a tremendous runway for growth in both free and pay streaming, and we're moving quickly. Pluto entered selected markets in Europe last year, and in April, entered into 17 Spanish-speaking Latin American markets. In fact, on a global basis, Pluto TV now has 33 million MAUs.
Looking ahead, our goal is to expand our channel lineup in Latin America to reach more than 70 channels by the end of the year and to continue expanding our content offering in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the U.K. We'll also add more distribution platforms to accelerate the expansion. And our geographic expansion will continue, with plans underway to launch new local versions of Pluto TV in a number of additional priority markets, including Brazil and Spain this year and France and Italy in 2021. Importantly, these are all markets where ViacomCBS has strong local operations, including a large pipeline of local language content in place and ready to go. The Pluto TV platform is powerful, and the world is quickly embracing it.
And in pay, we're targeting early '21 for the launch of our international streaming service, a super-sized offering of truly compelling content with first-run originals and library from all ViacomCBS brands, including Showtime. We will focus next year's initial rollout on a set of high-value territories where we see an opportunity to become the market leader. These territories include Australia, Latin America and the Nordics.
Our streaming strategy is working, and it's really just getting going. As you can see, it's about value creation on a global scale for the short and long term. And I look forward to updating you as we pass key milestones in the coming quarters.
Now before I turn it over, I want to thank Chris for her relentless hard work and dedication to CBS and now ViacomCBS. Over the past 23 years, she's been a critical financial operator. And over the past year, she's played an integral role in helping combine and integrate ViacomCBS. On a personal level, I'm so grateful for her dedication, contributions, and I really look forward to watching her future endeavors.

It has been an amazing journey to be with ViacomCBS, and I do believe the best is yet to come for our united company based upon the strong performance momentum taking hold.
As you can see in our results for the second quarter, COVID-19 did have an anticipated negative impact to our top line revenue performance. However, in preparing for this downturn in early March, we quickly pivoted to more disciplined expense management for Q2 and 2020 to ensure we maximize our financial performance in light of the lower top line trends.
We delivered solid results in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow all improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row, evidence of ViacomCBS' ability to manage through COVID-19 and demonstrating the power of our united company.
Today, I will first take you through our second quarter results in more detail. Then I will update you on the actions we have taken to strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. And finally, I will provide you with some insights for the remainder of the year.
Let's start with our financial performance in the quarter. As a result of COVID-19 and our ongoing restructuring plans, we have made several adjustments to our results. These adjustments include $121 million in programming charges associated with the abandonment of incomplete programs resulting from COVID-related production shutdown and $134 million in restructuring charges related to our synergy initiatives.
In light of the ongoing COVID pandemic, we achieved solid results in Q2 2020. Total company revenue was $6.28 billion, down 12% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.69 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and adjusted EPS was $1.25. Adjusted free cash flow was a strong $892 million in the quarter, which excludes $178 million of restructuring and merger-related payments.
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter, affiliate revenue increased 2%, benefiting from strong retrans, reverse comp and subscription streaming revenue growth, which more than offset the decline in cable network affiliate revenue. Cable network affiliate revenue declined 6% in Q2, in line with the decline in Q1 2020.
Advertising revenue was down 27% versus a year ago, overwhelmingly affected by COVID-19, which resulted in a significant pullback by advertisers. The comparison to the NCAA championship and Final Four games in the year ago period resulted in a 4-point headwind in the quarter.
Domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscription and digital video advertising revenue, was up 25% versus a year ago to $489 million. Q2 benefited from significant growth in sign-ups and streams on CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and in monthly active users and minutes viewed on Pluto. Domestic streaming subscription revenue was up 52% in the second quarter, accelerating from the rate of growth in the first quarter driven by the continued momentum we are experiencing across all of our streaming products.
Turning to content licensing. Revenue was comparable with the prior year. Revenue associated with the licensing of South Park was offset by significant licensing activity in the year ago quarter as well as the timing of deliveries, which have been affected by COVID-related production delays. Theatrical revenue was immaterial in the quarter as most theaters remain closed in the U.S. and internationally.
For Publishing, revenue declined 8%. Strong growth in digital book and audio sales was more than offset by declines in print sales. These titles in the quarter included John Bolton's The Room Where It Happened and Stephen King's If It Bleeds.
On the expense front, we are highly focused on strategically reducing our costs. We continue to benefit from merger-related cost synergies in the second quarter and are on track to realize $300 million in savings for the full year of 2020 before consideration of onetime costs to achieve them, up from our previous expectation of $250 million.
In addition, we are benefiting from COVID-related cost savings, which helped offset the impact of revenue declines and drove adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. A portion of these cost savings are timing related and will come back as we return to live sports and production. However, we expect to realize sustainable cost savings as we take learnings from this crisis and find ways to operate more efficiently over the long term.
In addition, we now expect to achieve $800 million in annualized merger-related cost synergies by the end of 2022, up from our prior $750 million target as we remain highly disciplined in managing our costs. Overall, we are very pleased with ViacomCBS' results in the second quarter of 2020.
Turning to the balance sheet and ViacomCBS' liquidity. In the second quarter, we completed 2 debt transactions totaling $4.5 billion. We used the proceeds to pay down $2.8 billion of our upcoming maturities, including a $340 million redemption that settled on July 10. And we added $1.7 billion to our cash balance, providing us with additional liquidity. These transactions significantly strengthen the financial position of the company, enabling us to effectively weather the current economic uncertainty. We now have no debt maturities until 2022. And in addition to our cash balance, we have our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn.
As of June 30, 2020, when you take into account the benefit of our full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.3x. On a net basis, taking into consideration our $2.3 billion cash balance as of June 30, our leverage ratio is 2.9x, unchanged from the end of 2019. We remain committed to our 2.75x leverage target, including the benefit of full run rate synergies, and plan to use cash on hand, proceeds from our noncore asset sales as well as excess cash flow after dividend payments to reduce our debt balance in order to achieve our leverage target.
I would now like to provide you with some insights on the remainder of the year. Starting with affiliate revenue. As Bob discussed, we had an impressive quarter for distribution, with several new agreements secured, including Verizon, YouTube TV, DISH, Sling TV, Sinclair and Cox. And as Bob mentioned, we now forecast domestic streaming subscribers to reach 18 million by year-end 2020, up from our previous 16 million expectations, which we have achieved ahead of plan. While we expect to be affected by industry pay TV subscriber trends, we will benefit from our recent affiliate deal, increased distribution on YouTube and the strong growth we are experiencing across our subscription streaming platforms. Taken together, we expect the year-over-year rate of change in domestic cable network affiliate revenue and total company affiliate revenue to improve in Q3 and again in Q4.
Moving to advertising. We believe Q2 marked the bottom in the year-over-year rate of change in total company advertising revenue and expect to see sequential improvement in the year-over-year rate of change in advertising revenue in Q3 and again in Q4.
A few other things to note for the third quarter and adjusted free cash flow in the back half of the year. First, on content licensing revenue. We expect COVID-related production delays will continue to affect content licensing deliveries in the third quarter.
Second, on theatrical revenue. We have no movies scheduled to be released in the third quarter as we are saving valuable IP to be released in the theatrical window. That said, we strategically decided to deploy The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run through the relaunch of our super service in early 2021.
And third, on adjusted free cash flow. We had a strong Q2. Our free cash flow benefited from disciplined COVID-related expense management, which will continue to positively impact cash in the balance of the year given the natural lag between expenses and cash.
In addition, our free cash flow benefited significantly from the delay in the timing of production. As we get back to production, spend will return, impacting free cash flow in the second half of the year. Looking beyond this year, we are laser-focused on optimizing working capital for ViacomCBS, which will drive improved free cash flow in 2021 and beyond.
In closing, the first half results of the united ViacomCBS have many proof points of tremendous momentum that will benefit the company over the long term. Although COVID-19 has affected our short-term revenue trends, we remain focused on ensuring that we optimize our cost structure and investment strategy to maximize revenue growth and financial performance for the long term.
On a personal note, it has been a true honor to be a part of the ViacomCBS team during the past 23 years. To Shari, Bob, the Board of Directors and Naveen, I wish you much continued success as you lead this phenomenal company. To me, the company is really all of our talented people. So to the entire ViacomCBS team, I wish you the very best for the future.
Lastly, I would like to commend and thank the amazing finance team of ViacomCBS. You are second to none, and I am most proud of all that we have accomplished together.
With that, we can open the line for questions."

If you could give us a bit more detail about how it progressed through the second quarter with respect to your platforms, really looking from your linear cable networks all the way to AVOD, how it differed, I guess, throughout the second quarter on those platforms. But I think you said June was better, but I'm curious if you have any early thoughts on July, if that improvement continued.
And then my follow-up is just on Paramount, just really regarding the shortening window, theatrical windows, and the agreement that we saw between AMC and Universal. Are you looking to reach sort of similar agreements for Paramount?"

So on advertising, let me reiterate that we believe Q2 is the bottom, and we expect to see continued sequential improvement in the rate of change in Q3 and again in Q4. With that, let me say a couple things to add so",678,"Sure. Alexia, nice to hear your voice. So on advertising, let me reiterate that we believe Q2 is the bottom, and we expect to see continued sequential improvement in the rate of change in Q3 and again in Q4. With that, let me say a couple things to add some additional color.
First, our total company advertising, obviously down in the quarter, and that was, as you heard, overwhelmingly and not surprisingly due to COVID. Beyond COVID, there is some lack of comparability to prior year, and that specifically is because we had the NCAA championship and Final Four game in 2019, but Turner would have had that this year. So that's worth about 400 basis points if you're doing math.
Second, and really more to your question, the quarter turned out better than we thought early. And that was because we did see sequential improvement in each month of the quarter and simultaneously because scatter pricing held strong, 25%, really greater than that versus the upfront. The softness we did see is very concentrated in terms of categories. But at the same time, we saw some early signs of strength from some others, notably pharma, insurance and financial.
And to the other specific question you asked, segments have been impacted differently. So broadcast in the mix is relatively strong. Cable's seen more relative softness. But in the cable side, we did take the opportunity to produce ad loads to improve the experience. Local has also been tough, but things are getting better. In particular, auto's coming back in Q3 as factories have reopened, and we continue to look forward to political being a significant driver in the second half.
Digital also was impacted, but high-quality digital remains super strong. In fact, Pluto TV quickly returned to pre-pandemic growth rates and pricing and was very strong in Q2. So we like what we're seeing in terms of green shoots and look to continue to see that momentum.
On the Paramount side, let me start by saying that while the studio was obviously unable to release films in the quarter due to COVID, it is an incredible asset to ViacomCBS. It has a powerful collection of IP, which we continue to develop for film, TV and streaming purposes. It's got a massive library, which benefits our networks and more recently, our streaming services. And its library is obviously a critical component of our licensing business.
In this COVID time, which is really a time where theaters are shut down, we are focused on protecting asset value and really benefiting from optionality that our company and this environment presents. And that's driven us to do a number of things.
First, we do continue to move films later to save them for what we believe will be a healthier environment in '21. You saw us do that most recently with A Quiet Place Part II and Top Gun: Maverick. We've also monetized some films, yes, with streamers, which allows us to get a return on our investment now. But importantly, it allows us to avoid putting even more product into a '21 that's starting to look pretty full. You saw that with Lovebirds as an example. We also decided to use a film franchise strategically, and that's deploying SpongeBob: Sponge on the Run exclusively in the U.S. against our super service relaunch in early '21 after a short PVOD window.
And then to your questions about PVOD, we really are in sort of a COVID rules phase of the business right now, where studios, including Paramount, are doing some things they wouldn't normally do because theaters are closed. Know we remain committed to theatrical and believe a lot of this reverts once the world normalizes. But we do believe the actual windows will probably shorten, and some of these new monetization paths, including both strategic ones and others, probably will become more confident.
But as I look at the whole thing, it continues to make me highly confident that despite COVID, Paramount is incredibly valuable to us, both strategically and financially."

First, on streaming, streaming TV, connected TV, advertising clearly have strong secular growth. You're investing into it with All Access and Pluto. But it's also a pretty complicated and fragmented market for advertisers. So Bob, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you see that developing, how products like EyeQ gives CBS an advantage -- ViacomCBS an advantage and why advertisers are spending with you rather than, say, a platform like an Amazon Fire or Roku TV.
And then second, just on costs. There's a number of puts and takes as we look forward with the synergies and timing. But as you go through this transition and invest in this transition to streaming, can you talk about how we should think about margins for the business maybe into the sort of like launch period, and then over the longer term, if this is margin-expanding initiative?"
27763231,676138434,2062614,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes. Sure, Michael. Thanks.

When we announced that acquisition, the market was confused. Most people didn't know what it was. Since then, AVOD, or now what people call FAST, has been accepted as a legitimate and important part of the streaming ecosystem, and others have followed us.
But we haven't let up, not even close, like we leaned into its content, into enhancing the platform, into expanding distribution, into building the brand and into monetizing its ad inventory and most recently, global expansion. And as a result, we've grown Pluto TV dramatically and arguably extended our leadership position.
The reality is no other U.S. FAST asset can touch the combination of Pluto's 100,000-plus hours of high-quality content, which we built through a combination of assets we own and these innovative revenue share-based models that we use with third parties. It's on over 30 devices and platforms. You name it. If it's significant, Pluto's there.
We're rapidly expanding the distribution. We talked about these 80 million devices that are coming through new partnerships with Verizon, TiVo and LG not only adds to the expansive base we're already building through Amazon, Roku, Comcast, Viveo and more. And many of those have preferred placement and/or built-in carriage. And by the way, we got more deals coming in the pipeline, which is going to take these numbers up higher.
Importantly, we're -- to the ad question, we're rapidly monetizing it. Pluto TV benefits both from programmatic flow and from direct ViacomCBS ad relationships. As a result, that business has grown dramatically. And as I said, it's bounced back to pre-COVID growth levels already. And now we're building an integrated ecosystem where Pluto's platform will feed our pay offerings.
Now to your question on EyeQ, it's worth noting that Pluto TV is really a cornerstone of EyeQ, which, for those of you that missed it, we announced this week. EyeQ is a new ad platform, which will reach premium viewing audiences across the ViacomCBS portfolio. And here, we're talking about over 50 million monthly full episode users. So super high-quality advertising base.
And by the way, to your question on why buy from us versus other people, you will only be able to buy that product direct from ViacomCBS. So we're -- in addition to being a broader solution provider, which, of course, we are, in this video space, we've really taken the next step in providing turnkey access to high-quality product to solve advertisers' problems. And that's just another example of the power of ViacomCBS in the ad marketplace.
On the cost side, I think your costs were largely, if not fully, related to the impact of streaming and scaling that service. So on investment, I guess, a couple of points. One is we have very significant amount of content that we've already invested in across the company that we can deploy against the asset, and you saw us do that -- some last week in the preview launch.
Second thing I'd say is we understand the math of content investment. On CBS All Access alone, we have 5 years of LTV data, which we use to drive content decision-making, what we commission, what we renew, et cetera. And third, we're obviously leveraging live events and sports, which we already have that are a real driver of subscribers and usage of service in our experience.
Now as the original slate grows over time and gets comprehensive across the full suite of brands, there will be some increase in cash content investment. However, we do intend to fund that as the mix shift from lower-growth areas. And remember, we're also going to be benefiting from a larger subscriber base, which will generate even more revenue and help fund it.
Lastly, I'd say we are going to market this in 2021 as part of a relaunch. But again, here, we'll significantly benefit from the power of our existing media assets and the appeal of our IP, including in social. So again, this is -- it's going to be ultimately additive to our financials, and we'll track through."

Just anything you can do to help us think about cash content spend this year and into next year.
And then I wanted to ask you, as you think about the super service and evolving All Access, sports is obviously something that is a huge driver of consumption and pricing power. I think you guys have a unique opportunity already in how you use sports and All Access, but that's something you're certainly leaning into. Can you just talk about your sports strategy on All Access and how you think about leveraging sports content on streaming versus linear and sort of the trade-offs of that strategic decision?"
27763231,676138434,2062614,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes. Sure.

So you're right, it's too early to provide 2021 guidance, and we're not going to do that. But I will say with respect to your question on return to production, which obviously is critical, particularly when you get to a cash basis, you saw our very strong cash flow delivery in Q2, close to $900 million on an adjusted basis. Certainly, that number benefited from working capital implications of our sort of production, I'd say, radical decline. It's not totally shut down but certainly radically declined. And you should expect that as we move forward in Q3 but more likely Q4 at scale, that, that working cap benefit begins to go the other way a bit.
And just to give you a little more color on the return to production because I think it's a topic everyone is interested in, we are currently executing a multifaceted return to production. Obviously, we're focused on health and safety of all involved in front of and behind the screen. And we have a real commitment to evolving approaches, locations, even story lines, to deliver that fresh product to customer and, ultimately, the consumer needs on a timely basis.
And as we do that, by the way, we are finding some ways that we can operate less expensively. We've learned a lot through this COVID phase from the productions that are on. And we're rolling that through -- whether it's entertainment or sports, and we're rolling that through.
We are dealing with all this through a centrally managed process so we can ensure application of best practices, mitigate risk, and we have the whole portfolio going through it. That has led us to having a whole bunch of fresh content on or coming to air shortly, unscripted, like Big Brother, which is on air now. We're shooting Love Island in a hotel in Vegas where the cast and crew are actually quarantined together. That will air later this month. Daytime soaps are back in production. In late night, Colbert and Corden are scheduled to return to their buildings next week, albeit without audiences.
Animation production continues to move forward. And by the way, I don't know how many of you saw it, but we made a series of announcements that were picked up last week about our path in adult animation. And that's really a building area of activity for us that I'm super excited about.
On the scripted side, we have a whole set of things in motion. We do have scripts on all series. We are putting shows through the restart process I mentioned. Our third-party production studios are also beginning to move forward. And we got a range of contingency plans in place, which include additional unscripted library movies and some other things. So a lot of options here as we work to serve consumers and customers.
To the cash flow point in particular, I think you should expect Q3, there's more production spend. In Q4, it builds there. And then we'll transition into 2021."

Thanks, Brett. Let me take that from the angle of the overall -- where we're going with the overall super service, and I'll deal with each of your questions within that.
So our guiding objective for a super service is to have a broad differentiated product at a compelling price point. And to get a real sense of that, take a good look at the preview launch we did last week where we materially broadened CBS All Access. The entertainment offering is now far wider. We added 3,500 episodes from 70 series from our flagship brands. It unquestionably widens the demographic appeal because we now have a real offering for kids, young adults, millennials and more. And look at the sports offering, now including UEFA. In fact, if you look at the collection of football, basketball, golf, soccer and more on the platform, we really are the first that have taken sports over the top in a meaningful way. And we believe there's real appeal here as part of a broad streaming service.
We obviously have events like the GRAMMYs, the Tony's, the Super Bowl. There's news, which is something people need these days, or maybe not, I don't know. And then there are originals, to your other part of your question. Today, All Access has a baseline of compelling originals, shows like Star Trek: Picard, Discovery and now Lower Decks, which is animated, The Good Fight, Twilight Zone and The Stand.
Starting in '21, that slate will greatly expand to include all flagship brands. And as an indicator, really a taste, we announced last week that Kamp Koral, which is a SpongeBob spin-off, will join the super service as the first Nickelodeon original. And that will be on the back of the exclusive availability of the latest SpongeBob film, Sponge on the Run.
So that's the kind of way we're using franchises. We have an original plan that goes through '22 quarterly. And I'm super excited about it, and you're going to hear more about that at another time. But that gives you a sense. The originals are going to be important, and they're going to be defining as well as the sports."

And if the AAV of the contract moves from sort of around 1 billion upwards towards 2 billion a year, your subscribers -- and this is not a Viacom issue, this is an industry issue, subscribers will have dropped from mid-90s into somewhere probably in the 60s by the time you get to the next contract. How do you think about the return on investment of the NFL? Like how does anyone essentially stay in the NFL business as subs are falling with the cost of the content going up so much? Like just how do you frame it? Or how do you think about it? Maybe how does CBS All Access or the new super service fit into the equation?"

And for ViacomCBS, we believe, obviously, as part of that, there's substantial international opportunity. We believe that's true both in free and pay. You look at our global operating footprint, which includes our linear reach, the content we own, including local content, on-the-ground resources and relationships, we really see that as a powerful go-to-market advantage and feel we're well positioned to succeed.
You look at where we are today on the free side, we're already in Europe and Latin America, Spanish-speaking Latin America with Pluto. We've seen very strong growth to date, particularly in Latin America, which we've only been there a couple of months. We do have almost 7 million international MAUs, 33 million global.
And we got -- we're just getting going there. We got plans to enhance our product, expanding our channel lineup. We're adding a bunch of distribution partners. We will enter Brazil and Spain later this year, France and Italy in early '21. So there's real growth ahead. And obviously, we're thinking about other things from Pluto as well.
On the pay side, we're targeting early '21 for the launch of our international streaming service. The exact product details and pricing, which we haven't announced, will vary by individual markets. But broadly speaking, the new service will feature exclusive first-run premier. So we're going to get those from the slate we're using with CBS All Access in the U.S., from Showtime and from Viacom International Studios. And alongside that, we'll use Paramount movies, box sets from CBS and Viacom media networks.
If you want to just compare it at a high level to what we're doing in the U.S., it will be a much more entertainment-focused product. It doesn't really have a sports -- a material sports lane to it. And it will have an output deal from Showtime because we don't operate Showtime networks outside the United States. We will be rolling it in multiple markets next year, including Australia, Latin America and the Nordics. You'll probably see some press about that. But we're really excited about the opportunity.
And again, this is another place where the power of ViacomCBS is really going to show through, the power of the combination of content, the power of the international footprint we have that's really differentiated from others.
So look, thanks, everyone, for making time in this COVID day coming to us probably from your home. I'd sum it up to say despite the COVID-19 headwinds, we did deliver another solid quarter, reaffirming the strength and optionality of our combined operations. We're executing against key objectives and pushing ViacomCBS to emerge stronger.
As you see, the key earnings and cash flow metrics improved sequentially as we continue to make progress on our integration, and we are now nicely ahead of our run rate and 2020 merger-related cost synergies that we committed to. Our deal-making and execution is underscoring the benefits of our increased scale. And that, obviously, you see in the significant distribution agreements we struck with Verizon, YouTube and others.
And importantly, we're ahead of schedule in building our streaming business. Pluto TV is really cranking, and we're progressively moving towards the relaunch of our diversified super service early next year. And by the way, we just debuted our latest original Star Trek: Lower Decks on CBS All Access. It's a great piece of adult animation. I hope you all go and check it out.
And lastly, to the employees of ViacomCBS, I want to thank you for your amazing passion, dedication and tenacity at this challenging point in time. You're all making a difference helping drive our company forward. So thanks again for your time today and stay well."

I'm pleased to report that ViacomCBS' second quarter delivered a continuation of, and in many respects an acceleration of, the 3 key themes we outlined on our Q1 call.First, despite headwinds f",3043,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that ViacomCBS' second quarter delivered a continuation of, and in many respects an acceleration of, the 3 key themes we outlined on our Q1 call.
First, despite headwinds from COVID-19, ViacomCBS delivered another solid quarter with sequential improvement in key earnings and cash flow metrics and clear operational momentum. Second, we continue to proactively manage through the pandemic, taking significant steps to strengthen our business, preserve the value of our assets, increase our financial flexibility and further reduce costs. And third, we continue to focus on and deliver on value creation, unlocking the power of ViacomCBS and, specifically, our synergistic combination of studios, networks and streaming.
In the quarter, we continued to integrate the company and increased our projection for cost savings, both in year and overall. We made significant progress in distribution, and we rapidly accelerated our streaming business. Here, we achieved record users in revenue in free and pay, all while simultaneously making material progress towards the relaunch of our diversified super service.
So there's a lot to talk about. Let me start with an overview of the financials and some key operating highlights from the quarter. Financially, ViacomCBS posted the combined company's second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in operating income, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow, this on both an absolute dollar and rate of change basis.
While advertising revenue declined 27% in the quarter, overwhelmingly due to COVID, we continue to expect Q2 to be the bottom in terms of year-over-year decline. To that end, we've seen sequential improvement month-over-month since April, June was strong, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far in Q3. We believe this reflects not only economic optimism for a gradual recovery but also the power of our portfolio and the significant value we bring to advertisers.
Affiliate revenue grew 2% in the quarter, with growth in pricing, retrans, reverse comp and streaming revenues more than offsetting pay TV subscriber declines. We anticipate this momentum to continue in the second half of the year. In addition, we increased domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes streaming subscription and digital video advertising revenue by 25%, reflecting record user growth in our streaming products, including 52% growth in subscription revenue.
Moving to earnings. Cost-cutting initiatives and proactive cash management helped offset COVID- and timing-related revenue impacts. Here, the company reported 8% adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter and generated $892 million of adjusted free cash flow, bringing year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to nearly $1.4 billion, up 19% year-on-year.
Keep in mind that the second quarter free cash flow includes a significant working capital benefit from COVID-related programming shifts and production delays. As film and TV production builds in the second half, we do anticipate some reversal of the working capital benefit.
Operationally, the enduring strength of our brands and IP is enabling us to successfully navigate this landscape. During the quarter, our domestic media networks held the highest share of TV viewing in all key audience demos.
In broadcast, CBS finished the season as America's most watched network for the 12th straight year. CBS was #1 in all key dayparts for the third season, with the most watched drama and most watched news program in prime, the top 5 comedies and the #1 late night show, plus 7 of the top 8 new series. We also maintained our leadership as the #1 cable portfolio and share of TV viewing across all key demos, with more top 30 cable networks than any other media family.
Nickelodeon was #1 with kids 2 to 11 for the 20th consecutive quarter and owned all of the top 10 original series. MTV had its best second quarter ratings performance in 2 years, and Comedy Central marked its 13th straight quarter of year-over-year share growth. And Showtime had the top show on premium cable for 2 consecutive quarters and the top 3 premium scripted series so far this year.
Internationally, we continue to build on a global footprint that includes 190 million broadcast homes, the biggest in the world, and 2.7 billion cumulative TV homes. Our international linear share of viewing across countries increased 11% year-over-year.
And I'm very proud to announce that for the first time, in June, Tubular Labs ranked ViacomCBS the #1 media entertainment company in social. Not only does this reinforce our popularity and the relevance of our brands and IP in the digital space, but our huge social platform is also an important marketing tool, particularly as we gear up for the relaunch of our streaming super service.
And speaking of streaming, we have continued our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our streaming platforms as we increasingly lean into this opportunity. In free, Pluto TV's domestic MAUs grew 61% to 26.5 million, and we remain confident that Pluto will achieve its 30 million domestic MAU target by year-end. And Pluto TV is also ramping up outside the U.S., something I'll come back to shortly.
And in pay, we ended the quarter with 16.2 million subscribers, up 74% year-on-year, reaching our year-end goal 6 months ahead of plan. Here, CBS All Access had a great quarter, and you'll hear more about where that product is going in a minute. And Showtime OTT had its best quarter ever in subscriber growth. And in the last 6 months alone, Showtime OTT has grown more than the previous 2.5 years combined.
As we rapidly grow and evolve our streaming business, we're now increasing our domestic pay streaming subscriber guidance to 18 million by year-end. This growth, in addition to the revenue growth I mentioned earlier, supports our conviction in the growth potential of our streaming offering, and we're just getting started.
The combined strengths of our networks and streaming offerings also enabled us to make important strides in domestic distribution, where we struck significant carriage agreements. In April, we signed a truly comprehensive multi-platform partnership with Verizon, spanning pay TV, connected TV and mobile. One particularly exciting component of this deal is the significant expansion of Pluto TV footprint that it enables, one which is rolling out on Verizon Wireless as we speak.
Then in May, we announced a new deal with YouTube TV. This deal renewed CBS and Showtime early and, importantly, brought Viacom's cable networks to the fast-growing service. Viacom's brands went live on YouTube in late June, and we're thrilled to now provide MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET and more to its customers.
More recently, in July, we announced a multiyear renewal with DISH and Sling TV. This was our third cross-company renewal, further demonstrating the power of our brands and content. And we continue to benefit from strong reverse comp, recently signing agreements with Sinclair and Cox, in addition to Nexstar and Meredith earlier in the year.
This deal-making and more is reflective of the fact that ViacomCBS is a cornerstone content provider to a broad range of distributors. The combination here is powerful. And I'm happy to say we expect sequential improvement in year-over-year growth rates for domestic cable networks and total company affiliate revenue in Q3 and Q4.
Now turning from performance in the quarter to the second theme: how we've been managing through COVID. Here, there are a couple of points worth mentioning.
First, we continue to fortify our balance sheet, enabling us to navigate the pandemic from a position of continued financial strength. During the quarter, we issued 2 debt transactions totaling $4.5 billion and used the proceeds to pay down $2.8 billion of upcoming maturities, including a $340 million redemption that settled in July. As a result, we don't have any maturities due until 2022. And we also have access to a committed and undrawn $3.5 billion revolver.
Simultaneously, we have taken action to preserve and maximize the value of our assets, particularly in the film space. This starts with moving marquee film releases to 2021 when we believe the theatrical market will be stronger. In addition, we decided to take The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run and deploy this asset as part of our rebrand and relaunch of CBS All Access early in 2021 when we'll also have a short PVOD window leading into it.
Paramount continues to be an incredible asset for the company. And while there weren't any new titles released in the quarter, we were able to capitalize on the strength and breadth of the studio's massive library of product as well as from our recently established joint venture with Miramax. And we remain excited about our film slate and look forward to opening fantastic films as the market stabilizes.
Broadly speaking, everyone knows that COVID has presented material production challenges, but despite that, through alternate models, ViacomCBS continues to present consumers with fresh content in news, late night and selected unscripted areas. And in the quarter, we also resumed sports production with PGA Golf on CBS. It goes without saying that there is tremendous pent-up demand for live sports. Ratings for the Charles Schwab Challenge, the Travelers Championship and the Rocket Mortgage Classic have all been very strong. In fact, since returning to live golf, CBS Sports' overall viewership is up 25% from comparable events last year.
And building on that, we're excited to have Bellator and Showtime Boxing back on air, along with UEFA soccer premiering on CBS and CBS All Access this week. And we look forward to the return of football in the fall, including last week's announcement that the SEC has confirmed its in-conference game schedule, and we continue to be optimistic about the NFL 2 given all the work they are doing.
With respect to entertainment product, we have already started to resume production activity, albeit on a smaller scale. Our priority is to restart our production safely and in compliance with local health and safety standards. There are, of course, a lot of moving parts to manage returning to production, and we've been collaborating with our industry partners on industry-wide recommendations. We're using a phased approach based on geography, show format, in-studio versus location-based productions, along with other considerations.
But against this backdrop, things are ramping up. As examples, Tyler Perry just wrapped production on the new season of Sistas for BET. We're in production and close to completing Yellowstone in Utah and are about to start filming season 4 in Wyoming. And we recently started shooting a live action show for Nickelodeon in Canada. Add to that, we have a series of unscripted productions underway, including Big Brother, which debuted this week. And we're excited about Love Island, which will be broadcasting 7 days a week once it debuts in late summer.
Looking forward, we have a pipeline of productions moving towards starting. And we're optimistic that volume will grow, ensuring we have fresh product on air in the fall.
And third, through it all, we continue to be focused on value creation. Value creation starts with delivering on the material cost savings opportunity associated with the integration of Viacom and CBS. Here, we continue to make quick progress. In fact, we are increasing our expected 2020 merger-related cost synergies from $250 million to $300 million. And we expect to achieve annualized run rate cost synergies of $800 million, up from our prior $750 million by the end of 2022.
And of course, we continue to look for additional opportunity, including based on how we've had to rethink our operations since March. While it's premature to put a number on this, the experience sets the stage for further transformation and cost savings.
But the combination of ViacomCBS is not only about value creation through cost savings. It's even more about value creation through revenue generation. I already spoke about the very material progress we've made on the distribution side and how that will lead to further sequential improvement in affiliate revenue this year. Here, the merger thesis is clearly coming to life. Streaming is another area where the power of the ViacomCBS combination is beginning to come to life. And this is critical since streaming is probably the most material value creation opportunity in media today.
Building off our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our streaming platforms, we will capitalize on our positions across free and pay. This includes adding substantial content assets and user experience enhancements, broadening distribution and leaning into marketing to serve consumers with a robust differentiated suite of linked streaming offering. In short, by providing consumers with the broadest video experience, spanning news, sports, entertainment, local and live across free and pay, we will be a global leader in freemium streaming.
Let me unpack that a bit. In free, we continue to build on Pluto TV's position as the #1 free streaming TV service in the United States. During the quarter, Pluto saw strong growth and numerous product enhancements. This starts with content, where we continue to add more and more high-quality IP to our market-leading service.
In fact, Pluto now has over 100,000 hours of compelling content available on it. As part of that, we gave you nightly South Park airings on Comedy Central Pluto TV, we launched CSI and Star Trek next-generation channels, and we plan to debut more than 40 other CBS shows, including Survivor, Amazing Race, JAG, America's Top Model, MacGyver and more. And of course, we continue to add a broad range of compelling third-party content in both entertainment and sports, including renewals with the NFL and Major League soccer. 
We also ramped up Pluto TV's distribution across multiple devices and services. I mentioned Verizon's first-of-its-kind deal earlier, but we also had major distribution expansions with TiVo and LG, which, on a combined basis, will shortly bring the Pluto TV service to well over 80 million new devices, setting the stage for the next leg of material growth.
And this growth is not just about Pluto. It will also benefit our pay streaming strategy as we progressively build a linked ecosystem of free and pay D2C services that will fulfill fundamental consumer needs around quality, convenience and cost. Here, Pluto will serve as an important complement to and funnel for our pay services.
In pay, we've progressed materially in the past few months, including being firmly on track with our CBS All Access transformation. On our last call, I said we'd preview a transformed service this summer. Last week, we did just that, adding the company's flagship brands, Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Smithsonian and 3,500 episodes from their libraries, bringing CBS All Access' offering to more than 20,000 episodes. This, in addition to the 150-plus Paramount movies we added roughly 2 months ago.
Apart from its vast library, the new service will continue to have compelling live offerings, spanning CBS local affiliates, tentpole events and a critical mass of live sports, from golf to football to basketball, plus exclusive streaming rights for major sports properties, including some of the world's biggest and most popular soccer leagues, adding a massive volume of compelling live sports content at just the right time. And as we get into 2021, expect to see a significant expansion of first-run originals, including originals from all the brands. This will be a truly differentiated streaming product, and we are very excited about the opportunity.
And I want to reiterate that we're doing all this in a targeted, capital-efficient way. We already have developed and scaled technology in the form of CBS All Access. We have a robust slate of exclusive originals from which we continue to build. Almost every dollar we invest in linear content across the company will benefit the service with varying windows.
We have established distribution points across all major platforms and high user engagement. And we're not starting from zero. Existing customers will benefit from the expanded library, service enhancements and product development, further reducing churn and driving greater value.
Outside the U.S., we also see a tremendous runway for growth in both free and pay streaming, and we're moving quickly. Pluto entered selected markets in Europe last year, and in April, entered into 17 Spanish-speaking Latin American markets. In fact, on a global basis, Pluto TV now has 33 million MAUs.
Looking ahead, our goal is to expand our channel lineup in Latin America to reach more than 70 channels by the end of the year and to continue expanding our content offering in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the U.K. We'll also add more distribution platforms to accelerate the expansion. And our geographic expansion will continue, with plans underway to launch new local versions of Pluto TV in a number of additional priority markets, including Brazil and Spain this year and France and Italy in 2021. Importantly, these are all markets where ViacomCBS has strong local operations, including a large pipeline of local language content in place and ready to go. The Pluto TV platform is powerful, and the world is quickly embracing it.
And in pay, we're targeting early '21 for the launch of our international streaming service, a super-sized offering of truly compelling content with first-run originals and library from all ViacomCBS brands, including Showtime. We will focus next year's initial rollout on a set of high-value territories where we see an opportunity to become the market leader. These territories include Australia, Latin America and the Nordics.
Our streaming strategy is working, and it's really just getting going. As you can see, it's about value creation on a global scale for the short and long term. And I look forward to updating you as we pass key milestones in the coming quarters.
Now before I turn it over, I want to thank Chris for her relentless hard work and dedication to CBS and now ViacomCBS. Over the past 23 years, she's been a critical financial operator. And over the past year, she's played an integral role in helping combine and integrate ViacomCBS. On a personal level, I'm so grateful for her dedication, contributions, and I really look forward to watching her future endeavors. From all of management and from the ViacomCBS Board, thank you, Chris.
With that, I'll hand it over to provide additional financial detail on the quarter."

It has been an amazing journey to be with ViacomCBS, and I do believe the best is yet to come for our united company based upon the strong performance momentum taking hold.
As you can see in our results for the second quarter, COVID-19 did have an anticipated negative impact to our top line revenue performance. However, in preparing for this downturn in early March, we quickly pivoted to more disciplined expense management for Q2 and 2020 to ensure we maximize our financial performance in light of the lower top line trends.
We delivered solid results in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow all improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row, evidence of ViacomCBS' ability to manage through COVID-19 and demonstrating the power of our united company.
Today, I will first take you through our second quarter results in more detail. Then I will update you on the actions we have taken to strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. And finally, I will provide you with some insights for the remainder of the year.
Let's start with our financial performance in the quarter. As a result of COVID-19 and our ongoing restructuring plans, we have made several adjustments to our results. These adjustments include $121 million in programming charges associated with the abandonment of incomplete programs resulting from COVID-related production shutdown and $134 million in restructuring charges related to our synergy initiatives.
In light of the ongoing COVID pandemic, we achieved solid results in Q2 2020. Total company revenue was $6.28 billion, down 12% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.69 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and adjusted EPS was $1.25. Adjusted free cash flow was a strong $892 million in the quarter, which excludes $178 million of restructuring and merger-related payments.
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter, affiliate revenue increased 2%, benefiting from strong retrans, reverse comp and subscription streaming revenue growth, which more than offset the decline in cable network affiliate revenue. Cable network affiliate revenue declined 6% in Q2, in line with the decline in Q1 2020.
Advertising revenue was down 27% versus a year ago, overwhelmingly affected by COVID-19, which resulted in a significant pullback by advertisers. The comparison to the NCAA championship and Final Four games in the year ago period resulted in a 4-point headwind in the quarter.
Domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscription and digital video advertising revenue, was up 25% versus a year ago to $489 million. Q2 benefited from significant growth in sign-ups and streams on CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and in monthly active users and minutes viewed on Pluto. Domestic streaming subscription revenue was up 52% in the second quarter, accelerating from the rate of growth in the first quarter driven by the continued momentum we are experiencing across all of our streaming products.
Turning to content licensing. Revenue was comparable with the prior year. Revenue associated with the licensing of South Park was offset by significant licensing activity in the year ago quarter as well as the timing of deliveries, which have been affected by COVID-related production delays. Theatrical revenue was immaterial in the quarter as most theaters remain closed in the U.S. and internationally.
For Publishing, revenue declined 8%. Strong growth in digital book and audio sales was more than offset by declines in print sales. These titles in the quarter included John Bolton's The Room Where It Happened and Stephen King's If It Bleeds.
On the expense front, we are highly focused on strategically reducing our costs. We continue to benefit from merger-related cost synergies in the second quarter and are on track to realize $300 million in savings for the full year of 2020 before consideration of onetime costs to achieve them, up from our previous expectation of $250 million.
In addition, we are benefiting from COVID-related cost savings, which helped offset the impact of revenue declines and drove adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. A portion of these cost savings are timing related and will come back as we return to live sports and production. However, we expect to realize sustainable cost savings as we take learnings from this crisis and find ways to operate more efficiently over the long term.
In addition, we now expect to achieve $800 million in annualized merger-related cost synergies by the end of 2022, up from our prior $750 million target as we remain highly disciplined in managing our costs. Overall, we are very pleased with ViacomCBS' results in the second quarter of 2020.
Turning to the balance sheet and ViacomCBS' liquidity. In the second quarter, we completed 2 debt transactions totaling $4.5 billion. We used the proceeds to pay down $2.8 billion of our upcoming maturities, including a $340 million redemption that settled on July 10. And we added $1.7 billion to our cash balance, providing us with additional liquidity. These transactions significantly strengthen the financial position of the company, enabling us to effectively weather the current economic uncertainty. We now have no debt maturities until 2022. And in addition to our cash balance, we have our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn.
As of June 30, 2020, when you take into account the benefit of our full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.3x. On a net basis, taking into consideration our $2.3 billion cash balance as of June 30, our leverage ratio is 2.9x, unchanged from the end of 2019. We remain committed to our 2.75x leverage target, including the benefit of full run rate synergies, and plan to use cash on hand, proceeds from our noncore asset sales as well as excess cash flow after dividend payments to reduce our debt balance in order to achieve our leverage target.
I would now like to provide you with some insights on the remainder of the year. Starting with affiliate revenue. As Bob discussed, we had an impressive quarter for distribution, with several new agreements secured, including Verizon, YouTube TV, DISH, Sling TV, Sinclair and Cox. And as Bob mentioned, we now forecast domestic streaming subscribers to reach 18 million by year-end 2020, up from our previous 16 million expectations, which we have achieved ahead of plan. While we expect to be affected by industry pay TV subscriber trends, we will benefit from our recent affiliate deal, increased distribution on YouTube and the strong growth we are experiencing across our subscription streaming platforms. Taken together, we expect the year-over-year rate of change in domestic cable network affiliate revenue and total company affiliate revenue to improve in Q3 and again in Q4.
Moving to advertising. We believe Q2 marked the bottom in the year-over-year rate of change in total company advertising revenue and expect to see sequential improvement in the year-over-year rate of change in advertising revenue in Q3 and again in Q4.
A few other things to note for the third quarter and adjusted free cash flow in the back half of the year. First, on content licensing revenue. We expect COVID-related production delays will continue to affect content licensing deliveries in the third quarter.
Second, on theatrical revenue. We have no movies scheduled to be released in the third quarter as we are saving valuable IP to be released in the theatrical window. That said, we strategically decided to deploy The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run through the relaunch of our super service in early 2021.
And third, on adjusted free cash flow. We had a strong Q2. Our free cash flow benefited from disciplined COVID-related expense management, which will continue to positively impact cash in the balance of the year given the natural lag between expenses and cash.
In addition, our free cash flow benefited significantly from the delay in the timing of production. As we get back to production, spend will return, impacting free cash flow in the second half of the year. Looking beyond this year, we are laser-focused on optimizing working capital for ViacomCBS, which will drive improved free cash flow in 2021 and beyond.
In closing, the first half results of the united ViacomCBS have many proof points of tremendous momentum that will benefit the company over the long term. Although COVID-19 has affected our short-term revenue trends, we remain focused on ensuring that we optimize our cost structure and investment strategy to maximize revenue growth and financial performance for the long term.
On a personal note, it has been a true honor to be a part of the ViacomCBS team during the past 23 years. To Shari, Bob, the Board of Directors and Naveen, I wish you much continued success as you lead this phenomenal company. To me, the company is really all of our talented people. So to the entire ViacomCBS team, I wish you the very best for the future.
Lastly, I would like to commend and thank the amazing finance team of ViacomCBS. You are second to none, and I am most proud of all that we have accomplished together.
With that, we can open the line for questions."

If you could give us a bit more detail about how it progressed through the second quarter with respect to your platforms, really looking from your linear cable networks all the way to AVOD, how it differed, I guess, throughout the second quarter on those platforms. But I think you said June was better, but I'm curious if you have any early thoughts on July, if that improvement continued.
And then my follow-up is just on Paramount, just really regarding the shortening window, theatrical windows, and the agreement that we saw between AMC and Universal. Are you looking to reach sort of similar agreements for Paramount?"

So on advertising, let me reiterate that we believe Q2 is the bottom, and we expect to see continued sequential improvement in the rate of change in Q3 and again in Q4. With that, let me say a couple things to add so",678,"Sure. Alexia, nice to hear your voice. So on advertising, let me reiterate that we believe Q2 is the bottom, and we expect to see continued sequential improvement in the rate of change in Q3 and again in Q4. With that, let me say a couple things to add some additional color.
First, our total company advertising, obviously down in the quarter, and that was, as you heard, overwhelmingly and not surprisingly due to COVID. Beyond COVID, there is some lack of comparability to prior year, and that specifically is because we had the NCAA championship and Final Four game in 2019, but Turner would have had that this year. So that's worth about 400 basis points if you're doing math.
Second, and really more to your question, the quarter turned out better than we thought early. And that was because we did see sequential improvement in each month of the quarter and simultaneously because scatter pricing held strong, 25%, really greater than that versus the upfront. The softness we did see is very concentrated in terms of categories. But at the same time, we saw some early signs of strength from some others, notably pharma, insurance and financial.
And to the other specific question you asked, segments have been impacted differently. So broadcast in the mix is relatively strong. Cable's seen more relative softness. But in the cable side, we did take the opportunity to produce ad loads to improve the experience. Local has also been tough, but things are getting better. In particular, auto's coming back in Q3 as factories have reopened, and we continue to look forward to political being a significant driver in the second half.
Digital also was impacted, but high-quality digital remains super strong. In fact, Pluto TV quickly returned to pre-pandemic growth rates and pricing and was very strong in Q2. So we like what we're seeing in terms of green shoots and look to continue to see that momentum.
On the Paramount side, let me start by saying that while the studio was obviously unable to release films in the quarter due to COVID, it is an incredible asset to ViacomCBS. It has a powerful collection of IP, which we continue to develop for film, TV and streaming purposes. It's got a massive library, which benefits our networks and more recently, our streaming services. And its library is obviously a critical component of our licensing business.
In this COVID time, which is really a time where theaters are shut down, we are focused on protecting asset value and really benefiting from optionality that our company and this environment presents. And that's driven us to do a number of things.
First, we do continue to move films later to save them for what we believe will be a healthier environment in '21. You saw us do that most recently with A Quiet Place Part II and Top Gun: Maverick. We've also monetized some films, yes, with streamers, which allows us to get a return on our investment now. But importantly, it allows us to avoid putting even more product into a '21 that's starting to look pretty full. You saw that with Lovebirds as an example. We also decided to use a film franchise strategically, and that's deploying SpongeBob: Sponge on the Run exclusively in the U.S. against our super service relaunch in early '21 after a short PVOD window.
And then to your questions about PVOD, we really are in sort of a COVID rules phase of the business right now, where studios, including Paramount, are doing some things they wouldn't normally do because theaters are closed. Know we remain committed to theatrical and believe a lot of this reverts once the world normalizes. But we do believe the actual windows will probably shorten, and some of these new monetization paths, including both strategic ones and others, probably will become more confident.
But as I look at the whole thing, it continues to make me highly confident that despite COVID, Paramount is incredibly valuable to us, both strategically and financially."

First, on streaming, streaming TV, connected TV, advertising clearly have strong secular growth. You're investing into it with All Access and Pluto. But it's also a pretty complicated and fragmented market for advertisers. So Bob, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you see that developing, how products like EyeQ gives CBS an advantage -- ViacomCBS an advantage and why advertisers are spending with you rather than, say, a platform like an Amazon Fire or Roku TV.
And then second, just on costs. There's a number of puts and takes as we look forward with the synergies and timing. But as you go through this transition and invest in this transition to streaming, can you talk about how we should think about margins for the business maybe into the sort of like launch period, and then over the longer term, if this is margin-expanding initiative?"

When we announced that acquisition, the market was confused. Most people didn't know what it was. Since then, AVOD, or now what people call FAST, has been accepted as a legitimate and important part of the streaming ecosystem, and others have followed us.
But we haven't let up, not even close, like we leaned into its content, into enhancing the platform, into expanding distribution, into building the brand and into monetizing its ad inventory and most recently, global expansion. And as a result, we've grown Pluto TV dramatically and arguably extended our leadership position.
The reality is no other U.S. FAST asset can touch the combination of Pluto's 100,000-plus hours of high-quality content, which we built through a combination of assets we own and these innovative revenue share-based models that we use with third parties. It's on over 30 devices and platforms. You name it. If it's significant, Pluto's there.
We're rapidly expanding the distribution. We talked about these 80 million devices that are coming through new partnerships with Verizon, TiVo and LG not only adds to the expansive base we're already building through Amazon, Roku, Comcast, Viveo and more. And many of those have preferred placement and/or built-in carriage. And by the way, we got more deals coming in the pipeline, which is going to take these numbers up higher.
Importantly, we're -- to the ad question, we're rapidly monetizing it. Pluto TV benefits both from programmatic flow and from direct ViacomCBS ad relationships. As a result, that business has grown dramatically. And as I said, it's bounced back to pre-COVID growth levels already. And now we're building an integrated ecosystem where Pluto's platform will feed our pay offerings.
Now to your question on EyeQ, it's worth noting that Pluto TV is really a cornerstone of EyeQ, which, for those of you that missed it, we announced this week. EyeQ is a new ad platform, which will reach premium viewing audiences across the ViacomCBS portfolio. And here, we're talking about over 50 million monthly full episode users. So super high-quality advertising base.
And by the way, to your question on why buy from us versus other people, you will only be able to buy that product direct from ViacomCBS. So we're -- in addition to being a broader solution provider, which, of course, we are, in this video space, we've really taken the next step in providing turnkey access to high-quality product to solve advertisers' problems. And that's just another example of the power of ViacomCBS in the ad marketplace.
On the cost side, I think your costs were largely, if not fully, related to the impact of streaming and scaling that service. So on investment, I guess, a couple of points. One is we have very significant amount of content that we've already invested in across the company that we can deploy against the asset, and you saw us do that -- some last week in the preview launch.
Second thing I'd say is we understand the math of content investment. On CBS All Access alone, we have 5 years of LTV data, which we use to drive content decision-making, what we commission, what we renew, et cetera. And third, we're obviously leveraging live events and sports, which we already have that are a real driver of subscribers and usage of service in our experience.
Now as the original slate grows over time and gets comprehensive across the full suite of brands, there will be some increase in cash content investment. However, we do intend to fund that as the mix shift from lower-growth areas. And remember, we're also going to be benefiting from a larger subscriber base, which will generate even more revenue and help fund it.
Lastly, I'd say we are going to market this in 2021 as part of a relaunch. But again, here, we'll significantly benefit from the power of our existing media assets and the appeal of our IP, including in social. So again, this is -- it's going to be ultimately additive to our financials, and we'll track through."

Just anything you can do to help us think about cash content spend this year and into next year.
And then I wanted to ask you, as you think about the super service and evolving All Access, sports is obviously something that is a huge driver of consumption and pricing power. I think you guys have a unique opportunity already in how you use sports and All Access, but that's something you're certainly leaning into. Can you just talk about your sports strategy on All Access and how you think about leveraging sports content on streaming versus linear and sort of the trade-offs of that strategic decision?"
27763231,676138434,2114094,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes. Sure.

So you're right, it's too early to provide 2021 guidance, and we're not going to do that. But I will say with respect to your question on return to production, which obviously is critical, particularly when you get to a cash basis, you saw our very strong cash flow delivery in Q2, close to $900 million on an adjusted basis. Certainly, that number benefited from working capital implications of our sort of production, I'd say, radical decline. It's not totally shut down but certainly radically declined. And you should expect that as we move forward in Q3 but more likely Q4 at scale, that, that working cap benefit begins to go the other way a bit.
And just to give you a little more color on the return to production because I think it's a topic everyone is interested in, we are currently executing a multifaceted return to production. Obviously, we're focused on health and safety of all involved in front of and behind the screen. And we have a real commitment to evolving approaches, locations, even story lines, to deliver that fresh product to customer and, ultimately, the consumer needs on a timely basis.
And as we do that, by the way, we are finding some ways that we can operate less expensively. We've learned a lot through this COVID phase from the productions that are on. And we're rolling that through -- whether it's entertainment or sports, and we're rolling that through.
We are dealing with all this through a centrally managed process so we can ensure application of best practices, mitigate risk, and we have the whole portfolio going through it. That has led us to having a whole bunch of fresh content on or coming to air shortly, unscripted, like Big Brother, which is on air now. We're shooting Love Island in a hotel in Vegas where the cast and crew are actually quarantined together. That will air later this month. Daytime soaps are back in production. In late night, Colbert and Corden are scheduled to return to their buildings next week, albeit without audiences.
Animation production continues to move forward. And by the way, I don't know how many of you saw it, but we made a series of announcements that were picked up last week about our path in adult animation. And that's really a building area of activity for us that I'm super excited about.
On the scripted side, we have a whole set of things in motion. We do have scripts on all series. We are putting shows through the restart process I mentioned. Our third-party production studios are also beginning to move forward. And we got a range of contingency plans in place, which include additional unscripted library movies and some other things. So a lot of options here as we work to serve consumers and customers.
To the cash flow point in particular, I think you should expect Q3, there's more production spend. In Q4, it builds there. And then we'll transition into 2021."

Thanks, Brett. Let me take that from the angle of the overall -- where we're going with the overall super service, and I'll deal with each of your questions within that.
So our guiding objective for a super service is to have a broad differentiated product at a compelling price point. And to get a real sense of that, take a good look at the preview launch we did last week where we materially broadened CBS All Access. The entertainment offering is now far wider. We added 3,500 episodes from 70 series from our flagship brands. It unquestionably widens the demographic appeal because we now have a real offering for kids, young adults, millennials and more. And look at the sports offering, now including UEFA. In fact, if you look at the collection of football, basketball, golf, soccer and more on the platform, we really are the first that have taken sports over the top in a meaningful way. And we believe there's real appeal here as part of a broad streaming service.
We obviously have events like the GRAMMYs, the Tony's, the Super Bowl. There's news, which is something people need these days, or maybe not, I don't know. And then there are originals, to your other part of your question. Today, All Access has a baseline of compelling originals, shows like Star Trek: Picard, Discovery and now Lower Decks, which is animated, The Good Fight, Twilight Zone and The Stand.
Starting in '21, that slate will greatly expand to include all flagship brands. And as an indicator, really a taste, we announced last week that Kamp Koral, which is a SpongeBob spin-off, will join the super service as the first Nickelodeon original. And that will be on the back of the exclusive availability of the latest SpongeBob film, Sponge on the Run.
So that's the kind of way we're using franchises. We have an original plan that goes through '22 quarterly. And I'm super excited about it, and you're going to hear more about that at another time. But that gives you a sense. The originals are going to be important, and they're going to be defining as well as the sports."

So streaming is clearly a global opportunity. And for ViacomCBS, we believe, obviously, as part of that, there's substantial international opportunity. We believe that's true both in free and pay. You look at our global operating footp",625,"Yes. Sure, Michael. So streaming is clearly a global opportunity. And for ViacomCBS, we believe, obviously, as part of that, there's substantial international opportunity. We believe that's true both in free and pay. You look at our global operating footprint, which includes our linear reach, the content we own, including local content, on-the-ground resources and relationships, we really see that as a powerful go-to-market advantage and feel we're well positioned to succeed.
You look at where we are today on the free side, we're already in Europe and Latin America, Spanish-speaking Latin America with Pluto. We've seen very strong growth to date, particularly in Latin America, which we've only been there a couple of months. We do have almost 7 million international MAUs, 33 million global.
And we got -- we're just getting going there. We got plans to enhance our product, expanding our channel lineup. We're adding a bunch of distribution partners. We will enter Brazil and Spain later this year, France and Italy in early '21. So there's real growth ahead. And obviously, we're thinking about other things from Pluto as well.
On the pay side, we're targeting early '21 for the launch of our international streaming service. The exact product details and pricing, which we haven't announced, will vary by individual markets. But broadly speaking, the new service will feature exclusive first-run premier. So we're going to get those from the slate we're using with CBS All Access in the U.S., from Showtime and from Viacom International Studios. And alongside that, we'll use Paramount movies, box sets from CBS and Viacom media networks.
If you want to just compare it at a high level to what we're doing in the U.S., it will be a much more entertainment-focused product. It doesn't really have a sports -- a material sports lane to it. And it will have an output deal from Showtime because we don't operate Showtime networks outside the United States. We will be rolling it in multiple markets next year, including Australia, Latin America and the Nordics. You'll probably see some press about that. But we're really excited about the opportunity.
And again, this is another place where the power of ViacomCBS is really going to show through, the power of the combination of content, the power of the international footprint we have that's really differentiated from others.
So look, thanks, everyone, for making time in this COVID day coming to us probably from your home. I'd sum it up to say despite the COVID-19 headwinds, we did deliver another solid quarter, reaffirming the strength and optionality of our combined operations. We're executing against key objectives and pushing ViacomCBS to emerge stronger.
As you see, the key earnings and cash flow metrics improved sequentially as we continue to make progress on our integration, and we are now nicely ahead of our run rate and 2020 merger-related cost synergies that we committed to. Our deal-making and execution is underscoring the benefits of our increased scale. And that, obviously, you see in the significant distribution agreements we struck with Verizon, YouTube and others.
And importantly, we're ahead of schedule in building our streaming business. Pluto TV is really cranking, and we're progressively moving towards the relaunch of our diversified super service early next year. And by the way, we just debuted our latest original Star Trek: Lower Decks on CBS All Access. It's a great piece of adult animation. I hope you all go and check it out.
And lastly, to the employees of ViacomCBS, I want to thank you for your amazing passion, dedication and tenacity at this challenging point in time. You're all making a difference helping drive our company forward. So thanks again for your time today and stay well."

I'm pleased to report that ViacomCBS' second quarter delivered a continuation of, and in many respects an acceleration of, the 3 key themes we outlined on our Q1 call.First, despite headwinds f",3043,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that ViacomCBS' second quarter delivered a continuation of, and in many respects an acceleration of, the 3 key themes we outlined on our Q1 call.
First, despite headwinds from COVID-19, ViacomCBS delivered another solid quarter with sequential improvement in key earnings and cash flow metrics and clear operational momentum. Second, we continue to proactively manage through the pandemic, taking significant steps to strengthen our business, preserve the value of our assets, increase our financial flexibility and further reduce costs. And third, we continue to focus on and deliver on value creation, unlocking the power of ViacomCBS and, specifically, our synergistic combination of studios, networks and streaming.
In the quarter, we continued to integrate the company and increased our projection for cost savings, both in year and overall. We made significant progress in distribution, and we rapidly accelerated our streaming business. Here, we achieved record users in revenue in free and pay, all while simultaneously making material progress towards the relaunch of our diversified super service.
So there's a lot to talk about. Let me start with an overview of the financials and some key operating highlights from the quarter. Financially, ViacomCBS posted the combined company's second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in operating income, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow, this on both an absolute dollar and rate of change basis.
While advertising revenue declined 27% in the quarter, overwhelmingly due to COVID, we continue to expect Q2 to be the bottom in terms of year-over-year decline. To that end, we've seen sequential improvement month-over-month since April, June was strong, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far in Q3. We believe this reflects not only economic optimism for a gradual recovery but also the power of our portfolio and the significant value we bring to advertisers.
Affiliate revenue grew 2% in the quarter, with growth in pricing, retrans, reverse comp and streaming revenues more than offsetting pay TV subscriber declines. We anticipate this momentum to continue in the second half of the year. In addition, we increased domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes streaming subscription and digital video advertising revenue by 25%, reflecting record user growth in our streaming products, including 52% growth in subscription revenue.
Moving to earnings. Cost-cutting initiatives and proactive cash management helped offset COVID- and timing-related revenue impacts. Here, the company reported 8% adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter and generated $892 million of adjusted free cash flow, bringing year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to nearly $1.4 billion, up 19% year-on-year.
Keep in mind that the second quarter free cash flow includes a significant working capital benefit from COVID-related programming shifts and production delays. As film and TV production builds in the second half, we do anticipate some reversal of the working capital benefit.
Operationally, the enduring strength of our brands and IP is enabling us to successfully navigate this landscape. During the quarter, our domestic media networks held the highest share of TV viewing in all key audience demos.
In broadcast, CBS finished the season as America's most watched network for the 12th straight year. CBS was #1 in all key dayparts for the third season, with the most watched drama and most watched news program in prime, the top 5 comedies and the #1 late night show, plus 7 of the top 8 new series. We also maintained our leadership as the #1 cable portfolio and share of TV viewing across all key demos, with more top 30 cable networks than any other media family.
Nickelodeon was #1 with kids 2 to 11 for the 20th consecutive quarter and owned all of the top 10 original series. MTV had its best second quarter ratings performance in 2 years, and Comedy Central marked its 13th straight quarter of year-over-year share growth. And Showtime had the top show on premium cable for 2 consecutive quarters and the top 3 premium scripted series so far this year.
Internationally, we continue to build on a global footprint that includes 190 million broadcast homes, the biggest in the world, and 2.7 billion cumulative TV homes. Our international linear share of viewing across countries increased 11% year-over-year.
And I'm very proud to announce that for the first time, in June, Tubular Labs ranked ViacomCBS the #1 media entertainment company in social. Not only does this reinforce our popularity and the relevance of our brands and IP in the digital space, but our huge social platform is also an important marketing tool, particularly as we gear up for the relaunch of our streaming super service.
And speaking of streaming, we have continued our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our streaming platforms as we increasingly lean into this opportunity. In free, Pluto TV's domestic MAUs grew 61% to 26.5 million, and we remain confident that Pluto will achieve its 30 million domestic MAU target by year-end. And Pluto TV is also ramping up outside the U.S., something I'll come back to shortly.
And in pay, we ended the quarter with 16.2 million subscribers, up 74% year-on-year, reaching our year-end goal 6 months ahead of plan. Here, CBS All Access had a great quarter, and you'll hear more about where that product is going in a minute. And Showtime OTT had its best quarter ever in subscriber growth. And in the last 6 months alone, Showtime OTT has grown more than the previous 2.5 years combined.
As we rapidly grow and evolve our streaming business, we're now increasing our domestic pay streaming subscriber guidance to 18 million by year-end. This growth, in addition to the revenue growth I mentioned earlier, supports our conviction in the growth potential of our streaming offering, and we're just getting started.
The combined strengths of our networks and streaming offerings also enabled us to make important strides in domestic distribution, where we struck significant carriage agreements. In April, we signed a truly comprehensive multi-platform partnership with Verizon, spanning pay TV, connected TV and mobile. One particularly exciting component of this deal is the significant expansion of Pluto TV footprint that it enables, one which is rolling out on Verizon Wireless as we speak.
Then in May, we announced a new deal with YouTube TV. This deal renewed CBS and Showtime early and, importantly, brought Viacom's cable networks to the fast-growing service. Viacom's brands went live on YouTube in late June, and we're thrilled to now provide MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET and more to its customers.
More recently, in July, we announced a multiyear renewal with DISH and Sling TV. This was our third cross-company renewal, further demonstrating the power of our brands and content. And we continue to benefit from strong reverse comp, recently signing agreements with Sinclair and Cox, in addition to Nexstar and Meredith earlier in the year.
This deal-making and more is reflective of the fact that ViacomCBS is a cornerstone content provider to a broad range of distributors. The combination here is powerful. And I'm happy to say we expect sequential improvement in year-over-year growth rates for domestic cable networks and total company affiliate revenue in Q3 and Q4.
Now turning from performance in the quarter to the second theme: how we've been managing through COVID. Here, there are a couple of points worth mentioning.
First, we continue to fortify our balance sheet, enabling us to navigate the pandemic from a position of continued financial strength. During the quarter, we issued 2 debt transactions totaling $4.5 billion and used the proceeds to pay down $2.8 billion of upcoming maturities, including a $340 million redemption that settled in July. As a result, we don't have any maturities due until 2022. And we also have access to a committed and undrawn $3.5 billion revolver.
Simultaneously, we have taken action to preserve and maximize the value of our assets, particularly in the film space. This starts with moving marquee film releases to 2021 when we believe the theatrical market will be stronger. In addition, we decided to take The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run and deploy this asset as part of our rebrand and relaunch of CBS All Access early in 2021 when we'll also have a short PVOD window leading into it.
Paramount continues to be an incredible asset for the company. And while there weren't any new titles released in the quarter, we were able to capitalize on the strength and breadth of the studio's massive library of product as well as from our recently established joint venture with Miramax. And we remain excited about our film slate and look forward to opening fantastic films as the market stabilizes.
Broadly speaking, everyone knows that COVID has presented material production challenges, but despite that, through alternate models, ViacomCBS continues to present consumers with fresh content in news, late night and selected unscripted areas. And in the quarter, we also resumed sports production with PGA Golf on CBS. It goes without saying that there is tremendous pent-up demand for live sports. Ratings for the Charles Schwab Challenge, the Travelers Championship and the Rocket Mortgage Classic have all been very strong. In fact, since returning to live golf, CBS Sports' overall viewership is up 25% from comparable events last year.
And building on that, we're excited to have Bellator and Showtime Boxing back on air, along with UEFA soccer premiering on CBS and CBS All Access this week. And we look forward to the return of football in the fall, including last week's announcement that the SEC has confirmed its in-conference game schedule, and we continue to be optimistic about the NFL 2 given all the work they are doing.
With respect to entertainment product, we have already started to resume production activity, albeit on a smaller scale. Our priority is to restart our production safely and in compliance with local health and safety standards. There are, of course, a lot of moving parts to manage returning to production, and we've been collaborating with our industry partners on industry-wide recommendations. We're using a phased approach based on geography, show format, in-studio versus location-based productions, along with other considerations.
But against this backdrop, things are ramping up. As examples, Tyler Perry just wrapped production on the new season of Sistas for BET. We're in production and close to completing Yellowstone in Utah and are about to start filming season 4 in Wyoming. And we recently started shooting a live action show for Nickelodeon in Canada. Add to that, we have a series of unscripted productions underway, including Big Brother, which debuted this week. And we're excited about Love Island, which will be broadcasting 7 days a week once it debuts in late summer.
Looking forward, we have a pipeline of productions moving towards starting. And we're optimistic that volume will grow, ensuring we have fresh product on air in the fall.
And third, through it all, we continue to be focused on value creation. Value creation starts with delivering on the material cost savings opportunity associated with the integration of Viacom and CBS. Here, we continue to make quick progress. In fact, we are increasing our expected 2020 merger-related cost synergies from $250 million to $300 million. And we expect to achieve annualized run rate cost synergies of $800 million, up from our prior $750 million by the end of 2022.
And of course, we continue to look for additional opportunity, including based on how we've had to rethink our operations since March. While it's premature to put a number on this, the experience sets the stage for further transformation and cost savings.
But the combination of ViacomCBS is not only about value creation through cost savings. It's even more about value creation through revenue generation. I already spoke about the very material progress we've made on the distribution side and how that will lead to further sequential improvement in affiliate revenue this year. Here, the merger thesis is clearly coming to life. Streaming is another area where the power of the ViacomCBS combination is beginning to come to life. And this is critical since streaming is probably the most material value creation opportunity in media today.
Building off our momentum in user, subscriber and consumption growth across our streaming platforms, we will capitalize on our positions across free and pay. This includes adding substantial content assets and user experience enhancements, broadening distribution and leaning into marketing to serve consumers with a robust differentiated suite of linked streaming offering. In short, by providing consumers with the broadest video experience, spanning news, sports, entertainment, local and live across free and pay, we will be a global leader in freemium streaming.
Let me unpack that a bit. In free, we continue to build on Pluto TV's position as the #1 free streaming TV service in the United States. During the quarter, Pluto saw strong growth and numerous product enhancements. This starts with content, where we continue to add more and more high-quality IP to our market-leading service.
In fact, Pluto now has over 100,000 hours of compelling content available on it. As part of that, we gave you nightly South Park airings on Comedy Central Pluto TV, we launched CSI and Star Trek next-generation channels, and we plan to debut more than 40 other CBS shows, including Survivor, Amazing Race, JAG, America's Top Model, MacGyver and more. And of course, we continue to add a broad range of compelling third-party content in both entertainment and sports, including renewals with the NFL and Major League soccer. 
We also ramped up Pluto TV's distribution across multiple devices and services. I mentioned Verizon's first-of-its-kind deal earlier, but we also had major distribution expansions with TiVo and LG, which, on a combined basis, will shortly bring the Pluto TV service to well over 80 million new devices, setting the stage for the next leg of material growth.
And this growth is not just about Pluto. It will also benefit our pay streaming strategy as we progressively build a linked ecosystem of free and pay D2C services that will fulfill fundamental consumer needs around quality, convenience and cost. Here, Pluto will serve as an important complement to and funnel for our pay services.
In pay, we've progressed materially in the past few months, including being firmly on track with our CBS All Access transformation. On our last call, I said we'd preview a transformed service this summer. Last week, we did just that, adding the company's flagship brands, Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Smithsonian and 3,500 episodes from their libraries, bringing CBS All Access' offering to more than 20,000 episodes. This, in addition to the 150-plus Paramount movies we added roughly 2 months ago.
Apart from its vast library, the new service will continue to have compelling live offerings, spanning CBS local affiliates, tentpole events and a critical mass of live sports, from golf to football to basketball, plus exclusive streaming rights for major sports properties, including some of the world's biggest and most popular soccer leagues, adding a massive volume of compelling live sports content at just the right time. And as we get into 2021, expect to see a significant expansion of first-run originals, including originals from all the brands. This will be a truly differentiated streaming product, and we are very excited about the opportunity.
And I want to reiterate that we're doing all this in a targeted, capital-efficient way. We already have developed and scaled technology in the form of CBS All Access. We have a robust slate of exclusive originals from which we continue to build. Almost every dollar we invest in linear content across the company will benefit the service with varying windows.
We have established distribution points across all major platforms and high user engagement. And we're not starting from zero. Existing customers will benefit from the expanded library, service enhancements and product development, further reducing churn and driving greater value.
Outside the U.S., we also see a tremendous runway for growth in both free and pay streaming, and we're moving quickly. Pluto entered selected markets in Europe last year, and in April, entered into 17 Spanish-speaking Latin American markets. In fact, on a global basis, Pluto TV now has 33 million MAUs.
Looking ahead, our goal is to expand our channel lineup in Latin America to reach more than 70 channels by the end of the year and to continue expanding our content offering in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the U.K. We'll also add more distribution platforms to accelerate the expansion. And our geographic expansion will continue, with plans underway to launch new local versions of Pluto TV in a number of additional priority markets, including Brazil and Spain this year and France and Italy in 2021. Importantly, these are all markets where ViacomCBS has strong local operations, including a large pipeline of local language content in place and ready to go. The Pluto TV platform is powerful, and the world is quickly embracing it.
And in pay, we're targeting early '21 for the launch of our international streaming service, a super-sized offering of truly compelling content with first-run originals and library from all ViacomCBS brands, including Showtime. We will focus next year's initial rollout on a set of high-value territories where we see an opportunity to become the market leader. These territories include Australia, Latin America and the Nordics.
Our streaming strategy is working, and it's really just getting going. As you can see, it's about value creation on a global scale for the short and long term. And I look forward to updating you as we pass key milestones in the coming quarters.
Now before I turn it over, I want to thank Chris for her relentless hard work and dedication to CBS and now ViacomCBS. Over the past 23 years, she's been a critical financial operator. And over the past year, she's played an integral role in helping combine and integrate ViacomCBS. On a personal level, I'm so grateful for her dedication, contributions, and I really look forward to watching her future endeavors. From all of management and from the ViacomCBS Board, thank you, Chris.
With that, I'll hand it over to provide additional financial detail on the quarter."

It has been an amazing journey to be with ViacomCBS, and I do believe the best is yet to come for our united company based upon the strong performance momentum taking hold.
As you can see in our results for the second quarter, COVID-19 did have an anticipated negative impact to our top line revenue performance. However, in preparing for this downturn in early March, we quickly pivoted to more disciplined expense management for Q2 and 2020 to ensure we maximize our financial performance in light of the lower top line trends.
We delivered solid results in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow all improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row, evidence of ViacomCBS' ability to manage through COVID-19 and demonstrating the power of our united company.
Today, I will first take you through our second quarter results in more detail. Then I will update you on the actions we have taken to strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. And finally, I will provide you with some insights for the remainder of the year.
Let's start with our financial performance in the quarter. As a result of COVID-19 and our ongoing restructuring plans, we have made several adjustments to our results. These adjustments include $121 million in programming charges associated with the abandonment of incomplete programs resulting from COVID-related production shutdown and $134 million in restructuring charges related to our synergy initiatives.
In light of the ongoing COVID pandemic, we achieved solid results in Q2 2020. Total company revenue was $6.28 billion, down 12% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.69 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and adjusted EPS was $1.25. Adjusted free cash flow was a strong $892 million in the quarter, which excludes $178 million of restructuring and merger-related payments.
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter, affiliate revenue increased 2%, benefiting from strong retrans, reverse comp and subscription streaming revenue growth, which more than offset the decline in cable network affiliate revenue. Cable network affiliate revenue declined 6% in Q2, in line with the decline in Q1 2020.
Advertising revenue was down 27% versus a year ago, overwhelmingly affected by COVID-19, which resulted in a significant pullback by advertisers. The comparison to the NCAA championship and Final Four games in the year ago period resulted in a 4-point headwind in the quarter.
Domestic streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscription and digital video advertising revenue, was up 25% versus a year ago to $489 million. Q2 benefited from significant growth in sign-ups and streams on CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and in monthly active users and minutes viewed on Pluto. Domestic streaming subscription revenue was up 52% in the second quarter, accelerating from the rate of growth in the first quarter driven by the continued momentum we are experiencing across all of our streaming products.
Turning to content licensing. Revenue was comparable with the prior year. Revenue associated with the licensing of South Park was offset by significant licensing activity in the year ago quarter as well as the timing of deliveries, which have been affected by COVID-related production delays. Theatrical revenue was immaterial in the quarter as most theaters remain closed in the U.S. and internationally.
For Publishing, revenue declined 8%. Strong growth in digital book and audio sales was more than offset by declines in print sales. These titles in the quarter included John Bolton's The Room Where It Happened and Stephen King's If It Bleeds.
On the expense front, we are highly focused on strategically reducing our costs. We continue to benefit from merger-related cost synergies in the second quarter and are on track to realize $300 million in savings for the full year of 2020 before consideration of onetime costs to achieve them, up from our previous expectation of $250 million.
In addition, we are benefiting from COVID-related cost savings, which helped offset the impact of revenue declines and drove adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. A portion of these cost savings are timing related and will come back as we return to live sports and production. However, we expect to realize sustainable cost savings as we take learnings from this crisis and find ways to operate more efficiently over the long term.
In addition, we now expect to achieve $800 million in annualized merger-related cost synergies by the end of 2022, up from our prior $750 million target as we remain highly disciplined in managing our costs. Overall, we are very pleased with ViacomCBS' results in the second quarter of 2020.
Turning to the balance sheet and ViacomCBS' liquidity. In the second quarter, we completed 2 debt transactions totaling $4.5 billion. We used the proceeds to pay down $2.8 billion of our upcoming maturities, including a $340 million redemption that settled on July 10. And we added $1.7 billion to our cash balance, providing us with additional liquidity. These transactions significantly strengthen the financial position of the company, enabling us to effectively weather the current economic uncertainty. We now have no debt maturities until 2022. And in addition to our cash balance, we have our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn.
As of June 30, 2020, when you take into account the benefit of our full run rate merger-related cost synergies, our debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.3x. On a net basis, taking into consideration our $2.3 billion cash balance as of June 30, our leverage ratio is 2.9x, unchanged from the end of 2019. We remain committed to our 2.75x leverage target, including the benefit of full run rate synergies, and plan to use cash on hand, proceeds from our noncore asset sales as well as excess cash flow after dividend payments to reduce our debt balance in order to achieve our leverage target.
I would now like to provide you with some insights on the remainder of the year. Starting with affiliate revenue. As Bob discussed, we had an impressive quarter for distribution, with several new agreements secured, including Verizon, YouTube TV, DISH, Sling TV, Sinclair and Cox. And as Bob mentioned, we now forecast domestic streaming subscribers to reach 18 million by year-end 2020, up from our previous 16 million expectations, which we have achieved ahead of plan. While we expect to be affected by industry pay TV subscriber trends, we will benefit from our recent affiliate deal, increased distribution on YouTube and the strong growth we are experiencing across our subscription streaming platforms. Taken together, we expect the year-over-year rate of change in domestic cable network affiliate revenue and total company affiliate revenue to improve in Q3 and again in Q4.
Moving to advertising. We believe Q2 marked the bottom in the year-over-year rate of change in total company advertising revenue and expect to see sequential improvement in the year-over-year rate of change in advertising revenue in Q3 and again in Q4.
A few other things to note for the third quarter and adjusted free cash flow in the back half of the year. First, on content licensing revenue. We expect COVID-related production delays will continue to affect content licensing deliveries in the third quarter.
Second, on theatrical revenue. We have no movies scheduled to be released in the third quarter as we are saving valuable IP to be released in the theatrical window. That said, we strategically decided to deploy The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run through the relaunch of our super service in early 2021.
And third, on adjusted free cash flow. We had a strong Q2. Our free cash flow benefited from disciplined COVID-related expense management, which will continue to positively impact cash in the balance of the year given the natural lag between expenses and cash.
In addition, our free cash flow benefited significantly from the delay in the timing of production. As we get back to production, spend will return, impacting free cash flow in the second half of the year. Looking beyond this year, we are laser-focused on optimizing working capital for ViacomCBS, which will drive improved free cash flow in 2021 and beyond.
In closing, the first half results of the united ViacomCBS have many proof points of tremendous momentum that will benefit the company over the long term. Although COVID-19 has affected our short-term revenue trends, we remain focused on ensuring that we optimize our cost structure and investment strategy to maximize revenue growth and financial performance for the long term.
On a personal note, it has been a true honor to be a part of the ViacomCBS team during the past 23 years. To Shari, Bob, the Board of Directors and Naveen, I wish you much continued success as you lead this phenomenal company. To me, the company is really all of our talented people. So to the entire ViacomCBS team, I wish you the very best for the future.
Lastly, I would like to commend and thank the amazing finance team of ViacomCBS. You are second to none, and I am most proud of all that we have accomplished together.
With that, we can open the line for questions."

If you could give us a bit more detail about how it progressed through the second quarter with respect to your platforms, really looking from your linear cable networks all the way to AVOD, how it differed, I guess, throughout the second quarter on those platforms. But I think you said June was better, but I'm curious if you have any early thoughts on July, if that improvement continued.
And then my follow-up is just on Paramount, just really regarding the shortening window, theatrical windows, and the agreement that we saw between AMC and Universal. Are you looking to reach sort of similar agreements for Paramount?"

So on advertising, let me reiterate that we believe Q2 is the bottom, and we expect to see continued sequential improvement in the rate of change in Q3 and again in Q4. With that, let me say a couple things to add so",678,"Sure. Alexia, nice to hear your voice. So on advertising, let me reiterate that we believe Q2 is the bottom, and we expect to see continued sequential improvement in the rate of change in Q3 and again in Q4. With that, let me say a couple things to add some additional color.
First, our total company advertising, obviously down in the quarter, and that was, as you heard, overwhelmingly and not surprisingly due to COVID. Beyond COVID, there is some lack of comparability to prior year, and that specifically is because we had the NCAA championship and Final Four game in 2019, but Turner would have had that this year. So that's worth about 400 basis points if you're doing math.
Second, and really more to your question, the quarter turned out better than we thought early. And that was because we did see sequential improvement in each month of the quarter and simultaneously because scatter pricing held strong, 25%, really greater than that versus the upfront. The softness we did see is very concentrated in terms of categories. But at the same time, we saw some early signs of strength from some others, notably pharma, insurance and financial.
And to the other specific question you asked, segments have been impacted differently. So broadcast in the mix is relatively strong. Cable's seen more relative softness. But in the cable side, we did take the opportunity to produce ad loads to improve the experience. Local has also been tough, but things are getting better. In particular, auto's coming back in Q3 as factories have reopened, and we continue to look forward to political being a significant driver in the second half.
Digital also was impacted, but high-quality digital remains super strong. In fact, Pluto TV quickly returned to pre-pandemic growth rates and pricing and was very strong in Q2. So we like what we're seeing in terms of green shoots and look to continue to see that momentum.
On the Paramount side, let me start by saying that while the studio was obviously unable to release films in the quarter due to COVID, it is an incredible asset to ViacomCBS. It has a powerful collection of IP, which we continue to develop for film, TV and streaming purposes. It's got a massive library, which benefits our networks and more recently, our streaming services. And its library is obviously a critical component of our licensing business.
In this COVID time, which is really a time where theaters are shut down, we are focused on protecting asset value and really benefiting from optionality that our company and this environment presents. And that's driven us to do a number of things.
First, we do continue to move films later to save them for what we believe will be a healthier environment in '21. You saw us do that most recently with A Quiet Place Part II and Top Gun: Maverick. We've also monetized some films, yes, with streamers, which allows us to get a return on our investment now. But importantly, it allows us to avoid putting even more product into a '21 that's starting to look pretty full. You saw that with Lovebirds as an example. We also decided to use a film franchise strategically, and that's deploying SpongeBob: Sponge on the Run exclusively in the U.S. against our super service relaunch in early '21 after a short PVOD window.
And then to your questions about PVOD, we really are in sort of a COVID rules phase of the business right now, where studios, including Paramount, are doing some things they wouldn't normally do because theaters are closed. Know we remain committed to theatrical and believe a lot of this reverts once the world normalizes. But we do believe the actual windows will probably shorten, and some of these new monetization paths, including both strategic ones and others, probably will become more confident.
But as I look at the whole thing, it continues to make me highly confident that despite COVID, Paramount is incredibly valuable to us, both strategically and financially."

First, on streaming, streaming TV, connected TV, advertising clearly have strong secular growth. You're investing into it with All Access and Pluto. But it's also a pretty complicated and fragmented market for advertisers. So Bob, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you see that developing, how products like EyeQ gives CBS an advantage -- ViacomCBS an advantage and why advertisers are spending with you rather than, say, a platform like an Amazon Fire or Roku TV.
And then second, just on costs. There's a number of puts and takes as we look forward with the synergies and timing. But as you go through this transition and invest in this transition to streaming, can you talk about how we should think about margins for the business maybe into the sort of like launch period, and then over the longer term, if this is margin-expanding initiative?"

When we announced that acquisition, the market was confused. Most people didn't know what it was. Since then, AVOD, or now what people call FAST, has been accepted as a legitimate and important part of the streaming ecosystem, and others have followed us.
But we haven't let up, not even close, like we leaned into its content, into enhancing the platform, into expanding distribution, into building the brand and into monetizing its ad inventory and most recently, global expansion. And as a result, we've grown Pluto TV dramatically and arguably extended our leadership position.
The reality is no other U.S. FAST asset can touch the combination of Pluto's 100,000-plus hours of high-quality content, which we built through a combination of assets we own and these innovative revenue share-based models that we use with third parties. It's on over 30 devices and platforms. You name it. If it's significant, Pluto's there.
We're rapidly expanding the distribution. We talked about these 80 million devices that are coming through new partnerships with Verizon, TiVo and LG not only adds to the expansive base we're already building through Amazon, Roku, Comcast, Viveo and more. And many of those have preferred placement and/or built-in carriage. And by the way, we got more deals coming in the pipeline, which is going to take these numbers up higher.
Importantly, we're -- to the ad question, we're rapidly monetizing it. Pluto TV benefits both from programmatic flow and from direct ViacomCBS ad relationships. As a result, that business has grown dramatically. And as I said, it's bounced back to pre-COVID growth levels already. And now we're building an integrated ecosystem where Pluto's platform will feed our pay offerings.
Now to your question on EyeQ, it's worth noting that Pluto TV is really a cornerstone of EyeQ, which, for those of you that missed it, we announced this week. EyeQ is a new ad platform, which will reach premium viewing audiences across the ViacomCBS portfolio. And here, we're talking about over 50 million monthly full episode users. So super high-quality advertising base.
And by the way, to your question on why buy from us versus other people, you will only be able to buy that product direct from ViacomCBS. So we're -- in addition to being a broader solution provider, which, of course, we are, in this video space, we've really taken the next step in providing turnkey access to high-quality product to solve advertisers' problems. And that's just another example of the power of ViacomCBS in the ad marketplace.
On the cost side, I think your costs were largely, if not fully, related to the impact of streaming and scaling that service. So on investment, I guess, a couple of points. One is we have very significant amount of content that we've already invested in across the company that we can deploy against the asset, and you saw us do that -- some last week in the preview launch.
Second thing I'd say is we understand the math of content investment. On CBS All Access alone, we have 5 years of LTV data, which we use to drive content decision-making, what we commission, what we renew, et cetera. And third, we're obviously leveraging live events and sports, which we already have that are a real driver of subscribers and usage of service in our experience.
Now as the original slate grows over time and gets comprehensive across the full suite of brands, there will be some increase in cash content investment. However, we do intend to fund that as the mix shift from lower-growth areas. And remember, we're also going to be benefiting from a larger subscriber base, which will generate even more revenue and help fund it.
Lastly, I'd say we are going to market this in 2021 as part of a relaunch. But again, here, we'll significantly benefit from the power of our existing media assets and the appeal of our IP, including in social. So again, this is -- it's going to be ultimately additive to our financials, and we'll track through."

Just anything you can do to help us think about cash content spend this year and into next year.
And then I wanted to ask you, as you think about the super service and evolving All Access, sports is obviously something that is a huge driver of consumption and pricing power. I think you guys have a unique opportunity already in how you use sports and All Access, but that's something you're certainly leaning into. Can you just talk about your sports strategy on All Access and how you think about leveraging sports content on streaming versus linear and sort of the trade-offs of that strategic decision?"
27763231,676138434,2114104,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes. Sure.

So you're right, it's too early to provide 2021 guidance, and we're not going to do that. But I will say with respect to your question on return to production, which obviously is critical, particularly when you get to a cash basis, you saw our very strong cash flow delivery in Q2, close to $900 million on an adjusted basis. Certainly, that number benefited from working capital implications of our sort of production, I'd say, radical decline. It's not totally shut down but certainly radically declined. And you should expect that as we move forward in Q3 but more likely Q4 at scale, that, that working cap benefit begins to go the other way a bit.
And just to give you a little more color on the return to production because I think it's a topic everyone is interested in, we are currently executing a multifaceted return to production. Obviously, we're focused on health and safety of all involved in front of and behind the screen. And we have a real commitment to evolving approaches, locations, even story lines, to deliver that fresh product to customer and, ultimately, the consumer needs on a timely basis.
And as we do that, by the way, we are finding some ways that we can operate less expensively. We've learned a lot through this COVID phase from the productions that are on. And we're rolling that through -- whether it's entertainment or sports, and we're rolling that through.
We are dealing with all this through a centrally managed process so we can ensure application of best practices, mitigate risk, and we have the whole portfolio going through it. That has led us to having a whole bunch of fresh content on or coming to air shortly, unscripted, like Big Brother, which is on air now. We're shooting Love Island in a hotel in Vegas where the cast and crew are actually quarantined together. That will air later this month. Daytime soaps are back in production. In late night, Colbert and Corden are scheduled to return to their buildings next week, albeit without audiences.
Animation production continues to move forward. And by the way, I don't know how many of you saw it, but we made a series of announcements that were picked up last week about our path in adult animation. And that's really a building area of activity for us that I'm super excited about.
On the scripted side, we have a whole set of things in motion. We do have scripts on all series. We are putting shows through the restart process I mentioned. Our third-party production studios are also beginning to move forward. And we got a range of contingency plans in place, which include additional unscripted library movies and some other things. So a lot of options here as we work to serve consumers and customers.
To the cash flow point in particular, I think you should expect Q3, there's more production spend. In Q4, it builds there. And then we'll transition into 2021."

Thanks, Brett. Let me take that from the angle of the overall -- where we're going with the overall super service, and I'll deal with each of your questions within that.
So our guiding objective for a super service is to have a broad differentiated product at a compelling price point. And to get a real sense of that, take a good look at the preview launch we did last week where we materially broadened CBS All Access. The entertainment offering is now far wider. We added 3,500 episodes from 70 series from our flagship brands. It unquestionably widens the demographic appeal because we now have a real offering for kids, young adults, millennials and more. And look at the sports offering, now including UEFA. In fact, if you look at the collection of football, basketball, golf, soccer and more on the platform, we really are the first that have taken sports over the top in a meaningful way. And we believe there's real appeal here as part of a broad streaming service.
We obviously have events like the GRAMMYs, the Tony's, the Super Bowl. There's news, which is something people need these days, or maybe not, I don't know. And then there are originals, to your other part of your question. Today, All Access has a baseline of compelling originals, shows like Star Trek: Picard, Discovery and now Lower Decks, which is animated, The Good Fight, Twilight Zone and The Stand.
Starting in '21, that slate will greatly expand to include all flagship brands. And as an indicator, really a taste, we announced last week that Kamp Koral, which is a SpongeBob spin-off, will join the super service as the first Nickelodeon original. And that will be on the back of the exclusive availability of the latest SpongeBob film, Sponge on the Run.
So that's the kind of way we're using franchises. We have an original plan that goes through '22 quarterly. And I'm super excited about it, and you're going to hear more about that at another time. But that gives you a sense. The originals are going to be important, and they're going to be defining as well as the sports."

You look at our global operating footprint, which includes our linear reach, the content we own, including local content, on-the-ground resources and relationships, we really see that as a powerful go-to-market advantage and feel we're well positioned to succeed.
You look at where we are today on the free side, we're already in Europe and Latin America, Spanish-speaking Latin America with Pluto. We've seen very strong growth to date, particularly in Latin America, which we've only been there a couple of months. We do have almost 7 million international MAUs, 33 million global.
And we got -- we're just getting going there. We got plans to enhance our product, expanding our channel lineup. We're adding a bunch of distribution partners. We will enter Brazil and Spain later this year, France and Italy in early '21. So there's real growth ahead. And obviously, we're thinking about other things from Pluto as well.
On the pay side, we're targeting early '21 for the launch of our international streaming service. The exact product details and pricing, which we haven't announced, will vary by individual markets. But broadly speaking, the new service will feature exclusive first-run premier. So we're going to get those from the slate we're using with CBS All Access in the U.S., from Showtime and from Viacom International Studios. And alongside that, we'll use Paramount movies, box sets from CBS and Viacom media networks.
If you want to just compare it at a high level to what we're doing in the U.S., it will be a much more entertainment-focused product. It doesn't really have a sports -- a material sports lane to it. And it will have an output deal from Showtime because we don't operate Showtime networks outside the United States. We will be rolling it in multiple markets next year, including Australia, Latin America and the Nordics. You'll probably see some press about that. But we're really excited about the opportunity.
And again, this is another place where the power of ViacomCBS is really going to show through, the power of the combination of content, the power of the international footprint we have that's really differentiated from others.
So look, thanks, everyone, for making time in this COVID day coming to us probably from your home. I'd sum it up to say despite the COVID-19 headwinds, we did deliver another solid quarter, reaffirming the strength and optionality of our combined operations. We're executing against key objectives and pushing ViacomCBS to emerge stronger.
As you see, the key earnings and cash flow metrics improved sequentially as we continue to make progress on our integration, and we are now nicely ahead of our run rate and 2020 merger-related cost synergies that we committed to. Our deal-making and execution is underscoring the benefits of our increased scale. And that, obviously, you see in the significant distribution agreements we struck with Verizon, YouTube and others.
And importantly, we're ahead of schedule in building our streaming business. Pluto TV is really cranking, and we're progressively moving towards the relaunch of our diversified super service early next year. And by the way, we just debuted our latest original Star Trek: Lower Decks on CBS All Access. It's a great piece of adult animation. I hope you all go and check it out.
And lastly, to the employees of ViacomCBS, I want to thank you for your amazing passion, dedication and tenacity at this challenging point in time. You're all making a difference helping drive our company forward. So thanks again for your time today and stay well."

On today's call, I'll cover 3 key topics: first, how we've unlocked the power of a combined ViacomCBS in the years since we've merged; second, how our third quarter results demonstrate the company's building momentum; and third, how we're focused on achieving growth in the short and long term by aggressively leaning into streaming. I'll then hand it over to Naveen Chopra, who I'm pleased to welcome to his first earnings call as ViacomCBS' CFO. Naveen will give you his early perspective on the company as well as a detailed financial commentary on Q3. Following that, we'll take your questions. 
Okay. So first off, it's been almost a year since the ViacomCBS merger closed, and I'm thrilled with the way our organization has come together to create value from the combined asset base. In fact, despite the challenges presented by the world around us, our company's transformation is ahead of schedule, and we've moved quickly to realize the power of the ViacomCBS combination: by establishing a best-in-class management team, including, most recently, through the creation of a new consolidated streaming organization; by accelerating our strategy and execution across pay and free streaming; driving growth in subscribers, monthly active users and revenue. We're also unlocking more value in distribution by expanding our footprint through cross-company renewals and new deals; and simultaneously strengthening our positioning in advertising by bringing to bear the power of our combined portfolio and capabilities, all while improving operational efficiency and exceeding the cost synergies we promised when we announced the transaction. We've accomplished a lot in a short amount of time, and we're just getting going. 
Second, let me turn to the quarter's financial and operating results. ViacomCBS' Q3 reflects the continuation and acceleration of a strategy that is clearly working, even as we navigate through the pandemic. To that end, importantly, during the quarter, we saw improving top line trends across affiliate, advertising and domestic streaming and digital video revenue. 
In affiliate, revenue grew 10% in the quarter, marking a significant improvement versus Q2. This improvement was fueled by strong growth in subscription streaming revenue as well as higher reverse comp and retransmission fees. It was also fueled by a return to growth in domestic cable affiliate revenue, which saw a 10 percentage point improvement in growth rate versus Q2. 
Advertising revenue also improved dramatically versus what we saw in Q2 with the rate of decline slowing to 6%. Improvements were seen across the board in broadcast, cable, sports, national, local, digital and international. And the scatter market was robust with strong activity across key categories. 
Speaking of categories, we've also seen certain COVID-impacted industries like auto and retail gradually return, which reflects improvement in the economy and the significant value our portfolio brings to advertisers to drive their own business recovery. 
Importantly, as we look forward, the return of CBS' stable fall schedule is upon us with several scripted series already on air and more premier dates coming up. Add to that, the NFL, the SEC and the Masters. Our content position is strong. 
This dynamic, paired with a successful upfront and the hot political category, should provide further benefit in the fourth quarter. Overall, we're encouraged by what we're seeing, and big-picture advertising is certainly moving in the right direction. 
The commercial momentum of ViacomCBS is clear, and it is underpinned by the durable strength of our brands and IP. CBS was once again the most watched network across primetime, daytime and late night during the 2019-2020 broadcast year. We maintained our leadership in key demos as the #1 cable portfolio for share of viewing, and we owned more top 30 cable networks than any other media family. 
Internationally, our linear share of viewing increased for a third consecutive quarter. And for the second quarter in a row, Tubular Labs ranked ViacomCBS the #1 media and entertainment company in Social, reinforcing the popularity and relevance of our brands and IP in the digital space. 
The strength of ViacomCBS' foundation in content, franchise IP and audience reach is an important competitive advantage, including as a growth accelerant for our streaming business, where we had another great quarter. To that end, ViacomCBS grew domestic streaming and digital video revenue by 56% in Q3, up from 25% in Q2, reflecting the real momentum in usage and monetization in our pay and free streaming products, something we're aggressively leaning into. 
Let me unpack this a bit. In pay, we ended the quarter with 17.9 million domestic subscribers, up 72% year-on-year, which basically puts us just under the raised year-end guidance we issued last quarter, where we took it up from 16 million to 18 million subs. And both CBS All Access and Showtime OTT each had robust consumption growth in sign-ups. 
Starting with All Access. The service benefited from strong demand for sports like UEFA and the NFL; originals like Star Trek Lower Decks; and CBS network content like Big Brother and Love Island; as well from the 3,500 library episodes added from Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, MTV and Smithsonian; plus the almost 200 films from Paramount that we added in late July as part of our preview launch. 
CBS All Access is now in the early stages of benefiting from the power of the combined company, and there's much more to come. More on that in a bit. 
And Showtime OTT had a strong quarter as well driven by the trifecta of original programming, including The Shy, Billions, the final season of Homeland, all of which drove strong adoption and engagement. 
Our momentum in pay streaming is driven by the combination of compelling content and ubiquitous distribution. On the distribution side, the latest example is the All Access and Showtime streaming bundle we recently began offering through Apple TV+, which follows our recent Amazon renewal. 
We have a lot going on here. And the combination of compelling content in ubiquitous distribution is clearly working, as evidenced by ViacomCBS subscription streaming revenue growth accelerating to 78% in Q3 from Q2's 52%. 
On the free side, Pluto TV continues to build on its position as the #1 fast, free, ad-supported streaming television service in the United States. In the quarter, Pluto TV's domestic MAUs grew 57% to 28.4 million and globally grew to nearly 36 million MAUs. On top of that, Pluto's ad monetization has been growing rapidly, and the trend line is compelling. 
Consider this. After logging its first $1 million ad sales day in 2019, it took Pluto 10 months to log its first $2 million ad sales day. But it just took 1 month after that for Pluto TV to achieve its first $3 million day. While this shouldn't be interpreted as a daily run rate, we are seeing revenue inflection at Pluto TV in a most positive way. 
The trajectory is extremely exciting. And we remain confident that Pluto will meet or exceed its 30 million domestic MAU target by year-end, bolstered by the fact that we continue to add even more high-quality content to the market-leading service. In fact, in the U.S., Pluto now has well over 100,000 hours of compelling content available to consumers. 
We recently added 9 ViacomCBS channels, including Star Trek, Bellator, CBSN Dallas and CSI. And of course, we continue to add a broad range of compelling third-party content. As an example, in October, Narcos began streaming on Pluto TV, marking the first time the series will be widely available to U.S. streaming viewers without a Netflix subscription. 
We also ramped up Pluto's TV's distribution across multiple devices and services, including new distribution agreements with LG and Sony PlayStation, extending Pluto TV reach well over 100 million additional devices worldwide. What's even more exciting is we're an official launch partner of the highly anticipated PlayStation 5 console debuting in mid-November. 
Outside the U.S., Pluto TV is expanding rapidly and seeing strong adoption as well, especially in Latin America. And last month, we launched Pluto TV in Spain with 40 thematic and uniquely curated channels across multiple genres. In fact, during the first week of launch in Spain, Pluto TV was the #1 downloaded app for Android devices. 
Looking ahead, we plan to bring new local versions of Pluto TV to other priority markets, including Brazil this year and France and Italy in 2021. Importantly, these are all markets where ViacomCBS has strong local operations, including a large pipeline of local language content in place and ready to go. 
The world is quickly raising fast, which is why Pluto TV's leadership and growth is a key component of our streaming strategy. And remember, as we progressively build out a linked ecosystem, Pluto will also serve as a gateway to and funnel for our pay services. So there's a lot to be excited about for ViacomCBS in Q3 in the streaming space. And I'm even more excited about where we're going. 
Here, I want to touch on a few items. First, consistent with our strategy to maximize our position in assets across both pay and free, in mid-October, we announced the creation of a new consolidated streaming organization. Tom Ryan, the Co-Founder and CEO of Pluto TV, has assumed the role of President and CEO of ViacomCBS Streaming, overseeing Paramount Plus and Pluto TV. In this expanded role, Tom will drive our strategic execution globally as we create a progressively integrated streaming ecosystem across pay and free. 
Tom's entrepreneurial drive, deep knowledge in over-the-top, his focus on the consumer experience and demonstrated ability to work effectively across our company make him ideally suited to lead this next leg of our streaming journey. 
A second item I want to touch on is Paramount Plus, which is on track to debut in early 2021. As you know, Paramount Plus will combine live sports, breaking news and a mountain of entertainment, including exclusive original content plus a diverse and deep library of shows and movies, spanning all programming genres from Viacom CBS's leading brands in one unified service. 
Here, despite the challenges of COVID, our original programming plans continue to advance. And we will have a deep roster of original series that leans heavily on our franchises, including The Offer, a scripted limited series that will tell the incredible story behind the making of The Godfather, one of Paramount Picture's most iconic franchises; a new addition of Behind The Music, a truly iconic music series; Real Criminal Minds, a true crime docu series spinning out of CBS' Criminal Minds; Camp Coral, a new original children series from Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, which we will release after the new SpongeBob movie, Sponge on the Run, and will be exclusive to Paramount Plus; and we also have new original content, including Lioness, a new series from the creator of Yellowstone. We will, of course, have more original programming to announce as we get closer to launch. 
As we get into '21, we see substantial incremental growth ahead. Our preview launch at the end of July served as a proof of concept, and that gives us the confidence to lean into streaming even more. We're executing a plan which will bring more content, more marketing and more distribution to the table. 
Paramount Plus with its live sports, breaking news and mountain of entertainment, together with Pluto TV in the free space and Showtime OTT in premium, will take ViacomCBS streaming to a whole new level. 
This is certainly an exciting time for our company, and I'm so glad that Naveen Chopra has joined us for the next leg of our journey. Since early August, he's truly hit the ground running. He's brought a fresh and valuable perspective to ViacomCBS, especially as we gear up for our launch of Paramount Plus early next year. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Naveen to provide his thoughts as well as additional financial detail on the quarter. Naveen?"

I'm excited to be here for my first ViacomCBS earnings call. It has now been 3 months since I joined the company. I was initially drawn to ViacomCBS because of its strong position in the media industry. Having now had some time to listen and learn, I find myself even more bullish about our future and our ability to create long-term value for ViacomCBS shareholders by leveraging the scale of our brands, content and distribution. 
Thus far, ViacomCBS has exceeded my expectations in several respects. The company has moved quickly and effectively to capture synergies from the merger, has successfully found ways to enhance both the financial and strategic value of its traditional media businesses and has an even stronger presence in streaming than people recognize, all of which are demonstrated in our Q3 results. 
I am particularly inspired by the opportunities we have in streaming, where the addressable market is expansive and growing both domestically and globally. In addition, the value of the users of our largest pay streaming services continues to increase driven in part by favorable trends in underlying churn and growth in engagement. 
Similarly, in free ad-supported streaming, Pluto TV is not only rapidly growing MAUs and total viewing hours, but it is seeing a significant mix shift to consumption on higher-value connected TV platforms and material growth in monetization with plenty of room to grow in sell-through and CPMs. 
I'm also emboldened by the fact that we have the rare DNA to produce world-class content at scale, including for the streaming generation, from original programming like Billions or Yellowstone; to unscripted like MTV's The Challenge; to kids programming like PAW Patrol or SpongeBob; and of course, iconic movie franchises such as Top Gun and The Godfather, ViacomCBS content has proven to be a powerful audience magnet on both our owned and third-party platforms. And I consider this pipeline of content, regardless of where it is distributed, a tremendous asset that we can optimally allocate to support our overall strategy. 
And I share with you that this depth of content production capability is quite rare. Both the content assets themselves and the ability to create them are scarce, valuable, and they are the envy of some of the largest technology and media players in the industry. So while the competitive environment is intense and requires sharp execution to achieve our streaming ambitions, I am encouraged by the progress we have made, and together with industry trends, believe pay and free streaming will yield compelling ROI, consistent with our goal of creating long-term shareholder value. 
Now let me take you through some of the highlights of our third quarter results. Total company revenue was $6.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.1 billion, down 12% year-over-year. And adjusted diluted EPS was $0.91. 
I'll provide some additional details on revenue in a moment. But as you would expect, the year-over-year trend in total company revenue represents significant pandemic-related effects on advertising sales, content licensing and theatrical revenues. Compared to the year ago quarter, adjusted OIBDA declined driven by lower revenue, somewhat offset by lower costs principally associated with delays in production expense. 
Q3 adjusted free cash flow was very strong at $1.5 billion, largely because production activity remained limited throughout most of the quarter, resulting in a significant working capital benefit. As a reminder, adjusted free cash flow excludes $164 million of payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and costs to achieve synergies. 
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter. Domestic streaming and digital video revenue grew 56% versus the year ago period to $636 million, owing to significant growth in sign-ups across CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and very strong growth in monthly active users and minutes viewed on Pluto. Domestic subscription streaming revenue grew 78% in Q3, an acceleration from 52% in Q2, driven by the continued momentum we are seeing across our subscription services. 
And on the ad-supported side, digital video advertising revenue also experienced a strong recovery versus Q2. Pluto TV was a key contributor to this recovery. In fact, growth at Pluto TV accelerated materially from Q2 with revenue more than doubling from the year ago period. In aggregate, our domestic streaming and digital video revenue is now pacing at an annual run rate north of $2.5 billion and growing over 50% year-on-year as of Q3. 
Streaming momentum also benefited affiliate revenue, which grew 10% year-on-year in Q3 versus 2% in Q2. The growth in total company affiliate revenue was driven by growth in streaming subscription revenue and distribution renewals, which included incremental carriage and improved economics. Domestic cable affiliate revenue grew 4% year-over-year in Q3 versus a decline of 6% in Q2 and grew year-on-year even excluding the growth of Showtime OTT. 
In addition, TV entertainment affiliate revenue grew 25% in Q3, an acceleration versus 22% in Q2 driven by strong growth in streaming subscription revenue and retrans feed and reverse comp, which also benefited from renewal activity in the quarter. 
Advertising revenue was down 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued COVID-19 headwinds. However, the Q3 growth rate was a significant improvement relative to the year-over-year decline we experienced in Q2. The improvement in advertising trends has been broad-based across broadcast and cable, but we are especially encouraged by the increasing contribution from the inventory included in EyeQ. As a reminder, the EyeQ platform provides advertisers a single transactional point of entry to our digital video content advertising inventory and includes not only digital video advertising revenue from Pluto TV, but full episode inventory from our other ViacomCBS networks. 
The recovery in Q3 also benefited from improvement in scatter pricing, owing to firming marketplace demand. In terms of key categories, pharma remains strong. And we've seen improvements in automotive, financial services and retail. As expected, political spend was very robust in Q3. 
Turning to content licensing. Q3 revenue was down 33% year-over-year, reflecting a lower volume of licensing due to COVID-related production delays and several licensed programs reaching series-end in the year ago period. As you know, licensing revenue is inherently lumpy as evidenced by the licensing of South Park earlier this year, which contributed a significant amount of revenue and adjusted OIBDA in Q2. So while content licensing will be a part of our strategy going forward, we do not expect to replicate a deal of this size and nature in 2021. 
Theatrical revenue was immaterial in the quarter as most theaters remained closed. But we have found ways to mitigate the near-term loss of theatrical revenue through alternate monetization strategies, including early EST, PVOD and licensing select titles to streaming platforms. 
And finally, publishing revenue increased 29% year-over-year due to strong sales in Q3, including Mary Trump's Too Much and Never Enough and Bob Woodward's Rage. 
On the expense front, we remain focused on reducing our costs. We benefited from merger-related cost synergies in the third quarter and are on track to realize at least $300 million in savings for the full year 2020 and $800 million in annualized run rate merger-related cost synergies by the end of 2022 before consideration of onetime cost to achieve. 
In addition, we are benefiting from COVID-related cost savings, which helped offset some of the COVID impact of revenue. And a portion of these cost savings are sustainable, while some are timing related and will return as we increase production activity. 
Turning to cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $1.5 billion, equaling $2.9 billion year-to-date, benefiting from a significant working capital tailwind due in large part to temporary production delays. We expect this trend will reverse somewhat in Q4 as we continue to ramp production. 
Regarding the balance sheet. As a result of the financing transactions completed earlier this year and our strong free cash flow, we ended the quarter with over $3 billion of cash on hand and have no debt maturities until 2022. When considering merger-related cost synergies, our gross debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.4x and 2.9x on a net debt basis. 
Following the quarter, we closed the sale of CNET on October 30, resulting in proceeds of $350 million net of taxes and transaction costs. 
Our cash balance and maturity profile provide operating flexibility and capacity to delever even before factoring future noncore asset sales. We continue to hold a 2.75x long-term leverage target, and we will use our excess capital after streaming investments and dividend payments to pay down debt. We do not currently plan to repurchase any shares. 
I'd now like to share some impacts regarding our expectations for the remainder of the year. First, regarding our domestic streaming and digital video revenue, we anticipate continued momentum as we move closer to the launch of Paramount Plus next year. We expect to end 2020 at an annual run rate north of $2.8 billion in domestic streaming and digital video revenue, powered by strong growth in streaming subs and Pluto TV, MAUs and engagement. 
We continue to prepare for the launch of Paramount Plus by adding content to All Access, rolling out new features like customer profiles and enhance recommendations and consolidating our marketing efforts to support the launch. As part of this consolidation, in Q4, we will start sunsetting some of our smaller legacy streaming services like MTV Hits, whose content will be incorporated in Paramount Plus. This will create a onetime headwind to streaming subscriber growth in Q4 as we set up for a much larger streaming service longer term. Nonetheless, we now expect to finish the year with at least 19 million domestic streaming subscribers, up from our original guidance of 16 million. 
We continue to expect Pluto TV to finish the year at over 30 million domestic MAUs and expect 40 million when measured on a global basis. 
Looking at affiliate revenue. We expect Q4 to show similar affiliate revenue growth rates to Q3 in both total company affiliate and domestic cable affiliate revenue as the combined strength in pricing retrans, reverse comp, incremental carriage and subscription streaming revenue more than offsets linear subscriber declines. In terms of advertising revenue, we expect another quarter of improving trends driven by strength in political, sports and digital. 
And finally, on free cash flow. In Q4, we expect some reversal of the working capital tailwind as content production spend ramps materially. Nonetheless, for the full year 2020, adjusted free cash flow will still enjoy a material temporary working capital benefit from the delayed timing of production, which will continue to unwind in 2021. 
Looking to 2021. We are encouraged by the growth opportunity ahead for Paramount Plus, Showtime OTT and Pluto TV, and we expect to support this momentum by increasing our investments in streaming. As it relates to adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow, we expect the impacts of additional streaming investment to be partially offset by the benefits of incremental merger-related cost synergies and the Super Bowl on CBS in the first quarter. 
As we look forward, I want to reiterate how happy I am to be here and how excited I am about the growth opportunity we have. 
With that, we can now open the line for questions."

And it's going to be a truly differentiated and compelling offering that's unlike anything that's really out there today. 
And look, as a reminder, Paramount Plus is building on CBS All Access, a product that already has strong momentum, as you've seen in the metrics in the third quarter. 
That said, Paramount Plus is going to be live sports, breaking news and a mountain of entertainment. Look at live sports, includes the NFL, the SEC, UEFA, PGA Golf, the NCAA and more. The breaking news side, it will be Live CBS News anytime from CBSN, live local news from CBS stations, key new shows like 60 Minutes and more to be announced. 
And then there's the mountain of entertainment from our flagship brands, which are Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Smithsonian. It really provides us strength in a whole set of key genres: reality, crime procedurals, kids, films and more. It will appeal across demographics, everything from preschoolers to 50-plus. Of course, it's going to be available on demand but has some live elements. And it's going to have a very strong original slate, many based on franchises that come from across the brands that are represented in the service. 
I'd also point out that the consumer response from our preview launch -- and remember, in late July, we added 3,500 episodes from Viacom brands as well as about 190 Paramount films. That consumer response was strong and really served as proof of concept that's given us the confidence to lean in. The response include growing subscribers and a significant decrease in the average age. The average age of new subs came down by almost 10 years and was more diverse. 
We saw material increase in time spent. That included more than doubling time spent with film and Viacom content becoming a strong double-digit part of overall consumption. 
So no question the product is working. The plan now is to continue to add content. That will be about 10,000 additional hours. Of course, rebrand CBS All Access to Paramount Plus in early '21, and that will be the time when the original slate also has expanded further to encompass the flagship brands. 
The last thing I'd say is the response to us selecting Paramount Plus as the brand has been overwhelmingly positive. So lots to be excited about here around Paramount Plus, and we see substantial incremental growth ahead."

And then if I could, just real quickly, you talked a bit about cash flow into the coming year. And I'm curious if you can share a little more about how Paramount Plus might impact free cash flow. Like how much of your investment in that business is sort of a repurposing or a shifting of sort of existing run rate? And how much will be incremental?"

So the -- look, I'm really happy with the state of our affiliate business. We clearly had a very strong dynamic in the quarter, and that dynamic was driven both by unit and by rate. 
So if you look at the unit side of the equation, subscriber declines were less than expected from an industry perspective. We saw that, too, in our remits. And we had the benefit of incremental carriage in the form of Viacom networks being added to YouTube TV in July. 
And then on top of that, you overlay rate. And the rate story is very strong. We had renewal activity that benefited retrans and reverse comp as well as our premium services. And that's in addition to the built-in escalators we have in all our network deals. 
I'd also remind you that on the reverse comp side, deals are priced in absolute dollars, and therefore, insulated from subscriber declines. So that's effectively another driver of rate. 
And then of course, as you mentioned, our affiliate growth is also being driven by the strong momentum we have in streaming. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, subscription streaming revenue growth accelerated to 78% in the quarter. 
So you put all that together, and we had a very strong affiliate story. And importantly, we expect the growth we experienced in Q3 will continue at a similar rate in Q4. 
And then more broadly, I really like our position. Our product line positions us very well to respond to changing consumer behavior. We have compelling offerings in pay and free streaming apps, plus an industry-leading linear bundle. And we know how to work with a broad range of distribution partners. We know how to get deals done, and we have a legacy of creating mutually beneficial value. So feel great about affiliate. 
On the cash flow side, Naveen?"

In terms of the streaming investment piece, we're not going to provide any specific guidance for '21 at this point. But what I can share is that as we think about the magnitude and the composition of our content investments, we're very focused on thinking about it relative to the growth opportunities we see. 
And what I mean by that is -- look, streaming is obviously a big opportunity. It's one where we've got several years of experience and increasing momentum. So it's not a greenfield investment. Remember, our domestic streaming and digital video revenue is growing 50% on an annual run rate of $2.5 billion. So we see that as a really compelling case for investing to continue to support the growth. 
And as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we do intend to do that in 2021. Some of that investment will be funded by the growth itself, and some of it will be funded by incremental cost synergies. And so unlike a pure-play streaming company, I think our content investments have a lot of leverage, meaning that every dollar we spend on content can benefit us across the entire company, from streaming to linear to film and adjacent businesses like consumer products. So we spend a lot of time thinking about how to allocate and reallocate that spend to optimize that leverage across all of those different distribution channels."

So first, in terms of the streaming org, probably 3 things that I should highlight. First, as I mentioned in my remarks, we recently created this combined organization under Tom Ryan to enhance our ability to create value from the combined asset base. Now look, in particular, that's really about maximizing the benefit of us operating in both the pay and free space. 
I see that combination of having a range of benefits. It will advantage us in terms of increasing lifetime value, including helping manage SAC and churn. An integrated model also facilitates sharing of tech, data and analytics. And I believe an integrated model will facilitate a more sophisticated approach to windowing across our streaming services. 
The second thing you should know is that, as part of this change, Tom Ryan joins our Content Council, and that means he's partnering with our content leadership as they execute on a multi-platform mandate. 
Our brand leads, you know them, Jessica, George Cheeks, Jim Gianopulos, Chris McCarthy, David Nevins, Brian Robbins, they are the best in the business. And they are now aligned with Tom to ensure we put the full weight of our company behind our streaming aspirations. 
I believe that enables a stronger team and allows us also to extract benefits from outside streaming from which to drive streaming, things like traditional reach and our broader IP portfolio, including, importantly, as related to key franchises. And by the way, we're already seeing that benefit in terms of our plans for Paramount Plus and for Pluto TV. 
The last thing, you should look at this really in the context of our overall execution as one ViacomCBS. As you know, Jessica, since day 1 of the merger, I've been focused on harnessing the combined power of this company. And you've seen us move quickly to integrate key functions, both on the commercial and strategic services side to really benefit from that. It's a powerful model. It's already working in many ways, and I believe there's much more to come. 
On the upfront side -- look, we're doing an upfront -- a virtual upfront, in fact, in the middle of COVID-19, was something no one had ever experienced before, but I'm really happy with where we ended up. I think the team did a phenomenal job really benefiting from our asset base. We were up low single digits on price. And we were very careful with volume holding back inventory so that we have inventory to sell in scatter. And as you know, Jessica, scatter market today is very robust. We're seeing historically high premiums versus the upfront, higher than pre-COVID, by the way. And we're seeing scatter-to-scatter in broadcast in double digits and then in cable in high singles. So that market is robust. You want to have inventory to play there, we will. 
On the digital side of the upfront, demand was very solid, up versus last year's upfront. It's another reason why I love our position with Pluto. It's a solution -- because if you think about Pluto for a second, it's a solution to our clients' need for high-quality video reach in today's marketplace, and it's a solution to our needs for impressions to drive growth. And when you look at the numbers, it's a solution that's clearly working, and it has room to run. 
So again, a different upfront than any of us have ever experienced, but I feel very good about how we're exiting it. And it is a good base to build on going into '21."

So let me start by saying, I couldn't be happier with our decision to acquire Pluto in late 2018. It's an amazing asset, and it's growing even faster than we had hoped, never mind planned, but hoped at the time. I mean, look, you hear",680,"Yes. Sure, Alexia. So let me start by saying, I couldn't be happier with our decision to acquire Pluto in late 2018. It's an amazing asset, and it's growing even faster than we had hoped, never mind planned, but hoped at the time. 
I mean, look, you heard the metrics today. The momentum is unquestionable in both usage and monetization. If you recall, we closed on that deal in March of '19. And we quickly talked about it being a long-term opportunity of having $1 billion in revenue. I think people thought we were crazy when we said that. But given the growth we've experienced since then, our ambitions have actually grown from there. 
Why? Because as I said, really to my last answer, it's an amazing thing. It's a solution to the marketplace need for high-quality video reach, and it's a solution to us needing more impressions to sell. It's a great intersection. 
In terms of the category and competitors, look, the category is very strong, but the good news is we have the #1 fast service. So are we feeling any pressure? No, not -- I mean look at the revenue growth rates. Pluto more than doubled in the quarter. And it's -- again, it's got tremendous momentum. 
With respect to your question on Comedy Central and HBO Max -- look, our content licensing strategy, I think there's really 2 things to think about here: one is content licensing is an important business; but two is, our strategy is clearly evolving, particularly with Paramount Plus. 
So first, in terms of the content licensing business, we have a tremendous asset base in content both from a library -- film library of 4,000 titles, TV library of 140,000 episodes, current series production of 750 series globally. We can't keep all that for ourself. It doesn't make sense. It's too much. 
And we do have strong demand from third parties because we are proven hit-makers. And that demand, we can reliably and profitably monetize it, and we do. And remember, the monetization is overwhelming a rental model so the IP does return to us over time for other downstream uses. 
I'd also say that beyond the financial value of licensing, it has strategic value. We can and do use third-party platforms to extend and expand audience, and that also provides downstream benefits to our owned and operated platforms. That could be about early seasons on a third-party platform, driving demand for new seasons or spin-offs on ours, could also be about broader revenues like consumer products. 
All that said, and this is where I want to talk a bit about Comedy Central specifically that you asked, our strategy is clearly evolving in a more O&O, owned- and operated-based direction. And Paramount Plus has already impacted our content licensing decisions. We do have a 2-year view of the original slate for Paramount Plus that leans heavily on franchise, IP from across the company. We made those decisions before we decided what to license. That's IP we're very excited about. You've heard a bit about it, but there's more to come as we get closer to launch. 
In terms of library, which is where your comedy question fits in, we've increasingly moved to a co-exclusive or nonexclusive model to ensure that Paramount Plus also benefits from the product. And again, you look at what is an acquisition driver versus what is an engagement driver. Library product is not acquisition drivers. These, we believe, will be our franchise-linked originals and our original originals. But library product, including some stuff from Comedy Central, is good for engagement. And so we want to have it for our own use. But again, we don't think that detracts from subscriber acquisition for Paramount Plus. 
So again, I feel very good about where we are in content licensing. We have a very thoughtful strategy. We are supporting that business, but we are clearly evolving it, including in a more owned and operated direction as we ramp Paramount Plus. And again, very excited about what '21 is going to bring."

You don't have to watch Paramount Plus to get the NFL.

So look, we're absolutely focused on creating a must-watch service in Paramount Plus. And we do believe that our positioning of live sports, breaking news and a mountain of entertainment is differentiated and compelling. 
Now as part of that, there's no question that franchises will be key to the success of Paramount Plus. And related to that, our strategy is to have new original variants of franchises to serve as subscription drivers. Those originals, in turn, much like my commentary to Alexia's point in a way, will be linked to larger library assets that drive subscriber engagement. So we're very focused on this strategy. And I'd also note that one of our competitors has clearly demonstrated the value of that approach. 
So Star Trek, you mentioned, arguably the original proof of concept for CBS All access. There are now multiple variants of it on All Access. It works well for us. Sports, which you also mentioned, they're a bit different but clearly powerful. We have UEFA. That is exclusive, and we're very happy we got it. By the way, we're super happy we got it early and now have it for a whole bunch of years going forward. But look, the NFL, the SEC, the golf, even though they're also available on CBS linear, they definitely work for All Access and will definitely work for Paramount Plus. 
In terms of Paramount Plus, we have announced some new entertainment franchises that we're bringing to Plus: The Godfather, SpongeBob, the Criminal Minds spinout. But under the covers, our preview launch showed that there's other franchises that work, too, that have potential, things like MTV's reality show, The Challenge; things like Nick's animated library series, Avatar. And all this is really the tip of the iceberg. And we do have other franchises in the company. So you can safely assume that upcoming announcements will include new original variants of them for Paramount Plus. We will, of course, have some nonfranchise-based new originals to keep things fresh. But I'm not going to get ahead of things and reveal them until we get much closer to launch."

How do you think about the kids and family investment and opportunity in front of Paramount Plus, particularly around sort of the Nick brand and animated content? Some of the more general entertainment, broader services have kids content, but they're not dedicated kids apps, so to speak. So just wondering how you're thinking about integrating Nick and animation and to make sure you get the most out of that inside of Paramount Plus. 
And then for either you or Naveen, I'm just curious -- maybe Naveen, since from your Amazon days. When you look at how Viacom CBS is executing on like customer acquisition, retention, analytics, across kind of Pluto, Paramount Plus, Showtime, do you think there's opportunities to align those across the 3 services in a more effective way than what's being done today?

So look, the kids -- and it's really the kids and family space, we believe, is fundamentally important to us at Paramount Plus. We obviously believe that bringing the Nick brand and its incredible library of both shows and IP that can continue to go forward is an amazing advantage. 
If you look at the preview launch and what we've done with CBS All Access to date, we have added a bunch of Nickelodeon content. That content is definitely a significant contributor to what I characterized as a strong double-digit share of overall consumption that Viacom network content now represents on CBS All Access. 
As we get into Paramount Plus, we mentioned adding 10,000 additional hours. Certainly, a bunch of that will be from Nick. We mentioned a growing original slate. Certainly, that's coming from Nick. We have mentioned one title that we are putting as new exclusive original on Paramount Plus, that is Camp Coral, which is a SpongeBob spinout. That is getting dropped after we exclusively release the SpongeBob, Sponge on the Run movie in the domestic U.S. market on Paramount Plus. 
So we think kids and family is very important, and we think we have real advantage in terms of content and capabilities here. By the way, we are also -- Naveen, I think mentioned adding features and other things to Paramount plus. One of the things we're doing there is in the profile area, including setting it up to be a safe kids environment. We believe that's important, particularly for the preschool side of the house, but obviously, older kids as 
well. So yes, that's important part of the equation. And again, this is another place where ViacomCBS brings a tremendous advantage to the table. And having Brian Robbins, who, as I referenced, is on the Content Council, is working with Tom Ryan, is focused on moving this forward. In fact, he was the advocate for Camp Coral debuting on Paramount Plus versus Nickelodeon linear because he believed it was a key part of a franchise play. So he's totally in us making Paramount Plus a success including, of course, in the kids space. Naveen?"

So whether you look at churn, whether you look at SAC, whether you look at engagement, I think that we have great momentum in many of those dimensions. And we're highly focused on continuing to optimize them. 
In particular, the fact that we have the linked ecosystem between subscription in Paramount Plus and Showtime and Pluto TV as a free offering, I think, gives us tremendous opportunities to apply analytics and data and figure out the most optimal way to acquire subscribers and ways to maximize their lifetime, perhaps by moving them between those services, depending on their needs at any given point. 
And I would add to that, that we can layer on top of those different services some really sophisticated analytics, and we'll be able to collect more data than we would have with a single service. So I'm extremely excited about what we can do there. I think there's clearly momentum, but also a lot of opportunity that we can take that to the next level."

But I am happy to say that we've made very significant progress in a safe return to production with the health of our crews and talent top of mind. 
At this point, knock on wood, we're almost back to normal volumes. If you look at our Viacom media networks, the cable side of the house, they're probably at 95% of production relative to prior year. CBS essentially has all of the fall network series currently in production. By the way, we debuted a bunch of them recently, including Young Sheldon, Mom, NCIS as well as a new comedy from Chuck, B Positive. And there's more coming. 
Showtime's back up in production in almost all of its series. And even Paramount on the film side, which obviously very location-based, is ramping up and expects to be back at full capacity in 2021. And I also mentioned that our originals for Paramount Plus are on track. 
So again, from a production volume standpoint, we really have made extraordinary progress, particularly in the last quarter. And we're currently in very good shape, and that means we're ramping back to a more normal level of content spend. Obviously, that trajectory will continue into '21.

And to your question really on, I would call it, mix of subscriber adds and what's going on with subscribers. Again, Q3, on a pay subscriber growth basis, very strong.

And to your question really on, I would call it, mix of subscriber adds and what's going on with subscribers. Again, Q3, on a pay subscriber growth basis, very strong.  Q4, we didn't take the number up as much as we did before. Remember, our year-end target for pay used to be 16 million then. We took it up to 18 million. Now we're taking up to 19 million. 
It is true that in the fourth quarter, as I think Naveen referenced in his remarks, we are doing some sunsetting of smaller services a service like MTV Hits as we prepare for the relaunch of Paramount Plus in early '21. And we're also kind of focusing on marketing in '21 versus in the fourth quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into the fact that we only raised it to 19 million versus a higher number. We feel very good about our trajectory in '20, and we're super excited about where this thing is going in '21. 
As to your question about kind of mix of ads and Apple TV+ versus others, the good news is we have broad and really ubiquitous distribution. It's one of our, I believe, real advantages in this game. It's partially because we don't have an in-house distribution channel that we favor. And we're really seeing net adds come from a broad range of places, yes, including Apple TV+. But by far, that's not the only place they're coming from. So we feel good about that. 
Look, we're very pleased with our results for this quarter, including the accelerated transformation of our business that you're seeing in less than a year. And despite the challenges of the pandemic, we brought together a single ViacomCBS that does have growing momentum and is creating value on multiple dimensions. You see that in our Q3 metrics both on the traditional side, and importantly, in streaming, where our momentum is indisputable. And while we're really pleased with Q3, it's what to come that we're really excited about. 
So thank you for your time today. Thank you for your support. And finally, I'd like to thank all ViacomCBS employees for all they do every day to drive our company forward. Stay well, everyone."

On today's call, I'll cover 3 key topics: first, how we've unlocked the power of a combined ViacomCBS in the year since we've merged; second, how our third quarter results demonstrate the company's building momentum; and third, how we're focused on achieving growth in the short and long term by aggressively leaning into streaming. I'll then hand it over to Naveen Chopra, who I'm pleased to welcome to his first earnings call as ViacomCBS's CFO. Naveen will give you his early perspective on the company as well as a detailed financial commentary on Q3. Following that, we'll take your questions.  
Okay. So first off, it's been almost a year since the ViacomCBS merger closed, and I'm thrilled with the way our organization has come together to create value from the combined asset base. In fact, despite the challenges presented by the world around us, our company's transformation is ahead of schedule, and we've moved quickly to realize the power of the ViacomCBS combination, by establishing a best-in-class management team, including, most recently, through the creation of a new consolidated streaming organization; by accelerating our strategy and execution across pay and free streaming; driving growth in subscribers, monthly active users and revenue.  
We're also unlocking more value in distribution by expanding our footprint through cross-company renewals and new deals and simultaneously strengthening our positioning in advertising by bringing to bear the power of our combined portfolio and capabilities, all while improving operational efficiency and exceeding the cost synergies we promised when we announced the transaction. We've accomplished a lot in a short amount of time, and we're just getting going.  
Second, let me turn to the quarter's financial and operating results. ViacomCBS's Q3 reflects the continuation and acceleration of a strategy that is clearly working, even as we navigate through the pandemic. To that end, importantly, during the quarter, we saw improving top line trends across affiliate, advertising and domestic streaming and digital video revenue.  
In affiliate, revenue grew 10% in the quarter, marking a significant improvement versus Q2. This improvement was fueled by strong growth in subscription streaming revenue as well as higher reverse comp and retransmission fees. It was also fueled by a return to growth in domestic cable affiliate revenue, which saw a 10 percentage point improvement in growth rate versus Q2.  
Advertising revenue also improved dramatically versus what we saw in Q2 with the rate of decline slowing to 6%. Improvements were seen across the board in broadcast, cable, sports, national, local, digital and international. And the scatter market was robust with strong activity across key categories.  
Speaking of categories, we've also seen certain COVID-impacted industries like auto and retail gradually return, which reflects improvement in the economy and the significant value our portfolio brings to advertisers to drive their own business recovery.  
Importantly, as we look forward, the return of CBS' stable fall schedule is upon us with several scripted series already on air and more premier dates coming up. Add to that the NFL, the FCC and the Masters. Our content position is strong.  
This dynamic, paired with a successful upfront and the hot political category, should provide further benefit in the fourth quarter. Overall, we're encouraged by what we're seeing and big-picture advertising is certainly moving in the right direction.  
The commercial momentum of ViacomCBS is clear, and it is underpinned by the durable strength of our brands and IP. CBS was once again the most watched network across prime time, daytime and late night during the 2019-2020 broadcast year. We maintained our leadership in key demos as the #1 cable portfolio for share of viewing, and we owned more top 30 cable networks than any other media family.  
Internationally, our linear share of viewing increased for a third consecutive quarter. And for the second quarter in a row, Tubular Labs ranked ViacomCBS the #1 media and entertainment company in social, reinforcing the popularity and relevance of our brands and IP in the digital space.  
The strength of ViacomCBS' foundation in content, franchise IP and audience reach is an important competitive advantage, including as a growth accelerant for our streaming business, where we had another great quarter. To that end, ViacomCBS grew domestic streaming and digital video revenue by 56% in Q3, up from 25% in Q2, reflecting the real momentum in usage and monetization in our pay and free streaming products, something we're aggressively leaning into.  
Let me unpack this a bit. In pay, we ended the quarter with 17.9 million domestic subscribers, up 72% year-on-year, which basically puts us just under the raised year-end guidance we issued last quarter, where we took it up from 16 million to 18 million subs. And both CBS All Access and Showtime OTT each had robust consumption growth in sign-ups.  
Starting with All Access. The service benefited from strong demand for sports like UEFA and the NFL, originals like Star Trek Lower Decks and CBS network content like Big Brother and Love Island; as well from the 3,500 library episodes added from Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, MTV and Smithsonian; plus the almost 200 films from Paramount that we added in late July as part of our preview launch.  
CBS All Access is now in the early stages of benefiting from the power of the combined company, and there's much more to come. More on that in a bit.  
And Showtime OTT had a strong quarter as well driven by the trifecta of original programming, including The Chi, Billions, the final season of Homeland, all of which drove strong adoption and engagement.  
Our momentum in pay streaming is driven by the combination of compelling content and ubiquitous distribution. On the distribution side, the latest example is the All Access and Showtime streaming bundle we recently began offering through Apple TV+, which follows our recent Amazon renewal.  
We have a lot going on here. And the combination of compelling content in ubiquitous distribution is clearly working, as evidenced by ViacomCBS subscription streaming revenue growth accelerating to 78% in Q3 from Q2's 52%.  
On the free side, Pluto TV continues to build on its position as the #1 fast, free, ad-supported streaming television service in the United States. In the quarter, Pluto TV's domestic MAUs grew 57% to 28.4 million and globally grew to nearly 36 million MAUs. On top of that, Pluto's ad monetization has been growing rapidly, and the trend line is compelling.  
Consider this. After logging its first $1 million ad sales day in 2019, it took Pluto 10 months to log its first $2 million ad sales day. But it just took 1 month after that for Pluto TV to achieve its first $3 million day. While this shouldn't be interpreted as a daily run rate, we are seeing revenue inflection at Pluto TV in a most positive way.  
The trajectory is extremely exciting. And we remain confident that Pluto will meet or exceed its 30 million domestic MAU target by year-end, bolstered by the fact that we continue to add even more high-quality content to the market-leading service. In fact, in the U.S., Pluto now has well over 100,000 hours of compelling content available to consumers.  
We recently added 9 ViacomCBS channels, including Star Trek, Bellator, CBSN Dallas and CSI. And of course, we continue to add a broad range of compelling third-party content. As an example, in October, Narcos began streaming on Pluto TV, marking the first time the series will be widely available to U.S. streaming viewers without a Netflix subscription.  
We also ramped up Pluto's TV's distribution across multiple devices and services, including new distribution agreements with LG and Sony PlayStation, extending Pluto TV reach to well over 100 million additional devices worldwide. What's even more exciting is we're an official launch partner of the highly anticipated PlayStation 5 console debuting in mid-November.  
Outside the U.S., Pluto TV is expanding rapidly and seeing strong adoption as well, especially in Latin America. And last month, we launched Pluto TV in Spain with 40 thematic and uniquely curated channels across multiple genres. In fact, during the first week of launch in Spain, Pluto TV was the #1 downloaded app for Android devices.  
Looking ahead, we plan to bring new local versions of Pluto TV to other priority markets, including Brazil this year and France and Italy in 2021. Importantly, these are all markets where ViacomCBS has strong local operations, including a large pipeline of local language content in place and ready to go.  
The world is quickly embracing fast, which is why Pluto TV's leadership and growth is a key component of our streaming strategy. And remember, as we progressively build out a linked ecosystem, Pluto will also serve as a gateway to and funnel for our pay services. So there was a lot to be excited about for ViacomCBS in Q3 in the streaming space, and I'm even more excited about where we're going.  
Here, I want to touch on a few items. First, consistent with our strategy to maximize our position in assets across both pay and free, in mid-October, we announced the creation of a new consolidated streaming organization. Tom Ryan, the Co-Founder and CEO of Pluto TV, has assumed the role of President and CEO of ViacomCBS Streaming, overseeing Paramount Plus and Pluto TV. In this expanded role, Tom will drive our strategic execution globally as we create a progressively integrated streaming ecosystem across pay and free.  
Tom's entrepreneurial drive, deep knowledge in over-the-top, his focus on the consumer experience and demonstrated ability to work effectively across our company make him ideally suited to lead this next leg of our streaming journey.  
A second item I want to touch on is Paramount Plus, which is on track to debut in early 2021. As you know, Paramount Plus will combine live sports, breaking news and a mountain of entertainment, including exclusive original content plus a diverse and deep library of shows and movies, spanning all programming genres from ViacomCBS's leading brands in one unified service.  
Here, despite the challenges of COVID, our original programming plans continue to advance. And we will have a deep roster of original series that leans heavily on our franchises, including THE OFFER, a scripted limited series that will tell the incredible story behind the making of The Godfather, one of Paramount Picture's most iconic franchises; a new addition of Behind The Music, a truly iconic music series; REAL CRIMINAL MINDS, a true crime docuseries spinning out of CBS' Criminal Minds; KAMP koral, a new original children's series from Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, which we will release after the new SpongeBob movie, SPONGE ON THE RUN, and will be exclusive to Paramount Plus; and we also have new original content, including LIONESS, a new series from the creator of Yellowstone.  
We will, of course, have more original programming to announce as we get closer to launch.  
As we get into '21, we see substantial incremental growth ahead. Our preview launch at the end of July served as a proof of concept, and that gives us the confidence to lean into streaming even more. We're executing a plan which will bring more content, more marketing and more distribution to the table.  
Paramount Plus with its live sports, breaking news and mountain of entertainment, together with Pluto TV in the free space and Showtime OTT in premium, will take ViacomCBS Streaming to a whole new level.  
This is certainly an exciting time for our company, and I'm so glad that Naveen Chopra has joined us for the next leg of our journey. Since early August, he's truly hit the ground running. He's brought a fresh and valuable perspective to ViacomCBS, especially as we gear up for our launch of Paramount Plus early next year.  
With that, I'll hand it over to Naveen to provide his thoughts as well as additional financial detail on the quarter. Naveen?"

I'm excited to be here for my first ViacomCBS earnings call. It has now been 3 months since I joined the company. I was initially drawn to ViacomCBS because of its strong position in the media industry. Having now had some time to listen and learn, I find myself even more bullish about our future and our ability to create long-term value for ViacomCBS shareholders by leveraging the scale of our brands, content and distribution.  
Thus far, ViacomCBS has exceeded my expectations in several respects. The company has moved quickly and effectively to capture synergies from the merger, has successfully found ways to enhance both the financial and strategic value of its traditional media businesses and has an even stronger presence in streaming than people recognize, all of which are demonstrated in our Q3 results.  
I am particularly inspired by the opportunities we have in streaming, where the addressable market is expansive and growing, both domestically and globally. In addition, the value of the users of our largest pay streaming services continues to increase, driven in part by favorable trends in underlying churn and growth in engagement.  
Similarly, in free ad-supported streaming, Pluto TV is not only rapidly growing MAUs and total viewing hours, but it is seeing a significant mix shift to consumption on higher-value connected TV platforms and material growth in monetization with plenty of room to grow in sell-through and CPMs.  
I'm also emboldened by the fact that we have the rare DNA to produce world-class content at scale, including for the streaming generation, from original programming like Billions or Yellowstone to unscripted like MTV's The Challenge; to kids programming like PAW Patrol or SpongeBob; and of course, iconic movie franchises such as Top Gun and The Godfather, ViacomCBS content has proven to be a powerful audience magnet on both our owned and third-party platforms. And I consider this pipeline of content, regardless of where it is distributed, a tremendous asset that we can optimally allocate to support our overall strategy.  
And I share with you that this depth of content production capability is quite rare. Both the content assets themselves and the ability to create them are scarce, valuable, and they are the envy of some of the largest technology and media players in the industry. So while the competitive environment is intense and requires sharp execution to achieve our streaming ambitions, I am encouraged by the progress we have made, and together with industry trends, believe pay and free streaming will yield compelling ROI, consistent with our goal of creating long-term shareholder value.  
Now let me take you through some of the highlights of our third quarter results. Total company revenue was $6.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.1 billion, down 12% year-over-year. And adjusted diluted EPS was $0.91.  
I'll provide some additional details on revenue in a moment. But as you would expect, the year-over-year trend in total company revenue represents significant pandemic-related effects on advertising sales, content licensing and theatrical revenues. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted OIBDA declined driven by lower revenue, somewhat offset by lower costs principally associated with delays in production expense.  
Q3 adjusted free cash flow was very strong at $1.5 billion, largely because production activity remained limited throughout most of the quarter, resulting in a significant working capital benefit. As a reminder, adjusted free cash flow excludes $164 million of payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and costs to achieve synergies.  
Looking more closely at our revenue performance in the quarter. Domestic streaming and digital video revenue grew 56% versus the year ago period to $636 million, owing to significant growth in sign-ups across CBS All Access and Showtime OTT and very strong growth in monthly active users and minutes viewed on Pluto. Domestic subscription streaming revenue grew 78% in Q3, an acceleration from 52% in Q2, driven by the continued momentum we are seeing across our subscription services.  
And on the ad-supported side, digital video advertising revenue also experienced a strong recovery versus Q2. Pluto TV was a key contributor to this recovery. In fact, growth at Pluto TV accelerated materially from Q2 with revenue more than doubling from the year-ago period. In aggregate, our domestic streaming and digital video revenue is now pacing at an annual run rate north of $2.5 billion and growing over 50% year-on-year as of Q3.  
Streaming momentum also benefited affiliate revenue, which grew 10% year-on-year in Q3 versus 2% in Q2. The growth in total company affiliate revenue was driven by growth in streaming subscription revenue and distribution renewals, which included incremental carriage and improved economics. Domestic cable affiliate revenue grew 4% year-over-year in Q3 versus a decline of 6% in Q2 and grew year-on-year even excluding the growth of Showtime OTT.  
In addition, TV entertainment affiliate revenue grew 25% in Q3, an acceleration versus 22% in Q2, driven by strong growth in streaming subscription revenue and retrans feed and reverse comp, which also benefited from renewal activity in the quarter.  
Advertising revenue was down 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued COVID-19 headwinds. However, the Q3 growth rate was a significant improvement relative to the year-over-year decline we experienced in Q2. The improvement in advertising trends has been broad based across broadcast and cable, but we are especially encouraged by the increasing contribution from the inventory included in EyeQ. As a reminder, the EyeQ platform provides advertisers a single transactional point of entry to our digital video content advertising inventory and includes not only digital video advertising revenue from Pluto TV, but full episode inventory from our other ViacomCBS networks.  
The recovery in Q3 also benefited from improvement in scatter pricing, owing to firming marketplace demand. In terms of key categories, pharma remains strong and we've seen improvements in automotive, financial services and retail. And as expected, political spend was very robust in Q3.  
Turning to content licensing. Q3 revenue was down 33% year-over-year, reflecting a lower volume of licensing due to COVID-related production delays and several licensed programs reaching series-end in the year-ago period. As you know, licensing revenue is inherently lumpy as evidenced by the licensing of South Park earlier this year, which contributed a significant amount of revenue and adjusted OIBDA in Q2. So while content licensing will be a part of our strategy going forward, we do not expect to replicate a deal of this size and nature in 2021.  
Theatrical revenue was immaterial in the quarter as most theaters remain closed. But we have found ways to mitigate the near-term loss of theatrical revenue through alternate monetization strategies, including early EST, PVOD and licensing select titles to streaming platforms.  
And finally, publishing revenue increased 29% year-over-year due to strong sales in Q3, including Mary Trump's Too Much and Never Enough and Bob Woodward's Rage.  
On the expense front, we remain focused on reducing our costs. We benefited from merger-related cost synergies in the third quarter and are on track to realize at least $300 million in savings for the full year 2020 and $800 million in annualized run rate merger-related cost synergies by the end of 2022 before consideration of onetime cost to achieve.  
In addition, we are benefiting from COVID-related cost savings, which helped offset some of the COVID impacts of revenue. And a portion of these cost savings are sustainable, while some are timing related and will return as we increase production activity.  
Turning to cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $1.5 billion, equaling $2.9 billion year-to-date, benefiting from a significant working capital tailwind due in large part to temporary production delays. We expect this trend will reverse somewhat in Q4  as we continue to ramp production.  
Regarding the balance sheet. As a result of the financing transactions completed earlier this year and our strong free cash flow, we ended the quarter with over $3 billion of cash on hand and have no debt maturities until 2022. When considering merger-related cost synergies, our gross debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio calculates to 3.4x and 2.9x on a net debt basis.  
Following the quarter, we closed the sale of CNET on October 30, resulting in proceeds of $350 million net of taxes and transaction costs.  
Our cash balance and maturity profile provide operating flexibility and capacity to delever even before factoring future noncore asset sales. We continue to hold a 2.75x long-term leverage target, and we will use our excess capital after streaming investments and dividend payments to pay down debt. We do not currently plan to repurchase any shares.  
I'd now like to share some impacts regarding our expectations for the remainder of the year. First, regarding our domestic streaming and digital video revenue, we anticipate continued momentum as we move closer to the launch of Paramount Plus next year. We expect to end 2020 at an annual run rate north of $2.8 billion in domestic streaming and digital video revenue, powered by strong growth in streaming subs and Pluto TV, MAUs and engagement.  
We continue to prepare for the launch of Paramount Plus by adding content to All Access, rolling out new features like customer profiles and enhanced recommendations and consolidating our marketing efforts to support the launch. As part of this consolidation, in Q4, we will start sunsetting some of our smaller legacy streaming services like MTV Hits, whose content will be incorporated in Paramount Plus. This will create a onetime headwind to streaming subscriber growth in Q4 as we set up for a much larger streaming service longer term. Nonetheless, we now expect to finish the year with at least 19 million domestic streaming subscribers, up from our original guidance of 16 million.  
We continue to expect Pluto TV to finish the year at over 30 million domestic MAUs and expect 40 million when measured on a global basis.  
Looking at affiliate revenue. We expect Q4 to show similar affiliate revenue growth rates to Q3 in both total company affiliate and domestic cable affiliate revenue as the combined strength in pricing, retrans, reverse comp, incremental carriage and subscription streaming revenue more than offsets linear subscriber declines.  
In terms of advertising revenue, we expect another quarter of improving trends driven by strength in political, sports and digital.  
And finally, on free cash flow. In Q4, we expect some reversal of the working capital tailwind as content production spend ramps materially. Nonetheless, for the full year 2020, adjusted free cash flow will still enjoy a material temporary working capital benefit from the delayed timing of production, which will continue to unwind in 2021.  
Looking to 2021. We are encouraged by the growth opportunity ahead for Paramount Plus, Showtime OTT and Pluto TV, and we expect to support this momentum by increasing our investments in streaming. As it relates to adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow, we expect the impacts of additional streaming investment to be partially offset by the benefits of incremental merger-related cost synergies and the Super Bowl on CBS in the first quarter.  
As we look forward, I want to reiterate how happy I am to be here and how excited I am about the growth opportunity we have.  
With that, we can now open the line for questions."

That said, Paramount Plus is going to be live sports, breaking news and a mountain of entertainment. Look at live sports, includes the NFL, the FCC, UEFA, PGA Golf, the NCAA and more. The breaking news side, it will be Live CBS News anytime from CBSN, live local news from CBS stations, key new shows like 60 Minutes and more to be announced. 
And then there's the mountain of entertainment from our flagship brands, which are Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Smithsonian. It really provides us strength in a whole set of key genres: reality, crime procedurals, kids, films and more. It'll appeal across demographics, everything from preschoolers to 50-plus. Of course, it's going to be available on demand but has some live elements. And it's going to have a very strong original slate, many based on franchises that come from across the brands that are represented in the service. 
I'd also point out that the consumer response from our preview launch -- and remember, in late July, we added 3,500 episodes from Viacom brands as well as about 190 Paramount films. That consumer response was strong and really served as proof of concept that's given us the confidence to lean in. The response include growing subscribers and a significant decrease in the average age. The average age of new subs came down by almost 10 years and was more diverse. 
We saw material increase in time spent. That included more than doubling time spent with film and Viacom content becoming a strong double-digit part of overall consumption. 
So no question the product is working. The plan now is to continue to add content. That will be about 10,000 additional hours. Of course, rebrand CBS All Access to Paramount Plus in early '21, and that will be the time when the original slate also has expanded further to encompass the flagship brands. 
The last thing I'd say is the response to us selecting Paramount Plus as the brand has been overwhelmingly positive. So lots to be excited about here around Paramount Plus, and we see substantial incremental growth ahead."

Certainly came in ahead of what we were expecting. And there's a few moving parts in there with the strength in streaming, what you're seeing sort of in the kind of core traditional cable universe. Also, you had a couple of new agreements with YouTube, I think maybe one with another major distributor. Can you help us at all with those different components that contributed to the acceleration? And maybe whether we need to consider any that might not be recurring going forward? 
And then if I could, just real quickly, you talked a bit about cash flow into the coming year. And I'm curious if you can share a little more about how Paramount Plus might impact free cash flow. Like how much of your investment in that business is sort of a repurposing or a shifting of sort of existing run rate? And how much will be incremental?"

So the -- look, I'm really happy with the state of our affiliate business. We clearly had a very strong dynamic in the quarter, and that dynamic was driven both by unit and by rate. 
So if you look at the unit side of the equation, subscriber declines were less than expected from an industry perspective. We saw that, too, in our remits. And we had the benefit of incremental carriage in the form of Viacom networks being added to YouTube TV in July. 
And then on top of that, you overlay rate and the rate story is very strong. We had renewal activity that benefited retrans and reverse comp as well as our premium services. And that's in addition to the built-in escalators we have in all our network deals. 
I'd also remind you that on the reverse comp side, deals are priced in absolute dollars, and therefore, insulated from subscriber declines. So that's effectively another driver of rate. 
And then, of course, as you mentioned, our affiliate growth is also being driven by the strong momentum we have in streaming. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, subscription streaming revenue growth accelerated to 78% in the quarter. 
So you put all that together and we had a very strong affiliate story. And importantly, we expect the growth we experienced in Q3 will continue at a similar rate in Q4. 
And then more broadly, I really like our position. Our product line positions us very well to respond to changing consumer behavior. We have compelling offerings in pay and free streaming apps, plus an industry-leading linear bundle. And we know how to work with a broad range of distribution partners. We know how to get deals done, and we have a legacy of creating mutually beneficial value. So feel great about affiliate. 
On the cash flow side, Naveen?"

In terms of the streaming investment piece, we're not going to provide any specific guidance for '21 at this point. But what I can share is that as we think about the magnitude and the composition of our content investments, we're very focused on thinking about it relative to the growth opportunities we see. 
And what I mean by that is, look, streaming is obviously a big opportunity. It's one where we've got several years of experience and increasing momentum. So it's not a greenfield investment. Remember, our domestic streaming and digital video revenue is growing 50% on an annual run rate of $2.5 billion. So we see that as a really compelling case for investing to continue to support the growth. 
And as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we do intend to do that in 2021. Some of that investment will be funded by the growth itself, and some of it will be funded by incremental cost synergies. And so unlike a pure-play streaming company, I think our content investments have a lot of leverage, meaning that every dollar we spend on content can benefit us across the entire company, from streaming to linear to film and adjacent businesses like consumer products. So we spend a lot of time thinking about how to allocate and reallocate that spend to optimize that leverage across all of those different distribution channels."

And then just a separate topic, but could you touch on the upfront and how it turned out?"
27763231,690968214,2133013,"ViacomCBS Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2020",2020-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Yes. Sure, Jessica.

So first, in terms of the streaming org, probably 3 things that I should highlight. First, as I mentioned in my remarks, we recently created this combined organization under Tom Ryan to enhance our ability to create value from the combined asset base. Now look, in particular, that's really about maximizing the benefit of us operating in both the pay and free space. 
I see that combination of having a range of benefits. It will advantage us in terms of increasing lifetime value, including helping manage SAC and churn. An integrated model also facilitates sharing of tech, data and analytics. And I believe an integrated model will facilitate a more sophisticated approach to windowing across our streaming services. 
The second thing you should know is that as part of this change, Tom Ryan joins our Content Council, and that means he's partnering with our content leadership as they execute on a multi-platform mandate. 
Our brand leads, you know them, Jessica, George Cheeks, Jim Gianopulos, Chris McCarthy, David Nevins, Brian Robbins, they are the best in the business. And they are now aligned with Tom to ensure we put the full weight of our company behind our streaming aspirations. 
I believe that enables a stronger team and allows us also to extract benefits from outside streaming from which to drive streaming, things like traditional reach and our broader IP portfolio, including, importantly, as related to key franchises. And by the way, we're already seeing that benefit in terms of our plans for Paramount Plus and for Pluto TV. 
The last thing you should look, you should look at this really in the context of our overall execution as one ViacomCBS. As you know, Jessica, since day 1 of the merger, I've been focused on harnessing the combined power of this company. And you've seen us move quickly to integrate key functions, both on the commercial and strategic services side to really benefit from that. It's a powerful model. It's already working in many ways, and I believe there's much more to come. 
On the upfront side, look, we doing an upfront -- a virtual upfront, in fact, in the middle of COVID-19, was something no one had ever experienced before, but I'm really happy with where we ended up. I think the team did a phenomenal job really benefiting from our asset base. We were up low single digits on price. And we were very careful with volume, holding back inventory so that we have inventory to sell in scatter. And as you know, Jessica, scatter market today is very robust. We're seeing historically high premiums versus the upfront, higher than pre-COVID, by the way. And we're seeing scatter-to-scatter in broadcast in double digits and then in cable in high singles. So that market is robust. You want to have inventory to play there, we will. 
On the digital side of the upfront, demand was very solid, up versus last year's upfront. It's another reason why I love our position with Pluto. It's a solution -- because if you think about Pluto for a second, it's a solution to our clients' need for high-quality video reach in today's marketplace, and it's a solution to our needs for impressions to drive growth. And when you look at the numbers, it's a solution that's clearly working, and it has room to run. 
So again, a different upfront than any of us have ever experienced, but I feel very good about how we're exiting it. And it is a good base to build on going into '21."

So let me start by saying I couldn't be happier with our decision to acquire Pluto in late 2018. It's an amazing asset, and it's growing even faster than we had hoped, never mind planned, but hoped at the time. 
I mean, look, you heard the metrics today. The momentum is unquestionable in both usage and monetization. If you recall, we closed on that deal in March of '19. And we quickly talked about it being a long-term opportunity of having $1 billion in revenue. I think people thought we were crazy when we said that. But given the growth we've experienced since then, our ambitions have actually grown from there. 
Why? Because as I said, really, in my last answer, it's an amazing thing. It's a solution to the marketplace need for high-quality video reach, and it's a solution to us needing more impressions to sell. It's a great intersection. 
In terms of the category and competitors, look, the category is very strong, but the good news is we have the #1 fast service. So are we feeling any pressure? No, not -- I mean look at the revenue growth rates. Pluto more than doubled in the quarter. And it's -- again, it's got tremendous momentum. 
With respect to your question on Comedy Central and HBO Max, look, our content licensing strategy, I think there's really 2 things to think about here: one is content licensing is an important business; but two is, our strategy is clearly evolving, particularly with Paramount Plus. 
So first, in terms of the content licensing business, we have a tremendous asset base in content, both from a library -- film library of 4,000 titles, TV library of 140,000 episodes, current series production of 750 series globally. We can't keep all that for ourself. It doesn't make sense. It's too much. 
And we do have strong demand from third parties because we are proven hit-makers. And that demand, we can reliably and profitably monetize it, and we do. And remember, the monetization is overwhelming a rental model so the IP does return to us over time for other downstream uses. 
I'd also say that beyond the financial value of licensing, it has strategic value. We can and do use third-party platforms to extend and expand audience, and that also provides downstream benefits to our owned and operated platforms. That could be about early seasons on a third-party platform, driving demand for new seasons or spin-offs on ours, could also be about broader revenues like consumer products. 
All that said, and this is where I want to talk a bit about Comedy Central specifically that you asked, our strategy is clearly evolving in a more O&O, owned- and operated-based direction. And Paramount Plus has already impacted our content licensing decisions. We do have a 2-year view of the original slate for Paramount Plus that leans heavily on franchise, IP from across the company. We made those decisions before we decided what to license. That's IP we're very excited about. You've heard a bit about it, but there's more to come as we get closer to launch. 
In terms of library, which is where your comedy question fits in, we've increasingly moved to a co-exclusive or nonexclusive model to ensure that Paramount Plus also benefits from the product. And again, you look at what is an acquisition driver versus what is an engagement driver. Library product is not acquisition drivers. These, we believe, will be our franchise-linked originals and our original originals. But library product, including some stuff from Comedy Central, is good for engagement. And so we want to have it for our own use. But again, we don't think that detracts from subscriber acquisition for Paramount Plus. 
So again, I feel very good about where we are in content licensing. We have a very thoughtful strategy. We are supporting that business, but we are clearly evolving it, including in a more owned and operated direction as we ramp Paramount Plus. And again, very excited about what '21 is going to bring."

You don't have to watch Paramount Plus to get the NFL.

So look, we're absolutely focused on creating a must-watch service in Paramount Plus. And we do believe that our positioning of live sports, breaking news and a mountain of entertainment is differentiated and compelling. 
Now as part of that, there's no question that franchises will be key to the success of Paramount Plus. And related to that, our strategy is to have new original variants of franchises to serve as subscription drivers. Those originals, in turn, much like my commentary to Alexia's point in a way, will be linked to larger library assets that drive subscriber engagement. So we're very focused on this strategy. And I'd also note that one of our competitors has clearly demonstrated the value of that approach. 
So Star Trek, you mentioned, arguably the original proof of concept for CBS All Access, there are now multiple variants of it on All Access. It works well for us. Sports, which you also mentioned, they're a bit different but clearly powerful. We have UEFA. That is exclusive, and we're very happy we got it. By the way, we're super happy we got it early and now have it for a whole bunch of years going forward. But look, the NFL, the FCC, the golf, even though they're also available on CBS linear, they definitely work for All Access and will definitely work for Paramount Plus. 
In terms of Paramount Plus, we have announced some new entertainment franchises that we're bringing to Plus: The Godfather, SpongeBob, the Criminal Minds spinout. But under the covers, our preview launch showed that there's other franchises that work, too, that have potential, things like MTV's reality show, The Challenge; things like Nick's animated library series, Avatar. And all this is really the tip of the iceberg. And we do have other franchises in the company. So you can safely assume that upcoming announcements will include new original variants of them for Paramount Plus. We will, of course, have some nonfranchise-based new originals to keep things fresh. But I'm not going to get ahead of things and reveal them until we get much closer to launch."

So just wondering how you're thinking about integrating Nick and animation and to make sure you get the most out of that inside of Paramount Plus. 
And then for either you or Naveen, I'm just curious -- maybe Naveen, since from your Amazon days. When you look at how ViacomCBS is executing on like customer acquisition, retention, analytics, across kind of Pluto, Paramount Plus, Showtime, do you think there's opportunities to align those across the 3 services in a more effective way than what's being done today?

So look, the kids -- and it's really the kids and family space, we believe, is fundamentally important to us at Paramount Plus. We obviously believe that bringing the Nick brand and its incredible library of both shows and IP that can continue to go forward is an amazing advantage. 
If you look at the preview launch and what we've done with CBS All Access to date, we have added a bunch of Nickelodeon content. That content is definitely a significant contributor to what I characterized as a strong double-digit share of overall consumption that Viacom network content now represents on CBS All Access. 
As we get into Paramount Plus, we mentioned adding 10,000 additional hours. Certainly, a bunch of that will be from Nick. We mentioned a growing original slate. Certainly, that's coming from Nick. We have mentioned one title that we are putting as new exclusive original on Paramount Plus, that is KAMP KORAL, which is a SpongeBob spinout. That is getting dropped after we exclusively release the SpongeBob, SPONGE ON THE RUN movie in the domestic U.S. market on Paramount Plus. 
So we think kids and family is very important, and we think we have real advantage in terms of content and capabilities here. By the way, we are also -- Naveen, I think mentioned adding features and other things to Paramount Plus. One of the things we're doing there is in the profile area, including setting it up to be a safe kids environment. We believe that's important, particularly for the preschool side of the house, but obviously, older kids as well. So yes, that's important part of the equation. And again, this is another place where ViacomCBS brings a tremendous advantage to the table. And having Brian Robbins, who, as I referenced, is on the Content Council, is working with Tom Ryan, is focused on moving this forward. In fact, he was the advocate for KAMP KORAL debuting on Paramount Plus versus Nickelodeon linear because he believed it was a key part of a franchise play. So he's totally in us making Paramount Plus a success including, of course, in the kids space. Naveen?"

So whether you look at churn, whether you look at SAC, whether you look at engagement, I think that we have great momentum in many of those dimensions. And we're highly focused on continuing to optimize them. 
In particular, the fact that we have the linked ecosystem between subscription in Paramount Plus and Showtime and Pluto TV as a free offering, I think, gives us tremendous opportunities to apply analytics and data and figure out the most optimal way to acquire subscribers and ways to maximize their lifetime, perhaps by moving them between those services, depending on their needs at any given point. 
And I would add to that, that we can layer on top of those different services some really sophisticated analytics, and we'll be able to collect more data than we would have with a single service. So I'm extremely excited about what we can do there. I think there's clearly momentum, but also a lot of opportunity that we can take that to the next level."

Showtime's back up in production in almost all of its series. And even Paramount on the film side, which obviously very location based, is ramping up and expects to be back at full capacity in 2021. And I also mentioned that our originals for Paramount Plus are on track. 
So again, from a production volume standpoint, we really have made extraordinary progress, particularly in the last quarter. And we're currently in very good shape, and that means we're ramping back to a more normal level of content spend. Obviously, that trajectory will continue into '21. 
And look, we'll continue to work to remix it as we have been to optimize our return on investment, pushing towards growth areas, et cetera. But the production side is actually in pretty good shape, again, knock on wood at the moment. Naveen?"

So in relation to the balance sheet and cash, I feel very good about the current state of the balance sheet. As you heard, $3 billion of cash on the balance sheet today. That's before accounting any of the proceeds from CNET or other future noncore asset sales. 
And going forward, we think about 3 financial priorities. We want to be able to support our organic investment, principally in streaming. We want to fund our dividend, and we want to pay down debt. The first 2 are basically funded out of free cash flow. Debt paydown is accomplished through any excess free cash flow and then noncore asset sales. So to the extent we do complete additional transactions in the future, I would expect the proceeds of those to primarily go to debt reduction. So hopefully, that gives you some clarity."

Net adds for the quarter slowed a bit versus the last 2. Was there -- did the consolidation of the legacy D2C platforms impact the quarter? Or was there some pull-forward in maybe 2Q from COVID? And then lastly, where is the distribution most effective? Did the Apple promo that you guys had out there pro forma as expected?"

Simon & Schuster particularly is one that we think has been performing extremely well of late and is a very valuable asset, though still not core for us. And so we do look forward to completing that in the future."

And to your question really on, I would call it, mix of subscriber adds and what's going on with subscribers. Again, Q3, on a pay subscriber growth basis, very strong. Q4, we didn't take the number up as much as we did before. Remember, our year-end target for pay used to be 16 million then. We took it up to 18 million. Now we're taking up to 19 million. 
It is true that in the fourth quarter, as I think Naveen referenced in his remarks, we are doing some sunsetting of smaller services -- service like MTV Hits as we prepare for the relaunch of Paramount Plus in early '21. And we're also kind of focusing on marketing in '21 versus in the fourth quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into the fact that we only raised it to 19 million versus a higher number. We feel very good about our trajectory in '20, and we're super excited about where this thing is going in '21. 
As to your question about kind of mix of ads and Apple TV+ versus others, the good news is we have broad and really ubiquitous distribution. It's one of our, I believe, real advantages in this game. It's partially because we don't have an in-house distribution channel that we favor. And we're really seeing net adds come from a broad range of places, yes, including Apple TV+. But by far, that's not the only place they're coming from. So we feel good about that. 
Look, we're very pleased with our results for this quarter, including the accelerated transformation of our business that you're seeing in less than a year. And despite the challenges of the pandemic, we brought together a single ViacomCBS that does have growing momentum and is creating value on multiple dimensions. You see that in our Q3 metrics, both on the traditional side, and importantly, in streaming, where our momentum is indisputable. And while we're really pleased with Q3, it's what to come that we're really excited about. 
So thank you for your time today. Thank you for your support. And finally, I'd like to thank all ViacomCBS employees for all they do every day to drive our company forward. Stay well, everyone."
