I'd like to welcome everyone to what we expect will be the last full year earnings call for Mylan as a stand-alone company. I'll be covering commentary regarding Mylan's Q4 and full year 2019 performance. Rajiv and Ken will provide additional detail about these results, including an update on pre-integration planning, and we'll end our prepared remarks with commentary from our Chairman, Robert J. Coury. 
However, before we get to results, I'd first like to thank those Mylan employees who may be listening for their continued dedication and commitment to the customers and patients we serve. I would also like to welcome any Upjohn employees listening to the call. 
I want to take a moment to address the very serious matter of the coronavirus. We've been in close contact with our colleagues around the world regarding recent developments and are following government and health organization recommendation. The health and safety of our teams and their families is our priority, and we're supporting those on the ground where possible. 
Our business exposure in China, specifically, is limited. However, given the global nature of our supply chain, operations and businesses, our results could potentially be impacted. The guidance we disclosed today does not include any anticipated impact from coronavirus, however, we will continue monitoring the situation very closely from a business perspective. 
Moving to our results. 2019 was a strong year for Mylan. In the fourth quarter and full year, Mylan's businesses grew across all segments on a constant currency basis. Similar to last quarter, our business transformation work continues to flow through our P&L. As we've previously shared, our transformation work is focused on unlocking latent value within Mylan's organization and delivering economic profit while maintaining our commitment of providing access. 
We started developing this plan in late 2018 and began implementation in earnest late last year. In the fourth quarter, for example, we identified opportunities to further refine our SG&A and R&D spend focusing on products that are promotionally responsive as well as higher value portfolio investments. 
Looking at our full year results. Mylan delivered $11.5 billion in revenue, $1 billion on new product launches and $2.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow and exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.12 at the midpoint. These results highlight the durability and stability of the business we've created, as well as our ability to withstand negative trends impacting the industry. They also reinforce the strength of our diverse portfolio, geographic reach and global, commercial and operational scale, powerful levers that will live on through Viatris. 
Looking ahead to the full year of 2020, today we also announced guidance ranges for total revenues of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion. Although we widened the ranges to take into consideration certain factors, the midpoint of our guidance is in line with what we previously disclosed for 2020 in conjunction with the Upjohn transaction. 
Additionally, as we have previously stated, on a go-forward basis, we believe adjusted EBITDA to be the best measure of our company's underlying operational results and true business performance. We're extremely proud of the efforts of our global workforce that enable us to sustain consistent business performance and profitability across all of our segments. 
While we continue to see unprecedented change in our industry, we believe we are setting a solid foundation to help position Viatris for a strong future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

To begin, I would like to take a moment to thank my Mylan colleagues for a strong 2019 performance. 
As Heather mentioned, this call has a unique [indiscernible] as it represents the last time we expect to report our full year results for Mylan as a stand-alone company. I'm extremely proud of all that we have accomplished together to build a strong global business we have today. It's because of the hard work of our employees that Mylan is well positioned to combine with Upjohn and chart a new course as Viatris. 
I would also like to welcome my Upjohn colleagues who are listening to today's call. 
I could not be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and the meaningful role Viatris will play in the future of health care. Our unparalleled global reach and supply network will enable us to deliver high-quality medicines to more patients around the world. And we will also leverage our platform for development partners to have ready access to expanded markets through our new and unique global healthcare gateway. 
Q1 is quickly approaching, and I'm pleased to report that we remain on track to close in mid-2020. While Pfizer and Upjohn have been working together to ensure that Upjohn is separated as planned, Mylan has been partnering with Pfizer and Upjohn on integration planning with a focus on business continuity for both organizations. 
To build upon Heather's comments regarding business transformation, it's important to understand that our 2020 guidance takes into consideration the company applying an economic profitability lens to how we invest every dollar across the business. Our transformation program is about utilizing a highly disciplined approach to drive strong returns on our investments across all of our businesses. 
We are also looking at our manufacturing network to further optimize the equation of demand, required capacity and efficiency. This program gives us the right mindset and approach to manage the increasingly volatile and dynamic nature of our business. 
Turning to 2019 total revenues, we delivered $11.5 billion, representing 3% growth on a constant currency basis. These results reflect solid underlying business performance, driven by existing products that generated double-digit growth including Creon, Influvac, Dona, Amitiza and Glatiramer Acetate 40 milligram. We also achieved our target of $1 billion in new product launches, driven by Exela, Fulphila and several other new products. 
Our North America business had total net sales of approximately $4.2 billion, which is a 2% increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by $800 million in new product launches, which were partially offset by lower volume, including business transformation-related product rationalization and, to a lesser extent, price erosion in our commodity generics portfolio. 
In Europe, our net sales totaled approximately $4 billion, representing 2% growth on a constant currency basis. Our key brands such as Creon, [indiscernible] and Influvac drove this strong performance. 
In our rest of World segment, net sales totaled approximately $3.2 billion, representing an 8% growth on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily the result of new product launches and increased volumes across the region, including key markets like Japan, Australia and China. 
As we look ahead to 2020, we continue to see growth being driven by the complex products, global key brands and biosimilars, which will help offset continued competitive pressures on our commoditized generics portfolio. 
Overall, we expect another strong year with approximately $600 million in revenue from new product launches, which will help us offset expected mid-single-digit year-over-year price revision. 
Let me now walk you through projected year-over-year net sales growth across our 3 business segments. In our North America business, we expect low single-digit growth, largely driven by Yupelri, Exela, Glatiramer Acetate, Fulphila as well as Ogivri. We are also looking forward to the launch of several new products, including the midyear launch of insulin Glargine. 
We expect our Europe business to grow mid- to high single digits. This is largely driven by our key brands such as Creon, Influvac, Dymista and Brufen. We also continue to see opportunities to expand our biosimilars portfolio, which today includes [indiscernible], Hulio, [indiscernible], Fulphila. Moving 
to the rest of the world. We expect to grow mid-single digits, primarily driven by key brands and biosimilars growth in certain expansion in emerging markets. These drivers will be partially offset by government price cuts in Japan and Australia as well as standards around ARVs. 
I would now like to share some key pipeline updates. Beginning with insulin blocking. As you know, we have been steadfast in our efforts to bring to the market a more affordable insulin for the millions of people living with diabetes around the world. [indiscernible] formulation patents have been formed to be invalid. This was a form on AP. [indiscernible] also showed us on 1 device patent that we have challenged in an IPR proceeding and is before the district court. We expect a decision on the IPR proceedings by second quarter, and we are awaiting the trial just this year. 
Lastly, FDA completed its preapproval inspection of [indiscernible] insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia and issued a Form 483 with 3 observations. Viracon is responding to FDA and are confident in their ability to fully address the observations. We do not believe that the inspection in any way impacts our commercialization plans of insulin glargine in USA. 
Also, our biosimilar to Avastin has been accepted by filing and is under review with the FDA. Our user fee goal date is the summer 27th this year. We also submitted our European application and it's currently in the validation stage with the authorities. 
Lastly, regarding [indiscernible], we remain on track for our U.S. emission in the next quarter. And EYLEA remains under track for submission in early 2021. 
As I mentioned earlier this year, we initiated work on 2 new brand opportunities. Starting with MR 107801, which is being developed as a safe and effective nonnarcotic oral analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain. The drug's novel formulation is being designed to potentially provide an alternative to opioids and a Phase II clinical study is being initiated this year. 
The other product where we initiated development equity is known as MR-106801. It's a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that's being developed as a topical product for treatment of wounds, including barn wounds. Early clinical studies have demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with partial thickness bond wounds. We are preparing to initiate further clinical development this year. 
Finally, we are pleased to update that the pivotal Phase III clinical study of [indiscernible] once a month was started in October 2019. This study is assessing the efficacy, safety, tolerability of [indiscernible] administered once a month in the treatment of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis. To date, the study has been initiated in 19 sites and is actively enrolling patients. We look forward to keeping you informed of these development programs. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

I'll take a few minutes to provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2019. Fourth quarter 2019 total revenues of $3.2 billion were 4% higher than the prior y",1363,"Thanks, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2019. 
Fourth quarter 2019 total revenues of $3.2 billion were 4% higher than the prior year and in line with our expectations. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, constant currency total revenues grew 5%, with growth in all 3 segments. Rest of world net sales grew 9%, followed by Europe and North America, which were up 5% and 3%, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by new product sales, including Wixela, partially offset by a decrease in net sales from existing products, mainly due to lower pricing across the regions. 
From a segment profitability standpoint, North America declined 5% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This decline reflects contributions from new product sales, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing and volumes on existing products due to changes in the competitive environment, in addition to inventory write-offs related to certain product discontinuations. 
Europe segment profitability expanded 4% in the quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of new product sales and higher volumes of existing products, along with the favorable comparison from lower restructuring costs in the quarter. 
Rest of World segment profitability also expanded 4% in the quarter as a result of the favorable impact of new product sales and higher volumes of existing products. These favorable impacts were partially mitigated by lower gross profit on ARV sales resulting from higher API input costs. 
For the quarter, we reported adjusted net earnings of $721 million and adjusted EPS of $1.40, which were both above our internal expectations. The year-over-year increase of 8% in adjusted EPS reflects strong segment performance, and to a lesser extent, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange. 
Now for the full year, total revenues of $11.5 billion were 1% higher than the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, constant currency total revenues grew 3%, with all 3 segments delivering year-over-year growth. 
Consistent with our expectations, new product sales for the year were approximately $1 billion, with approximately $800 million coming from North America, and the remaining amount was balanced between Europe and the rest of world. This growth was partially mitigated by the decrease in net sales from existing products as a result of lower pricing and volumes. 
For 2019, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to 54% in the prior year. Year-over-year, lower gross profit from sales of existing products was essentially offset by gross margins on new product introductions. 
Moving on to full year segment profitability, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring remediation program, North America adjusted segment profitability expanded 3% in the year. This growth reflects contributions from new product sales, partially offset by impacts from lower volumes and to a lesser extent, pricing on existing products, as well as inventory write-offs related to product discontinuations and higher investments in SG&A. 
Primarily due to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation, Europe segment profitability declined 6% and rest of world declined 5%. In addition, both segments reflect the anticipated higher investments in selling and marketing costs, and rest of world segment profitability was further impacted by lower gross profit on ARV sales resulting from the higher API input costs. 
Full year adjusted R&D of $516 million was down 9% compared to 2018 due to the reprioritization of global programs. In 2019, adjusted SG&A increased 4% compared to the full year 2018, reflecting the expected incremental investments in selling and marketing. In addition, the prior year included the favorable impact of reversing certain performance-based incentive accruals. These increases in costs were partially offset by benefits from restructuring activities, as well as business transformation initiatives. 
We reported adjusted net earnings of $2.28 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.42 for the full year, which was above the high end of our most recent guidance. Excluding the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange, full year adjusted EPS was flat to 2018. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the year was exactly in line with our expectations at $2.1 billion, including the planned investment of more than $600 million in net working capital that was required to support the approximately $1 billion of new product launches that we've talked about. Ongoing working capital velocity initiatives and lower capital expenditures, partially offset these investments. 
During 2019, we delivered on our commitment to repay $1.1 billion of debt, bringing our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio down to 3.6x at the end of the fourth quarter, which is in compliance with our covenant requirements and reflects our continuing commitment to our investment-grade credit rating. 
 
Now moving on to 2020. At a high level for Mylan stand-alone, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 4% at the midpoint versus full year 2019. 
As Heather mentioned, going forward, we're no longer providing adjusted EPS guidance as we believe adjusted EBITDA better reflects how we manage and measure the performance of the business. We 
expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion. It's important to note that there are no material changes in our underlying Mylan stand-alone business assumptions compared to the Mylan financial targets that were provided in July 2019 when we announced the Upjohn transaction. Our current expectations do reflect the impact of foreign exchange headwinds experienced as we move through 2019, which resulted in the $250 million reduction in the revenue midpoint and the $50 million reduction in the EBITDA midpoint. A schedule reconciling these numbers is included in the press release. 
As you heard from Rajiv in our top line outlook, we expect positive volume growth, along with the contributions from new product launches to more than offset competitive market dynamics. 
Moving to adjusted EBITDA, we're expecting a positive contribution from sales growth, driven by volume from existing products and new product launches, partially offset by pricing in addition to higher SG&A spending to support those top line expectations and higher R&D investments to focus on our complex product pipeline, which will support the long-term health of our business. 
Moving to capital deployment. On a stand-alone basis, our priority remains deleveraging. We intend to repay approximately $1 billion of debt in 2020 on consistent adjusted free cash flow generation. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage as we work towards our standalone long-term average debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x. 
Finally, we anticipate lower interest expense, reflecting the $1.1 billion of debt repayments we made in 2019 as well as the incremental debt repayments we expect to make in 2020. In addition, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19%, and we expect a diluted share count of between $516 million and 520 million shares. 
Before I close, a quick comment on calendarization as you think about modeling the year. We expect total revenues and adjusted EBITDA quarterly phasing to be very consistent with 2019, with Q1 being the lowest quarter and sequentially increasing as we move through the year. First quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA represented approximately 20% of full year adjusted EBITDA. We expect the same in 2020. 
In addition, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the first half of 2020 to be slightly higher than the second half due primarily to the calendarization of revenues. 
Similar to 2019, first quarter 2020 adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be the lightest quarter of the year as we invest in the working capital required to support new product launches. But as Rajiv noted, new product launch revenues in 2020 are expected to be approximately $600 million or $400 million lower than 2019. Therefore, we expect a lower front end net working capital investment, which will ultimately put less pressure on first quarter free cash flow. With 
that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mylan's Chairman, Robert Coury. Rob?"

Good afternoon, everyone. To echo the comments of our management team, I, too, would like to personally thank our dedicated Mylan colleagues for their continued outstanding execution and commitment, and to once again welcome the Upjohn colleagues as well, who will be partnering with us as we transition into Viatris in the near future. 
I would also like to share how much our hearts go out to those impacted in China and across the world, in light of the current coronavirus situation. We will continue to do all that we can do to help mitigate this serious health issue. As for the potential company impact, and as Heather has mentioned, we, like others, are closely monitoring the situation, though it is too early to predict any commercial impact to our operations around the globe. 
I am pleased to share that we have already achieved numerous milestones on our path to creating Viatris, the combination of Mylan and Upjohn, a new champion for global health. As you saw this morning in our press release, we have now announced the remaining members of the Viatris Board of Directors. With these appointments at the Viatris board level, we have assembled a world-class Board of Directors with extensive experience, knowledge and strategic vision to help guide the company and to unlock greater shareholder value. 
In addition, this morning, we announced Upjohn's CFO, Sanjiv Narula, who will become Viatris' CFO and will join Michael and Rajiv on the management team. Sanjiv brings exactly the right profile, given where the new company will be in its first business life cycle upon closing. I've had the privilege to spend a great deal of time directly with Sanjiv over the past several months. His strength in operations and his understanding of the pharmaceutical industry as well as Upjohn will prove to be invaluable. His deep-rooted experience at Pfizer, which includes significant accomplishments in the process optimization and automation, capital allocation, internal and external reporting makes him the right fit to help ensure Viatris delivers on its opportunities and commitment to creating shareholder value. 
Additionally, his significant knowledge of Pfizer and Upjohn will be extremely instrumental as we continue to integrate our 2 companies and manage the numerous business-critical transition service agreements we will have with Pfizer in the early years of Viatris. We are fortunate to add him to the seasoned management team. 
In other milestones, we have received regulatory approvals in certain key regions, including approval from the state administration for market regulation in China. And we recently set the extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders to be held on April 27. In short, we continue to progress every day and remain on track to close the transaction in mid-2020. 
Our goal remains to build a new and even more robust and integrated global health care platform, one that will be balanced between returning capital to shareholders and investing more in innovative segments of the industry's value chain, while maintaining our core commitment to improving patient access to medicines around the world. With this as our focus, and together with strong and consistent execution and delivering results, I continue to be very excited about the incredible value creation opportunity we expect for shareholders as a result of this combination. 
To be clear, Viatris will not be a Mylan 2.0. This is Viatris 1.0, which will benefit from the many additional opportunities not present within either Mylan or Upjohn on a stand-alone basis. 
As we continue to progress towards closing and the years beyond, I have been well aware of all of your continued interest and receiving more clarity on what are the -- what actually is the starting baseline financial targets for Viatris' first full year of operations in 2021. As I shared in the last quarter conference call and at the JPMorgan conference, I believe I have been very consistent in my focus for Viatris in 2021, its first full year of operations. We expect that the formal guidance will be delivered to you by Viatris' new management team, led by Michael, Rajiv and Sanjiv at the close and at the appropriate time after the transaction closes. 
You can expect that the management team will, of course, be taken into consideration. All the known as well as potentially anticipated headwinds, whether it's the changes in China's health care system, which some are calling the China reset, the upcoming Lyrica and Celebrex loss of exclusivity in Japan and any other what-ifs at that time. Simply put, you should expect that the Viatris management team to deliver a 2021 baseline, representing a trough year from which the company can grow from. 
Looking ahead beyond that, Viatris will be creating a new global and unique global health care gateway, which will offer many other biotech and spec pharma companies ready access to markets around the globe by leveraging our true one-of-a-kind global infrastructure, making Viatris the true partner of choice for players often facing challenges and utilizing multiple, local or regional partners. 
We envision Viatris' unique global health care gateway department to leverage our already existing enhanced scientific successes to date with our own research and development capabilities, as well as those future opportunities we expect to realize from the Viatris global health care gateway, partnering opportunities to more rapidly broaden our own product portfolio and future pipeline, including new business models to once again give the street confidence in Viatris' ability to grow. 
These are just a few of the additional growth opportunities not present within, again, either Mylan or Upjohn on a stand-alone basis. 
I would like to conclude by sharing what I mentioned at the JPMorgan conference last month. We believe that Viatris, with its new and unique profile, will be recognized for being at the forefront of establishing a new kind of global pharmaceutical player designed for where the health care industry is going, not where it has been. And I am extremely excited about the opportunities ahead for the company and the value opportunities that Viatris can create for its patients, employees, customers, shareholders and all stakeholders. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to start the Q&A session.  Thank you."

This is our opportunity to reset. And we, at the board level, want to absolutely make sure that management's starting point has the best chance not just to meet but even to exceed.

And I really think, directionally, you have been doing a really good job in telegraph it. I think the trajectory of where Viatris will -- where it will be situated when it starts and the opportunities going forward. So I do appreciate the opportunity for me to embellish. I do think that the -- there will be opportunities for revenue, the starting point of revenue. I think that whatever that starting point of revenue is, some of you have directionally already picked up that the EBITDA, we have many levers to, I think, maintain a strong EBITDA base. We do intend on resetting the revenue base. 
And I do believe that there will be an opportunity to grow. I expect that management, I would like at the very minimum, for them to be able to provide a 3- to 5-year CAGR, both on top line and on EBITDA. And I think that we'll be able to deliver that in terms of what the trough year is over the 3- to 5-year time frame. 
And then, I do believe, again something I think you've been out in front. This creation of this new global health care gateway, I have to tell you, this has been in the works since 2016 for us. And the only reason why we didn't announce this before, I mean, obviously, if you saw what we were tied up with in 2016 with the whole EpiPen situation, and I think the street really, really missed the opportunity in 2018 because we were drowned out by all the noise, but it was the best year of science in Mylan's almost 60-year history. And as you could see, not only did we -- not only did we build a robust pipeline, but even some of the commentary that Rajiv made today, the 3 opportunities that we have in our pipeline. The reason why we couldn't actually announced the global health care gateway that has been underway since 2016 is because without the Upjohn business and without really having critical mass in China, you really can't make that claim. We were simply dabbling in China, but Upjohn gave us the critical mass. So we will be building out an official department that will actually be in charge. It will be -- that department will be led by the new CEO, Michael Gettler. He will be driving that global health care gateway. And I believe that all future capital allocation and all the disciplines that need to be around future capital allocations, will be within that global health care gateway. You can fully expect that our internal R&D business development will be in very, very much competition of capital going forward against continuing debt repayment or share buyback or any other opportunities that we would have. But I do think that we have a number of levers, and I'm really excited once we get to close this and really establish the Department of the Global Health Care Gateway. I do think that we will be recognized as a partner of choice and represent a real unique opportunity to bring ready access to other spec pharma companies to bring their products around the globe."

I think you, Randall, Chris, there's been several other analysts that I think have now been trying to understand 2021, and I want to make sure it's a trough year. That's why I think we need to go out to 2022. And we don't want to say it's a trough year and then set the numbers in a way where there's another step down.

Many of the drivers within that are -- we're starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation initiatives. But I would also point out, just like we pointed it out for 2019 as well as 2018, that we continue to work on working capital velocity improvement initiatives. We've reduced our days working capital by probably 6 or 7 days over the last couple of years. Each day is about $40 million to Mylan. And so you can imagine, each day that we're able to organize the business around reducing that working capital requirement gives us another dollar, or in this case, $40 million per day to invest in their business and redeploy the capital appropriately. So the simple answer is effectively the same cash generation in 2020, supporting the new product launches, but always focusing heavily on working capital improvements."

Are you factoring that in? Is that one of the arguments for broadening the range of EBITDA? 
And second, on biosimilars. Rajiv, if I look at the biosimilar adoptions of late engine products, they actually look quite low for all the companies that enter kind of like second wave. You have a couple of products which are entering second wave or supply coming online after the market have already formed. Is your impression that biosimilar markets, you can catch up?

So over the last 3, 4 years, looking into the volatility of supply from China we focused on delisting their supply and create alternatives. So even kind of -- what I will tell you, still a couple of intermediates, we still rely heavily in China. But so far, we are not seeing a issue from the pricing point of view.

Now coming to the biosimilars, you're right. But here I would like Tony to add up if he wants to add up anything.

We launched ahead and you [indiscernible] caught up pretty well. So -- and now, and but it does take time just by the -- because of the unique nature of this business and the channel.

B",298,"And David, I think you actually have a really good question at a high level. And I think you're spot on in the natural progression, especially started in Europe, where you had brand, which they call ethical drugs and then brand generic and then generic. But what I -- and so we've discovered this and have been operating in that environment, with all 3. And of course, we also discover the importance of OTC, which we added that on. Because each one of these markets, David, are actually driven by a different priority scheme. Some markets are actually driven by generics. Some markets are actually still driven by brand, and most markets accept brand generics. And believe it or not, OTC has its advantages just because of the relationship that the OTC rep has with pharmacies, it's a little bit different than when you're regulated, both either in the brand or the generics. So I will tell you, in Europe, there's actually still quite a bit of, especially Central and Eastern Europe, I wouldn't say that generics has taken the kind of hold yet that we believe that it will eventually take. But it's that learning that we have and what we've lived in Europe. Where I think you're insightful is that when you think about what Upjohn's bringing to the table, they have yet to experience, quite frankly, what it's like to go from a brand, maybe brand generics, but certainly not generic. So I think the skill set that we're going to be bringing them to the emerging market opportunities that we have, I think that will be one of the upside synergy values that I expect that we're going to gain when we bring the 2 organizations together. Rajiv, do you want to add something?"

Look, I think I'll start just also and take you back to the fact that you'll see in the press release that we've included some discussion that's not in any way intended to be a new discussion. But for the last 12 to 18 months, we've been talking about the fact that we're really looking at the right -- trying to find the right measure that we can talk to you about, about -- that is consistent with how we talk about the business internally. And that's why we're moving to an EBITDA measure, and it gives you some of the background for that. 
In doing so, what I also want to point out is that comes out a lot of the transformation work that we've been doing over the last year plus. And when I give you a little bit of color about that transformation work, it will help you to understand why we're maybe not giving as much specificity around gross margins versus SG&A rates, because in that transformation work, we're really looking at economic profit on each one of our products in all the segments and all the businesses in all the markets around the world. And in doing so, as you can imagine, each product has a different gross margin profile. Depending on the nature, you just heard the discussion on the previous question around how the product is either marketed or represented or how much support it has to have for it, whether it be from a salesperson or from a tendering process, it may have a different SG&A rate. But what we're really trying to look at is we're trying to look at the bottom line operating margin, EBITDA profitability on each one of these products. 
Now that said, I will tell you that we don't anticipate significant movements in our gross margin rate from 2019 to 2020, or significant movements in our SG&A rate from 2019 to 2020. But we want to transition and help you transition to thinking about the business the way that we think about it, which is bottom line operating profitability on each one of the products that are in our portfolio, because that's how we're making decisions around the business today."

I would only simply ask for your patience, because we are dealing within a highly complex integration. I'd just like to remind you that Pfizer was right in the midst of separating this business. They were probably only about 25% or 30% into their separation, and -- when Mylan came along. So when you're doing a transaction like this, it's not a typical merger. This is a reverse Moore's trust, where you do have 3 parties here. So there is the amount of work that is being done and why it's taking a little bit longer than maybe a typical transaction. It's extensive. And I can't even begin to tell you, daily, weekly, weekends, the amount of time that people are putting in to make sure that we are in a readiness mode from day 1. 
Now with that said, I will tell you that if you'll just be patient, we will have Michael Sanjiv and Rajiv, get around to shareholders more for -- not for really anything else but a meet and greet. I would say, a get to know. Anxious to have them meet together with all the analysts, with some of the shareholders. I think that would be proper especially even before they come and even give the guidance so that you kind of get to know the individuals. I think we have a really good team. 
I have to tell you, it's taken some time to really pull together and coalesce this management team. They are tight. They are aligned. I think that they get stronger by the day, by the week. And again, I just ask, I want to acknowledge your desire, but I would ask for your patience, and we will get around to you as quickly as we possibly can. Thank you."

Rajiv and Ken will provide additional detail about these results, including an update on pre-integration planning, and we'll end our prepared remarks with commentary from our Chairman, Robert J. Coury. 
However, before we get to results, I'd first like to thank those Mylan employees who may be listening for their continued dedication and commitment to the customers and patients we serve. I would also like to welcome any Upjohn employees listening to the call. 
I want to take a moment to address the very serious matter of the coronavirus. We've been in close contact with our colleagues around the world regarding recent developments and are following government and health organization recommendation. The health and safety of our teams and their families is our priority, and we're supporting those on the ground where possible. 
Our business exposure in China, specifically, is limited. However, given the global nature of our supply chain, operations and businesses, our results could potentially be impacted. The guidance we disclose today does not include any anticipated impact from coronavirus, however, we will continue monitoring the situation very closely from a business perspective. 
Moving to our results. 2019 was a strong year for Mylan. In the fourth quarter and full year, Mylan's businesses grew across all segments on a constant currency basis. Similar to last quarter, our business transformation work continues to flow through our P&L. As we've previously shared, our transformation work is focused on unlocking latent value within Mylan's organization and delivering economic profit while maintaining our commitment of providing access. 
We started developing this plan in late 2018 and began implementation in earnest late last year. In the fourth quarter, for example, we identified opportunities to further refine our SG&A and R&D spend, focusing on products that are promotionally responsive as well as higher value portfolio investments. 
Looking at our full year results. Mylan delivered $11.5 billion in revenue, $1 billion on new product launches and $2.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow and exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.12 at the midpoint. These results highlight the durability and stability of the business we've created, as well as our ability to withstand negative trends impacting the industry. They also reinforce the strength of our diverse portfolio, geographic reach and global, commercial and operational scale, powerful levers that will live on through Viatris. 
Looking ahead to the full year of 2020, today we also announced guidance ranges for total revenues of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion. Although we widened the ranges to take into consideration certain factors, the midpoint of our guidance is in line with what we previously disclosed for 2020 in conjunction with the Upjohn transaction. 
Additionally, as we have previously stated, on a go-forward basis, we believe adjusted EBITDA to be the best measure of our company's underlying operational results and true business performance. We're extremely proud of the efforts of our global workforce that enable us to sustain consistent business performance and profitability across all of our segments. 
While we continue to see unprecedented change in our industry, we believe we are setting a solid foundation to help position Viatris for a strong future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

To begin, I would like to take a moment to thank my Mylan colleagues for a strong 2019 performance. 
As Heather mentioned, this call has a unique [indiscernible] as it represents the last time we expect to report our full year results for Mylan as a stand-alone company. I'm extremely proud of all that we have accomplished together to build a strong global business we have today. It's because of the hard work of our employees that Mylan is well positioned to combine with Upjohn and chart a new course as Viatris. 
I would also like to welcome my Upjohn colleagues who are listening to today's call. 
I could not be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and the meaningful role Viatris will play in the future of health care. Our unparalleled global reach and supply network will enable us to deliver high-quality medicines to more patients around the world. And we will also leverage our platform for development partners to have ready access to expanded markets through our new and unique Global Healthcare Gateway. 
Year 1 is quickly approaching, and I'm pleased to report that we remain on track to close in mid-2020. While Pfizer and Upjohn have been working together to ensure that Upjohn is separated as planned, Mylan has been partnering with Pfizer and Upjohn on integration planning with a focus on business continuity for both organizations. 
To build upon Heather's comments regarding business transformation, it's important to understand that our 2020 guidance takes into consideration the company applying an economic profitability lens to how we invest every dollar across the business. Our transformation program is about utilizing a highly disciplined approach to drive strong returns on our investments across all of our businesses. 
We are also looking at our manufacturing network to further optimize the equation of demand, required capacity and efficiency. This program gives us the right mindset and approach to manage the increasingly volatile and dynamic nature of our business. 
Turning to 2019 total revenues, we delivered $11.5 billion, representing 3% growth on a constant currency basis. These results reflect solid underlying business performance, driven by existing products that generated double-digit growth, including Creon, Influvac, Dona, Amitiza and glatiramer acetate 40 milligram. We also achieved our target of $1 billion in new product launches, driven by Wixela, Fulphila and several other new products. 
Our North America business had total net sales of approximately $4.2 billion, which is a 2% increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by $800 million in new product launches, which were partially offset by lower volume, including business transformation-related product rationalization and, to a lesser extent, price erosion in our commodity generics portfolio.
In Europe, our net sales totaled approximately $4 billion, representing 2% growth on a constant currency basis. Our key brands such as Creon, Dymista and Influvac drove this strong performance. 
In our Rest of World segment, net sales totaled approximately $3.2 billion, representing an 8% growth on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily the result of new product launches and increased volumes across the region, including key markets like Japan, Australia and China. 
As we look ahead to 2020, we continue to see growth being driven by the complex products, global key brands and biosimilars, which will help offset continued competitive pressures on our commoditized generics portfolio. 
Overall, we expect another strong year with approximately $600 million in revenue from new product launches, which will help us offset expected mid-single-digit year-over-year price erosion. 
Let me now walk you through projected year-over-year net sales growth across our 3 business segments. In our North America business, we expect low single-digit growth, largely driven by Yupelri, Exela, glatiramer acetate, Fulphila as well as Ogivri. We are also looking forward to the launch of several new products, including the midyear launch of insulin glargine. 
We expect our Europe business to grow mid- to high-single digits. This is largely driven by our key brands such as Creon, Influvac, Dymista and Brufen. We also continue to see opportunities to expand our biosimilars portfolio, which today includes Ogivri, Hulio as well as Fulphila. 
Moving to the rest of the world. We expect to grow mid-single digits, primarily driven by key brands and biosimilars growth in certain expansion in emerging markets. These drivers will be partially offset by government price cuts in Japan and Australia as well as standards around ARVs. 
I would now like to share some key pipeline updates. Beginning with insulin blocking, as you know, we have been steadfast in our efforts to bring to the market a more affordable insulin for the millions of people living with diabetes around the world. Sanofi's formulation patents have been formed to be invalid. This was affirmed on [indiscernible]. Sanofi has also sued us on 1 device patent that we have challenged in an IPR proceeding and is before the district court. We expect a decision on the IPR proceedings by second quarter, and we are awaiting the trial decision. 
Lastly, FDA completed its pre-approval inspection of Biocon's insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia and issued a Form 483 with 3 observations. Biocon is responding to FDA and are confident in their ability to fully address the observations. We do not believe that the inspection in any way impacts our commercialization plans of insulin glargine in USA. 
Also, our biosimilar to Avastin has been accepted for filing and is under review with the FDA. Our user fee goal date is December 27 this year. We also submitted our European application and it's currently in the validation stage with the authorities. 
Lastly, regarding [indiscernible], we remain on track for our U.S. emission in the next quarter. And EYLEA remains on the track for submission in early 2021. 
As I mentioned earlier this year, we initiated work on 2 new brand opportunities. Starting with [ EMA 107801 ], which is being developed as a safe and effective non-narcotic oral analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain. The drug's novel formulation is being designed to potentially provide an alternative to opioids and a Phase II clinical study is being initiated this year. 
The other product where we initiated development equity is known as [ EMA 106801 ]. It's a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that's being developed as a topical product for treatment of wounds, including burn wounds. Early clinical studies have demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with partial-thickness burn wounds. We are preparing to initiate further clinical development this year. 
Finally, we are pleased to update that the pivotal Phase III clinical study of glatiramer acetate once a month was started in October 2019. This study is assessing the efficacy, safety, tolerability of glatiramer acetate administered once a month in the treatment of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis. To date, the study has been initiated in 19 sites and is actively enrolling patients. We look forward to keeping you informed of these development programs. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

I'll take a few minutes to provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2019. Fourth quarter 2019 total revenues of $3.2 billion were 4% higher than the prior y",1364,"Thanks, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2019. 
Fourth quarter 2019 total revenues of $3.2 billion were 4% higher than the prior year and in line with our expectations. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, constant currency total revenues grew 5%, with growth in all 3 segments. Rest of World net sales grew 9%, followed by Europe and North America, which were up 5% and 3%, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by new product sales, including Wixela, partially offset by a decrease in net sales from existing products, mainly due to lower pricing across the regions. 
From a segment profitability standpoint, North America declined 5% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This decline reflects contributions from new product sales, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing and volumes on existing products due to changes in the competitive environment, in addition to inventory write-offs related to certain product discontinuations. 
Europe segment profitability expanded 4% in the quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of new product sales and higher volumes of existing products, along with the favorable comparison from lower restructuring costs in the quarter. 
Rest of World segment profitability also expanded 4% in the quarter as a result of the favorable impact of new product sales and higher volumes of existing products. These favorable impacts were partially mitigated by lower gross profit on ARV sales resulting from higher API input costs. 
For the quarter, we reported adjusted net earnings of $721 million and adjusted EPS of $1.40, which were both above our internal expectations. The year-over-year increase of 8% in adjusted EPS reflects strong segment performance, and to a lesser extent, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange. 
Now for the full year, total revenues of $11.5 billion were 1% higher than the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, constant currency total revenues grew 3%, with all 3 segments delivering year-over-year growth. 
Consistent with our expectations, new product sales for the year were approximately $1 billion, with approximately $800 million coming from North America, and the remaining amount was balanced between Europe and the rest of world. This growth was partially mitigated by the decrease in net sales from existing products as a result of lower pricing and volumes. 
For 2019, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to 54% in the prior year. Year-over-year, lower gross profit from sales of existing products was essentially offset by gross margins on new product introductions. 
Moving on to full year segment profitability, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program, North America adjusted segment profitability expanded 3% in the year. This growth reflects contributions from new product sales, partially offset by impacts from lower volumes and, to a lesser extent, pricing on existing products, as well as inventory write-offs related to product discontinuations and higher investments in SG&A. 
Primarily due to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation, Europe segment profitability declined 6% and Rest of World declined 5%. In addition, both segments reflect the anticipated higher investments in selling and marketing costs, and Rest of World segment profitability was further impacted by lower gross profit on ARV sales resulting from the higher API input costs. 
Full year adjusted R&D of $516 million was down 9% compared to 2018 due to the reprioritization of global programs. In 2019, adjusted SG&A increased 4% compared to the full year 2018, reflecting the expected incremental investments in selling and marketing. In addition, the prior year included the favorable impact of reversing certain performance-based incentive accruals. These increases in costs were partially offset by benefits from restructuring activities as well as business transformation initiatives. 
We reported adjusted net earnings of $2.28 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.42 for the full year, which was above the high end of our most recent guidance. Excluding the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange, full year adjusted EPS was flat to 2018. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the year was exactly in line with our expectations at $2.1 billion, including the planned investment of more than $600 million in net working capital that was required to support the approximately $1 billion of new product launches that we've talked about. Ongoing working capital velocity initiatives and lower capital expenditures partially offset these investments. 
During 2019, we delivered on our commitment to repay $1.1 billion of debt, bringing our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio down to 3.6x at the end of the fourth quarter, which is in compliance with our covenant requirements and reflects our continuing commitment to our investment-grade credit rating.  
Now moving on to 2020. At a high level for Mylan stand-alone, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 4% at the midpoint versus full year 2019. 
As Heather mentioned, going forward, we're no longer providing adjusted EPS guidance as we believe adjusted EBITDA better reflects how we manage and measure the performance of the business. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion. It's important to note that there are no material changes in our underlying Mylan stand-alone business assumptions compared to the Mylan financial targets that were provided in July 2019 when we announced the Upjohn transaction. Our current expectations do reflect the impact of foreign exchange headwinds experienced as we move through 2019, which resulted in the $250 million reduction in the revenue midpoint and the $50 million reduction in the EBITDA midpoint. A schedule reconciling these numbers is included in the press release. 
As you heard from Rajiv in our top line outlook, we expect positive volume growth, along with the contributions from new product launches to more than offset competitive market dynamics.
Moving to adjusted EBITDA, we're expecting a positive contribution from sales growth, driven by volume from existing products and new product launches, partially offset by pricing, in addition to higher SG&A spending to support those top line expectations and higher R&D investments to focus on our complex product pipeline, which will support the long-term health of our business. 
Moving to capital deployment. On a stand-alone basis, our priority remains deleveraging. We intend to repay approximately $1 billion of debt in 2020 on consistent adjusted free cash flow generation. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage as we work towards our standalone long-term average debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x. 
Finally, we anticipate lower interest expense, reflecting the $1.1 billion of debt repayments we made in 2019 as well as the incremental debt repayments we expect to make in 2020. In addition, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19%, and we expect a diluted share count of between $516 million and 520 million shares. 
Before I close, a quick comment on calendarization as you think about modeling the year. We expect total revenues and adjusted EBITDA quarterly phasing to be very consistent with 2019, with Q1 being the lowest quarter and sequentially increasing as we move through the year. First quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA represented approximately 20% of full year adjusted EBITDA. We expect the same in 2020. 
In addition, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the first half of 2020 to be slightly higher than the second half due primarily to the calendarization of revenues. 
Similar to 2019, first quarter 2020 adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be the lightest quarter of the year as we invest in the working capital required to support new product launches. But as Rajiv noted, new product launch revenues in 2020 are expected to be approximately $600 million or $400 million lower than 2019. Therefore, we expect a lower front end net working capital investment, which will ultimately put less pressure on first quarter free cash flow. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mylan's Chairman, Robert Coury. Rob?"

Good afternoon, everyone. To echo the comments of our management team, I, too, would like to personally thank our dedicated Mylan colleagues for their continued outstanding execution and commitment, and to once again welcome the Upjohn colleagues as well, who will be partnering with us as we transition into Viatris in the near future. 
I would also like to share how much our hearts go out to those impacted in China and across the world, in light of the current coronavirus situation. We will continue to do all that we can do to help mitigate this serious health issue. As for the potential company impact, and as Heather has mentioned, we, like others, are closely monitoring the situation, though it is too early to predict any commercial impact to our operations around the globe. 
I am pleased to share that we have already achieved numerous milestones on our path to creating Viatris, the combination of Mylan and Upjohn, a new champion for global health. As you saw this morning in our press release, we have now announced the remaining members of the Viatris Board of Directors. With these appointments at the Viatris board level, we have assembled a world-class Board of Directors with extensive experience, knowledge and strategic vision to help guide the company and to unlock greater shareholder value. 
In addition, this morning, we announced Upjohn's CFO, Sanjiv Narula, who will become Viatris' CFO and will join Michael and Rajiv on the management team. Sanjiv brings exactly the right profile, given where the new company will be in its first business life cycle upon closing. I've had the privilege to spend a great deal of time directly with Sanjiv over the past several months. His strength in operations and his understanding of the pharmaceutical industry as well as Upjohn will prove to be invaluable. His deep-rooted experience at Pfizer, which includes significant accomplishments in the process optimization and automation, capital allocation, internal and external reporting makes him the right fit to help ensure Viatris delivers on its opportunities and commitment to creating shareholder value. 
Additionally, his significant knowledge of Pfizer and Upjohn will be extremely instrumental as we continue to integrate our 2 companies and manage the numerous business-critical transition service agreements we will have with Pfizer in the early years of Viatris. We are fortunate to add him to the seasoned management team. 
In other milestones, we have received regulatory approvals in certain key regions, including approval from the state administration for market regulation in China. And we recently set the extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders to be held on April 27. In short, we continue to progress every day and remain on track to close the transaction in mid-2020. 
Our goal remains to build a new and even more robust and integrated global health care platform, one that will be balanced between returning capital to shareholders and investing more in innovative segments of the industry's value chain, while maintaining our core commitment to improving patient access to medicines around the world. 
With this as our focus, and together with strong and consistent execution and delivering results, I continue to be very excited about the incredible value creation opportunity we expect for shareholders as a result of this combination.
To be clear, Viatris will not be a Mylan 2.0. This is Viatris 1.0, which will benefit from the many additional opportunities not present within either Mylan or Upjohn on a stand-alone basis. 
As we continue to progress towards closing and the years beyond, I have been well aware of all of your continued interest and receiving more clarity on what are the -- what actually is the starting baseline financial targets for Viatris' first full year of operations in 2021. As I shared in the last quarter conference call and at the JPMorgan conference, I believe I have been very consistent in my focus for Viatris in 2021, its first full year of operations. We expect that the formal guidance will be delivered to you by Viatris' new management team, led by Michael, Rajiv and Sanjiv at the close and at the appropriate time after the transaction closes. 
You can expect that the management team will, of course, be taken into consideration. All the known as well as potentially anticipated headwinds, whether it's the changes in China's health care system, which some are calling the China reset, the upcoming Lyrica and Celebrex loss of exclusivity in Japan and any other what-ifs at that time. Simply put, you should expect that the Viatris management team to deliver a 2021 baseline, representing a trough year from which the company can grow from. 
Looking ahead beyond that, Viatris will be creating a new global and unique Global Healthcare Gateway, which will offer many other biotech and spec pharma companies ready access to markets around the globe by leveraging our true one-of-a-kind global infrastructure, making Viatris the true partner of choice for players often facing challenges and utilizing multiple, local or regional partners. 
We envision Viatris' unique Global Healthcare Gateway department to leverage our already existing enhanced scientific successes to date with our own research and development capabilities, as well as those future opportunities we expect to realize from the Viatris' Global Healthcare Gateway, partnering opportunities to more rapidly broaden our own product portfolio and future pipeline, including new business models to once again give the street confidence in Viatris' ability to grow. 
These are just a few of the additional growth opportunities not present within, again, either Mylan or Upjohn on a stand-alone basis. 
I would like to conclude by sharing what I mentioned at the JPMorgan conference last month. We believe that Viatris, with its new and unique profile, will be recognized for being at the forefront of establishing a new kind of global pharmaceutical player designed for where the health care industry is going, not where it has been. And I am extremely excited about the opportunities ahead for the company and the value opportunities that Viatris can create for its patients, employees, customers, shareholders and all stakeholders. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to start the Q&A session. Thank you."

Or maybe just give us a little bit more color on what the swing factors are that could leave us at either the high end or low end of that range? 
And then a second question, Robert, you talked about 2021 being kind of a trough year for the company in a baseline to grow off of. When you think about that comment, is that referring to EBITDA? Is that referring to sales? Or is that referring to both sales and EBITDA? I'm just trying to get a sense of as we think about that year when you define trough, what are we thinking about there?"

But as you would expect when we start a year in a very dynamic industry that has a lot of moving parts, we start the year like we did last year with a wider range that we fully intend to narrow around that midpoint, just as we did in 2019. So there's no subtle message or inherent message about widening the range.

And I really think, directionally, you have been doing a really good job in telegraphing. I think the trajectory of where Viatris will -- where it will be situated when it starts and the opportunities going forward. So I do appreciate the opportunity for me to embellish. I do think that the -- there will be opportunities for revenue, the starting point of revenue. I think that whatever that starting point of revenue is, some of you have directionally already picked up that the EBITDA, we have many levers to, I think, maintain a strong EBITDA base. We do intend on resetting the revenue base. 
And I do believe that there will be an opportunity to grow. I expect that management, I would like at the very minimum, for them to be able to provide a 3- to 5-year CAGR, both on top line and on EBITDA. And I think that we'll be able to deliver that in terms of what the trough year is over the 3- to 5-year time frame. 
And then, I do believe, again, something I think you've been out in front. This creation of this new Global Healthcare Gateway, I have to tell you, this has been in the works since 2016 for us. And the only reason why we didn't announce this before, I mean, obviously, if you saw what we were tied up with in 2016 with the whole EpiPen situation, and I think the street really, really missed the opportunity in 2018 because we were drowned out by all the noise, but it was the best year of science in Mylan's almost 60-year history. 
And as you could see, not only did we build a robust pipeline, but even some of the commentary that Rajiv made today, the 3 opportunities that we have in our pipeline. The reason why we couldn't actually announce the Global Healthcare Gateway that has been underway since 2016 is because without the Upjohn business and without really having critical mass in China, you really can't make that claim. We were simply dabbling in China, but Upjohn gave us the critical mass. So we will be building out an official department that will actually be in charge. It will be -- that department will be led by the new CEO, Michael Goettler. He will be driving that Global Healthcare Gateway. And I believe that all future capital allocation and all the disciplines that need to be around future capital allocations will be within that Global Healthcare Gateway. You can fully expect that our internal R&D, business development will be in very, very much competition of capital going forward against continuing debt repayment or share buyback or any other opportunities that we would have. But I do think that we have a number of levers, and I'm really excited once we get to close this and really establish the department of the Global Healthcare Gateway, I do think that we will be recognized as a partner of choice and represent a real unique opportunity to bring ready access to other spec pharma companies to bring their products around the globe."

So I think that you're not actually off track. I think you've been kind of sort of spot on. And I think that's the way others directionally should be looking at it. 
I think, you, Randall, Chris, there's been several other analysts that I think have now been trying to understand 2021, and I want to make sure it's a trough year. That's why I think we need to go out to 2022. And we don't want to say it's a trough year and then set the numbers in a way where there's another step down. We've seen others do that in the sector, and we saw the punishment that they had to pay as a result of it. 
So again, you only get one time to reset. I want to bring as much clarity as we can or have management bring as much clarity as they can.

Many of the drivers within that are -- we're starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation initiatives. But I would also point out, just like we pointed it out for 2019 as well as 2018, that we continue to work on working capital velocity improvement initiatives. We've reduced our days working capital by probably 6 or 7 days over the last couple of years. Each day is about $40 million to Mylan. And so you can imagine, each day that we're able to organize the business around reducing that working capital requirement gives us another dollar, or in this case, $40 million per day to invest in their business and redeploy the capital appropriately.

All in a lot -- I mean, I think it's well-known that most of the intermediates do come from China. So all API suppliers are going to be affected, not just Mylan. We've been fortunate to vertically integrate and have a lot of our own API. But we still need to get the intermediates. And even some of the API that we have, we may sell some to third party. We buy some from third party. So because the entire spec and generic industry is kind of sort of connected, so to speak when it comes to the API of intermediates, I think whatever impact there is going to be, it's going to be a broad impact and not particularly any one company or the other."

One of them, you've mentioned the intermediates for manufacturing. And you also mentioned that you had an increase in factory costs going into your HIV products. I was wondering if you can tell us more broadly? Are we seeing an intermediate price increase? Will this impact the generic industry in 2020 given at least concerns about product shortage? Are you factoring that in? Is that one of the arguments for broadening the range of EBITDA? 
And second, on biosimilars. Rajiv, if I look at the biosimilar adoptions of late entrant products, they actually look quite low for all the companies that enter kind of like second wave. You have a couple of products which are entering second wave or supply coming online after the market have already formed. Is your impression that in the biosimilar markets, you can catch up? Or are we really in a market, which is somewhat similar to the generic market in years back? The earlier players are inherently going to capture the vast majority of the profit pool."

So over the last 3, 4 years, looking into the volatility of supply from China, we focused on derisking their supply and create alternatives. So even kind of -- what I will tell you, still a couple of intermediates, we still are relying heavily on China. But so far, we are not seeing an issue from the pricing point of view. We are seeing logistical issues. We're not seeing a disruption from them not being able to produce. So putting that -- sorry, you want to go ahead?"

Now coming to the biosimilars, you're right. But here's [indiscernible] and I would like Tony to add up if he wants to add up anything. I don't think that if you are not in the first or second -- first wave, it should be an issue. And you saw, a good example is on Fulphila, where we had some supply constraints. We launched ahead and you -- then share caught up pretty well. So -- and now -- but it does take time just by the -- because of the unique nature of this business and the channels.

And I think you're spot on in the natural progression, especially started in Europe, where you had brand, which they call ethical drugs, and then brand generic and then generic. But what I -- and so we've discovered this and have been operating in that environment with all 3. And of course, we also discovered the importance of OTC, which we added that on, because each one of these markets, David, are actually driven by a different priority scheme. Some markets are actually driven by generics. Some markets are actually still driven by brand, and most markets accept brand generics. And believe it or not, OTC has its advantages just because of the relationship that the OTC rep has with pharmacies. It's a little bit different than when you're regulated, both either in the brand or the generics. 
So I will tell you, in Europe, there's actually still quite a bit of -- especially Central and Eastern Europe, I wouldn't say that generics has taken the kind of hold yet that we believe that it will eventually take. But it's that learning that we have and what we've lived in Europe. And where I think you're insightful is that when you think about what Upjohn's bringing to the table, they have yet to experience, quite frankly, what it's like to go from a brand, maybe brand generics, but certainly not generics. So I think the skill set that we're going to be bringing them to the emerging market opportunities that we have, I think that will be one of the upside synergy values that I expect that we're going to gain when we bring the 2 organizations together.

Look, I think I'll start just also and take you back to the fact that you'll see in the press release that we've included some discussion that's not in any way intended to be a new discussion. But for the last 12 to 18 months, we've been talking about the fact that we're really looking at the right -- trying to find the right measure that we can talk to you about, about -- that is consistent with how we talk about the business internally. And that's why we're moving to an EBITDA measure, and it gives you some of the background for that. 
In doing so, what I also want to point out is that comes out a lot of the transformation work that we've been doing over the last year plus. And when I give you a little bit of color about that transformation work, it will help you to understand why we're maybe not giving as much specificity around gross margins versus SG&A rates, because in that transformation work, we're really looking at economic profit on each one of our products in all the segments and all the businesses and all the markets around the world. And in doing so, as you can imagine, each product has a different gross margin profile. Depending on the nature, you just heard the discussion on the previous question around how the product is either marketed or represented or how much support it has to have for it, whether it be from a salesperson or from a tendering process, it may have a different SG&A rate. But what we're really trying to look at is we're trying to look at the bottom line operating margin, EBITDA profitability on each one of these products. 
Now that said, I will tell you that we don't anticipate significant movements in our gross margin rate from 2019 to 2020, or significant movements in our SG&A rate from 2019 to 2020. But we want to transition and help you transition to thinking about the business the way that we think about it, which is bottom line operating profitability on each one of the products that are in our portfolio, because that's how we're making decisions around the business today."

I would only simply ask for your patience, because we are dealing within a highly complex integration. I'd just like to remind you that Pfizer was right in the midst of separating this business. They were probably only about 25% or 30% into their separation, and -- when Mylan came along. So when you're doing a transaction like this, it's not a typical merger. This is a reverse Morris trust, where you do have 3 parties here. So there is the amount of work that is being done and why it's taking a little bit longer than maybe a typical transaction. It's extensive. And I can't even begin to tell you, daily, weekly, weekends, the amount of time that people are putting in to make sure that we are in a readiness mode from day 1. 
Now with that said, I will tell you that if you'll just be patient, we will have Michael, Sanjiv and Rajiv get around to shareholders more for -- not for really anything else but a meet and greet. I would say, a get to know. Anxious to have them meet together with all the analysts, with some of the shareholders. I think that would be proper, especially even before they come and even give the guidance so that you kind of get to know the individuals. I think we have a really good team. 
I have to tell you, it's taken some time to really pull together and coalesce this management team. They are tight. They are aligned. I think that they get stronger by the day, by the week. And again, I'd just ask -- I want to acknowledge your desire, but I would ask for your patience, and we will get around to you as quickly as we possibly can. Thank you."

Rajiv and Ken will provide additional detail about these results, including an update on pre-integration planning, and we'll end our prepared remarks with commentary from our Chairman, Robert J. Coury. 
However, before we get to results, I'd first like to thank those Mylan employees who may be listening for their continued dedication and commitment to the customers and patients we serve. I would also like to welcome any Upjohn employees listening to the call. 
I want to take a moment to address the very serious matter of the coronavirus. We've been in close contact with our colleagues around the world regarding recent developments and are following government and health organization recommendation. The health and safety of our teams and their families is our priority, and we're supporting those on the ground where possible. Our business exposure in China, specifically, is limited. However, given the global nature of our supply chain, operations and businesses, our results could potentially be impacted. The guidance we disclose today does not include any anticipated impact from coronavirus, however, we will continue monitoring the situation very closely from a business perspective. 
Moving to our results. 2019 was a strong year for Mylan. In the fourth quarter and full year, Mylan's businesses grew across all segments on a constant currency basis. Similar to last quarter, our business transformation work continues to flow through our P&L. As we've previously shared, our transformation work is focused on unlocking latent value within Mylan's organization and delivering economic profit while maintaining our commitment of providing access. We started developing this plan in late 2018 and began implementation in earnest late last year. In the fourth quarter, for example, we identified opportunities to further refine our SG&A and R&D spend, focusing on products that are promotionally responsive as well as higher value portfolio investments. 
Looking at our full year results. Mylan delivered $11.5 billion in revenue, $1 billion on new product launches and $2.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow and exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.12 at the midpoint. These results highlight the durability and stability of the business we've created, as well as our ability to withstand negative trends impacting the industry. They also reinforce the strength of our diverse portfolio, geographic reach and global, commercial and operational scale, powerful levers that will live on through Viatris. 
Looking ahead to the full year of 2020, today we also announced guidance ranges for total revenues of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion. Although we widened the ranges to take into consideration certain factors, the midpoint of our guidance is in line with what we previously disclosed for 2020 in conjunction with the Upjohn transaction. Additionally, as we have previously stated, on a go-forward basis, we believe adjusted EBITDA to be the best measure of our company's underlying operational results and true business performance. We're extremely proud of the efforts of our global workforce that enable us to sustain consistent business performance and profitability across all of our segments. While we continue to see unprecedented change in our industry, we believe we are setting a solid foundation to help position Viatris for a strong future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

It's because of the hard work of our employees that Mylan is well positioned to combine with Upjohn and chart a new course as Viatris. I would also like to welcome my Upjohn colleagues who are listening to today's call. 
I could not be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and the meaningful role Viatris will play in the future of health care. Our unparalleled global reach and supply network will enable us to deliver high-quality medicines to more patients around the world. And we will also leverage our platform for development partners to have ready access to expanded markets through our new and unique Global Healthcare Gateway. Year 1 is quickly approaching, and I'm pleased to report that we remain on track to close in mid-2020. While Pfizer and Upjohn have been working together to ensure that Upjohn is separated as planned, Mylan has been partnering with Pfizer and Upjohn on integration planning with a focus on business continuity for both organizations. 
To build upon Heather's comments regarding business transformation, it's important to understand that our 2020 guidance takes into consideration the company applying an economic profitability lens to how we invest every dollar across the business. Our transformation program is about utilizing a highly disciplined approach to drive strong returns on our investments across all of our businesses. We are also looking at our manufacturing network to further optimize the equation of demand, required capacity and efficiency. This program gives us the right mindset and approach to manage the increasingly volatile and dynamic nature of our business. 
Turning to 2019 total revenues. We delivered $11.5 billion, representing 3% growth on a constant currency basis. These results reflect solid underlying business performance, driven by existing products that generated double-digit growth, including Creon, Influvac, Dona, Amitiza and glatiramer acetate 40 milligram. We also achieved our target of $1 billion in new product launches, driven by Wixela, Fulphila and several other new products. 
Our North America business had total net sales of approximately $4.2 billion, which is a 2% increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by $800 million in new product launches, which were partially offset by lower volume, including business transformation-related product rationalization and, to a lesser extent, price erosion in our commodity generics portfolio. In Europe, our net sales totaled approximately $4 billion, representing 2% growth on a constant currency basis. Our key brands such as Creon, Dymista and Influvac drove this strong performance. In our Rest of World segment, net sales totaled approximately $3.2 billion, representing an 8% growth on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily the result of new product launches and increased volumes across the region, including key markets like Japan, Australia and China. 
As we look ahead to 2020, we continue to see growth being driven by the complex products, global key brands and biosimilars, which will help offset continued competitive pressures on our commoditized generics portfolio. Overall, we expect another strong year with approximately $600 million in revenue from new product launches, which will help us offset expected mid-single-digit year-over-year price erosion. 
Let me now walk you through projected year-over-year net sales growth across our 3 business segments. In our North America business, we expect low single-digit growth, largely driven by Yupelri, Wixela, glatiramer acetate, Fulphila as well as Ogivri. We are also looking forward to the launch of several new products, including the midyear launch of insulin glargine. We expect our Europe business to grow mid- to high-single digits. This is largely driven by our key brands such as Creon, Influvac, Dymista and Brufen. We also continue to see opportunities to expand our biosimilars portfolio, which today includes Ogivri, Hulio as well as Fulphila. 
Moving to the rest of the world. We expect to grow mid-single digits, primarily driven by key brands and biosimilars growth in certain expansion and emerging markets. These drivers will be partially offset by government price cuts in Japan and Australia as well as standards around ARVs. 
I would now like to share some key pipeline updates. Beginning with insulin blocking, as you know, we have been steadfast in our efforts to bring to the market a more affordable insulin for the millions of people living with diabetes around the world. Sanofi's formulation patents have been found to be invalid. This was affirmed on appeal. Sanofi has also sued us on one device patent that we have challenged in an IPR proceeding and is before the District Court. We expect a decision on the IPR proceedings by second quarter, and we are awaiting the trial judge decision. 
Last week, FDA completed its pre-approval inspection of Biocon's insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia and issued a Form 483 with 3 observations. Biocon is responding to FDA and are confident in their ability to fully address the observations. We do not believe that the inspection in any way impacts our commercialization plans of insulin glargine in U.S.A. 
Also, our biosimilar to Avastin has been accepted for filing and is under review with the FDA. Our user fee goal date is December 27 this year. We also submitted our European application and it's currently in the validation stage with the authorities. Lastly, regarding aspart, we remain on track for our U.S. submission in the next quarter. And EYLEA remains on the track for submission in early 2021. 
As I mentioned earlier this year, we initiated work on 2 new brand opportunities. Starting with MR-107A-01, which is being developed as a safe and effective non-narcotic oral analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain. The drug's novel formulation is being designed to potentially provide an alternative to opioids and a Phase II clinical study is being initiated this year. The other product where we initiated development equity is known as MR-106A-01. It's a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that's being developed as a topical product for treatment of wounds, including burn wounds. Early clinical studies have demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with partial-thickness burn wounds. We are preparing to initiate further clinical development this year. 
Finally, we are pleased to update that the pivotal Phase III clinical study of glatiramer acetate once a month was started in October 2019. This study is assessing the efficacy, safety, tolerability of glatiramer acetate administered once a month in the treatment of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis. To date, the study has been initiated in 19 sites and is actively enrolling patients. We look forward to keeping you informed of these development programs. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

I'll take a few minutes to provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2019. Fourth quarter 2019 total revenues of $3.2 billion were 4% higher than the prior y",1363,"Thanks, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2019. 
Fourth quarter 2019 total revenues of $3.2 billion were 4% higher than the prior year and in line with our expectations. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, constant currency total revenues grew 5%, with growth in all 3 segments. Rest of World net sales grew 9%, followed by Europe and North America, which were up 5% and 3%, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by new product sales, including Wixela, partially offset by a decrease in net sales from existing products mainly due to lower pricing across the regions. 
From a segment profitability standpoint, North America declined 5% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This decline reflects contributions from new product sales, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing and volumes on existing products due to changes in the competitive environment, in addition to inventory write-offs related to certain product discontinuations. Europe segment profitability expanded 4% in the quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of new product sales and higher volumes of existing products, along with the favorable comparison from lower restructuring costs in the quarter. Rest of World segment profitability also expanded 4% in the quarter as a result of the favorable impact of new product sales and higher volumes of existing products. These favorable impacts were partially mitigated by lower gross profit on ARV sales resulting from higher API input costs. 
For the quarter, we reported adjusted net earnings of $721 million and adjusted EPS of $1.40, which were both above our internal expectations. The year-over-year increase of 8% in adjusted EPS reflects strong segment performance and, to a lesser extent, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange. 
Now for the full year, total revenues of $11.5 billion were 1% higher than the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, constant currency total revenues grew 3%, with all 3 segments delivering year-over-year growth. Consistent with our expectations, new product sales for the year were approximately $1 billion, with approximately $800 million coming from North America, and the remaining amount was balanced between Europe and the Rest of World. This growth was partially mitigated by the decrease in net sales from existing products as a result of lower pricing and volumes. For 2019, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to 54% in the prior year. Year-over-year, lower gross profit from sales of existing products was essentially offset by gross margins on new product introductions. 
Moving on to full year segment profitability. Excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program, North America adjusted segment profitability expanded 3% in the year. This growth reflects contributions from new product sales, partially offset by impacts from lower volumes and, to a lesser extent, pricing on existing products, as well as inventory write-offs related to product discontinuations and higher investments in SG&A. Primarily due to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation, Europe segment profitability declined 6% and Rest of World declined 5%. In addition, both segments reflect the anticipated higher investments in selling and marketing costs, and Rest of World segment profitability was further impacted by lower gross profit on ARV sales resulting from the higher API input costs. 
Full year adjusted R&D of $516 million was down 9% compared to 2018 due to the reprioritization of global programs. In 2019, adjusted SG&A increased 4% compared to the full year 2018, reflecting the expected incremental investments in selling and marketing. In addition, the prior year included the favorable impact of reversing certain performance-based incentive accruals. These increases in costs were partially offset by benefits from restructuring activities as well as business transformation initiatives. 
We reported adjusted net earnings of $2.28 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.42 for the full year, which was above the high end of our most recent guidance. Excluding the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange, full year adjusted EPS was flat to 2018. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was exactly in line with our expectations at $2.1 billion, including the planned investment of more than $600 million in net working capital that was required to support the approximately $1 billion of new product launches that we've talked about. Ongoing working capital velocity initiatives and lower capital expenditures partially offset these investments. 
During 2019, we delivered on our commitment to repay $1.1 billion of debt, bringing our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio down to 3.6x at the end of the fourth quarter, which is in compliance with our covenant requirements and reflects our continuing commitment to our investment-grade credit rating.  
Now moving on to 2020. At a high level for Mylan stand-alone, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 4% at the midpoint versus full year 2019. As Heather mentioned, going forward, we're no longer providing adjusted EPS guidance as we believe adjusted EBITDA better reflects how we manage and measure the performance of the business. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion. 
It's important to note that there are no material changes in our underlying Mylan stand-alone business assumptions compared to the Mylan financial targets that were provided in July 2019 when we announced the Upjohn transaction. Our current expectations do reflect the impact of foreign exchange headwinds experienced as we move through 2019, which resulted in the $250 million reduction in the revenue midpoint and the $50 million reduction in the EBITDA midpoint. A schedule reconciling these numbers is included in the press release. As you heard from Rajiv in our top line outlook, we expect positive volume growth, along with the contributions from new product launches to more than offset competitive market dynamics.
Moving to adjusted EBITDA. We're expecting a positive contribution from sales growth, driven by volume from existing products and new product launches, partially offset by pricing, in addition to higher SG&A spending to support those top line expectations and higher R&D investments to focus on our complex product pipeline, which will support the long-term health of our business. 
Moving to capital deployment. On a stand-alone basis, our priority remains deleveraging. We intend to repay approximately $1 billion of debt in 2020 on consistent adjusted free cash flow generation. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage as we work towards our stand-alone long-term average debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x. 
Finally, we anticipate lower interest expense, reflecting the $1.1 billion of debt repayments we made in 2019 as well as the incremental debt repayments we expect to make in 2020. In addition, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19%, and we expect a diluted share count of between 516 million and 520 million shares. 
Before I close, a quick comment on calendarization as you think about modeling the year. We expect total revenues and adjusted EBITDA quarterly phasing to be very consistent with 2019, with Q1 being the lowest quarter and sequentially increasing as we move through the year. First quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA represented approximately 20% of full year adjusted EBITDA. We expect the same in 2020. In addition, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the first half of 2020 to be slightly higher than the second half due primarily to the calendarization of revenues. Similar to 2019, first quarter 2020 adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be the lightest quarter of the year as we invest in the working capital required to support new product launches. But as Rajiv noted, new product launch revenues in 2020 are expected to be approximately $600 million or $400 million lower than 2019. Therefore, we expect a lower front-end net working capital investment, which will ultimately put less pressure on first quarter free cash flow. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mylan's Chairman, Robert Coury. Rob?"

Good afternoon, everyone. To echo the comments of our management team, I, too, would like to personally thank our dedicated Mylan colleagues for their continued outstanding execution and commitment and to once again welcome the Upjohn colleagues as well, who will be partnering with us as we transition into Viatris in the near future. 
I would also like to share how much our hearts go out to those impacted in China and across the world in light of the current coronavirus situation. We will continue to do all that we can do to help mitigate this serious health issue. As for the potential company impact, and as Heather has mentioned, we, like others, are closely monitoring the situation, though it is too early to predict any commercial impact to our operations around the globe. 
I am pleased to share that we have already achieved numerous milestones on our path to creating Viatris, the combination of Mylan and Upjohn, a new champion for global health. As you saw this morning in our press release, we have now announced the remaining members of the Viatris Board of Directors. With these appointments at the Viatris Board level, we have assembled a world-class Board of Directors with extensive experience, knowledge and strategic vision to help guide the company and to unlock greater shareholder value. 
In addition, this morning, we announced Upjohn's CFO, Sanjeev Narula, who will become Viatris' CFO and will join Michael and Rajiv on the management team. Sanjeev brings exactly the right profile, given where the new company will be in its first business life cycle upon closing. I've had the privilege to spend a great deal of time directly with Sanjeev over the past several months. His strength in operations and his understanding of the pharmaceutical industry as well as Upjohn will prove to be invaluable. His deep-rooted experience at Pfizer, which includes significant accomplishments in the process optimization and automation, capital allocation, internal and external reporting makes him the right fit to help ensure Viatris delivers on its opportunities and commitment to creating shareholder value. Additionally, his significant knowledge of Pfizer and Upjohn will be extremely instrumental as we continue to integrate our 2 companies and manage the numerous business-critical transition service agreements we will have with Pfizer in the early years of Viatris. We are fortunate to add him to the seasoned management team. 
In other milestones, we have received regulatory approvals in certain key regions, including approval from the state administration for market regulation in China. And we recently set the extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders to be held on April 27. In short, we continue to progress every day and remain on track to close the transaction in mid-2020. 
Our goal remains to build a new and even more robust and integrated global health care platform, one that will be balanced between returning capital to shareholders and investing more in innovative segments of the industry's value chain while maintaining our core commitment to improving patient access to medicines around the world. With this as our focus, and together with strong and consistent execution and delivering results, I continue to be very excited about the incredible value creation opportunity we expect for shareholders as a result of this combination. To be clear, Viatris will not be a Mylan 2.0. This is Viatris 1.0, which will benefit from the many additional opportunities not present within either Mylan or Upjohn on a stand-alone basis. 
As we continue to progress towards closing and the years beyond, I have been well aware of all of your continued interest and receiving more clarity on what are the -- what actually is the starting baseline financial targets for Viatris' first full year of operations in 2021. As I shared in the last quarter conference call and at the JPMorgan conference, I believe I have been very consistent in my focus for Viatris in 2021, its first full year of operations. We expect that the formal guidance will be delivered to you by Viatris' new management team, led by Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev at the close and at the appropriate time after the transaction closes. 
You can expect that the management team will, of course, be taken into consideration. All the known as well as potentially anticipated headwinds, whether it's the changes in China's health care system, which some are calling the China reset, the upcoming Lyrica and Celebrex loss of exclusivity in Japan and any other what-ifs at that time. Simply put, you should expect that the Viatris management team to deliver a 2021 baseline, representing a trough year from which the company can grow from. 
Looking ahead beyond that, Viatris will be creating a new global and unique Global Healthcare Gateway, which will offer many other biotech and spec pharma companies ready access to markets around the globe by leveraging our true, one-of-a-kind global infrastructure, making Viatris the true partner of choice for players often facing challenges and utilizing multiple, local or regional partners. We envision Viatris' unique Global Healthcare Gateway department to leverage our already existing enhanced scientific successes to date with our own research and development capabilities, as well as those future opportunities we expect to realize from the Viatris' Global Healthcare Gateway, partnering opportunities to more rapidly broaden our own product portfolio and future pipeline, including new business models to once again give the street confidence in Viatris' ability to grow. These are just a few of the additional growth opportunities not present within, again, either Mylan or Upjohn on a stand-alone basis. 
I would like to conclude by sharing what I mentioned at the JPMorgan conference last month. We believe that Viatris, with its new and unique profile, will be recognized for being at the forefront of establishing a new kind of global pharmaceutical player designed for where the health care industry is going, not where it has been. And I am extremely excited about the opportunities ahead for the company and the value opportunities that Viatris can create for its patients, employees, customers, shareholders and all stakeholders. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to start the Q&A session. Thank you."

And then a second question, Robert, you talked about 2021 being kind of a trough year for the company and a baseline to grow off of. When you think about that comment, is that referring to EBITDA? Is that referring to sales? Or is that referring to both sales and EBITDA? I'm just trying to get a sense of, as we think about that year when you define trough, what are we thinking about there."

This is our opportunity to reset. And we, at the Board level, want to absolutely make sure that management's starting point has the best chance not just to meet but even to exceed.

I think the trajectory of where Viatris will -- where it will be situated when it starts and the opportunities going forward. So I do appreciate the opportunity for me to embellish. I do think that the -- there will be opportunities for revenue, the starting point of revenue. I think that whatever that starting point of revenue is, some of you have directionally already picked up that the EBITDA, we have many levers to, I think, maintain a strong EBITDA base. We do intend on resetting the revenue base. And I do believe that there will be an opportunity to grow. I expect that management, I would like at the very minimum, for them to be able to provide a 3- to 5-year CAGR, both on top line and on EBITDA. And I think that we'll be able to deliver that in terms of what the trough year is over the 3- to 5-year time frame. 
And then, I do believe, again, something I think you've been out in front. This creation of this new Global Healthcare Gateway, I have to tell you, this has been in the works since 2016 for us. And the only reason why we didn't announce this before, I mean, obviously, if you saw what we were tied up with in 2016 with the whole EpiPen situation, and I think the street really, really missed the opportunity in 2018 because we were drowned out by all the noise, but it was the best year of science in Mylan's almost 60-year history. And as you could see, not only did we build a robust pipeline, but even some of the commentary that Rajiv made today, the 3 opportunities that we have in our pipeline. The reason why we couldn't actually announce the Global Healthcare Gateway that has been underway since 2016 is because without the Upjohn business and without really having critical mass in China, you really can't make that claim. We were simply dabbling in China, but Upjohn gave us the critical mass. 
So we will be building out an official department that will actually be in charge. It will be -- that department will be led by the new CEO, Michael Goettler. He will be driving that Global Healthcare Gateway. And I believe that all future capital allocation and all the disciplines that need to be around future capital allocations will be within that Global Healthcare Gateway. You can fully expect that our internal R&D, business development will be in very, very much competition of capital going forward against continuing debt repayment or share buyback or any other opportunities that we would have. But I do think that we have a number of levers, and I'm really excited once we get to close this and really establish the department of the Global Healthcare Gateway, I do think that we will be recognized as partner of choice and represent a real unique opportunity to bring ready access to other spec pharma companies to bring their products around the globe."

Let's not forget about the transformational work that's being done. Let's not forget about some of the other opportunities that we see. And we're currently even -- I know Michael and Sanjeev were doing work on their side, trying to identify some of the transformational opportunities even within Upjohn. 
So I think that you're not actually off track. I think you've been kind of sort of spot on. And I think that's the way others directionally should be looking at it. I think, you, Randall, Chris, there's been several other analysts that I think have now been trying to understand 2021, and I want to make sure it's a trough year. That's why I think we need to go out to 2022. And we don't want to say it's a trough year and then set the numbers in a way where there's another step down. We've seen others do that in the sector, and we saw the punishment that they had to pay as a result of it. So again, you only get one time to reset. I want to bring as much clarity as we can or have management bring as much clarity as they can. And at the proper time, when they give the guidance, I'm sure there'll be a lot of discussion what the new reset of 2021 will mean and the growth opportunity from there going forward."

Many of the drivers within that are -- we're starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation initiatives. But I would also point out, just like we pointed it out for 2019 as well as 2018, that we continue to work on working capital velocity improvement initiatives. We've reduced our days working capital by probably 6 or 7 days over the last couple of years. Each day is about $40 million to Mylan. And so you can imagine, each day that we're able to organize the business around reducing that working capital requirement gives us another dollar, or in this case, $40 million per day to invest in their business and redeploy the capital appropriately. So the simple answer is, effectively, the same cash generation in 2020 supporting the new product launches but always focusing heavily on working capital improvements."

Because we do both API and because we do rely on intermediates, all API, all API producers rely on intermediates. All in a lot -- I mean, I think it's well-known that most of the intermediates do come from China. So all API suppliers are going to be affected, not just Mylan. We've been fortunate to vertically integrate and have a lot of our own API. But we still need to get the intermediates. And even some of the API that we have, we may sell some to third party. We buy some from third party.

Are you factoring that in? Is that one of the arguments for broadening the range of EBITDA? 
And second, on biosimilars. Rajiv, if I look at the biosimilar adoptions of late entrant products, they actually look quite low for all the companies that enter kind of like second wave. You have a couple of products which are entering second wave or supply coming online after the market have already formed. Is your impression that in the biosimilar markets, you can catch up? Or are we really in a market which is somewhat similar to the generic market in years back? The earlier players are inherently going to capture the vast majority of the profit pool."

Over last 3, 4 years, looking into the volatility of supply from China, we focused on derisking their supply and create alternatives. So even kind of -- but I will tell you still a couple of intermediates, we still are relying heavily on China. But so far, we are not seeing issue from the pricing point of view.

Now coming to the biosimilars, you're right. But here's how I see it and I would like Tony to add up if he wants to add up anything. I don't think that if you are not in the first or second -- first wave, it should be an issue. And you saw -- a good example is on Fulphila, where we had some supply constraints. We launched ahead and you -- then share caught up pretty well. So -- and now -- but it does take time just by the -- because of the unique nature of this business and the channels.

And I think you're spot on in the natural progression, especially started in Europe, where you had brand, which they call ethical drugs, and then brand generic and then generic. But what I -- and so we've discovered this and have been operating in that environment with all 3. And of course, we also discovered the importance of OTC, which we added that on, because each one of these markets, David, are actually driven by a different priority scheme. Some markets are actually driven by generics. Some markets are actually still driven by brand, and most markets accept brand generics. And believe it or not, OTC has its advantages just because of the relationship that the OTC rep has with pharmacies. It's a little bit different than when you're regulated both either in the brand or the generics. 
So I will tell you, in Europe, there's actually still quite a bit of -- especially Central and Eastern Europe, I wouldn't say that generics has taken the kind of hold yet that we believe that it will eventually take. But it's that learning that we have and what we've lived in Europe. And where I think you're insightful is that when you think about what Upjohn's bringing to the table, they have yet to experience, quite frankly, what it's like to go from a brand, maybe brand generics, but certainly not generics. So I think the skill set that we're going to be bringing them to the emerging market opportunities that we have, I think that will be one of the upside synergy values that I expect that we're going to gain when we bring the 2 organizations together.

And that's why we're moving to an EBITDA measure, and it gives you some of the background for that. 
In doing so, what I also want to point out is that comes out a lot of the transformation work that we've been doing over the last year plus. And when I give you a little bit of color about that transformation work, it will help you to understand why we're maybe not giving as much specificity around gross margins versus SG&A rates because in that transformation work, we're really looking at economic profit on each one of our products in all the segments and all the businesses and all the markets around the world. And in doing so, as you can imagine, each product has a different gross margin profile. Depending on the nature, you just heard the discussion on the previous question around how the product is either marketed or represented or how much support it has to have for it, whether it be from a salesperson or from a tendering process, it may have a different SG&A rate. But what we're really trying to look at is we're trying to look at the bottom line operating margin, EBITDA profitability on each one of these products. 
Now that said, I will tell you that we don't anticipate significant movements in our gross margin rate from 2019 to 2020, or significant movements in our SG&A rate from 2019 to 2020.

Before we close the line, I'd just like to say one thing. A lot of shareholders have been requesting time with Michael and now, obviously, going to be with Sanjeev, and I can't express to you enough how excited and anxious we are to put Michael and Rajiv and Sanjeev in front of all of you. I would only simply ask for your patience because we are dealing within a highly complex integration. I'd just like to remind you that Pfizer was right in the midst of separating this business. They were probably only about 25% or 30% into their separation and -- when Mylan came along. So when you're doing a transaction like this, it's not a typical merger. This is a reverse Morris trust, where you do have 3 parties here. So there is the amount of work that is being done and why it's taking a little bit longer than maybe a typical transaction. It's extensive. And I can't even begin to tell you, daily, weekly, weekends, the amount of time that people are putting in to make sure that we are in a readiness mode from day 1. 
Now with that said, I will tell you that if you'll just be patient, we will have Michael, Sanjeev and Rajiv get around to shareholders more for -- not for really anything else but a meet and greet, I would say a get to know, anxious to have them meet together with all the analysts, with some of the shareholders. I think that would be proper, especially even before they come and even give the guidance so that you kind of get to know the individuals. I think we have a really good team. I have to tell you, it's taken some time to really pull together and coalesce this management team. They are tight. They are aligned. I think that they get stronger by the day, by the week. And again, I'd just ask -- I want to acknowledge your desire, but I would ask for your patience, and we will get around to you as quickly as we possibly can. Thank you."

I'd like to welcome everyone to what we expect will be the last full year earnings call for Mylan as a stand-alone company. I'll be covering commentary regarding Mylan's Q4 and full year 2019 performance. Rajiv and Ken will provide additional detail about these results, including an update on pre-integration planning, and we'll end our prepared remarks with commentary from our Chairman, Robert J. Coury. 
However, before we get to results, I'd first like to thank those Mylan employees who may be listening for their continued dedication and commitment to the customers and patients we serve. I would also like to welcome any Upjohn employees listening to the call. 
I want to take a moment to address the very serious matter of the coronavirus. We've been in close contact with our colleagues around the world regarding recent developments and are following government and health organization recommendation. The health and safety of our teams and their families is our priority, and we're supporting those on the ground where possible. Our business exposure in China, specifically, is limited. However, given the global nature of our supply chain, operations and businesses, our results could potentially be impacted. The guidance we disclose today does not include any anticipated impact from coronavirus, however, we will continue monitoring the situation very closely from a business perspective. 
Moving to our results. 2019 was a strong year for Mylan. In the fourth quarter and full year, Mylan's businesses grew across all segments on a constant currency basis. Similar to last quarter, our business transformation work continues to flow through our P&L. As we've previously shared, our transformation work is focused on unlocking latent value within Mylan's organization and delivering economic profit while maintaining our commitment of providing access. We started developing this plan in late 2018 and began implementation in earnest late last year. In the fourth quarter, for example, we identified opportunities to further refine our SG&A and R&D spend, focusing on products that are promotionally responsive as well as higher value portfolio investments. 
Looking at our full year results. Mylan delivered $11.5 billion in revenue, $1 billion on new product launches and $2.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow and exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.12 at the midpoint. These results highlight the durability and stability of the business we've created, as well as our ability to withstand negative trends impacting the industry. They also reinforce the strength of our diverse portfolio, geographic reach and global, commercial and operational scale, powerful levers that will live on through Viatris. 
Looking ahead to the full year of 2020, today we also announced guidance ranges for total revenues of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion. Although we widened the ranges to take into consideration certain factors, the midpoint of our guidance is in line with what we previously disclosed for 2020 in conjunction with the Upjohn transaction. Additionally, as we have previously stated, on a go-forward basis, we believe adjusted EBITDA to be the best measure of our company's underlying operational results and true business performance. We're extremely proud of the efforts of our global workforce that enable us to sustain consistent business performance and profitability across all of our segments. While we continue to see unprecedented change in our industry, we believe we are setting a solid foundation to help position Viatris for a strong future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

To begin, I would like to take a moment to thank my Mylan colleagues for a strong 2019 performance. 
As Heather mentioned, this call has a unique significance as it represents the last time we expect to report our full year results for Mylan as a stand-alone company. I'm extremely proud of all that we have accomplished together to build a strong global business we have today. It's because of the hard work of our employees that Mylan is well positioned to combine with Upjohn and chart a new course as Viatris. I would also like to welcome my Upjohn colleagues who are listening to today's call. 
I could not be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and the meaningful role Viatris will play in the future of health care. Our unparalleled global reach and supply network will enable us to deliver high-quality medicines to more patients around the world. And we will also leverage our platform for development partners to have ready access to expanded markets through our new and unique Global Healthcare Gateway. Year 1 is quickly approaching, and I'm pleased to report that we remain on track to close in mid-2020. While Pfizer and Upjohn have been working together to ensure that Upjohn is separated as planned, Mylan has been partnering with Pfizer and Upjohn on integration planning with a focus on business continuity for both organizations. 
To build upon Heather's comments regarding business transformation, it's important to understand that our 2020 guidance takes into consideration the company applying an economic profitability lens to how we invest every dollar across the business. Our transformation program is about utilizing a highly disciplined approach to drive strong returns on our investments across all of our businesses. We are also looking at our manufacturing network to further optimize the equation of demand, required capacity and efficiency. This program gives us the right mindset and approach to manage the increasingly volatile and dynamic nature of our business. 
Turning to 2019 total revenues. We delivered $11.5 billion, representing 3% growth on a constant currency basis. These results reflect solid underlying business performance, driven by existing products that generated double-digit growth, including Creon, Influvac, Dona, Amitiza and glatiramer acetate 40 milligram. We also achieved our target of $1 billion in new product launches, driven by Wixela, Fulphila and several other new products. 
Our North America business had total net sales of approximately $4.2 billion, which is a 2% increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by $800 million in new product launches, which were partially offset by lower volume, including business transformation-related product rationalization and, to a lesser extent, price erosion in our commodity generics portfolio. In Europe, our net sales totaled approximately $4 billion, representing 2% growth on a constant currency basis. Our key brands such as Creon, Dymista and Influvac drove this strong performance. In our Rest of World segment, net sales totaled approximately $3.2 billion, representing an 8% growth on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily the result of new product launches and increased volumes across the region, including key markets like Japan, Australia and China. 
As we look ahead to 2020, we continue to see growth being driven by the complex products, global key brands and biosimilars, which will help offset continued competitive pressures on our commoditized generics portfolio. Overall, we expect another strong year with approximately $600 million in revenue from new product launches, which will help us offset expected mid-single-digit year-over-year price erosion. 
Let me now walk you through projected year-over-year net sales growth across our 3 business segments. In our North America business, we expect low single-digit growth, largely driven by Yupelri, Wixela, glatiramer acetate, Fulphila as well as Ogivri. We are also looking forward to the launch of several new products, including the midyear launch of insulin glargine. We expect our Europe business to grow mid- to high-single digits. This is largely driven by our key brands such as Creon, Influvac, Dymista and Brufen. We also continue to see opportunities to expand our biosimilars portfolio, which today includes Ogivri, Hulio as well as Fulphila. 
Moving to the rest of the world. We expect to grow mid-single digits, primarily driven by key brands and biosimilars growth in certain expansion and emerging markets. These drivers will be partially offset by government price cuts in Japan and Australia as well as standards around ARVs. 
I would now like to share some key pipeline updates. Beginning with insulin blocking, as you know, we have been steadfast in our efforts to bring to the market a more affordable insulin for the millions of people living with diabetes around the world. Sanofi's formulation patents have been found to be invalid. This was affirmed on appeal. Sanofi has also sued us on one device patent that we have challenged in an IPR proceeding and is before the District Court. We expect a decision on the IPR proceedings by second quarter, and we are awaiting the trial judge decision. 
Last week, FDA completed its pre-approval inspection of Biocon's insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia and issued a Form 483 with 3 observations. Biocon is responding to FDA and are confident in their ability to fully address the observations. We do not believe that the inspection in any way impacts our commercialization plans of insulin glargine in U.S.A. 
Also, our biosimilar to Avastin has been accepted for filing and is under review with the FDA. Our user fee goal date is December 27 this year. We also submitted our European application and it's currently in the validation stage with the authorities. Lastly, regarding aspart, we remain on track for our U.S. submission in the next quarter. And EYLEA remains on the track for submission in early 2021. 
As I mentioned earlier this year, we initiated work on 2 new brand opportunities. Starting with MR-107A-01, which is being developed as a safe and effective non-narcotic oral analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain. The drug's novel formulation is being designed to potentially provide an alternative to opioids and a Phase II clinical study is being initiated this year. The other product where we initiated development equity is known as MR-106A-01. It's a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that's being developed as a topical product for treatment of wounds, including burn wounds. Early clinical studies have demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with partial-thickness burn wounds. We are preparing to initiate further clinical development this year. 
Finally, we are pleased to update that the pivotal Phase III clinical study of glatiramer acetate once a month was started in October 2019. This study is assessing the efficacy, safety, tolerability of glatiramer acetate administered once a month in the treatment of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis. To date, the study has been initiated in 19 sites and is actively enrolling patients. We look forward to keeping you informed of these development programs. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

I'll take a few minutes to provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2019. Fourth quarter 2019 total revenues of $3.2 billion were 4% higher than the prior y",1363,"Thanks, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2019. 
Fourth quarter 2019 total revenues of $3.2 billion were 4% higher than the prior year and in line with our expectations. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, constant currency total revenues grew 5%, with growth in all 3 segments. Rest of World net sales grew 9%, followed by Europe and North America, which were up 5% and 3%, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by new product sales, including Wixela, partially offset by a decrease in net sales from existing products mainly due to lower pricing across the regions. 
From a segment profitability standpoint, North America declined 5% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This decline reflects contributions from new product sales, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing and volumes on existing products due to changes in the competitive environment, in addition to inventory write-offs related to certain product discontinuations. Europe segment profitability expanded 4% in the quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of new product sales and higher volumes of existing products, along with the favorable comparison from lower restructuring costs in the quarter. Rest of World segment profitability also expanded 4% in the quarter as a result of the favorable impact of new product sales and higher volumes of existing products. These favorable impacts were partially mitigated by lower gross profit on ARV sales resulting from higher API input costs. 
For the quarter, we reported adjusted net earnings of $721 million and adjusted EPS of $1.40, which were both above our internal expectations. The year-over-year increase of 8% in adjusted EPS reflects strong segment performance and, to a lesser extent, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange. 
Now for the full year, total revenues of $11.5 billion were 1% higher than the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, constant currency total revenues grew 3%, with all 3 segments delivering year-over-year growth. Consistent with our expectations, new product sales for the year were approximately $1 billion, with approximately $800 million coming from North America, and the remaining amount was balanced between Europe and the Rest of World. This growth was partially mitigated by the decrease in net sales from existing products as a result of lower pricing and volumes. For 2019, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to 54% in the prior year. Year-over-year, lower gross profit from sales of existing products was essentially offset by gross margins on new product introductions. 
Moving on to full year segment profitability. Excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program, North America adjusted segment profitability expanded 3% in the year. This growth reflects contributions from new product sales, partially offset by impacts from lower volumes and, to a lesser extent, pricing on existing products, as well as inventory write-offs related to product discontinuations and higher investments in SG&A. Primarily due to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation, Europe segment profitability declined 6% and Rest of World declined 5%. In addition, both segments reflect the anticipated higher investments in selling and marketing costs, and Rest of World segment profitability was further impacted by lower gross profit on ARV sales resulting from the higher API input costs. 
Full year adjusted R&D of $516 million was down 9% compared to 2018 due to the reprioritization of global programs. In 2019, adjusted SG&A increased 4% compared to the full year 2018, reflecting the expected incremental investments in selling and marketing. In addition, the prior year included the favorable impact of reversing certain performance-based incentive accruals. These increases in costs were partially offset by benefits from restructuring activities as well as business transformation initiatives. 
We reported adjusted net earnings of $2.28 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.42 for the full year, which was above the high end of our most recent guidance. Excluding the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange, full year adjusted EPS was flat to 2018. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was exactly in line with our expectations at $2.1 billion, including the planned investment of more than $600 million in net working capital that was required to support the approximately $1 billion of new product launches that we've talked about. Ongoing working capital velocity initiatives and lower capital expenditures partially offset these investments. 
During 2019, we delivered on our commitment to repay $1.1 billion of debt, bringing our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio down to 3.6x at the end of the fourth quarter, which is in compliance with our covenant requirements and reflects our continuing commitment to our investment-grade credit rating.  
Now moving on to 2020. At a high level for Mylan stand-alone, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 4% at the midpoint versus full year 2019. As Heather mentioned, going forward, we're no longer providing adjusted EPS guidance as we believe adjusted EBITDA better reflects how we manage and measure the performance of the business. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion. 
It's important to note that there are no material changes in our underlying Mylan stand-alone business assumptions compared to the Mylan financial targets that were provided in July 2019 when we announced the Upjohn transaction. Our current expectations do reflect the impact of foreign exchange headwinds experienced as we move through 2019, which resulted in the $250 million reduction in the revenue midpoint and the $50 million reduction in the EBITDA midpoint. A schedule reconciling these numbers is included in the press release. As you heard from Rajiv in our top line outlook, we expect positive volume growth, along with the contributions from new product launches to more than offset competitive market dynamics.
Moving to adjusted EBITDA. We're expecting a positive contribution from sales growth, driven by volume from existing products and new product launches, partially offset by pricing, in addition to higher SG&A spending to support those top line expectations and higher R&D investments to focus on our complex product pipeline, which will support the long-term health of our business. 
Moving to capital deployment. On a stand-alone basis, our priority remains deleveraging. We intend to repay approximately $1 billion of debt in 2020 on consistent adjusted free cash flow generation. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage as we work towards our stand-alone long-term average debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x. 
Finally, we anticipate lower interest expense, reflecting the $1.1 billion of debt repayments we made in 2019 as well as the incremental debt repayments we expect to make in 2020. In addition, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19%, and we expect a diluted share count of between 516 million and 520 million shares. 
Before I close, a quick comment on calendarization as you think about modeling the year. We expect total revenues and adjusted EBITDA quarterly phasing to be very consistent with 2019, with Q1 being the lowest quarter and sequentially increasing as we move through the year. First quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA represented approximately 20% of full year adjusted EBITDA. We expect the same in 2020. In addition, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the first half of 2020 to be slightly higher than the second half due primarily to the calendarization of revenues. Similar to 2019, first quarter 2020 adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be the lightest quarter of the year as we invest in the working capital required to support new product launches. But as Rajiv noted, new product launch revenues in 2020 are expected to be approximately $600 million or $400 million lower than 2019. Therefore, we expect a lower front-end net working capital investment, which will ultimately put less pressure on first quarter free cash flow. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mylan's Chairman, Robert Coury. Rob?"

Good afternoon, everyone. To echo the comments of our management team, I, too, would like to personally thank our dedicated Mylan colleagues for their continued outstanding execution and commitment and to once again welcome the Upjohn colleagues as well, who will be partnering with us as we transition into Viatris in the near future. 
I would also like to share how much our hearts go out to those impacted in China and across the world in light of the current coronavirus situation. We will continue to do all that we can do to help mitigate this serious health issue. As for the potential company impact, and as Heather has mentioned, we, like others, are closely monitoring the situation, though it is too early to predict any commercial impact to our operations around the globe. 
I am pleased to share that we have already achieved numerous milestones on our path to creating Viatris, the combination of Mylan and Upjohn, a new champion for global health. As you saw this morning in our press release, we have now announced the remaining members of the Viatris Board of Directors. With these appointments at the Viatris Board level, we have assembled a world-class Board of Directors with extensive experience, knowledge and strategic vision to help guide the company and to unlock greater shareholder value. 
In addition, this morning, we announced Upjohn's CFO, Sanjeev Narula, who will become Viatris' CFO and will join Michael and Rajiv on the management team. Sanjeev brings exactly the right profile, given where the new company will be in its first business life cycle upon closing. I've had the privilege to spend a great deal of time directly with Sanjeev over the past several months. His strength in operations and his understanding of the pharmaceutical industry as well as Upjohn will prove to be invaluable. His deep-rooted experience at Pfizer, which includes significant accomplishments in the process optimization and automation, capital allocation, internal and external reporting makes him the right fit to help ensure Viatris delivers on its opportunities and commitment to creating shareholder value. Additionally, his significant knowledge of Pfizer and Upjohn will be extremely instrumental as we continue to integrate our 2 companies and manage the numerous business-critical transition service agreements we will have with Pfizer in the early years of Viatris. We are fortunate to add him to the seasoned management team. 
In other milestones, we have received regulatory approvals in certain key regions, including approval from the state administration for market regulation in China. And we recently set the extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders to be held on April 27. In short, we continue to progress every day and remain on track to close the transaction in mid-2020. 
Our goal remains to build a new and even more robust and integrated global health care platform, one that will be balanced between returning capital to shareholders and investing more in innovative segments of the industry's value chain while maintaining our core commitment to improving patient access to medicines around the world. With this as our focus, and together with strong and consistent execution and delivering results, I continue to be very excited about the incredible value creation opportunity we expect for shareholders as a result of this combination. To be clear, Viatris will not be a Mylan 2.0. This is Viatris 1.0, which will benefit from the many additional opportunities not present within either Mylan or Upjohn on a stand-alone basis. 
As we continue to progress towards closing and the years beyond, I have been well aware of all of your continued interest and receiving more clarity on what are the -- what actually is the starting baseline financial targets for Viatris' first full year of operations in 2021. As I shared in the last quarter conference call and at the JPMorgan conference, I believe I have been very consistent in my focus for Viatris in 2021, its first full year of operations. We expect that the formal guidance will be delivered to you by Viatris' new management team, led by Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev at the close and at the appropriate time after the transaction closes. 
You can expect that the management team will, of course, be taken into consideration. All the known as well as potentially anticipated headwinds, whether it's the changes in China's health care system, which some are calling the China reset, the upcoming Lyrica and Celebrex loss of exclusivity in Japan and any other what-ifs at that time. Simply put, you should expect that the Viatris management team to deliver a 2021 baseline, representing a trough year from which the company can grow from. 
Looking ahead beyond that, Viatris will be creating a new global and unique Global Healthcare Gateway, which will offer many other biotech and spec pharma companies ready access to markets around the globe by leveraging our true, one-of-a-kind global infrastructure, making Viatris the true partner of choice for players often facing challenges and utilizing multiple, local or regional partners. We envision Viatris' unique Global Healthcare Gateway department to leverage our already existing enhanced scientific successes to date with our own research and development capabilities, as well as those future opportunities we expect to realize from the Viatris' Global Healthcare Gateway, partnering opportunities to more rapidly broaden our own product portfolio and future pipeline, including new business models to once again give the street confidence in Viatris' ability to grow. These are just a few of the additional growth opportunities not present within, again, either Mylan or Upjohn on a stand-alone basis. 
I would like to conclude by sharing what I mentioned at the JPMorgan conference last month. We believe that Viatris, with its new and unique profile, will be recognized for being at the forefront of establishing a new kind of global pharmaceutical player designed for where the health care industry is going, not where it has been.

Or maybe just give us a little bit more color on what the swing factors are that could leave us at either the high end or low end of that range. 
And then a second question, Robert, you talked about 2021 being kind of a trough year for the company and a baseline to grow off of. When you think about that comment, is that referring to EBITDA? Is that referring to sales? Or is that referring to both sales and EBITDA? I'm just trying to get a sense of, as we think about that year when you define trough, what are we thinking about there."

So there's no subtle message or inherent message about widening the range.

This is our opportunity to reset. And we, at the Board level, want to absolutely make sure that management's starting point has the best chance not just to meet but even to exceed.

And I really think, directionally, you have been doing a really good job in telegraphing. I think the trajectory of where Viatris will -- where it will be situated when it starts and the opportunities going forward. So I do appreciate the opportunity for me to embellish. I do think that the -- there will be opportunities for revenue, the starting point of revenue. I think that whatever that starting point of revenue is, some of you have directionally already picked up that the EBITDA, we have many levers to, I think, maintain a strong EBITDA base. We do intend on resetting the revenue base. And I do believe that there will be an opportunity to grow. I expect that management, I would like at the very minimum, for them to be able to provide a 3- to 5-year CAGR, both on top line and on EBITDA. And I think that we'll be able to deliver that in terms of what the trough year is over the 3- to 5-year time frame. 
And then, I do believe, again, something I think you've been out in front. This creation of this new Global Healthcare Gateway, I have to tell you, this has been in the works since 2016 for us. And the only reason why we didn't announce this before, I mean, obviously, if you saw what we were tied up with in 2016 with the whole EpiPen situation, and I think the street really, really missed the opportunity in 2018 because we were drowned out by all the noise, but it was the best year of science in Mylan's almost 60-year history. And as you could see, not only did we build a robust pipeline, but even some of the commentary that Rajiv made today, the 3 opportunities that we have in our pipeline. The reason why we couldn't actually announce the Global Healthcare Gateway that has been underway since 2016 is because without the Upjohn business and without really having critical mass in China, you really can't make that claim. We were simply dabbling in China, but Upjohn gave us the critical mass. 
So we will be building out an official department that will actually be in charge. It will be -- that department will be led by the new CEO, Michael Goettler. He will be driving that Global Healthcare Gateway. And I believe that all future capital allocation and all the disciplines that need to be around future capital allocations will be within that Global Healthcare Gateway. You can fully expect that our internal R&D, business development will be in very, very much competition of capital going forward against continuing debt repayment or share buyback or any other opportunities that we would have. But I do think that we have a number of levers, and I'm really excited once we get to close this and really establish the department of the Global Healthcare Gateway, I do think that we will be recognized as partner of choice and represent a real unique opportunity to bring ready access to other spec pharma companies to bring their products around the globe."

So I think that you're not actually off track. I think you've been kind of sort of spot on. And I think that's the way others directionally should be looking at it. I think, you, Randall, Chris, there's been several other analysts that I think have now been trying to understand 2021, and I want to make sure it's a trough year. That's why I think we need to go out to 2022. And we don't want to say it's a trough year and then set the numbers in a way where there's another step down. We've seen others do that in the sector, and we saw the punishment that they had to pay as a result of it. So again, you only get one time to reset. I want to bring as much clarity as we can or have management bring as much clarity as they can.

Many of the drivers within that are -- we're starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation initiatives. But I would also point out, just like we pointed it out for 2019 as well as 2018, that we continue to work on working capital velocity improvement initiatives. We've reduced our days working capital by probably 6 or 7 days over the last couple of years. Each day is about $40 million to Mylan. And so you can imagine, each day that we're able to organize the business around reducing that working capital requirement gives us another dollar, or in this case, $40 million per day to invest in their business and redeploy the capital appropriately. So the simple answer is, effectively, the same cash generation in 2020 supporting the new product launches but always focusing heavily on working capital improvements."

All in a lot -- I mean I think it's well-known that most of the intermediates do come from China. So all API suppliers are going to be affected, not just Mylan. We've been fortunate to vertically integrate and have a lot of our own API. But we still need to get the intermediates. And even some of the API that we have, we may sell some to third party. We buy some from third party.

And second, on biosimilars. Rajiv, if I look at the biosimilar adoptions of late entrant products, they actually look quite low for all the companies that enter kind of like second wave. You have a couple of products which are entering second wave or supply coming online after the market have already formed. Is your impression that in the biosimilar markets, you can catch up?

We launched ahead and you -- then share caught up pretty well. So -- and now -- but it does take time just by the -- because of the unique nature of this business and the channels.

And then second, just a very minor question, which is management had talked about the opportunity to move biosimilar BOTOX forward.

And I think you're spot on in the natural progression, especially started in Europe, where you had brand, which they call ethical drugs, and then brand generic and then generic. But what I -- and so we've discovered this and have been operating in that environment with all 3. And of course, we also discovered the importance of OTC, which we added that on, because each one of these markets, David, are actually driven by a different priority scheme. Some markets are actually driven by generics. Some markets are actually still driven by brand, and most markets accept brand generics. And believe it or not, OTC has its advantages just because of the relationship that the OTC rep has with pharmacies. It's a little bit different than when you're regulated both either in the brand or the generics. 
So I will tell you, in Europe, there's actually still quite a bit of -- especially Central and Eastern Europe, I wouldn't say that generics has taken the kind of hold yet that we believe that it will eventually take. But it's that learning that we have and what we've lived in Europe. And where I think you're insightful is that when you think about what Upjohn's bringing to the table, they have yet to experience, quite frankly, what it's like to go from a brand, maybe brand generics, but certainly not generics. So I think the skill set that we're going to be bringing them to the emerging market opportunities that we have, I think that will be one of the upside synergy values that I expect that we're going to gain when we bring the 2 organizations together. Rajiv, do you want to add something?"

But for the last 12 to 18 months, we've been talking about the fact that we're really looking at the right -- trying to find the right measure that we can talk to you about, about -- that is consistent with how we talk about the business internally. And that's why we're moving to an EBITDA measure, and it gives you some of the background for that. 
In doing so, what I also want to point out is that comes out a lot of the transformation work that we've been doing over the last year plus. And when I give you a little bit of color about that transformation work, it will help you to understand why we're maybe not giving as much specificity around gross margins versus SG&A rates because in that transformation work, we're really looking at economic profit on each one of our products in all the segments and all the businesses and all the markets around the world. And in doing so, as you can imagine, each product has a different gross margin profile. Depending on the nature, you just heard the discussion on the previous question around how the product is either marketed or represented or how much support it has to have for it, whether it be from a salesperson or from a tendering process, it may have a different SG&A rate. But what we're really trying to look at is we're trying to look at the bottom line operating margin, EBITDA profitability on each one of these products. 
Now that said, I will tell you that we don't anticipate significant movements in our gross margin rate from 2019 to 2020, or significant movements in our SG&A rate from 2019 to 2020. But we want to transition and help you transition to thinking about the business the way that we think about it, which is bottom line operating profitability on each one of the products that are in our portfolio, because that's how we're making decisions around the business today."

I would only simply ask for your patience because we are dealing within a highly complex integration. I'd just like to remind you that Pfizer was right in the midst of separating this business. They were probably only about 25% or 30% into their separation and -- when Mylan came along. So when you're doing a transaction like this, it's not a typical merger. This is a reverse Morris trust, where you do have 3 parties here. So there is the amount of work that is being done and why it's taking a little bit longer than maybe a typical transaction. It's extensive. And I can't even begin to tell you, daily, weekly, weekends, the amount of time that people are putting in to make sure that we are in a readiness mode from day 1. 
Now with that said, I will tell you that if you'll just be patient, we will have Michael, Sanjeev and Rajiv get around to shareholders more for -- not for really anything else but a meet and greet, I would say a get to know, anxious to have them meet together with all the analysts, with some of the shareholders. I think that would be proper, especially even before they come and even give the guidance so that you kind of get to know the individuals. I think we have a really good team. I have to tell you, it's taken some time to really pull together and coalesce this management team. They are tight. They are aligned. I think that they get stronger by the day, by the week. And again, I'd just ask -- I want to acknowledge your desire, but I would ask for your patience, and we will get around to you as quickly as we possibly can. Thank you."

I'd like to welcome everyone to Mylan's first quarter earnings call, including our Mylan and future Upjohn colleagues. 
As I begin, let me take a moment on behalf of Mylan to extend our deepest appreciation to all the health care workers and first responders who are working tirelessly around the globe to care for all those affected by the COVID-19 virus. I'd also like to sincerely thank our Mylan employees worldwide and their families for their remarkable resilience and determination they continue to show to help deliver on our mission of providing patients around the globe with continued access to much needed high-quality medicines. 
I will be turning the call over to Heather and the management team in a moment to discuss the quarter at hand, but first, either I or a member of our management team will also take this opportunity to address some of the questions and themes that I have received over time from shareholders and analysts, and I do really appreciate their inputs. We will address those questions either during our opening remarks or during today's Q&A session. 
While management will cover the effects of COVID-19 in our business and operations, I would like to share some high-level observations regarding the pandemic as a whole. I will also be providing an update on the status of our exciting combination with Pfizer's Upjohn business. 
As to COVID-19, since our last earnings call, the global landscape has changed significantly as a result of this pandemic. We all remember events in our lifetime that have left lasting impact on us as individuals, our communities and the world. This global pandemic is one of those moments. 
While the pandemic has brought significant challenges that will profoundly impact the global community for years to come, we are also witnessing incredible examples of human ingenuity, compassion, the extraordinarily talented efforts of health care professionals around the world and the critical importance, like never before, of the pharmaceutical industry during these unprecedented times. 
I also believe that we could be at the beginning of a resurgence of appreciation of the generic pharmaceutical industry and the critical value the industry delivers to the majority of the patient populations around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic only magnifies health care needs that we must meet by delivering both cost-effective therapies and targeted innovation. It is this unique and balanced profile that characterizes Viatris, which will be a leading role within the industry once we launch upon our closing later this year. 
Mylan, for its part, is deeply committed to continuing to support public health efforts as the pandemic evolves, and I am extremely proud that the one of a kind global platform we've built over the last decade has enabled us to do just that by continuing to deliver access to medicines around the world, even as supply chains across multiple industries and countries are challenged more than ever. Mylan achieves these things because we continue to remain intently focused on controlling what we can control and running our business safely and efficiently. It never ceases to amaze me at how Mylan and our dedicated workforce mobilizes to address challenges at hand, including those brought on by this pandemic. There are a couple of examples that bring to life some of the unique value proposition of Mylan's powerful global platform, coupled with its equally unique talented global workforce. 
For example, Mylan has already shown its ability to rapidly ramp up production to manufacture potential COVID-19 treatments in response to request of governments. 
Additionally, as many other innovative and biotech companies work to develop their own potential therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and given Mylan's rich experience in anti retrovirals, you can surely expect that Mylan will once again be in a readiness position to do its part to develop, partner, produce and soon scale up necessary medications, active ingredients in a matter of months, not years. 
Our ability to deliver on these unprecedented time frames is only possible as a result of Mylan's entrepreneurial spirit, vast global manufacturing and scientific platform, broad product portfolio covering nearly all therapeutic areas, including anti retrovirals, and by partnering with a broad scientific community all around the world, including CHAI, among others. 
Mylan has a long and successful history of partnerships with other companies. For example, we partnered with Gilead to help expand access to infectious disease medicines, including HIV, in the markets that they could not reach alone. From this partnership, we have licensed 9 medicines and distributed to nearly 10 million patients annually in more than 100 countries. 
These examples speak directly to the unique capabilities and nimbleness of Mylan's global diverse platform and the value we continue to bring to others by helping them expand their reach around the globe. 
Without speaking for other industries, I can certainly tell you that in the pharmaceutical industry, especially when needing to meet global health needs for medications, these kind of accomplishments simply could not occur with just 1 company or 1 country alone approach. This is exactly why Mylan built out its global platform in the first place, so that we can leverage our global resources and efficiently deliver high-quality medicines when and where needed. 
Now turning to a quick update on the status of our very exciting transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn business. To start, I think it's important to reiterate some of the clear fundamentals and substantial merits that this transaction has to offer. More specifically, one, this combination with Upjohn will not only enhance our global scale and geographical reach; but two, this combination will also accelerate Mylan's own stand-alone business plan by at least 3 to 5 years. Number three, this combination will create an even stronger business model, an operating platform with expanded commercial capabilities that will not only enhance our EBITDA, but our EBITDA margins as well, and generate much greater free cash flows. We also expect to garner an estimated $1 billion in annual cost synergies by the fourth full year after close, while at the same time pursuing more attractive revenue growth opportunities as well. Four, this combination will also create a much stronger financial profile by further strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility. We remain committed to rapidly delever and work towards our goal of 2.5x leverage ratio. And finally, five, Viatris will provide a greater focus on total shareholder return by creating a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation model, starting with our commitment to institute a dividend policy for Viatris after our first full quarter post close of at least 25% of our free cash flow. In addition, and as I've stated previously, I continue to believe that 2021 will be a trough year from which Viatris will establish a financial baseline to grow from. While we will not be giving guidance at this time, I do think that many, but not all analyst models, on both revenue and EBITDA ranges are directionally moving in the right place and consistent with where I believe 2021 may be coming together. But once again, official guidance will be given by the new Viatris management team led by Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev at the appropriate time. 
And when that occurs, I am even actually more excited about their having the opportunity to roll out and present to all of you, Viatris' new and unique global health care gateway. Importantly, this new global health care gateway will be powered by Viatris' unmatched global infrastructure and expertise, while also offering others the ability to further empower their own assets to reach more patients worldwide. 
By offering others access to Viatris' global health care gateway, which will include access to our global commercial reach across all channels, our global supply chain, our global expansive regulatory expertise and our global cost-efficient manufacturing platform, Viatris will be able to serve a unique sweet spot and tap a new reservoir of value creation as a new pathway for partners who would otherwise need to rely on either a fragmented or highly localized or regional expansion strategies of their own. You will hear more about this and why we believe Viatris will be the true partner of choice at the First Investor Day post close. 
Turning to integration planning, and although Heather and Rajiv will provide their own comments, from my own continued discussions and efforts in working with the future management team of Viatris, I am extremely pleased with their continued alignment and commitments to executing on the objectives that we have set forth in the roadmap to optimize total shareholder return. 
We will also be finding an opportunity for Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev to speak with shareholders and analysts directly at the appropriate time and as we monitor the evolution of the COVID-19 precautions, but certainly before closing. 
Also, you should know that our Extraordinary General meeting, EGM, for the Mylan shareholder vote to approve this transaction is currently scheduled to coincide with our Annual General Meeting, our AGM, on June 30. In addition to the shareholder approval at that meeting, the only outstanding third-party approvals at that point would require to close -- to close the transaction will be from the remaining reigning antitrust regulatory authorities. Hence, this is why we feel very confident at this time that we'll be able to close this transaction in the second half of this year. 
I look forward to answering your questions during the Q&A session, I'll now turn the call over to Heather for a comment at the quarter at hand."

We hope everyone listening today is staying safe and healthy as we continue to navigate these unprecedented times together. Our hearts and thoughts are with all of those who have been personally affected by COVID and all of the health care workers and first responders who continue to go above and beyond to help save lives. 
I'd also like to send a special message of gratitude to our entire Mylan family, especially our frontline workers. Due to their efforts, our manufacturing facilities have remained operational, and we've been able to continue meeting patients' needs even amid the challenges of a global pandemic. We recognize that the pharmaceutical industry, including Mylan, has a unique responsibility to help respond to public health needs during this time. Our efforts have been aimed at fulfilling those responsibilities on a number of fronts, including protecting the health and safety of our workforce, continuing to produce critically needed medicines, deploying our resources and expertise in the fight against COVID-19, supporting the communities in which we operate and maintaining the health of our overall business. Though the world around us has certainly changed, our mission remains the same. We've made extensive efforts to ensure supply continuity for critical medicines, ranging from maintenance treatments for chronic conditions to ICU drugs or anti effectives in short supply due to the increased demand related to COVID-19. We're also participating in clinical and prophylactic trials through which product donations, including the World Health Organization's global solidarity trial, and are continuing to evaluate additional opportunities to meet unmet needs. 
There's no doubt that COVID-19 has tested the strength of supply chains across multiple industries and countries. We all rely on a very global economy, especially when it comes to the availability of medicine. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we have received a number of inquiries regarding government's increasingly urgent interest in strengthening domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply. We have and will continue to spend time with legislators and regulators around the world on this important topic to hopefully help find the right balance between strategic supply and global needs. 
With all that said, I'd now like to turn to our first quarter results. Our performance came in with total revenues growing 5% or 8% on a constant currency basis. In addition, adjusted EBITDA improved 6% over the prior year, with strong adjusted free cash flow, especially for the first quarter, coming in at $357 million. Adjusted SG&A and capital expenditures came in lower than expectations, and our EBITDA margins were ahead of what we normally see during Q1. 
During the quarter, North America and Europe's performance more than compensated for our Rest of World segment, where COVID-19 impacts hit sooner than other parts of the globe. 
As we look forward, we're reaffirming our 2020 financial guidance as we continue to expect total revenues to be in the range of $11.5 to $12.5 billion, absorbing approximately $200 million of foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous expectations, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion, absorbing approximately $50 million of foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous expectations. These ranges account for COVID-19 impact forecasted through Q2 and assume that health care systems around the world will begin to resume their normal functions in the second half of 2020. This guidance also takes into account the fact that we are absorbing a delay in some of the benefits of our business transformation program because we paused certain restructuring elements of the plan due to COVID. 
Regarding the work we're doing to successfully close the transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn business, as Robert mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to achieve that milestone in the second half of 2020. To date, we have received antitrust regulatory clearances in 15 jurisdictions, including the recently announced conditional approval from the European Commission, and we continue to work collaboratively with regulatory agencies around the world in the remaining clearances. 
I'm impressed every day by the energy and motivation that the Mylan and Upjohn teams bring to the integration planning while also meeting their day-to-day and COVID-related responsibilities. I'm confident that Viatris will be well positioned to be a true partner of choice, especially as health systems globally grapple with the realities of evolving patient needs and new health care paradigm. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv, Tony and Ken to provide additional detail on the quarter and our COVID-19 response efforts."

I would like to begin by echoing Robert and Heather's thanks to our thousands of Mylan colleagues all over the world who have done above and beyond during this challenging time in support of our mission, esp",1206,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by echoing Robert and Heather's thanks to our thousands of Mylan colleagues all over the world who have done above and beyond during this challenging time in support of our mission, especially our frontline workers whose commitment and teamwork has enabled Mylan to continue its operations without missing a beat and respond to the need for certain critical medicines. 
During this unprecedented time, we have taken extraordinary measures to keep our operations safe so we can ensure continued supply of our medicines. A few examples include implementing social distancing within the plants, increased sanitization of common areas, temperature and symptoms monitoring and staggering shifts. 
I would like to take some time to address the inquiries that have come from various stakeholders around the impact of COVID-19 on our supply chain, especially given our relatively large presence in India. 
As you can see on Slide 5 in our earnings presentation, Mylan strategically has maintained a broad, diverse and resilient manufacturing footprint. Our 44 manufacturing facilities across 12 countries position us to maintain proximity to the key markets and help us maintain supply continuity even when the environment around us changes rapidly. Our top 50 products are supplied from 15 different countries and 30 different manufacturing locations. 
From an API point of view, not only are we vertically integrated for several key products, but we have also built strategic partnerships with our API suppliers and built in redundancies to mitigate disruption. Today, approximately half of our API come from India and China and the other half from North America, Europe and Rest of the World. 
In India, we have 19 manufacturing facilities located in 5 different states, which mitigates risk of disruption in any given part of the country. Similar to other countries, our operations in India did not experience much disruption. Even during the first week of lockdown, while rules regarding essential workers were being clarified, these sites saw minimal disruption. By the second to third week, Indian operations were back to normal. It's also worth noting that Mylan has not to date experienced any meaningful disruption from its more than 500 third-party supply partners located around the world. We are continuously monitoring our inventory levels of our raw materials and dosage forms and currently are in a strong position from a supply point of view to meet our customer needs across the globe. 
Turning to our first quarter results. We delivered $2.6 billion in total revenues which is an 8% constant currency growth versus the prior year. These results reflect solid underlying business performance and execution on recent launches. 
As you may expect, we did see increased demand due to COVID-19, which resulted in an increase in net positive consolidated revenues of approximately 2%, primarily coming from Europe. 
For North America, our net sales were $956 million, which is up 4% compared to the same period last year. Growth was largely driven by Wixela, a generic to Advair, which, as you may recall, was launched in the first quarter of 2019. We are also pleased to see that YupeLri, our nebulized once daily LAMA, achieved 87% share of nebulized LAMA market and a 13.7% share of long-acting nebulized market. 
In Europe, our net sales totaled $1 billion, which are up 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. Our strong quarterly performance was primarily driven by the higher net sales and volumes of existing products. For example, products such as Creon, Dymista, Brufen and [indiscernible], which is our biosimilar [ through ] Humira, showed double-digit growth due to the targeted investments in the key markets. 
In addition to the estimated impact of COVID-19, increased volumes were driven by the resolution of the supply disruptions in the prior year period. 
Moving on to the Rest of the World. Our net sales were $611 million. This is flat on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. The estimated negative impact from COVID-19 which resulted in a slightly weak performance in China and Japan was largely offset by strong performance of our anti retroviral franchise and new product sales, primarily in Australia. 
I would now like to share some key pipeline updates. I'll start with an update on our industry-leading comprehensive global biosimilar portfolio. Tony will later provide more detail from a commercial perspective. 
To begin, we remain on track with our expected approval of insulin glargine to support a midyear product launch. This quarter, Biocon's Malaysia's manufacturing facility received FDA pre-approval. With respect to the related patent litigation, we received a favorable tested court decision on March 9 and further IPR DCNs remain pending. We also continue to be engaged in active discussion with FDA on a viable pathway to obtain an interchangeable designation. 
In addition, we expect to launch our Eternacept product, which is our biosimilar to Enbrel, in the second half of this year in Europe. 
Our BLA and marking authorization for our biosimilar to Avastin is currently under review with FDA and European authorities. 
In addition, the development of our biosimilar to [indiscernible] and EYLEA remain on track. 
Also, as recently announced by [indiscernible] we are continuing discussions with them regarding the development of a biosimilar to BOTOX. We plan to provide an update on the path forward by May 31. 
Now, I will provide an update on some other pipeline products. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to deepen our pipeline with high-value product opportunities. I'm pleased to inform you that we have filed an IND application for MR-107A-01, which is being developed as a non narcotic oral analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain and we plan to initiate Phase II clinical studies this year. 
We also continue to progress the development of MR-106A-01, which is a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that's being developed as a topical product for burn wound treatments. This product will enter clinical development later this year. 
Lastly,  the Phase III study for our glatiramer acetate once a month program was initiated last October. This is a pivotal clinical study for the U.S. NDA. To date, the study enrollment has been progressing well with more than 170 patients dosed in the study across 56 sites. 
Regarding Morgantown, we have continued to make progress on our comprehensive and ongoing remediation efforts at the facility. And I'm pleased to share that FDA has determined the inspection classification of the site as voluntary action indicated, which changed from OAI. We are awaiting the formal closeout of the warning letter, which was issued in November 2018, and we expect to receive it at any time. 
Before I hand it over to Tony, I would also like to express my excitement about our continued progress with Upjohn on integration planning. I look forward to continuing to partner with Michael, Sanjeev and the future Viatris leaders as we plan this integration and create a new champion for global health. We are successfully managing the process virtually given the current environment and are taking advantage of the additional time to focus on executing a quality separation and integration planning program. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."

In terms of my remarks today, I'd like to elaborate on 2 topics. First, I'd like to provide [ a data union ] on our commercial efforts and share some further detail on how we are navigating our commercial business globally through the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, and also important, I'd like to begin today by highlighting our biosimilars franchise and share our path from science to commercialization of one of the industry's deepest product pipeline. 
To start with the current COVID-19 situation, our #1 priority continues to be the safety of our employees, including our dedicated sales force and commercial team of 7,500 people globally. In most countries, we have moved to a remote engagement model and have found new ways of doing business, relying heavily on technology and focusing efforts on connecting with health care professionals through various virtual tools. Through the impressive work of our sales team, we have completed nearly 200,000 interactions with health care providers over the past 8 weeks and continue to provide the same level of value support that our teams have always delivered. I'd like to personally thank these dedicated teams for their continued efforts and hard work during these complex times. 
Throughout this pandemic, we also continue to collaborate with pharmacies, hospitals, wholesalers, governments and health care providers to help address patient needs. We remain focused on ensuring customer and patient access to needed medicines and are closely monitoring volumes of critical products. Our service levels are currently strong, and I'm pleased to report that, to date, our customers have sufficient supply on hand in markets across geographies. 
Turning to our biosimilars franchise. We have always viewed this as an investment for the long-term and one made globally across many territories. As we have invested in our pipeline and successfully demonstrated the science behind these products, we knew the next important step was the focus on the commercialization strategy. We are in the beginning stages of this journey in most of the developed markets around the world, and we know we have much work to do. We are focusing on 2020 as a year of expansion as we've continued to increase our commercial footprint in the U.S. and abroad. Our initial focus for this stage was to scale the organization and ensure we were methodically optimizing the opportunity to meet demand and maintain stock as we began to introduce biosimilars to markets around the world. 
Now, with multiple global commercial launches underway and added learnings from our experiences in market, our focus has shifted to execution and strategic performance and we continue to look to grow our business and capitalize on new global opportunities. 
To provide a comprehensive look at where we are today, we offer one of the industry's largest and most diverse global biosimilars franchises which includes products either on the market or in development, focused on areas of oncology, immunology, endocrinology, ophthalmology and dermatology. We have received more than 150 marketing authorizations for biosimilar products in more than 85 countries worldwide. 
In the U.S., we've launched [indiscernible], a biosimilar to [ Neulasta ] and Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin and have strong confidence in our long-term capabilities from physician, payer and hospital standpoints to fully execute on both products throughout 2020 and the coming years. 
As Rajiv mentioned, we look forward to the anticipated approval and launch of [indiscernible], our insulin glargine, as we continue to expand our portfolio in this market. 
In Europe, we've launched [ Hulio ], a biosimilar to Humira, and we are beginning to launch process for Ogivri, [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] in various markets as we broaden our biosimilar franchise offerings in many European countries. 
In addition, as Rajiv noted, we are looking forward to launching [indiscernible], our biosimilar to Enbrel, following anticipated regulatory approval in the coming months. 
Other highlights include the recent launch of Fulphila in Canada, which extends our oncology portfolio there along with Ogivri. 
Additionally, in Australia, after being the first to offer biosimilar trastuzumab, we recently launched Fulphila there as well and are encouraged by the early market response. 
Overall, we continue to believe that our experience and ability to develop complex products and successfully commercialize these products on a global basis have positioned us to be a worldwide leader in the biosimilar space over the long term. We remain enthusiastic about this franchise and continue to look for opportunities to invest as well as expand our portfolio. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ken."

I'll take a few minutes to provide a summary of our financial results for the first quarter.  Q1 2020 total revenues of $2.6 billion were 5% higher than the prior year and 8% higher on a constant currency basis.",819,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide a summary of our financial results for the first quarter.  
Q1 2020 total revenues of $2.6 billion were 5% higher than the prior year and 8% higher on a constant currency basis. The consolidated results were favorably impacted by approximately 2% due to increased customer buying patterns and patient prescription trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of this impact was realized in Europe. In addition, total revenue growth reflects higher volumes of existing products and, to a lesser extent, new product sales of approximately $70 million, partially offset by lower pricing. 
In the first quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 54% in the same period last year. The decline is primarily the result of lower gross margin on sales of existing products in the rest of world as well as North America, partially offset by higher gross margin on sales of existing products in Europe, along with sales of new products in all 3 regions. 
From a segment profitability standpoint, North America increased 9% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This increase reflects contributions from new product sales, higher volumes and favorable product mix, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing on existing products due to changes in the competitive environment, including levothyroxine. 
Europe segment profitability also expanded, up 35% in the quarter, primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes, along with lower SG&A spending. 
Conversely, Rest of World segment profitability declined in the quarter, down 27%, as a result of lower pricing on existing products primarily due to governmental pricing reductions in Australia and Japan, and unfavorable product mix, which was partially offset by benefits from new product sales, along with higher ARB volumes. 
Both Europe and Rest of World segment profitability results were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. 
In Q1, adjusted R&D of $112 million was 19% lower compared to 2019 due to higher payments in the prior year period related to clinical activities for products and development. 
During the quarter, adjusted SG&A spending was lower than our expectations and essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting lower travel and promotional activities, primarily resulting from COVID-19-related travel restrictions and lower legal expenses, primarily offset by higher payroll related [indiscernible] 
In Q1, we reported adjusted net earnings of $467 million and adjusted EBITDA of $751 million, an increase of 11% and 6%, respectively. These increases versus the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the increase in our revenues and lower R&D spending, partially offset by negative foreign currency translation impacts. 
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2020, adjusted free cash flow was strong at $357 million, an increase of $330 million over the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by improvements in working capital velocity and timing of certain other payments. For the remainder of the year, we expect adjusted free cash flow to benefit from seasonally increasing profitability, coupled with the resulting reductions in net working capital from first quarter levels. 
At the end of Q1 2020, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.6x, in line with our expectation and our covenant requirements. We anticipate full year adjusted free cash flow generation consistent with 2019 levels and continue to target approximately $1 billion of debt repayment in 2020, starting with a scheduled maturity of EUR 500 million of bonds later this month. 
While we don't presently see any negative liquidity trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will certainly continue to monitor those trends very closely. 
We currently believe our positive cash flow from operations, along with our existing borrowing facilities, providing liquidity up to $2.6 billion, will allow us to meet our liquidity needs for the remainder of the year. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage. 
Finally, as you heard earlier, we're reaffirming our full year 2020 guidance that we provided this past February. Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, absorbing an estimated $200 million of foreign exchange headwind beyond our previous expectations. 
Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion, absorbing [indiscernible] [ $50 million  ] of foreign exchange headwinds beyond our previous expectations. 
It's important to note that both of these ranges reflect our current expectations for operational and commercial performance, as well as estimated COVID-related impacts continuing through the second quarter. 
Before I close, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to express my thanks to our incredible teams around the world who worked and continue to work tirelessly to deliver on our mission and our commitments while keeping themselves, their families and their coworkers safe and healthy. 
With that, we'll now open the call up for your questions. Erica?"

And how much do you think it will grow to the end of the year? Obviously, if you set it to yourself as a key goal, would be great to be able to track your performance against it.

These products are products that are sticky, they have long-term value and we truly look forward to not just launching we have but launching other products. As we outlined either late last year, early beginning of this year, we had $3 billion in revenues from products we're going to be launching up through 2023. And with that being said, although we're not giving guidance, you can continue to expect that biosimilars will be a very good portion of that value moving forward.

For quite some time, shareholders and analysts alike have been really focused in on our portfolio. When we first started building the portfolio, obviously, we were an unknown in the space. And the first thing we needed to do was demonstrate our science. Now that that's done, we are shifting completely to a commercial effort. I have to be very honest and clear. Yes, we have starts and stops. This is not, and I do think it would be a mistake for the investment community to look at this as a short-term measurement because we didn't invest in this franchise 9 or 10 years for the next 9 months. We invested because, as Tony said, this is a very sticky product. And also, to be frank, I think you guys have heard in the past, we did not get into this biosimilar franchise. Actually, for the United States, we didn't even think that the United States would come online so quickly. We thought it would come on afterwards. So we were very fortunate to be here first, but we do have a lot of work to do on the commercial end.

There are 2 things that I want to point out. 
One, in my beginning and opening remarks, I can't make it any more clear that once we come together with Pfizer's Upjohn business and create Viatris, we are completely changing the emphasis of our business model to total shareholder return, and a huge part of that, especially, I must respect the Pfizer shareholders as well. Because part of what was in our thinking is to make sure that, that dividend is not only are we committed to it, but I hope that we can grow that dividend over time. That is our strategy. We are deeply committed to this dividend as part of our more friendly shareholder allocation of capital going forward. And so I will -- so I hope -- I think between that change of business model and the fact that we're going to be taking in 57% of Pfizer shareholders, we are very, very committed. 
In terms of amount, we don't give a dollar amount, Umer boomer, but that 25% of free cash flow is a commitment of ours. And I think what you'll need to do is take the EBITDA. I think I've kind of sort of directionally given you guys where I think the right starting point is. And I think it's -- I do believe it's substantially higher than the $500 million that you are referencing, but I don't want to give a specific dollar because we're basing it off of our free cash flows."

Can you walk us through the bridge between the roughly $7.5 billion in pro forma EBITDA to the $4 billion in free cash flow. There seems like there's an undisclosed impairment charge. And given the tweaks on the business, are you comfortable with that $4 billion free cash flow number on a go-forward basis? 
And secondly, on gross margins, we noticed both in the U.S. and EU, margins were up year-over-year. But overall, gross margins were slightly down. Can you give us some color on what's driving this gap between the interest segment margins going up, but the overall gross margin is going down?"

So then you get down to cash flow, you actually have to take that back out. You get your tax rate applied to it. You have interest, and there's clearly going to be interest on the -- not only the existing Mylan debt, which is about $0.5 billion. There's going to be interest on the $12 billion of financing debt, and you can call that about the same amount, depending on where rates land. When you do that, you're going to end up -- you should end up very much right at the $4 billion number that you're trying to calculate to.

So not all 3 businesses are showing expanding operating margins, which is reflective of the gross margin trends, and that should get you to about 1 point of overall consolidated gross margin deterioration."

And I think, Greg, as it relates to biosimilars, just going back to this, this is really a long-term play for us, one that's not just U.S.-centric, but global. And as we see these launches happening throughout the world and in the U.S., products like Ogivri and Fulphila, we walked through kind of where we saw Fulphila at the end of '19 in terms of where our supply ceiling was, we're seeing that open up. We were concentrating on building that commercial infrastructure, how we built that foundation. And we're starting to see green sprouts. [indiscernible] share is up almost 3% this year in the U.S. We're seeing these kind of optimistic things happening, and we look forward to just growing them in 2020 and the years beyond."

So again, I want to be careful here, but you're exactly right, because I'm not actually giving guidance, and I'm trying to signal to all of you that what I see in 2021 is really not a surprise to me. It's what we've seen very early on as we were out way in front of some of the changes that were happening in China and we obviously were well aware of the LOEs going into this transaction. That's why if you look at the transaction, you look at the pricing of the transaction, you'll see that we fully incorporated a lot of what we see in front of us. So we didn't really have the opportunity to jump out in front and really articulate directionally where the business is going. And everybody started off by looking at Upjohn 2020. And that is why I've also given comments in the past to try to help the Street understand that it's not as simple as taking as 4s and adding them together and looking out into the future. There's -- as you bring companies together, there are many other moving pieces. And I think that the $18 billion, yes, I was directionally very comfortable. And I also think that the EBITDA, I don't see EBITDA coming down as much only because there's a number of offsets that I can see. So we're really thinking hard, and this is where this extra time has really helped, how we will be bringing the businesses back together. And then when we take a look at the transformation work that we're doing, that was already well underway at Mylan and now underway at Upjohn, and again I just feel that directionally, you are correct. One of the things I have to make sure and ensure and pressure test with management is making sure that, that starting point is a true baseline to grow from, where management, this new management has the best chance of coming -- I mean, you can see by the roadmap that we have out there, we have very explicit plans when it comes to execution, what is it that we need to execute on and how we're going to deliver that total shareholder return for our investors. So I think that, that [ $18 billion, $7 billion ] range roughly in that -- that kind of an area, that kind of is, I think, the right -- and I haven't changed on that. Even with what I see today, I haven't changed. If anything, I'm a little more confident as I continue to see things come together. But look, if you'll just be a little bit patient and let management come forth with very specific guidance with a lot of detail behind the guidance. And then also, I want to live up to the promise of the expectations that when management does come forth, I do think that they owe it to the investment community to share how exactly they're thinking about this global business, to do a walk around -- around each of the geographical territories, do swat analysis for you. And as they speak about how they're thinking about the business, then the next step should be, that should help you guys begin to build your models. And then I think there needs to be a discussion between management and the sell-side analysts and shareholders who are building models to make sure how we're thinking about the business, what disclosures and how transparent we can be, because we absolutely want to be as transparent as we could without hurting our competitive landscape. So please expect that we're still going to go through that process. And it's just a process. But it's an exciting process and one that we're looking forward to working together with you on."

We -- more importantly, our focus has been on the continuity of supply, supply of the critical products, supply of the important, how can we meet the surge, some ICU critical products, how the demands have increased, so we have kept our focus on that.

And it is something that we've been watching for the last several months.

We will not be addressing certain programs that require impact on employees for all the reasons that you would want us to put those on hold. There are parts of our restructuring program that can continue, preparatory phases, looking at certain parts of our supply chain and our operational chain. So those will continue. 
On the question of cost, besides the payroll costs, we do have buckets of costs that are variable in nature, whether it be travel, which I called out, advertising and promotions, meeting expenses, things such as that, along with other parts of our spend that is discretionary or, I would say, more discretionary and flexible in nature. With what's going on, some of that naturally reduces. I'm sure you see the same thing just like we do. People are not traveling. People are not getting on airplanes. People are doing much more by conferencing and tele calls and things such as that. So we have a measurable bucket of cost in this business that will move favorably with us. I would also remind you that our business transformation activities are anticipated, and that extends beyond our restructuring program, but it is a part of our restructuring program. Those will continue to occur as we move throughout the year, those parts of the business transformation that relates to products and evaluation of products that remain in the portfolio. So I think with the mix of all that, without giving you specific numbers on that, we believe that there is plenty of room to kind of manage with what we see with COVID in our current outlook extending through the second quarter to manage our cost base in relation to the current environment."

I think that, David, what I'm trying to focus on is, one, I think that the company is going to go through [ 2 ] stages for a potential rerate. I think, one, we have to get to closing. That's the very first thing we need to do. You can talk about paying the dividend, but until you actually are in a position you start paying it, I think there's that wait. So I want to be very clear about our commitment, and I'm glad that Umer asked the question that he did. And I think people are much closer when it comes to the dividend, even though I'm not going to give an exact number but commit to 25% of free cash flows. I actually think people are much closer to what they've anticipated then the number that Umer put out that some people are thinking about. But I think once we close and we're actually formed Viatris, and we have that right starting point and people actually can see the new financial profile, I mean we are already stronger from a financial profile than any one of our -- any one in our sector right now. Imagine when we bring Mylan together with the Pfizer Upjohn business. When you take a look at that balance sheet and you take a look at our cash generation and you take a look at our friendly shareholder capital allocation, I'm just telling you right off the bat, I do think that will be the first time we'll get the first rerate. But the second re-rate will come, and the one i think it's going to be most impactful is when management can outline a 3- to 5-year CAGR off of that '21 trough number and put [ lakes ] behind underneath that 3- to 5-year CAGR, be very explicit about how you're going to hit those growth rates both in 3 to 5 years. What do we already have in-house? What are we relying upon? And then I think once the investment community really gets comfortable with the stabilization and the consistency quarter after quarter of the baseline profile, and then they start to see some vision where there's actually -- they can actually see how we're going to get the growth, then I really think that the multiple that our company really deserves will materialize, but it has to happen in steps. That's not going to happen overnight and certainly not going to happen over our looks. But I want to thank you for that question because I can only say that I'm looking at 2022, but more so to ensure that 2021 is really going to be that trough year."

I'd like to welcome everyone to Mylan's first quarter earnings call, including our Mylan and future Upjohn colleagues. 
As I begin, let me take a moment on behalf of Mylan to extend our deepest appreciation to all the health care workers and first responders working tirelessly around the globe to care for all those affected by the COVID-19 virus. I'd also like to sincerely thank our Mylan employees worldwide and their families for their remarkable resilience and determination they continue to show to help deliver on our mission of providing patients around the globe with continued access to much needed high-quality medicines. 
I will be turning the call over to Heather and the management team in a moment to discuss the quarter at hand, but first, either I or a member of our management team will also take this opportunity to address some of the questions and themes that I have received over time from shareholders and analysts, and I do really appreciate their inputs. We will address those questions either during our opening remarks or during today's Q&A session. 
While management will cover the effects of COVID-19 in our business and operations, I would like to share some high-level observations regarding the pandemic as a whole. I will also be providing an update on the status of our exciting combination with Pfizer's Upjohn business. 
As to COVID-19, since our last earnings call, the global landscape has changed significantly as a result of this pandemic. We all remember events in our lifetime that have left lasting impact on us as individuals, our communities and the world. This global pandemic is one of those moments. 
While the pandemic has brought significant challenges that will profoundly impact the global community for years to come, we are also witnessing incredible examples of human ingenuity, compassion, the extraordinarily talented efforts of health care professionals around the world and the critical importance, like never before, of the pharmaceutical industry during these unprecedented times. 
I also believe that we could be at the beginning of a resurgence of appreciation of the generic pharmaceutical industry and the critical value the industry delivers to the majority of the patient populations around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic only magnifies health care needs that we must meet by delivering both cost-effective therapies and targeted innovation. It is this unique and balanced profile that characterizes Viatris, which will be a leading role within the industry once we launch upon our closing later this year. 
Mylan, for its part, is deeply committed to continuing to support public health efforts as the pandemic evolves, and I am extremely proud that the one of a kind global platform we've built over the last decade has enabled us to do just that by continuing to deliver access to medicines around the world, even as supply chains across multiple industries and countries are challenged more than ever. 
Mylan achieves these things because we continue to remain intently focused on controlling what we can control and running our business safely and efficiently. It never ceases to amaze me at how Mylan and our dedicated workforce mobilizes to address challenges at hand, including those brought on by this pandemic. There are a couple of examples that bring to life some of the unique value proposition of Mylan's powerful global platform, coupled with its equally unique talented global workforce. For example, Mylan has already shown its ability to rapidly ramp up production to manufacture potential COVID-19 treatments in response to request of governments. 
Additionally, as many other innovative and biotech companies work to develop their own potential therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and given Mylan's rich experience in antiretrovirals, you can surely expect that Mylan will once again be in a readiness position to do its part to develop, partner, produce and soon scale up necessary medications, active ingredients in a matter of months, not years. 
Our ability to deliver on these unprecedented time frames is only possible as a result of Mylan's entrepreneurial spirit, vast global manufacturing and scientific platform, broad product portfolio covering nearly all therapeutic areas, including antiretrovirals, and by partnering with a broad scientific community all around the world, including CHAI, among others. 
Mylan has a long and successful history of partnerships with other companies. For example, we partnered with Gilead to help expand access to infectious disease medicines, including HIV, in the markets that they could not reach alone. From this partnership, we have licensed 9 medicines and distributed to nearly 10 million patients annually in more than 100 countries. 
These examples speak directly to the unique capabilities and nimbleness of Mylan's global diverse platform and the value we continue to bring to others by helping them expand their reach around the globe. 
Without speaking for other industries, I can certainly tell you that in the pharmaceutical industry, especially when needing to meet global health needs for medications, these kind of accomplishments simply could not occur with just one company or one country alone approach. This is exactly why Mylan built out its global platform in the first place, so that we can leverage our global resources and efficiently deliver high-quality medicines when and where needed. 
Now turning to a quick update on the status of our very exciting transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn business. To start, I think it's important to reiterate some of the clear fundamentals and substantial merits that this transaction has to offer. More specifically, one, this combination with Upjohn will not only enhance our global scale and geographical reach; but two, this combination will also accelerate Mylan's own stand-alone business plan by at least 3 to 5 years. Number three, this combination will create an even stronger business model, an operating platform with expanded commercial capabilities that will not only enhance our EBITDA, but our EBITDA margins as well, and generate much greater free cash flows. We also expect to garner an estimated $1 billion in annual cost synergies by the fourth full year after close, while at the same time pursuing more attractive revenue growth opportunities as well. Four, this combination will also create a much stronger financial profile by further strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility. We remain committed to rapidly delever and work towards our goal of 2.5x leverage ratio. And finally, five, Viatris will provide a greater focus on total shareholder return by creating a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation model, starting with our commitment to institute a dividend policy for Viatris after our first full quarter post close of at least 25% of our free cash flow. 
In addition, and as I've stated previously, I continue to believe that 2021 will be a trough year from which Viatris will establish a financial baseline to grow from. While we will not be giving guidance at this time, I do think that many, but not all analyst models, on both revenue and EBITDA ranges are directionally moving in the right place and consistent with where I believe 2021 may be coming together. But once again, official guidance will be given by the new Viatris management team led by Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev at the appropriate time. 
And when that occurs, I am even actually more excited about they're having the opportunity to roll out and present to all of you, Viatris' new and unique global health care gateway. Importantly, this new global health care gateway will be powered by Viatris' unmatched global infrastructure and expertise, while also offering others the ability to further empower their own assets to reach more patients worldwide. 
By offering others access to Viatris' global health care gateway, which will include access to our global commercial reach across all channels, our global supply chain, our global expansive regulatory expertise and our global cost-efficient manufacturing platform, Viatris will be able to serve a unique sweet spot and tap a new reservoir of value creation as a new pathway for partners who would otherwise need to rely on either a fragmented or highly localized or regional expansion strategies of their own. You will hear more about this and why we believe Viatris will be the true partner of choice at the first Investor Day post close. 
Turning to integration planning, and although Heather and Rajiv will provide their own comments, from my own continued discussions and efforts in working with the future management team of Viatris, I am extremely pleased with their continued alignment and commitments to executing on the objectives that we have set forth in the roadmap to optimize total shareholder return. 
We will also be finding an opportunity for Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev to speak with shareholders and analysts directly at the appropriate time and as we monitor the evolution of the COVID-19 precautions, but certainly before closing. 
Also, you should know that our extraordinary general meeting, EGM, for the Mylan shareholder vote to approve this transaction is currently scheduled to coincide with our Annual General Meeting, our AGM, on June 30. In addition to the shareholder approval at that meeting, the only outstanding third-party approvals at that point would require to close -- to close the transaction will be from the remaining antitrust regulatory authorities. Hence, this is why we feel very confident at this time that we'll be able to close this transaction in the second half of this year. 
I look forward to answering your questions during the Q&A session, I'll now turn the call over to Heather for a comment at the quarter at hand."

We hope everyone listening today is staying safe and healthy as we continue to navigate these unprecedented times together. Our hearts and thoughts are with all of those who've been personally affected by COVID and all of the health care workers and first responders who continue to go above and beyond to help save lives. 
I'd also like to send a special message of gratitude to our entire Mylan family, especially our frontline workers. Due to their efforts, our manufacturing facilities have remained operational, and we've been able to continue meeting patients' needs even amid the challenges of a global pandemic. We recognize that the pharmaceutical industry, including Mylan, has a unique responsibility to help respond to public health needs during this time. 
Our efforts have been aimed at fulfilling those responsibilities on a number of fronts, including protecting the health and safety of our workforce, continuing to produce critically-needed medicines, deploying our resources and expertise in the fight against COVID-19, supporting the communities in which we operate and maintaining the health of our overall business. Though the world around us has certainly changed, our mission remains the same. 
We've made extensive efforts to ensure supply continuity for critical medicines, ranging from maintenance treatments for chronic conditions to ICU drugs or anti-infectives in short supply due to the increased demand related to COVID-19. 
We're also participating in clinical and prophylactic trials through which product donations, including the World Health Organization's global solidarity trial, and are continuing to evaluate additional opportunities to meet unmet needs. 
There's no doubt that COVID-19 has tested the strength of supply chains across multiple industries and countries, we all rely on a very global economy, especially when it comes to the availability of medicine. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we have received a number of inquiries regarding government's increasingly urgent interest in strengthening domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply. We have and will continue to spend time with legislators and regulators around the world on this important topic to hopefully help find the right balance between strategic supply and global needs. 
With all that said, I'd now like to turn to our first quarter results. Our performance came in with total revenues growing 5% or 8% on a constant currency basis. In addition, adjusted EBITDA improved 6% over the prior year, with strong adjusted free cash flow, especially for the first quarter, coming in at $357 million. Adjusted SG&A and capital expenditures came in lower than expectations, and our EBITDA margins were ahead of what we normally see during Q1. 
During the quarter, North America and Europe's performance more than compensated for our Rest of World segment, where COVID-19 impacts hit sooner than other parts of the globe. 
As we look forward, we're reaffirming our 2020 financial guidance as we continue to expect total revenues to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, absorbing approximately $200 million of foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous expectations, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion, absorbing approximately $50 million of foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous expectations. 
These ranges account for COVID-19 impact forecasted through Q2 and assume that health care systems around the world will begin to resume their normal functions in the second half of 2020. This guidance also takes into account the fact that we are absorbing a delay in some of the benefits of our business transformation program because we paused certain restructuring elements of the plan due to COVID. 
Regarding the work we're doing to successfully close the transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn business, as Robert mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to achieve that milestone in the second half of 2020. To date, we have received antitrust regulatory clearances in 15 jurisdictions, including the recently announced conditional approval from the European Commission, and we continue to work collaboratively with regulatory agencies around the world in the remaining clearances. 
I'm impressed every day by the energy and motivation that the Mylan and Upjohn teams bring to the integration planning, while also meeting their day-to-day and COVID-related responsibilities. I'm confident that Viatris will be well positioned to be a true partner of choice, especially as health systems globally grapple with the realities of evolving patient needs and new health care paradigm. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv, Tony and Ken to provide additional detail on the quarter and our COVID-19 response efforts."

I would like to begin by echoing Robert and Heather's thanks to our thousands of Mylan colleagues all over the world who have done above and beyond during this challenging time in support of our mission, especially our frontline workers whose commitment and teamwork has enabled Mylan to continue its operations without missing a beat and respond to the need for certain critical medicines. 
During this unprecedented time, we have taken extraordinary measures to keep our operations safe so we can ensure continued supply of our medicines. A few examples include implementing social distancing within the plants, increased sanitization of common areas, temperature and symptoms monitoring and staggering shifts. 
I would like to take some time to address the inquiries that have come from various stakeholders around the impact of COVID-19 on our supply chain, especially given our relatively large presence in India. 
As you can see on Slide 5 in our earnings presentation, Mylan strategically has maintained a broad, diverse and resilient manufacturing footprint. Our 44 manufacturing facilities across 12 countries position us to maintain proximity to the key markets and help us maintain supply continuity even when the environment around us changes rapidly. Our top 50 products are supplied from 15 different countries and 30 different manufacturing locations. 
From an API point of view, not only are we vertically integrated for several key products, but we have also built strategic partnerships with our API suppliers and built in redundancies to mitigate disruption. Today, approximately half of our API come from India and China and the other half from North America, Europe and Rest of the World. 
In India, we have 19 manufacturing facilities located in 5 different states, which mitigates risk of disruption in any given part of the country. Similar to other countries, our operations in India did not experience much disruption. Even during the first week of lockdown, while rules regarding essential workers were being clarified, these sites saw minimal disruption. By the second to third week, Indian operations were back to normal. 
It's also worth noting that Mylan has not to date experienced any meaningful disruption from its more than 500 third-party supply partners located around the world. We are continuously monitoring our inventory levels of our raw materials and dosage forms and currently are in a strong position from a supply point of view to meet our customer needs across the globe. 
Turning to our first quarter results. We delivered $2.6 billion in total revenues, which is an 8% constant currency growth versus the prior year. These results reflect solid underlying business performance and execution on recent launches. 
As you may expect, we did see increased demand due to COVID-19, which resulted in an increase in net positive consolidated revenues of approximately 2%, primarily coming from Europe. 
For North America, our net sales were $956 million, which is up 4% compared to the same period last year. Growth was largely driven by Wixela, a generic to Advair, which, as you may recall, was launched in the first quarter of 2019. We are also pleased to see that YupeLri, our nebulized once-daily LAMA, achieved 87% share of nebulized LAMA market and a 13.7% share of long-acting nebulized market. 
In Europe, our net sales totaled $1 billion, which are up 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. Our strong quarterly performance was primarily driven by the higher net sales and volumes of existing products. For example, products such as Creon, Dymista, Brufen and Hulio, which is our biosimilar to Humira, showed double-digit growth due to the targeted investments in the key markets. 
In addition to the estimated impact of COVID-19, increased volumes were driven by the resolution of the supply disruptions in the prior year period. 
Moving on to the Rest of the World. Our net sales were $611 million. This is flat on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. The estimated negative impact from COVID-19, which resulted in a slightly weak performance in China and Japan was largely offset by strong performance of our antiretroviral franchise and new product sales, primarily in Australia. 
I would now like to share some key pipeline updates. I'll start with an update on our industry-leading comprehensive global biosimilar portfolio. Tony will later provide more detail from a commercial perspective. 
To begin, we remain on track with our expected approval of insulin glargine to support a midyear product launch. This quarter, Biocon's Malaysia's manufacturing facility received FDA pre-approval. With respect to the related patent litigation, we received a favorable test of court decision on March 9 and further IPR decisions remain pending. We also continue to be engaged in active discussion with FDA on a viable pathway to obtain an interchangeable designation. 
In addition, we expect to launch our Etanercept product, which is our biosimilar to Enbrel, in the second half of this year in Europe. Our BLA and marking authorization for our biosimilar to Avastin is currently under review with FDA and European authorities. 
In addition, the development of our biosimilar to aspart and EYLEA remain on track. 
Also, as recently announced by Revance, we are continuing discussions with them regarding the development of a biosimilar to BOTOX. We plan to provide an update on the path forward by May 31. 
Now, I will provide an update on some other pipeline products. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to deepen our pipeline with high-value product opportunities. I'm pleased to inform you that we have filed an IND application for MR-107A-01, which is being developed as a non-narcotic oral analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain and we plan to initiate Phase II clinical studies this year. 
We also continue to progress the development of MR-106A-01, which is a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that's being developed as a topical product for burn wound treatments. This product will enter clinical development later this year. 
Lastly, the Phase III study for our glatiramer acetate once-a-month program was initiated last October. This is a pivotal clinical study for the U.S. NDA. To date, the study enrollment has been progressing well with more than 170 patients dosed in the study across 56 sites. 
Regarding Morgantown, we have continued to make progress on our comprehensive and ongoing remediation efforts at the facility. And I'm pleased to share that FDA has determined the inspection classification of the site as voluntary action indicated, which changed from OAI. We are awaiting the formal closeout of the warning letter, which was issued in November 2018, and we expect to receive it at any time. 
Before I hand it over to Tony, I would also like to express my excitement about our continued progress with Upjohn on integration planning. I look forward to continuing to partner with Michael, Sanjeev and the future Viatris leaders as we plan this integration and create a new champion for global health. 
We are successfully managing the process virtually given the current environment and are taking advantage of the additional time to focus on executing a quality separation and integration planning program. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."

In terms of my remarks today, I'd like to elaborate on 2 topics. First, I'd like to provide a state of the union on our commercial efforts and share some further detail on how we are navigating our commercial business globally through the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, and also important, I'd like to begin today by highlighting our biosimilars franchise and share our path from science to commercialization of one of the industry's deepest product pipeline. 
To start with the current COVID-19 situation, our #1 priority continues to be the safety of our employees, including our dedicated sales force and commercial team of 7,500 people globally. In most countries, we have moved to a remote engagement model and have found new ways of doing business, relying heavily on technology and focusing efforts on connecting with health care professionals through various virtual tools. 
Through the impressive work of our sales team, we have completed nearly 200,000 interactions with health care providers over the past 8 weeks and continue to provide the same level of value support that our teams have always delivered. I'd like to personally thank these dedicated teams for their continued efforts and hard work during these complex times. 
Throughout this pandemic, we also continue to collaborate with pharmacies, hospitals, wholesalers, governments and health care providers to help address patient needs. We remain focused on ensuring customer and patient access to needed medicines and are closely monitoring volumes of critical products. Our service levels are currently strong, and I'm pleased to report that, to date, our customers have sufficient supply on hand in markets across geographies. 
Turning to our biosimilars franchise. We have always viewed this as an investment for the long-term and one made globally across many territories. As we have invested in our pipeline and successfully demonstrated the science behind these products, we knew the next important step was the focus on the commercialization strategy. We are in the beginning stages of this journey in most of the developed markets around the world, and we know we have much work to do. 
We are focusing on 2020 as a year of expansion as we've continued to increase our commercial footprint in the U.S. and abroad. Our initial focus for this stage was to scale the organization and ensure we were methodically optimizing the opportunity to meet demand and maintain stock as we began to introduce biosimilars to markets around the world. 
Now, with multiple global commercial launches underway and added learnings from our experiences in markets, our focus has shifted to execution and strategic performance and we continue to look to grow our business and capitalize on new global opportunities. 
To provide a comprehensive look at where we are today, we offer one of the industry's largest and most diverse global biosimilars franchises, which includes products, either on the market or in development, focused on areas of oncology, immunology, endocrinology, ophthalmology and dermatology. We have received more than 150 marketing authorizations for biosimilar products in more than 85 countries worldwide. 
In the U.S., we've launched Fulphila, a biosimilar to Neulasta, and Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin and have strong confidence in our long-term capabilities from physician, payer and hospital standpoints to fully execute on both products throughout 2020 and the coming years. 
As Rajiv mentioned, we look forward to the anticipated approval and launch of Semglee, our insulin glargine, as we continue to expand our portfolio in this market. 
In Europe, we've launched Hulio, a biosimilar to Humira, and we are beginning to launch process for Ogivri, Semglee and Fulphila in various markets as we broaden our biosimilar franchise offerings in many European countries. 
In addition, as Rajiv noted, we are looking forward to launching Etanercept, our biosimilar to Enbrel, following anticipated regulatory approval in the coming months. 
Other highlights include the recent launch of Fulphila in Canada, which extends our oncology portfolio there along with Ogivri. 
Additionally, in Australia, after being the first to offer biosimilar trastuzumab, we recently launched Fulphila there as well and are encouraged by the early market response. 
Overall, we continue to believe that our experience and ability to develop complex products and successfully commercialize these products on a global basis have positioned us to be a worldwide leader in the biosimilar space over the long term. We remain enthusiastic about this franchise and continue to look for opportunities to invest as well as expand our portfolio. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ken."
290203,665378120,1980653,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 11, 2020",2020-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide a summary of our financial results for the first quarter.  Q1 2020 total revenues of $2.6 billion were 5% higher than the prior year and 8% higher on a constant currency basis.",817,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide a summary of our financial results for the first quarter.  
Q1 2020 total revenues of $2.6 billion were 5% higher than the prior year and 8% higher on a constant currency basis. The consolidated results were favorably impacted by approximately 2% due to increased customer buying patterns and patient prescription trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of this impact was realized in Europe. 
In addition, total revenue growth reflects higher volumes of existing products and, to a lesser extent, new product sales of approximately $70 million, partially offset by lower pricing. 
In the first quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 54% in the same period last year. The decline is primarily the result of lower gross margin on sales of existing products in the rest of world as well as North America, partially offset by higher gross margin on sales of existing products in Europe, along with sales of new products in all 3 regions. 
From a segment profitability standpoint, North America increased 9% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This increase reflects contributions from new product sales, higher volumes and favorable product mix, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing on existing products due to changes in the competitive environment, including levothyroxine. 
Europe segment profitability also expanded, up 35% in the quarter, primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes, along with lower SG&A spending. 
Conversely, Rest of World segment profitability declined in the quarter, down 27%, as a result of lower pricing on existing products primarily due to governmental pricing reductions in Australia and Japan, and unfavorable product mix, which was partially offset by benefits from new product sales, along with higher ARB volumes. Both Europe and Rest of World segment profitability results were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. 
In Q1, adjusted R&D of $112 million was 19% lower compared to 2019 due to higher payments in the prior year period related to clinical activities for products and development. 
During the quarter, adjusted SG&A spending was lower than our expectations and essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting lower travel and promotional activities, primarily resulting from COVID-19-related travel restrictions and lower legal expenses, primarily offset by higher payroll related expenses.
In Q1, we reported adjusted net earnings of $467 million and adjusted EBITDA of $751 million, an increase of 11% and 6%, respectively. These increases versus the prior year, primarily reflect the impact of the increase in our revenues and lower R&D spending, partially offset by negative foreign currency translation impacts. 
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2020, adjusted free cash flow was strong at $357 million, an increase of $330 million over the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by improvements in working capital velocity and timing of certain other payments. For the remainder of the year, we expect adjusted free cash flow to benefit from seasonally increasing profitability, coupled with the resulting reductions in net working capital from first quarter levels. 
At the end of Q1 2020, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.6x, in line with our expectation and our covenant requirements. We anticipate full year adjusted free cash flow generation consistent with 2019 levels and continue to target approximately $1 billion of debt repayment in 2020, starting with a scheduled maturity of EUR 500 million of bonds later this month. 
While we don't presently see any negative liquidity trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will certainly continue to monitor those trends very closely. 
We currently believe our positive cash flow from operations, along with our existing borrowing facilities, providing liquidity up to $2.6 billion, will allow us to meet our liquidity needs for the remainder of the year. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage. 
Finally, as you heard earlier, we're reaffirming our full year 2020 guidance that we provided this past February. Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, absorbing an estimated $200 million of foreign exchange headwind beyond our previous expectations. 
Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion, absorbing approximately $50 million of foreign exchange headwinds beyond our previous expectations. 
It's important to note that both of these ranges reflect our current expectations for operational and commercial performance, as well as estimated COVID-related impacts continuing through the second quarter. 
Before I close, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to express my thanks to our incredible teams around the world who worked and continue to work tirelessly to deliver on our mission and our commitments, while keeping themselves, their families and their coworkers safe and healthy. 
With that, we'll now open the call up for your questions. Erica?"

Could you share with us roughly what is your current run rate for biosimilars in the first quarter and how much you think it will grow to the end of the year? Obviously, if you set it to yourself as a key goal, it would be great to be able to track your performance against it. 
And related, you've mentioned interchangeability for Lantus, I guess the question is, are we looking for the launch of both the vial and the pen at the same time? And do you expect interchangeability potentially in both or just one of them?"

As we continue to launch these products, not just the run rate we're seeing in the quarter or the year for 2020 but for the long term. These products are products that are sticky. They have long-term value, and we truly look forward to not just launching we have but launching other products. As we outlined either late last year, early the beginning of this year, we had $3 billion in revenues from products we're going to be launching up through 2023. And with that being said, although we're not giving guidance, you can continue to expect that biosimilars will be a very good portion of that value moving forward. 
I think the next question was re Lantus?"

And thanks for your expression at the beginning of your question. We do -- we really do appreciate it. I would only ask you, yes, we highlighted the biosimilar franchise because that's really what it is, a franchise. For quite some time, shareholders and analysts alike have been really focused in on our portfolio. When we first started building the portfolio, obviously, we were an unknown in the space. And the first thing we needed to do was demonstrate our science. Now that that's done, we are shifting completely to a commercial effort. I have to be very honest and clear. Yes, we have starts and stops. This is not, and I do think it would be a mistake for the investment community to look at this as a short-term measurement because we didn't invest in this franchise 9 or 10 years for the next 9 months. We invested because, as Tony said, this is a very sticky product. 
And also, to be frank, I think you guys have heard in the past, we did not get into this biosimilar franchise. Actually, for the United States, we didn't even think that the United States would come online so quickly. We thought it would come on afterwards. So we were very fortunate to be here first, but we do have a lot of work to do on the commercial end. And you can expect, because of the long-term nature of this franchise, that we're going to continue to put in the type of improvements that are necessary to make sure that we get our value proposition out of our investment."

Because when we hit that reset button, there cannot be variability in execution. There needs to be a constant, at the very minimum meet or exceed quarter after quarter in order to restore confidence back in the sentiment of this very strong and powerful platform's ability to generate substantial and durable cash flows. 
I will tell you, this pandemic, as perverse as what I'm going to say, there are silver linings. I -- we can't control what we can't control. And unfortunately, this pandemic was thrown in us. So I am constantly trying to find silver linings and pick those silver linings out. A couple of them is, one, I believe that, that confidence that I'm conveying to you has been in large part because of the delay in the -- as a result of this pandemic.

Because part of what is -- was in our thinking is to make sure that, that dividend is, not only are we committed to it, but I hope that we can grow that dividend over time. That is our strategy. We are deeply committed to this dividend as part of our more friendly shareholder allocation of capital going forward. And so I will -- so I hope -- I think between that change of business model and the fact that we're going to be taking in 57% of Pfizer shareholders, we are very, very committed. 
In terms of amount, we don't give a dollar amount, Umer, but that 25% of free cash flow is a commitment of ours. And I think what you'll need to do is take the EBITDA. I think I've kind of sort of directionally given you guys where I think the right starting point is. And I think it's -- I do believe it's substantially higher than the $500 million that you are referencing. But I don't want to give a specific dollar because we're basing it off of our free cash flows."

Can you walk us through the bridge between the roughly $7.5 billion in pro forma EBITDA to the $4 billion in free cash flow. There seems like there's an undisclosed impairment charge. And given the tweaks on the business, are you comfortable with that $4 billion free cash flow number on a go-forward basis? 
And secondly, on gross margins, we noticed both in the U.S. and EU, margins were up year-over-year. But overall, gross margins were slightly down. Can you give us some color on what's driving this gap between the interest segment margins going up but the overall gross margin is going down?"

On the difference between the cash flow and the EBITDA number, it's the typical items that run through there. It's depreciation and amortization that's added back, right? So then you get down to cash flow, you actually have to take that back out. You get your tax rate applied to it. You have interest, and there's clearly going to be interest on the -- not only the existing Mylan debt, which is about $0.5 billion. There's going to be interest on the $12 billion of financing debt. And you can call that about the same amount, depending on where rates land. When you do that, you're going to end up -- you should end up very much right at the $4 billion number that you're trying to calculate to. So it's the typical items that would take you from EBITDA right down. I don't see -- I don't think there's anything related to -- I know there's nothing related to anticipated impairment charges in that math."

Whereas in the Rest of World segment, the operating margins in that business, and that's shown on the chart that's included in our earnings material, declined a bit. I think about 300 basis points year-over-year driven by the details that we called out, including stronger volumes of ARB, which tends to be a lower gross margin part of the business, combined with the pricing changes, the governmental pricing changes in Australia and Japan. So not all 3 businesses are showing expanding operating margins, which is reflective of the gross margin trends.

So we're monitoring these on a monthly basis, ensuring patients and customers have ample supply. 
And I think, Greg, as it relates to biosimilars, just going back to this, this is really a long-term play for us, one that's not just U.S.-centric but global. And as we see these launches happening throughout the world and in the U.S., products like Ogivri and Fulphila, we walked through kind of where we saw Fulphila at the end of '19 in terms of where our supply ceiling was. We're seeing that open up. We were concentrating on building that commercial infrastructure, how we built that foundation. And we're starting to see green sprouts. Ogivri share is up almost 3% this year in the U.S. We're seeing these kind of optimistic things happening. And we look forward to just growing them in 2020 and the years beyond."

So again, I want to be careful here, but you're exactly right, because I'm not actually giving guidance, and I'm trying to signal to all of you that what I see in 2021 is really not a surprise to me.

So again, I want to be careful here, but you're exactly right, because I'm not actually giving guidance, and I'm trying to signal to all of you that what I see in 2021 is really not a surprise to me. It's what we've seen very early on as we were out way in front of some of the changes that were happening in China. And we obviously were well aware of the LOEs going into this transaction. That's why if you look at the transaction, you look at the pricing of the transaction, you'll see that we fully incorporated a lot of what we see in front of us. So we didn't really have the opportunity to jump out in front and really articulate directionally where the business is going. And everybody started off by looking at Upjohn 2020. And that is why I've also given comments in the past to try to help the Street understand that it's not as simple as taking as 4s and adding them together and looking out into the future. There's -- as you bring companies together, there are many other moving pieces. And I think that the $18 billion, yes, I was directionally very comfortable. And I also think that the EBITDA, I don't see EBITDA coming down as much only because there's a number of offsets that I can see. So we're really thinking hard, and this is where this extra time has really helped, how we will be bringing the businesses back together. 
And then when we take a look at the transformation work that we're doing that was already well underway at Mylan and now underway at Upjohn, and again, I just feel that directionally, you are correct. One of the things I have to make sure and ensure and pressure test with management is making sure that, that starting point is a true baseline to grow from, where management, this new management has the best chance of coming -- I mean, you can see by the roadmap that we have out there, we have very explicit plans when it comes to execution, what is it that we need to execute on and how we're going to deliver that total shareholder return for our investors. So I think that the -- that $18 billion, $7 billion range roughly in that -- that kind of an area, that kind of -- is, I think, the right -- and I haven't changed on that. Even with what I see today, I haven't changed. If anything, I'm a little more confident as I continue to see things come together. 
But look, if you'll just be a little bit patient and let management come forth with very specific guidance with a lot of detail behind the guidance. And then also, I want to live up to the promise of the expectations that when management does come forth, I do think that they owe it to the investment community to share how exactly they're thinking about this global business, to do a walk around, around each of the geographical territories, do swa SWOT analysis for you. And as they speak about how they're thinking about the business, then the next step should be, that should help you guys begin to build your models. And then I think there needs to be a discussion between management and the sell-side analysts and shareholders who are building models to make sure how we're thinking about the business, what disclosures and how transparent we can be, because we absolutely want to be as transparent as we could without hurting our competitive landscape. So please expect that we're still going to go through that process. And it's just a process. But it's an exciting process and one that we're looking forward to working together with you on."

But as we go along, we are keeping a very close watch on this, and we will be transparent about what's coming from, what bucket, how it's being impacted. We -- more importantly, our focus has been on the continuity of supply, supply of the critical products, supply of the important, how can we meet the surge, some ICU critical products, how the demands have increased.

And it is something that we've been watching for the last several months. There's a portion of our cost, clearly, that is less flexible, especially since we have and said in the prepared remarks that certain parts of our restructuring programs will be placed on hold for a period of time. We will not be addressing certain programs that require impact on employees for all the reasons that you would want us to put those on hold. There are parts of our restructuring program that can continue, preparatory phases, looking at certain parts of our supply chain and our operational chain. So those will continue. 
On the question of cost, besides the payroll costs, we do have buckets of costs that are variable in nature, whether it be travel, which I called out, advertising and promotions, meeting expenses, things such as that, along with other parts of our spend that is discretionary or, I would say, more discretionary and flexible in nature. With what's going on, some of that naturally reduces. I'm sure you see the same thing just like we do. People are not traveling. People are not getting on airplanes. People are doing much more by conferencing and tele calls and things such as that. So we have a measurable bucket of cost in this business that will move favorably with us. 
I would also remind you that our business transformation activities are anticipated, and that extends beyond our restructuring program, but it is a part of our restructuring program. Those will continue to occur as we move throughout the year, those parts of the business transformation that relates to products and evaluation of products that remain in the portfolio. So I think with the mix of all that, without giving you specific numbers on that, we believe that there is plenty of room to kind of manage with what we see with COVID in our current outlook extending through the second quarter to manage our cost base in relation to the current environment."

I think that, David, what I'm trying to focus on is, one, I think that the company is going to go through 2 stages for a potential rerate. I think, one, we have to get to closing. That's the very first thing we need to do. You can talk about paying the dividend, but until you actually are in a position to start paying it, I think there's that wait. So I want to be very clear about our commitment, and I'm glad that Umer asked the question that he did. And I think people are much closer when it comes to the dividend even though I'm not going to give an exact number but commit to 25% of free cash flows. I actually think people are much closer to what they've anticipated than the number that Umer put out that some people are thinking about. 
But I think once we close and we're actually formed Viatris and we have that right starting point and people actually can see the new financial profile, I mean we are already stronger from a financial profile than any one of our -- any one in our sector right now. Imagine when we bring Mylan together with the Pfizer Upjohn business. When you take a look at that balance sheet and you take a look at our cash generation and you take a look at our friendly shareholder capital allocation, I'm just telling you right off the bat, I do think that will be the first time we'll get the first rerate. But the second rerate will come, and the one I think it's going to be most impactful is when management can outline a 3- to 5-year CAGR off of that '21 trough number and put [ rates ] behind underneath that 3- to 5-year CAGR, be very explicit about how you're going to hit those growth rates both in 3 to 5 years. What do we already have in-house? What are we relying upon? And then I think once the investment community really gets comfortable with the stabilization and the consistency quarter after quarter of the baseline profile, and then they start to see some vision where there's actually -- they can actually see how we're going to get the growth, then I really think that the multiple that our company really deserves will materialize, but it has to happen in steps. That's not going to happen overnight and certainly not going to happen over our looks. But I want to thank you for that question because I can only say that I'm looking at 2022 but more so to ensure that 2021 is really going to be that trough year."

I'd like to welcome everyone to Mylan's first quarter earnings call, including our Mylan and future Upjohn colleagues. 
As I begin, let me take a moment on behalf of Mylan to extend our deepest appreciation to all the health care workers and first responders working tirelessly around the globe to care for all those affected by the COVID-19 virus. I'd also like to sincerely thank our Mylan employees worldwide and their families for their remarkable resilience and determination they continue to show to help deliver on our mission of providing patients around the globe with continued access to much needed high-quality medicines. 
I will be turning the call over to Heather and the management team in a moment to discuss the quarter at hand, but first, either I or a member of our management team will also take this opportunity to address some of the questions and themes that I have received over time from shareholders and analysts, and I do really appreciate their inputs. We will address those questions either during our opening remarks or during today's Q&A session. 
While management will cover the effects of COVID-19 in our business and operations, I would like to share some high-level observations regarding the pandemic as a whole. I will also be providing an update on the status of our exciting combination with Pfizer's Upjohn business. 
As to COVID-19, since our last earnings call, the global landscape has changed significantly as a result of this pandemic. We all remember events in our lifetime that have left lasting impact on us as individuals, our communities and the world. This global pandemic is one of those moments. 
While the pandemic has brought significant challenges that will profoundly impact the global community for years to come, we are also witnessing incredible examples of human ingenuity, compassion, the extraordinarily talented efforts of health care professionals around the world and the critical importance, like never before, of the pharmaceutical industry during these unprecedented times. 
I also believe that we could be at the beginning of a resurgence of appreciation of the generic pharmaceutical industry and the critical value the industry delivers to the majority of the patient populations around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic only magnifies health care needs that we must meet by delivering both cost-effective therapies and targeted innovation. It is this unique and balanced profile that characterizes Viatris, which will be a leading role within the industry once we launch upon our closing later this year. 
Mylan, for its part, is deeply committed to continuing to support public health efforts as the pandemic evolves, and I am extremely proud that the one of a kind global platform we've built over the last decade has enabled us to do just that by continuing to deliver access to medicines around the world, even as supply chains across multiple industries and countries are challenged more than ever. 
Mylan achieves these things because we continue to remain intently focused on controlling what we can control and running our business safely and efficiently. It never ceases to amaze me at how Mylan and our dedicated workforce mobilizes to address challenges at hand, including those brought on by this pandemic. There are a couple of examples that bring to life some of the unique value proposition of Mylan's powerful global platform, coupled with its equally unique talented global workforce. For example, Mylan has already shown its ability to rapidly ramp up production to manufacture potential COVID-19 treatments in response to request of governments. 
Additionally, as many other innovative and biotech companies work to develop their own potential therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and given Mylan's rich experience in antiretrovirals, you can surely expect that Mylan will once again be in a readiness position to do its part to develop, partner, produce and soon scale up necessary medications, active ingredients in a matter of months, not years. 
Our ability to deliver on these unprecedented time frames is only possible as a result of Mylan's entrepreneurial spirit, vast global manufacturing and scientific platform, broad product portfolio covering nearly all therapeutic areas, including antiretrovirals, and by partnering with a broad scientific community all around the world, including CHAI, among others. 
Mylan has a long and successful history of partnerships with other companies. For example, we partnered with Gilead to help expand access to infectious disease medicines, including HIV, in the markets that they could not reach alone. From this partnership, we have licensed 9 medicines and distributed to nearly 10 million patients annually in more than 100 countries. 
These examples speak directly to the unique capabilities and nimbleness of Mylan's global diverse platform and the value we continue to bring to others by helping them expand their reach around the globe. 
Without speaking for other industries, I can certainly tell you that in the pharmaceutical industry, especially when needing to meet global health needs for medications, these kind of accomplishments simply could not occur with just one company or one country alone approach. This is exactly why Mylan built out its global platform in the first place, so that we can leverage our global resources and efficiently deliver high-quality medicines when and where needed. 
Now turning to a quick update on the status of our very exciting transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn business. To start, I think it's important to reiterate some of the clear fundamentals and substantial merits that this transaction has to offer. More specifically, one, this combination with Upjohn will not only enhance our global scale and geographical reach; but two, this combination will also accelerate Mylan's own stand-alone business plan by at least 3 to 5 years. Number three, this combination will create an even stronger business model, an operating platform with expanded commercial capabilities that will not only enhance our EBITDA, but our EBITDA margins as well, and generate much greater free cash flows. We also expect to garner an estimated $1 billion in annual cost synergies by the fourth full year after close, while at the same time pursuing more attractive revenue growth opportunities as well. Four, this combination will also create a much stronger financial profile by further strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility. We remain committed to rapidly delever and work towards our goal of 2.5x leverage ratio. And finally, five, Viatris will provide a greater focus on total shareholder return by creating a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation model, starting with our commitment to institute a dividend policy for Viatris after our first full quarter post close of at least 25% of our free cash flow. 
In addition, and as I've stated previously, I continue to believe that 2021 will be a trough year from which Viatris will establish a financial baseline to grow from. While we will not be giving guidance at this time, I do think that many, but not all analyst models, on both revenue and EBITDA ranges are directionally moving in the right place and consistent with where I believe 2021 may be coming together. But once again, official guidance will be given by the new Viatris management team led by Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev at the appropriate time. 
And when that occurs, I am even actually more excited about they're having the opportunity to roll out and present to all of you Viatris' new and unique global health care gateway. Importantly, this new global health care gateway will be powered by Viatris' unmatched global infrastructure and expertise, while also offering others the ability to further empower their own assets to reach more patients worldwide. 
By offering others access to Viatris' global health care gateway, which will include access to our global commercial reach across all channels, our global supply chain, our global expansive regulatory expertise and our global cost-efficient manufacturing platform, Viatris will be able to serve a unique sweet spot and tap a new reservoir of value creation as a new pathway for partners who would otherwise need to rely on either a fragmented or highly localized or regional expansion strategies of their own. You will hear more about this and why we believe Viatris will be the true partner of choice at the first Investor Day post close. 
Turning to integration planning, and although Heather and Rajiv will provide their own comments, from my own continued discussions and efforts in working with the future management team of Viatris, I am extremely pleased with their continued alignment and commitment to executing on the objectives that we have set forth in the road map to optimize total shareholder return. 
We will also be finding an opportunity for Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev to speak with shareholders and analysts directly at the appropriate time and as we monitor the evolution of the COVID-19 precautions, but certainly before closing. 
Also, you should know that our extraordinary general meeting, EGM, for the Mylan shareholder vote to approve this transaction is currently scheduled to coincide with our Annual General Meeting, our AGM, on June 30. In addition to the shareholder approval at that meeting, the only outstanding third-party approvals at that point would require to close -- to close the transaction will be from the remaining antitrust regulatory authorities. Hence, this is why we feel very confident at this time that we'll be able to close this transaction in the second half of this year. 
I look forward to answering your questions during the Q&A session, I'll now turn the call over to Heather for a comment at the quarter at hand."

We hope everyone listening today is staying safe and healthy as we continue to navigate these unprecedented times together. Our hearts and thoughts are with all of those who've been personally affected by COVID and all of the health care workers and first responders who continue to go above and beyond to help save lives. 
I'd also like to send a special message of gratitude to our entire Mylan family, especially our frontline workers. Due to their efforts, our manufacturing facilities have remained operational, and we've been able to continue meeting patients' needs even amid the challenges of a global pandemic. We recognize that the pharmaceutical industry, including Mylan, has a unique responsibility to help respond to public health needs during this time. 
Our efforts have been aimed at fulfilling those responsibilities on a number of fronts, including protecting the health and safety of our workforce, continuing to produce critically needed medicines, deploying our resources and expertise in the fight against COVID-19, supporting the communities in which we operate and maintaining the health of our overall business. Though the world around us has certainly changed, our mission remains the same. 
We've made extensive efforts to ensure supply continuity for critical medicines, ranging from maintenance treatments for chronic conditions to ICU drugs or anti-infectives in short supply due to the increased demand related to COVID-19. 
We're also participating in clinical and prophylactic trials through which product donations, including the World Health Organization's global solidarity trial, and are continuing to evaluate additional opportunities to meet unmet needs. 
There's no doubt that COVID-19 has tested the strength of supply chains across multiple industries and countries, we all rely on a very global economy, especially when it comes to the availability of medicine. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we have received a number of inquiries regarding government's increasingly urgent interest in strengthening domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply. We have and will continue to spend time with legislators and regulators around the world on this important topic to hopefully help find the right balance between strategic supply and global needs. 
With all that said, I'd now like to turn to our first quarter results. Our performance came in with total revenues growing 5% or 8% on a constant currency basis. In addition, adjusted EBITDA improved 6% over the prior year, with strong adjusted free cash flow, especially for the first quarter, coming in at $357 million. Adjusted SG&A and capital expenditures came in lower than expectations, and our EBITDA margins were ahead of what we normally see during Q1. 
During the quarter, North America and Europe's performance more than compensated for our Rest of World segment, where COVID-19 impacts hit sooner than other parts of the globe. 
As we look forward, we're reaffirming our 2020 financial guidance as we continue to expect total revenues to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, absorbing approximately $200 million of foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous expectations, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion, absorbing approximately $50 million of foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous expectations. 
These ranges account for COVID-19 impact forecasted through Q2 and assume that health care systems around the world will begin to resume their normal functions in the second half of 2020. This guidance also takes into account the fact that we are absorbing a delay in some of the benefits of our business transformation program because we paused certain restructuring elements of the plan due to COVID. 
Regarding the work we're doing to successfully close the transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn business, as Robert mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to achieve that milestone in the second half of 2020. To date, we have received antitrust regulatory clearances in 15 jurisdictions, including the recently announced conditional approval from the European Commission, and we continue to work collaboratively with regulatory agencies around the world in the remaining clearances. 
I'm impressed every day by the energy and motivation that the Mylan and Upjohn teams bring to the integration planning, while also meeting their day-to-day and COVID-related responsibilities. I'm confident that Viatris will be well positioned to be a true partner of choice, especially as health systems globally grapple with the realities of evolving patient needs and new health care paradigm. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv, Tony and Ken to provide additional detail on the quarter and our COVID-19 response efforts."

I would like to begin by echoing Robert and Heather's thanks to our thousands of Mylan colleagues all over the world who have done above and beyond during this challenging time in support of our mission, especially our frontline workers whose commitment and teamwork has enabled Mylan to continue its operations without missing a beat and respond to the need for certain critical medicines. 
During this unprecedented time, we have taken extraordinary measures to keep our operations safe so we can ensure continued supply of our medicines. A few examples include implementing social distancing within the plants, increased sanitization of common areas, temperature and symptoms monitoring and staggering shifts. 
I would like to take some time to address the inquiries that have come from various stakeholders around the impact of COVID-19 on our supply chain, especially given our relatively large presence in India. 
As you can see on Slide 5 in our earnings presentation, Mylan strategically has maintained a broad, diverse and resilient manufacturing footprint. Our 44 manufacturing facilities across 12 countries position us to maintain proximity to the key markets and help us maintain supply continuity even when the environment around us changes rapidly. Our top 50 products are supplied from 15 different countries and 30 different manufacturing locations. 
From an API point of view, not only are we vertically integrated for several key products, but we have also built strategic partnerships with our API suppliers and built in redundancies to mitigate disruption. Today, approximately half of our API come from India and China and the other half from North America, Europe and Rest of the World. 
In India, we have 19 manufacturing facilities located in 5 different states, which mitigates risk of disruption in any given part of the country. Similar to other countries, our operations in India did not experience much disruption. Even during the first week of lockdown, while rules regarding essential workers were being clarified, these sites saw minimal disruption. By the second to third week, Indian operations were back to normal. 
It's also worth noting that Mylan has not to date experienced any meaningful disruption from its more than 500 third-party supply partners located around the world. We are continuously monitoring our inventory levels of our raw materials and dosage forms and currently are in a strong position from a supply point of view to meet our customer needs across the globe. 
Turning to our first quarter results. We delivered $2.6 billion in total revenues, which is an 8% constant currency growth versus the prior year. These results reflect solid underlying business performance and execution on recent launches. 
As you may expect, we did see increased demand due to COVID-19, which resulted in an increase in net positive consolidated revenues of approximately 2%, primarily coming from Europe. 
For North America, our net sales were $956 million, which is up 4% compared to the same period last year. Growth was largely driven by Wixela, a generic to Advair, which, as you may recall, was launched in the first quarter of 2019. We are also pleased to see that YupeLri, our nebulized once-daily LAMA, achieved 87% share of nebulized LAMA market and a 13.7% share of long-acting nebulized market. 
In Europe, our net sales totaled $1 billion, which are up 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. Our strong quarterly performance was primarily driven by the higher net sales and volumes of existing products. For example, products such as Creon, Dymista, Brufen and Hulio, which is our biosimilar to Humira, showed double-digit growth due to the targeted investments in the key markets. 
In addition to the estimated impact of COVID-19, increased volumes were driven by the resolution of the supply disruptions in the prior year period. 
Moving on to the Rest of the World. Our net sales were $611 million. This is flat on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. The estimated negative impact from COVID-19, which resulted in a slightly weak performance in China and Japan, was largely offset by strong performance of our antiretroviral franchise and new product sales, primarily in Australia. 
I would now like to share some key pipeline updates. I'll start with an update on our industry-leading, comprehensive global biosimilar portfolio. Tony will later provide more detail from a commercial perspective. 
To begin, we remain on track with our expected approval of insulin glargine to support a midyear product launch. This quarter, Biocon's Malaysia's manufacturing facility received FDA pre-approval. With respect to the related patent litigation, we received a favorable district court decision on March 9 and further IPR decisions remain pending. We also continue to be engaged in active discussion with FDA on a viable pathway to obtain an interchangeable designation. 
In addition, we expect to launch our Etanercept product, which is our biosimilar to Enbrel, in the second half of this year in Europe. Our BLA and marketing authorization for our biosimilar to Avastin is currently under review with FDA and European authorities. 
In addition, the development of our biosimilar to aspart and EYLEA remain on track. 
Also, as recently announced by Revance, we are continuing discussions with them regarding the development of a biosimilar to BOTOX. We plan to provide an update on the path forward by May 31. 
Now I will provide an update on some other pipeline products. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to deepen our pipeline with high-value product opportunities. I'm pleased to inform you that we have filed an IND application for MR-107A-01, which is being developed as a non-narcotic, oral analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain and we plan to initiate Phase II clinical studies this year. 
We also continue to progress the development of MR-106A-01, which is a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that's being developed as a topical product for burn wound treatments. This product will enter clinical development later this year. 
Lastly, the Phase III study for our glatiramer acetate once-a-month program was initiated last October. This is a pivotal clinical study for the U.S. NDA. To date, the study enrollment has been progressing well with more than 170 patients dosed in the study across 56 sites. 
Regarding Morgantown, we have continued to make progress on our comprehensive and ongoing remediation efforts at the facility. And I'm pleased to share that FDA has determined the inspection classification of the site as voluntary action indicated, which changed from OAI. We are awaiting the formal closeout of the warning letter, which was issued in November 2018, and we expect to receive it at any time. 
Before I hand it over to Tony, I would also like to express my excitement about our continued progress with Upjohn on integration planning. I look forward to continuing to partner with Michael, Sanjeev and the future Viatris leaders as we plan this integration and create a new champion for global health. 
We are successfully managing the process virtually given the current environment and are taking advantage of the additional time to focus on executing a quality separation and integration planning program. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."

In terms of my remarks today, I'd like to elaborate on 2 topics. First, I'd like to provide a state of the union on our commercial efforts and share some further detail on how we are navigating our commercial business globally through the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, and also important, I'd like to begin today by highlighting our biosimilars franchise and share our path from science to commercialization of one of the industry's deepest product pipeline. 
To start with the current COVID-19 situation, our #1 priority continues to be the safety of our employees, including our dedicated sales force and commercial team of 7,500 people globally. In most countries, we have moved to a remote engagement model and have found new ways of doing business, relying heavily on technology and focusing efforts on connecting with health care professionals through various virtual tools. 
Through the impressive work of our sales team, we have completed nearly 200,000 interactions with health care providers over the past 8 weeks and continue to provide the same level of value support that our teams have always delivered. I'd like to personally thank these dedicated teams for their continued efforts and hard work during these complex times. 
Throughout this pandemic, we also continue to collaborate with pharmacies, hospitals, wholesalers, governments and health care providers to help address patient needs. We remain focused on ensuring customer and patient access to needed medicines and are closely monitoring volumes of critical products. Our service levels are currently strong, and I'm pleased to report that, to date, our customers have sufficient supply on hand in markets across geographies. 
Turning to our biosimilars franchise. We have always viewed this as an investment for the long term and one made globally across many territories. As we have invested in our pipeline and successfully demonstrated the science behind these products, we knew the next important step was to focus on the commercialization strategy. We are in the beginning stages of this journey in most of the developed markets around the world, and we know we have much work to do. 
We are focusing on 2020 as a year of expansion as we've continued to increase our commercial footprint in the U.S. and abroad. Our initial focus for this stage was to scale the organization and ensure we were methodically optimizing the opportunity to meet demand and maintain stock as we began to introduce biosimilars to markets around the world. 
Now with multiple global commercial launches underway and added learnings from our experiences in markets, our focus has shifted to execution and strategic performance and we continue to look to grow our business and capitalize on new global opportunities.
To provide a comprehensive look at where we are today, we offer one of the industry's largest and most diverse global biosimilars franchises, which includes products, either on the market or in development, focused on areas of oncology, immunology, endocrinology, ophthalmology and dermatology. We have received more than 150 marketing authorizations for biosimilar products in more than 85 countries worldwide. 
In the U.S., we've launched Fulphila, a biosimilar to Neulasta, and Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin and have strong confidence in our long-term capabilities from physician, payer and hospital standpoints to fully execute on both products throughout 2020 and the coming years.
As Rajiv mentioned, we look forward to the anticipated approval and launch of Semglee, our insulin glargine, as we continue to expand our portfolio in this market. 
In Europe, we've launched Hulio, a biosimilar to Humira, and we are beginning to launch process for Ogivri, Semglee and Fulphila in various markets as we broaden our biosimilar franchise offerings in many European countries. 
In addition, as Rajiv noted, we are looking forward to launching Nepexto, our biosimilar to Enbrel, following anticipated regulatory approval in the coming months. 
Other highlights include the recent launch of Fulphila in Canada, which extends our oncology portfolio there along with Ogivri. Additionally, in Australia, after being the first to offer biosimilar trastuzumab, we recently launched Fulphila there as well and are encouraged by the early market response. 
Overall, we continue to believe that our experience and ability to develop complex products and successfully commercialize these products on a global basis have positioned us to be a worldwide leader in the biosimilar space over the long term. We remain enthusiastic about this franchise and continue to look for opportunities to invest as well as expand our portfolio. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ken."

I'll take a few minutes to provide a summary of our financial results for the first quarter.  Q1 2020 total revenues of $2.6 billion were 5% higher than the prior year and 8% higher on a constant currency basis.",816,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide a summary of our financial results for the first quarter.  
Q1 2020 total revenues of $2.6 billion were 5% higher than the prior year and 8% higher on a constant currency basis. The consolidated results were favorably impacted by approximately 2% due to increased customer buying patterns and patient prescription trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of this impact was realized in Europe. 
In addition, total revenue growth reflects higher volumes of existing products and, to a lesser extent, new product sales of approximately $70 million, partially offset by lower pricing. 
In the first quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 54% in the same period last year. The decline is primarily the result of lower gross margin on sales of existing products in the rest of world as well as North America, partially offset by higher gross margin on sales of existing products in Europe, along with sales of new products in all 3 regions. 
From a segment profitability standpoint, North America increased 9% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This increase reflects contributions from new product sales, higher volumes and favorable product mix, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing on existing products due to changes in the competitive environment, including levothyroxine. 
Europe segment profitability also expanded, up 35% in the quarter, primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes, along with lower SG&A spending. 
Conversely, Rest of World segment profitability declined in the quarter, down 27%, as a result of lower pricing on existing products primarily due to governmental pricing reductions in Australia and Japan and unfavorable product mix, which was partially offset by benefits from new product sales, along with higher ARB volumes. Both Europe and Rest of World segment profitability results were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. 
In Q1, adjusted R&D of $112 million was 19% lower compared to 2019 due to higher payments in the prior year period related to clinical activities for products and development. 
During the quarter, adjusted SG&A spending was lower than our expectations and essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting lower travel and promotional activities, primarily resulting from COVID-19-related travel restrictions and lower legal expenses, primarily offset by higher payroll-related expenses.
In Q1, we reported adjusted net earnings of $467 million and adjusted EBITDA of $751 million, an increase of 11% and 6%, respectively. These increases versus the prior year, primarily reflect the impact of the increase in our revenues and lower R&D spending, partially offset by negative foreign currency translation impacts. 
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2020, adjusted free cash flow was strong at $357 million, an increase of $330 million over the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by improvements in working capital velocity and timing of certain other payments. For the remainder of the year, we expect adjusted free cash flow to benefit from seasonally increasing profitability, coupled with the resulting reductions in net working capital from first quarter levels. 
At the end of Q1 2020, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.6x, in line with our expectation and our covenant requirements. We anticipate full year adjusted free cash flow generation consistent with 2019 levels and continue to target approximately $1 billion of debt repayment in 2020, starting with a scheduled maturity of EUR 500 million of bonds later this month. 
While we don't presently see any negative liquidity trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will certainly continue to monitor those trends very closely. 
We currently believe our positive cash flow from operations, along with our existing borrowing facilities, providing liquidity up to $2.6 billion, will allow us to meet our liquidity needs for the remainder of the year. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage. 
Finally, as you heard earlier, we're reaffirming our full year 2020 guidance that we provided this past February. Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, absorbing an estimated $200 million of foreign exchange headwind beyond our previous expectations. 
Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion, absorbing approximately $50 million of foreign exchange headwinds beyond our previous expectations. 
It's important to note that both of these ranges reflect our current expectations for operational and commercial performance as well as estimated COVID-related impacts continuing through the second quarter. 
Before I close, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to express my thanks to our incredible teams around the world who worked and continue to work tirelessly to deliver on our mission and our commitments, while keeping themselves, their families and their coworkers safe and healthy. 
With that, we'll now open the call up for your questions. Erica?"

As we continue to launch these products, not just the run rate we're seeing in the quarter or the year for 2020 but for the long term, these products are products that are sticky. They have long-term value, and we truly look forward to not just launching we have but launching other products. As we outlined either late last year or in the beginning of this year, we had $3 billion in revenues from products we're going to be launching up through 2023. And with that being said, although we're not giving guidance, you can continue to expect that biosimilars will be a very good portion of that value moving forward.

And thanks for your expression at the beginning of your question. We do -- we really do appreciate it. I would only add to -- yes, we highlighted the biosimilar franchise because that's really what it is, a franchise. For quite some time, shareholders and analysts alike have been really focused in on our portfolio. When we first started building the portfolio, obviously, we were an unknown in the space. And the first thing we needed to do was demonstrate our science. Now that that's done, we are shifting completely to a commercial effort. I have to be very honest and clear. Yes, we have starts and stops. This is not, and I do think it would be a mistake for the investment community to look at this as a short-term measurement because we didn't invest in this franchise 9 or 10 years for the next 9 months. We invested because, as Tony said, this is a very sticky product. 
And also, to be frank, I think you guys have heard in the past, we did not get into this biosimilar franchise, actually, for the United States, we didn't even think that the United States would come online so quickly. We thought it would come on afterwards. So we were very fortunate to be here first, but we do have a lot of work to do on the commercial end. And you can expect, because of the long-term nature of this franchise, that we're going to continue to put in the type of improvements that are necessary to make sure that we get our value proposition out of our investment."

Because when we hit that reset button, there cannot be variability in execution. There needs to be a constant, at the very minimum meet or exceed quarter after quarter in order to restore confidence back in the sentiment of this very strong and powerful platform's ability to generate substantial and durable cash flows. 
I will tell you, this pandemic, as perverse as what I'm going to say, there are silver linings. I -- we can't control what we can't control. And unfortunately, this pandemic was thrown at us. So I am constantly trying to find silver linings and pick those silver linings out. A couple of them is, one, I believe that, that confidence that I'm conveying to you has been in large part because of the delay in the -- as a result of this pandemic.

There are 2 things that I want to point out. 
One, in my beginning and opening remarks, I can't make it any more clear that once we come together with Pfizer's Upjohn business and create Viatris, we are completely changing the emphasis of our business model to total shareholder return, and a huge part of that, especially, I must respect the Pfizer shareholders as well. Because part of what is -- was in our thinking is to make sure that, that dividend is, not only are we committed to it, but I hope that we can grow that dividend over time. That is our strategy. We are deeply committed to this dividend as part of our more friendly shareholder allocation of capital going forward. And so I will -- so I hope -- I think between that change of business model and the fact that we're going to be taking in 57% of Pfizer shareholders, we are very, very committed. 
In terms of amount, we don't give a dollar amount, Umer, but that 25% of free cash flow is a commitment of ours. And I think what you'll need to do is take the EBITDA. I think I've kind of sort of directionally given you guys where I think the right starting point is. And I think it's -- I do believe it's substantially higher than the $500 million that you are referencing. But I don't want to give a specific dollar because we're basing it off of our free cash flows."

On the difference between the cash flow and the EBITDA number, it's the typical items that run through there. It's depreciation and amortization that's added back, right? So then you get down to cash flow, you actually have to take that back out. You get your tax rate applied to it. You have interest, and there's clearly going to be interest on the -- not only the existing Mylan debt, which is about $0.5 billion. There's going to be interest on the $12 billion of financing debt. And you can call that about the same amount, depending on where rates land. When you do that, you're going to end up -- you should end up very much right at the $4 billion number that you're trying to calculate to. So it's the typical items that would take you from EBITDA right down.

Whereas in the Rest of World segment, the operating margins in that business, and that's shown on the chart that's included in our earnings material, declined a bit. I think about 300 basis points year-over-year driven by the details that we called out, including stronger volumes of ARB, which tends to be a lower gross margin part of the business, combined with the pricing changes, the governmental pricing changes in Australia and Japan. So not all 3 businesses are showing expanding operating margins, which is reflective of the gross margin trends.

And I think, Greg, as it relates to biosimilars, just going back to this, this is really a long-term play for us, one that's not just U.S.-centric but global. And as we see these launches happening throughout the world and in the U.S., products like Ogivri and Fulphila, we walked through kind of where we saw Fulphila at the end of '19 in terms of where our supply ceiling was. We're seeing that open up. We were concentrating on building that commercial infrastructure, how we built that foundation. And we're starting to see green sprouts. Ogivri share is up almost 3% this year in the U.S. We're seeing these kind of optimistic things happening. And we look forward to just growing them in 2020 and the years beyond."

So again, I want to be careful here, but you're exactly right, because I'm not actually giving guidance, and I'm trying to signal to all of you that what I see in 2021 is really not a surprise to me. It's what we've seen very early on as we were out way in front of some of the changes that were happening in China. And we obviously were well aware of the LOEs going into this transaction. That's why if you look at the transaction, you look at the pricing of the transaction, you'll see that we fully incorporated a lot of what we see in front of us. So we didn't really have the opportunity to jump out in front and really articulate directionally where the business is going. And everybody started off by looking at Upjohn 2020. And that is why I've also given comments in the past to try to help the Street understand that it's not as simple as taking S-4s and adding them together and looking out into the future. There's -- as you bring companies together, there are many other moving pieces. And I think that the $18 billion, yes, I was directionally very comfortable. And I also think that the EBITDA, I don't see EBITDA coming down as much only because there's a number of offsets that I can see. So we're really thinking hard, and this is where this extra time has really helped, how we will be bringing the businesses back together. 
And then when we take a look at the transformation work that we're doing that was already well underway at Mylan and now underway at Upjohn, and again, I just feel that directionally, you are correct. One of the things I have to make sure and ensure and pressure test with management is making sure that, that starting point is a true baseline to grow from, where management, this new management has the best chance of coming -- I mean, you can see by the road map that we have out there, we have very explicit plans when it comes to execution, what is it that we need to execute on and how we're going to deliver that total shareholder return for our investors. So I think that the -- that $18 billion, $7 billion range roughly in that -- that kind of an area, that kind of -- is, I think, the right -- and I haven't changed on that. Even with what I see today, I haven't changed. If anything, I'm a little more confident as I continue to see things come together. 
But look, if you'll just be a little bit patient and let management come forth with very specific guidance with a lot of detail behind the guidance. And then also, I want to live up to the promise of the expectations that when management does come forth, I do think that they owe it to the investment community to share how exactly they're thinking about this global business, to do a walk around, around each of the geographical territories, do SWOT analysis for you. And as they speak about how they're thinking about the business, then the next step should be, that should help you guys begin to build your models. And then I think there needs to be a discussion between management and the sell-side analysts and shareholders who are building models to make sure how we're thinking about the business, what disclosures and how transparent we can be, because we absolutely want to be as transparent as we could without hurting our competitive landscape. So please expect that we're still going to go through that process. And it's just a process. But it's an exciting process and one that we're looking forward to working together with you on."

But as we go along, we are keeping a very close watch on this, and we will be transparent about what's coming from what bucket, how it's being impacted. We -- more importantly, our focus has been on the continuity of supply, supply of the critical products, supply of the important, how can we meet the surge, some ICU critical products, how the demands have increased. So we have kept our focus on that. So that's, I think, from the supply chain point of view.

And it is something that we've been watching for the last several months. There's a portion of our cost, clearly, that is less flexible, especially since we have and said in the prepared remarks that certain parts of our restructuring programs will be placed on hold for a period of time. We will not be addressing certain programs that require impact on employees for all the reasons that you would want us to put those on hold. There are parts of our restructuring program that can continue, preparatory phases, looking at certain parts of our supply chain and our operational chain. So those will continue. 
On the question of cost, besides the payroll costs, we do have buckets of costs that are variable in nature, whether it be travel, which I called out, advertising and promotions, meeting expenses, things such as that, along with other parts of our spend that is discretionary or, I would say, more discretionary and flexible in nature. With what's going on, some of that naturally reduces. I'm sure you see the same thing just like we do. People are not traveling. People are not getting on airplanes. People are doing much more by conferencing and tele calls and things such as that. So we have a measurable bucket of cost in this business that will move favorably with us. 
I would also remind you that our business transformation activities are anticipated, and that extends beyond our restructuring program, but it is a part of our restructuring program. Those will continue to occur as we move throughout the year, those parts of the business transformation that relates to products and evaluation of products that remain in the portfolio. So I think with the mix of all that, without giving you specific numbers on that, we believe that there is plenty of room to kind of manage with what we see with COVID in our current outlook extending through the second quarter to manage our cost base in relation to the current environment."

And it's a great question, because without at least me projecting or, in my own mind, going out to 2022, how would I ever ensure that 2021 is going to be that trough year? I think that, David, what I'm trying to focus on is, one, I think that the company is going to go through 2 stages for a potential rerate. I think, one, we have to get to closing. That's the very first thing we need to do. You can talk about paying the dividend, but until you actually are in a position to start paying it, I think there's that wait. So I want to be very clear about our commitment, and I'm glad that Umer asked the question that he did. And I think people are much closer when it comes to the dividend even though I'm not going to give an exact number but commit to 25% of free cash flows. I actually think people are much closer to what they've anticipated than the number that Umer put out that some people are thinking about. 
But I think once we close and we actually formed Viatris and we have that right starting point and people actually can see the new financial profile, I mean we are already stronger from a financial profile than any one of our -- any one in our sector right now. Imagine when we bring Mylan together with the Pfizer Upjohn business. When you take a look at that balance sheet and you take a look at our cash generation and you take a look at our friendly shareholder capital allocation, I'm just telling you right off the bat, I do think that will be the first time we'll get the first rerate. But the second rerate will come. And the one I think it's going to be most impactful is when management can outline a 3- to 5-year CAGR off of that '21 trough number and put legs behind -- underneath that 3- to 5-year CAGR, be very explicit about how you're going to hit those growth rates both in 3 to 5 years. What do we already have in-house? What are we relying upon? And then I think once the investment community really gets comfortable with the stabilization and the consistency quarter after quarter of the baseline profile, and then they start to see some vision where there's actually -- they can actually see how we're going to get the growth, then I really think that the multiple that our company really deserves will materialize, but it has to happen in steps. That's not going to happen overnight and certainly not going to happen over our looks. But I want to thank you for that question because I can only say that I'm looking at 2022 but more so to ensure that 2021 is really going to be that trough year."

So I think the therapeutic category, you're going to get. I think there really will be some opportunities for some tuck-ins. I don't believe you should ever be thinking about major M&A. I do think that we need to really begin to start returning capital back to shareholders. So there -- we are in the process of really thinking about an extraordinarily disciplined approach about allocation of capital on a going-forward basis. And I think it would be only fair, one, to the answer to your question; and two, to the new management team. There's a tremendous amount of work that's being done. And I'd like to let Michael and Rajiv and Sanjeev, let them present to the Board of Directors. This is something that we're expecting. We like to get their thoughts, and we like to get the rationale behind their thoughts. We like to absolutely opine on them and then let them come forth. And I really believe that the real, concise answer to your question will be forthcoming."

So to put the 2 together actually kind of worked out well. I'm hoping I can land in the Netherlands by then to actually conduct the meeting, if need be. I did see that the Netherlands passed some emergency legislation to actually postpone to give people an extension up until October to actually have their Annual General Meeting on account of the COVID. So I'm looking at different ways of working through that. I don't think that's going to be a problem. We'll look at other alternatives if we have to. But right now, it's my intention to absolutely be there in person and to conduct that meeting. So I actually think that's not a difficult one. But you asked about how COVID-19 could play in, I would say that. 
I would say that the other one -- the only other one is the remaining regulatory agencies for the antitrust. And I can tell you, I'm feeling very comfortable with the work that's been done, just where we are. I mean, obviously, when DC closed on, they themselves, the agency themselves, the FTC asked for an extension. So we've absolutely opined on their request. I don't know how you can't. But there is nothing I see that's going to get in the way of our ability to close at the second half of this year. There's nothing I see -- there's no impediment. I think we have plenty of time to accommodate both COVID-19 and the antitrust regulators in terms of what needs to get done."

I'd like to welcome everyone to Mylan's first quarter earnings call, including our Mylan and future Upjohn colleagues. 
As I begin, let me take a moment on behalf of Mylan to extend our deepest appreciation to all the health care workers and first responders working tirelessly around the globe to care for all those affected by the COVID-19 virus. I'd also like to sincerely thank our Mylan employees worldwide and their families for their remarkable resilience and determination they continue to show to help deliver on our mission of providing patients around the globe with continued access to much needed high-quality medicines. 
I will be turning the call over to Heather and the management team in a moment to discuss the quarter at hand, but first, either I or a member of our management team will also take this opportunity to address some of the questions and themes that I have received over time from shareholders and analysts, and I do really appreciate their inputs. We will address those questions either during our opening remarks or during today's Q&A session. 
While management will cover the effects of COVID-19 in our business and operations, I would like to share some high-level observations regarding the pandemic as a whole. I will also be providing an update on the status of our exciting combination with Pfizer's Upjohn business. 
As to COVID-19, since our last earnings call, the global landscape has changed significantly as a result of this pandemic. We all remember events in our lifetime that have left lasting impact on us as individuals, our communities and the world. This global pandemic is one of those moments. 
While the pandemic has brought significant challenges that will profoundly impact the global community for years to come, we are also witnessing incredible examples of human ingenuity, compassion, the extraordinarily talented efforts of health care professionals around the world and the critical importance, like never before, of the pharmaceutical industry during these unprecedented times. 
I also believe that we could be at the beginning of a resurgence of appreciation of the generic pharmaceutical industry and the critical value the industry delivers to the majority of the patient populations around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic only magnifies health care needs that we must meet by delivering both cost-effective therapies and targeted innovation. It is this unique and balanced profile that characterizes Viatris, which will be a leading role within the industry once we launch upon our closing later this year. 
Mylan, for its part, is deeply committed to continuing to support public health efforts as the pandemic evolves, and I am extremely proud that the one of a kind global platform we've built over the last decade has enabled us to do just that by continuing to deliver access to medicines around the world, even as supply chains across multiple industries and countries are challenged more than ever. 
Mylan achieves these things because we continue to remain intently focused on controlling what we can control and running our business safely and efficiently. It never ceases to amaze me at how Mylan and our dedicated workforce mobilizes to address challenges at hand, including those brought on by this pandemic. There are a couple of examples that bring to life some of the unique value proposition of Mylan's powerful global platform, coupled with its equally unique talented global workforce. For example, Mylan has already shown its ability to rapidly ramp up production to manufacture potential COVID-19 treatments in response to request of governments. 
Additionally, as many other innovative and biotech companies work to develop their own potential therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and given Mylan's rich experience in antiretrovirals, you can surely expect that Mylan will once again be in a readiness position to do its part to develop, partner, produce and soon scale up necessary medications, active ingredients in a matter of months, not years. 
Our ability to deliver on these unprecedented time frames is only possible as a result of Mylan's entrepreneurial spirit, vast global manufacturing and scientific platform, broad product portfolio covering nearly all therapeutic areas, including antiretrovirals, and by partnering with a broad scientific community all around the world, including CHAI, among others. 
Mylan has a long and successful history of partnerships with other companies. For example, we partnered with Gilead to help expand access to infectious disease medicines, including HIV, in the markets that they could not reach alone. From this partnership, we have licensed 9 medicines and distributed to nearly 10 million patients annually in more than 100 countries. 
These examples speak directly to the unique capabilities and nimbleness of Mylan's global diverse platform and the value we continue to bring to others by helping them expand their reach around the globe. 
Without speaking for other industries, I can certainly tell you that in the pharmaceutical industry, especially when needing to meet global health needs for medications, these kind of accomplishments simply could not occur with just one company or one country alone approach. This is exactly why Mylan built out its global platform in the first place, so that we can leverage our global resources and efficiently deliver high-quality medicines when and where needed. 
Now turning to a quick update on the status of our very exciting transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn business. To start, I think it's important to reiterate some of the clear fundamentals and substantial merits that this transaction has to offer. More specifically, one, this combination with Upjohn will not only enhance our global scale and geographical reach; but two, this combination will also accelerate Mylan's own stand-alone business plan by at least 3 to 5 years. Number three, this combination will create an even stronger business model, an operating platform with expanded commercial capabilities that will not only enhance our EBITDA, but our EBITDA margins as well, and generate much greater free cash flows. We also expect to garner an estimated $1 billion in annual cost synergies by the fourth full year after close, while at the same time pursuing more attractive revenue growth opportunities as well. Four, this combination will also create a much stronger financial profile by further strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility. We remain committed to rapidly delever and work towards our goal of 2.5x leverage ratio. And finally, five, Viatris will provide a greater focus on total shareholder return by creating a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation model, starting with our commitment to institute a dividend policy for Viatris after our first full quarter post close of at least 25% of our free cash flow. 
In addition, and as I've stated previously, I continue to believe that 2021 will be a trough year from which Viatris will establish a financial baseline to grow from. While we will not be giving guidance at this time, I do think that many, but not all analyst models, on both revenue and EBITDA ranges are directionally moving in the right place and consistent with where I believe 2021 may be coming together. But once again, official guidance will be given by the new Viatris management team led by Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev at the appropriate time. 
And when that occurs, I am even actually more excited about they're having the opportunity to roll out and present to all of you Viatris' new and unique global health care gateway. Importantly, this new global health care gateway will be powered by Viatris' unmatched global infrastructure and expertise, while also offering others the ability to further empower their own assets to reach more patients worldwide. 
By offering others access to Viatris' global health care gateway, which will include access to our global commercial reach across all channels, our global supply chain, our global expansive regulatory expertise and our global cost-efficient manufacturing platform, Viatris will be able to serve a unique sweet spot and tap a new reservoir of value creation as a new pathway for partners who would otherwise need to rely on either a fragmented or highly localized or regional expansion strategies of their own. You will hear more about this and why we believe Viatris will be the true partner of choice at the first Investor Day post close. 
Turning to integration planning, and although Heather and Rajiv will provide their own comments, from my own continued discussions and efforts in working with the future management team of Viatris, I am extremely pleased with their continued alignment and commitment to executing on the objectives that we have set forth in the road map to optimize total shareholder return. 
We will also be finding an opportunity for Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev to speak with shareholders and analysts directly at the appropriate time and as we monitor the evolution of the COVID-19 precautions, but certainly before closing. 
Also, you should know that our extraordinary general meeting, EGM, for the Mylan shareholder vote to approve this transaction is currently scheduled to coincide with our Annual General Meeting, our AGM, on June 30. In addition to the shareholder approval at that meeting, the only outstanding third-party approvals at that point would require to close -- to close the transaction will be from the remaining antitrust regulatory authorities. Hence, this is why we feel very confident at this time that we'll be able to close this transaction in the second half of this year. 
I look forward to answering your questions during the Q&A session, I'll now turn the call over to Heather for a comment at the quarter at hand."

We hope everyone listening today is staying safe and healthy as we continue to navigate these unprecedented times together. Our hearts and thoughts are with all of those who've been personally affected by COVID and all of the health care workers and first responders who continue to go above and beyond to help save lives. 
I'd also like to send a special message of gratitude to our entire Mylan family, especially our frontline workers. Due to their efforts, our manufacturing facilities have remained operational, and we've been able to continue meeting patients' needs even amid the challenges of a global pandemic. We recognize that the pharmaceutical industry, including Mylan, has a unique responsibility to help respond to public health needs during this time. 
Our efforts have been aimed at fulfilling those responsibilities on a number of fronts, including protecting the health and safety of our workforce, continuing to produce critically needed medicines, deploying our resources and expertise in the fight against COVID-19, supporting the communities in which we operate and maintaining the health of our overall business. Though the world around us has certainly changed, our mission remains the same. 
We've made extensive efforts to ensure supply continuity for critical medicines, ranging from maintenance treatments for chronic conditions to ICU drugs or anti-infectives in short supply due to the increased demand related to COVID-19. 
We're also participating in clinical and prophylactic trials through which product donations, including the World Health Organization's global solidarity trial, and are continuing to evaluate additional opportunities to meet unmet needs. 
There's no doubt that COVID-19 has tested the strength of supply chains across multiple industries and countries, we all rely on a very global economy, especially when it comes to the availability of medicine. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we have received a number of inquiries regarding government's increasingly urgent interest in strengthening domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply. We have and will continue to spend time with legislators and regulators around the world on this important topic to hopefully help find the right balance between strategic supply and global needs. 
With all that said, I'd now like to turn to our first quarter results. Our performance came in with total revenues growing 5% or 8% on a constant currency basis. In addition, adjusted EBITDA improved 6% over the prior year, with strong adjusted free cash flow, especially for the first quarter, coming in at $357 million. Adjusted SG&A and capital expenditures came in lower than expectations, and our EBITDA margins were ahead of what we normally see during Q1. 
During the quarter, North America and Europe's performance more than compensated for our Rest of World segment, where COVID-19 impacts hit sooner than other parts of the globe. 
As we look forward, we're reaffirming our 2020 financial guidance as we continue to expect total revenues to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, absorbing approximately $200 million of foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous expectations, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion, absorbing approximately $50 million of foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous expectations. 
These ranges account for COVID-19 impact forecasted through Q2 and assume that health care systems around the world will begin to resume their normal functions in the second half of 2020. This guidance also takes into account the fact that we are absorbing a delay in some of the benefits of our business transformation program because we paused certain restructuring elements of the plan due to COVID. 
Regarding the work we're doing to successfully close the transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn business, as Robert mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to achieve that milestone in the second half of 2020. To date, we have received antitrust regulatory clearances in 15 jurisdictions, including the recently announced conditional approval from the European Commission, and we continue to work collaboratively with regulatory agencies around the world in the remaining clearances. 
I'm impressed every day by the energy and motivation that the Mylan and Upjohn teams bring to the integration planning, while also meeting their day-to-day and COVID-related responsibilities. I'm confident that Viatris will be well positioned to be a true partner of choice, especially as health systems globally grapple with the realities of evolving patient needs and new health care paradigm. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv, Tony and Ken to provide additional detail on the quarter and our COVID-19 response efforts."

I would like to begin by echoing Robert and Heather's thanks to our thousands of Mylan colleagues all over the world who have done above and beyond during this challenging time in support of our mission, especially our frontline workers whose commitment and teamwork has enabled Mylan to continue its operations without missing a beat and respond to the need for certain critical medicines. 
During this unprecedented time, we have taken extraordinary measures to keep our operations safe so we can ensure continued supply of our medicines. A few examples include implementing social distancing within the plants, increased sanitization of common areas, temperature and symptoms monitoring and staggering shifts. 
I would like to take some time to address the inquiries that have come from various stakeholders around the impact of COVID-19 on our supply chain, especially given our relatively large presence in India. 
As you can see on Slide 5 in our earnings presentation, Mylan strategically has maintained a broad, diverse and resilient manufacturing footprint. Our 44 manufacturing facilities across 12 countries position us to maintain proximity to the key markets and help us maintain supply continuity even when the environment around us changes rapidly. Our top 50 products are supplied from 15 different countries and 30 different manufacturing locations. 
From an API point of view, not only are we vertically integrated for several key products, but we have also built strategic partnerships with our API suppliers and built in redundancies to mitigate disruption. Today, approximately half of our API come from India and China and the other half from North America, Europe and Rest of the World. 
In India, we have 19 manufacturing facilities located in 5 different states, which mitigates risk of disruption in any given part of the country. Similar to other countries, our operations in India did not experience much disruption. Even during the first week of lockdown, while rules regarding essential workers were being clarified, these sites saw minimal disruption. By the second to third week, Indian operations were back to normal. 
It's also worth noting that Mylan has not to date experienced any meaningful disruption from its more than 500 third-party supply partners located around the world. We are continuously monitoring our inventory levels of our raw materials and dosage forms and currently are in a strong position from a supply point of view to meet our customer needs across the globe. 
Turning to our first quarter results. We delivered $2.6 billion in total revenues, which is an 8% constant currency growth versus the prior year. These results reflect solid underlying business performance and execution on recent launches. 
As you may expect, we did see increased demand due to COVID-19, which resulted in an increase in net positive consolidated revenues of approximately 2%, primarily coming from Europe. 
For North America, our net sales were $956 million, which is up 4% compared to the same period last year. Growth was largely driven by Wixela, a generic to Advair, which, as you may recall, was launched in the first quarter of 2019. We are also pleased to see that YupeLri, our nebulized once-daily LAMA, achieved 87% share of nebulized LAMA market and a 13.7% share of long-acting nebulized market. 
In Europe, our net sales totaled $1 billion, which are up 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. Our strong quarterly performance was primarily driven by the higher net sales and volumes of existing products. For example, products such as Creon, Dymista, Brufen and Hulio, which is our biosimilar to Humira, showed double-digit growth due to the targeted investments in the key markets. 
In addition to the estimated impact of COVID-19, increased volumes were driven by the resolution of the supply disruptions in the prior year period. 
Moving on to the Rest of the World. Our net sales were $611 million. This is flat on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. The estimated negative impact from COVID-19, which resulted in a slightly weak performance in China and Japan, was largely offset by strong performance of our antiretroviral franchise and new product sales, primarily in Australia. 
I would now like to share some key pipeline updates. I'll start with an update on our industry-leading, comprehensive global biosimilar portfolio. Tony will later provide more detail from a commercial perspective. 
To begin, we remain on track with our expected approval of insulin glargine to support a midyear product launch. This quarter, Biocon's Malaysia's manufacturing facility received FDA pre-approval. With respect to the related patent litigation, we received a favorable district court decision on March 9 and further IPR decisions remain pending. We also continue to be engaged in active discussion with FDA on a viable pathway to obtain an interchangeable designation. 
In addition, we expect to launch our Etanercept product, which is our biosimilar to Enbrel, in the second half of this year in Europe. Our BLA and marketing authorization for our biosimilar to Avastin is currently under review with FDA and European authorities. 
In addition, the development of our biosimilar to aspart and EYLEA remain on track. 
Also, as recently announced by Revance, we are continuing discussions with them regarding the development of a biosimilar to BOTOX. We plan to provide an update on the path forward by May 31. 
Now I will provide an update on some other pipeline products. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to deepen our pipeline with high-value product opportunities. I'm pleased to inform you that we have filed an IND application for MR-107A-01, which is being developed as a non-narcotic, oral analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain and we plan to initiate Phase II clinical studies this year. 
We also continue to progress the development of MR-106A-01, which is a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that's being developed as a topical product for burn wound treatments. This product will enter clinical development later this year. 
Lastly, the Phase III study for our glatiramer acetate once-a-month program was initiated last October. This is a pivotal clinical study for the U.S. NDA. To date, the study enrollment has been progressing well with more than 170 patients dosed in the study across 56 sites. 
Regarding Morgantown, we have continued to make progress on our comprehensive and ongoing remediation efforts at the facility. And I'm pleased to share that FDA has determined the inspection classification of the site as voluntary action indicated, which changed from OAI. We are awaiting the formal closeout of the warning letter, which was issued in November 2018, and we expect to receive it at any time. 
Before I hand it over to Tony, I would also like to express my excitement about our continued progress with Upjohn on integration planning. I look forward to continuing to partner with Michael, Sanjeev and the future Viatris leaders as we plan this integration and create a new champion for global health. 
We are successfully managing the process virtually given the current environment and are taking advantage of the additional time to focus on executing a quality separation and integration planning program. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."

In terms of my remarks today, I'd like to elaborate on 2 topics. First, I'd like to provide a state of the union on our commercial efforts and share some further detail on how we are navigating our commercial business globally through the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, and also important, I'd like to begin today by highlighting our biosimilars franchise and share our path from science to commercialization of one of the industry's deepest product pipeline. 
To start with the current COVID-19 situation, our #1 priority continues to be the safety of our employees, including our dedicated sales force and commercial team of 7,500 people globally. In most countries, we have moved to a remote engagement model and have found new ways of doing business, relying heavily on technology and focusing efforts on connecting with health care professionals through various virtual tools. 
Through the impressive work of our sales team, we have completed nearly 200,000 interactions with health care providers over the past 8 weeks and continue to provide the same level of value support that our teams have always delivered. I'd like to personally thank these dedicated teams for their continued efforts and hard work during these complex times. 
Throughout this pandemic, we also continue to collaborate with pharmacies, hospitals, wholesalers, governments and health care providers to help address patient needs. We remain focused on ensuring customer and patient access to needed medicines and are closely monitoring volumes of critical products. Our service levels are currently strong, and I'm pleased to report that, to date, our customers have sufficient supply on hand in markets across geographies. 
Turning to our biosimilars franchise. We have always viewed this as an investment for the long term and one made globally across many territories. As we have invested in our pipeline and successfully demonstrated the science behind these products, we knew the next important step was to focus on the commercialization strategy. We are in the beginning stages of this journey in most of the developed markets around the world, and we know we have much work to do. 
We are focusing on 2020 as a year of expansion as we've continued to increase our commercial footprint in the U.S. and abroad. Our initial focus for this stage was to scale the organization and ensure we were methodically optimizing the opportunity to meet demand and maintain stock as we began to introduce biosimilars to markets around the world. 
Now with multiple global commercial launches underway and added learnings from our experiences in markets, our focus has shifted to execution and strategic performance and we continue to look to grow our business and capitalize on new global opportunities.
To provide a comprehensive look at where we are today, we offer one of the industry's largest and most diverse global biosimilars franchises, which includes products, either on the market or in development, focused on areas of oncology, immunology, endocrinology, ophthalmology and dermatology. We have received more than 150 marketing authorizations for biosimilar products in more than 85 countries worldwide. 
In the U.S., we've launched Fulphila, a biosimilar to Neulasta, and Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin and have strong confidence in our long-term capabilities from physician, payer and hospital standpoints to fully execute on both products throughout 2020 and the coming years.
As Rajiv mentioned, we look forward to the anticipated approval and launch of Semglee, our insulin glargine, as we continue to expand our portfolio in this market. 
In Europe, we've launched Hulio, a biosimilar to Humira, and we are beginning to launch process for Ogivri, Semglee and Fulphila in various markets as we broaden our biosimilar franchise offerings in many European countries. 
In addition, as Rajiv noted, we are looking forward to launching Nepexto, our biosimilar to Enbrel, following anticipated regulatory approval in the coming months. 
Other highlights include the recent launch of Fulphila in Canada, which extends our oncology portfolio there along with Ogivri. Additionally, in Australia, after being the first to offer biosimilar trastuzumab, we recently launched Fulphila there as well and are encouraged by the early market response. 
Overall, we continue to believe that our experience and ability to develop complex products and successfully commercialize these products on a global basis have positioned us to be a worldwide leader in the biosimilar space over the long term. We remain enthusiastic about this franchise and continue to look for opportunities to invest as well as expand our portfolio. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ken."

I'll take a few minutes to provide a summary of our financial results for the first quarter.  Q1 2020 total revenues of $2.6 billion were 5% higher than the prior year and 8% higher on a constant currency basis.",816,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide a summary of our financial results for the first quarter.  
Q1 2020 total revenues of $2.6 billion were 5% higher than the prior year and 8% higher on a constant currency basis. The consolidated results were favorably impacted by approximately 2% due to increased customer buying patterns and patient prescription trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of this impact was realized in Europe. 
In addition, total revenue growth reflects higher volumes of existing products and, to a lesser extent, new product sales of approximately $70 million, partially offset by lower pricing. 
In the first quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 54% in the same period last year. The decline is primarily the result of lower gross margin on sales of existing products in the rest of world as well as North America, partially offset by higher gross margin on sales of existing products in Europe, along with sales of new products in all 3 regions. 
From a segment profitability standpoint, North America increased 9% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This increase reflects contributions from new product sales, higher volumes and favorable product mix, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing on existing products due to changes in the competitive environment, including levothyroxine. 
Europe segment profitability also expanded, up 35% in the quarter, primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes, along with lower SG&A spending. 
Conversely, Rest of World segment profitability declined in the quarter, down 27%, as a result of lower pricing on existing products primarily due to governmental pricing reductions in Australia and Japan and unfavorable product mix, which was partially offset by benefits from new product sales, along with higher ARB volumes. Both Europe and Rest of World segment profitability results were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. 
In Q1, adjusted R&D of $112 million was 19% lower compared to 2019 due to higher payments in the prior year period related to clinical activities for products and development. 
During the quarter, adjusted SG&A spending was lower than our expectations and essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting lower travel and promotional activities, primarily resulting from COVID-19-related travel restrictions and lower legal expenses, primarily offset by higher payroll-related expenses.
In Q1, we reported adjusted net earnings of $467 million and adjusted EBITDA of $751 million, an increase of 11% and 6%, respectively. These increases versus the prior year, primarily reflect the impact of the increase in our revenues and lower R&D spending, partially offset by negative foreign currency translation impacts. 
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2020, adjusted free cash flow was strong at $357 million, an increase of $330 million over the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by improvements in working capital velocity and timing of certain other payments. For the remainder of the year, we expect adjusted free cash flow to benefit from seasonally increasing profitability, coupled with the resulting reductions in net working capital from first quarter levels. 
At the end of Q1 2020, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.6x, in line with our expectation and our covenant requirements. We anticipate full year adjusted free cash flow generation consistent with 2019 levels and continue to target approximately $1 billion of debt repayment in 2020, starting with a scheduled maturity of EUR 500 million of bonds later this month. 
While we don't presently see any negative liquidity trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will certainly continue to monitor those trends very closely. 
We currently believe our positive cash flow from operations, along with our existing borrowing facilities, providing liquidity up to $2.6 billion, will allow us to meet our liquidity needs for the remainder of the year. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage. 
Finally, as you heard earlier, we're reaffirming our full year 2020 guidance that we provided this past February. Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, absorbing an estimated $200 million of foreign exchange headwind beyond our previous expectations. 
Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion, absorbing approximately $50 million of foreign exchange headwinds beyond our previous expectations. 
It's important to note that both of these ranges reflect our current expectations for operational and commercial performance as well as estimated COVID-related impacts continuing through the second quarter. 
Before I close, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to express my thanks to our incredible teams around the world who worked and continue to work tirelessly to deliver on our mission and our commitments, while keeping themselves, their families and their coworkers safe and healthy. 
With that, we'll now open the call up for your questions. Erica?"

They have long-term value, and we truly look forward to not just launching we have but launching other products. As we outlined either late last year or in the beginning of this year, we had $3 billion in revenues from products we're going to be launching up through 2023. And with that being said, although we're not giving guidance, you can continue to expect that biosimilars will be a very good portion of that value moving forward.

For quite some time, shareholders and analysts alike have been really focused in on our portfolio. When we first started building the portfolio, obviously, we were an unknown in the space. And the first thing we needed to do was demonstrate our science. Now that that's done, we are shifting completely to a commercial effort. I have to be very honest and clear. Yes, we have starts and stops. This is not, and I do think it would be a mistake for the investment community to look at this as a short-term measurement because we didn't invest in this franchise 9 or 10 years for the next 9 months. We invested because, as Tony said, this is a very sticky product. 
And also, to be frank, I think you guys have heard in the past, we did not get into this biosimilar franchise, actually, for the United States, we didn't even think that the United States would come online so quickly. We thought it would come on afterwards. So we were very fortunate to be here first, but we do have a lot of work to do on the commercial end. And you can expect, because of the long-term nature of this franchise, that we're going to continue to put in the type of improvements that are necessary to make sure that we get our value proposition out of our investment."

Because when we hit that reset button, there cannot be variability in execution. There needs to be a constant, at the very minimum meet or exceed quarter after quarter in order to restore confidence back in the sentiment of this very strong and powerful platform's ability to generate substantial and durable cash flows. 
I will tell you, this pandemic, as perverse as what I'm going to say, there are silver linings. I -- we can't control what we can't control. And unfortunately, this pandemic was thrown at us. So I am constantly trying to find silver linings and pick those silver linings out. A couple of them is, one, I believe that, that confidence that I'm conveying to you has been in large part because of the delay in the -- as a result of this pandemic. I'm seeing a higher quality integration process. I'm seeing a very strong alignment with management. I'm seeing much more clarity in what's in front of us as things begin to materialize.

There are 2 things that I want to point out. 
One, in my beginning and opening remarks, I can't make it any more clear that once we come together with Pfizer's Upjohn business and create Viatris, we are completely changing the emphasis of our business model to total shareholder return, and a huge part of that, especially, I must respect the Pfizer shareholders as well. Because part of what is -- was in our thinking is to make sure that, that dividend is, not only are we committed to it, but I hope that we can grow that dividend over time. That is our strategy. We are deeply committed to this dividend as part of our more friendly shareholder allocation of capital going forward. And so I will -- so I hope -- I think between that change of business model and the fact that we're going to be taking in 57% of Pfizer shareholders, we are very, very committed. 
In terms of amount, we don't give a dollar amount, Umer, but that 25% of free cash flow is a commitment of ours. And I think what you'll need to do is take the EBITDA. I think I've kind of sort of directionally given you guys where I think the right starting point is. And I think it's -- I do believe it's substantially higher than the $500 million that you are referencing. But I don't want to give a specific dollar because we're basing it off of our free cash flows."

You have interest, and there's clearly going to be interest on the -- not only the existing Mylan debt, which is about $0.5 billion. There's going to be interest on the $12 billion of financing debt.

And one of the things that we are pleased with is that with the sales levels that we've seen, including with the COVID impact that we called out primarily in Europe, equivalent to about 2% of our total consolidated revenues, inventory levels, consistently, by market, by category have been relatively consistent with what we saw December 31 going to March. And we measure those based upon looking at the sales numbers and the anticipated sale out over a period of time and taking into account some of the step-up and the sell-in to the channel.

And I think, Greg, as it relates to biosimilars, just going back to this, this is really a long-term play for us, one that's not just U.S.-centric but global. And as we see these launches happening throughout the world and in the U.S., products like Ogivri and Fulphila, we walked through kind of where we saw Fulphila at the end of '19 in terms of where our supply ceiling was. We're seeing that open up. We were concentrating on building that commercial infrastructure, how we built that foundation. And we're starting to see green sprouts. Ogivri share is up almost 3% this year in the U.S. We're seeing these kind of optimistic things happening. And we look forward to just growing them in 2020 and the years beyond."

It's what we've seen very early on as we were out",637,"Yes. So again, I want to be careful here, but you're exactly right, because I'm not actually giving guidance, and I'm trying to signal to all of you that what I see in 2021 is really not a surprise to me. It's what we've seen very early on as we were out way in front of some of the changes that were happening in China. And we obviously were well aware of the LOEs going into this transaction. That's why if you look at the transaction, you look at the pricing of the transaction, you'll see that we fully incorporated a lot of what we see in front of us. So we didn't really have the opportunity to jump out in front and really articulate directionally where the business is going. And everybody started off by looking at Upjohn 2020. And that is why I've also given comments in the past to try to help the Street understand that it's not as simple as taking S-4s and adding them together and looking out into the future. There's -- as you bring companies together, there are many other moving pieces. And I think that the $18 billion, yes, I was directionally very comfortable. And I also think that the EBITDA, I don't see EBITDA coming down as much only because there's a number of offsets that I can see. So we're really thinking hard, and this is where this extra time has really helped, how we will be bringing the businesses back together. 
And then when we take a look at the transformation work that we're doing that was already well underway at Mylan and now underway at Upjohn, and again, I just feel that directionally, you are correct. One of the things I have to make sure and ensure and pressure test with management is making sure that, that starting point is a true baseline to grow from, where management, this new management has the best chance of coming -- I mean you can see by the road map that we have out there, we have very explicit plans when it comes to execution, what is it that we need to execute on and how we're going to deliver that total shareholder return for our investors. So I think that the -- that $18 billion, $7 billion range roughly in that -- that kind of an area, that kind of -- is, I think, the right -- and I haven't changed on that. Even with what I see today, I haven't changed. If anything, I'm a little more confident as I continue to see things come together. 
But look, if you'll just be a little bit patient and let management come forth with very specific guidance with a lot of detail behind the guidance. And then also, I want to live up to the promise of the expectations that when management does come forth, I do think that they owe it to the investment community to share how exactly they're thinking about this global business, to do a walk around, around each of the geographical territories, do SWOT analysis for you. And as they speak about how they're thinking about the business, then the next step should be, that should help you guys begin to build your models. And then I think there needs to be a discussion between management and the sell-side analysts and shareholders who are building models to make sure how we're thinking about the business, what disclosures and how transparent we can be, because we absolutely want to be as transparent as we could without hurting our competitive landscape. So please expect that we're still going to go through that process. And it's just a process. But it's an exciting process and one that we're looking forward to working together with you on."

But it's not at the point that it has come to a point that it's going to adversely -- we don't see some of these trends continue where we are. We see freight basically getting normalized as we go along. We're getting used to this whole new norm. But as we go along, we are keeping a very close watch on this, and we will be transparent about what's coming from what bucket, how it's being impacted. We -- more importantly, our focus has been on the continuity of supply, supply of the critical products, supply of the important, how can we meet the surge, some ICU critical products, how the demands have increased. So we have kept our focus on that. So that's, I think, from the supply chain point of view. 
The second from epinephrine, we are in a strong position from supply at this point of time. We are ready for the school season. We don't see any hiccups at this point of time, Elliot."

And it is something that we've been watching for the last several months. There's a portion of our cost, clearly, that is less flexible, especially since we have and said in the prepared remarks that certain parts of our restructuring programs will be placed on hold for a period of time. We will not be addressing certain programs that require impact on employees for all the reasons that you would want us to put those on hold. There are parts of our restructuring program that can continue, preparatory phases, looking at certain parts of our supply chain and our operational chain. So those will continue. 
On the question of cost, besides the payroll costs, we do have buckets of costs that are variable in nature, whether it be travel, which I called out, advertising and promotions, meeting expenses, things such as that, along with other parts of our spend that is discretionary or, I would say, more discretionary and flexible in nature. With what's going on, some of that naturally reduces. I'm sure you see the same thing just like we do. People are not traveling. People are not getting on airplanes. People are doing much more by conferencing and tele calls and things such as that. So we have a measurable bucket of cost in this business that will move favorably with us. 
I would also remind you that our business transformation activities are anticipated, and that extends beyond our restructuring program, but it is a part of our restructuring program. Those will continue to occur as we move throughout the year, those parts of the business transformation that relates to products and evaluation of products that remain in the portfolio. So I think with the mix of all that, without giving you specific numbers on that, we believe that there is plenty of room to kind of manage with what we see with COVID in our current outlook extending through the second quarter to manage our cost base in relation to the current environment."

And it's a great question, because without at least me projecting or, in my own mind, going out to 2022, how would I ever ensure that 2021 is going to be that trough year? I think that, David, what I'm trying to focus on is, one, I think that the company is going to go through 2 stages for a potential rerate. I think, one, we have to get to closing. That's the very first thing we need to do. You can talk about paying the dividend, but until you actually are in a position to start paying it, I think there's that wait. So I want to be very clear about our commitment, and I'm glad that Umer asked the question that he did. And I think people are much closer when it comes to the dividend even though I'm not going to give an exact number but commit to 25% of free cash flows. I actually think people are much closer to what they've anticipated than the number that Umer put out that some people are thinking about. 
But I think once we close and we actually formed Viatris and we have that right starting point and people actually can see the new financial profile, I mean we are already stronger from a financial profile than any one of our -- any one in our sector right now. Imagine when we bring Mylan together with the Pfizer Upjohn business. When you take a look at that balance sheet and you take a look at our cash generation and you take a look at our friendly shareholder capital allocation, I'm just telling you right off the bat, I do think that will be the first time we'll get the first rerate. But the second rerate will come. And the one I think it's going to be most impactful is when management can outline a 3- to 5-year CAGR off of that '21 trough number and put legs behind -- underneath that 3- to 5-year CAGR, be very explicit about how you're going to hit those growth rates both in 3 to 5 years. What do we already have in-house? What are we relying upon? And then I think once the investment community really gets comfortable with the stabilization and the consistency quarter after quarter of the baseline profile, and then they start to see some vision where there's actually -- they can actually see how we're going to get the growth, then I really think that the multiple that our company really deserves will materialize, but it has to happen in steps. That's not going to happen overnight and certainly not going to happen over our looks. But I want to thank you for that question because I can only say that I'm looking at 2022 but more so to ensure that 2021 is really going to be that trough year."

But you asked about how COVID-19 could play in, I would say that. 
I would say that the other one -- the only other one is the remaining regulatory agencies for the antitrust. And I can tell you, I'm feeling very comfortable with the work that's been done, just where we are. I mean, obviously, when DC closed on, they themselves, the agency themselves, the FTC asked for an extension. So we've absolutely opined on their request. I don't know how you can't. But there is nothing I see that's going to get in the way of our ability to close at the second half of this year. There's nothing I see -- there's no impediment. I think we have plenty of time to accommodate both COVID-19 and the antitrust regulators in terms of what needs to get done."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on what could be Mylan's last earnings call. While we know all good things must come to an end, the team is ready to turn the page and is looking forward to Viatris becoming a reality and a global leader in the health care sector. I'm going to start today by giving a brief overview of our performance to date, COVID impact and updated guidance for the year. Rajiv and Tony will elaborate on the performance of our regions, key products as well as an integration planning update and Ken will review the detailed financial results for Q2 and the first half of the year. 
Lastly, Robert will provide perspective on the progress we continue to make towards becoming Viatris. 
Before we dive into results, I first would like to reiterate that Mylan remains committed to the health and safety of our employees, our patients and the global health care community at large. The COVID pandemic has forced all of us to acknowledge and grapple with difficult uncertainties and our heartfelt sympathy goes out to all of those who have been directly impacted. At the same time, I continue to be inspired by our employees around the world, especially our essential workers who have allowed us to continue to deliver important medicines during these unprecedented times. Thanks to their efforts, our plans remain operational, and our supply chain and customer service levels continue unabated. Additionally, we continue to leverage our resources and expertise in the fight against COVID-19 through potential prevention and treatment efforts. 
Now turning to our results. We believe our results from the first half of the year better represent the underlying performance of the business due to the fact that any COVID-19 related gains in Q1 were more than offset by the negative impact of the pandemic in Q2. During the first 6 months of the year, we delivered a solid performance that demonstrates the strong fundamentals of our business and our continued ability to actively and successfully manage through this time. The favorable results for the first 6 months are in line with our expectations. 
We achieved $5.35 billion of total revenues, up 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA of $1.63 billion, up 5% year-over-year. While we experienced a decrease in adjusted SG&A in the first 6 months of the year, partly due to COVID, our proactive business transformation efforts targeted at aligning investments with top line returns, represent a more important example of our ability to focus on not only maintaining our margins for 2020, but also continuing to drive sustainable long-term benefits for the business. 
On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted free cash flow is up 17% over the same period in 2019, and we expect sequential growth in the second part of the year, which speaks to the durable cash flow portfolio of our business. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we're tightening our full year guidance within the ranges of our original expectations for both adjusted EBITDA and total revenue. On adjusted EBITDA, we expect to be able to substantially maintain our original target for the full year, while tightening the range to between $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion. And on revenue, we're tightening our full year range to between $11.5 billion and $12 billion. Our outlook for the rest of the year includes some important data points. 
First, it's clear that overall COVID-19 recovery efforts are occurring slower-than-anticipated and may continue at least through the end of this year. As a result, we expect that our total revenues, which absorbed a 2% net decline in the first half of the year to have an overall similar negative impact of 2% in the second half of the year. 
And on EBITDA, while we are seeing savings in SG&A due to COVID, these are being partially offset by the previously announced delay in the implementation of the restructuring portion of our business transformation initiatives also due to COVID. With all of that said, it's important to note that we do not anticipate significant change to overall demand in our underlying base business. 
Before I turn the call over and on behalf of the management team, I would like to take a minute and thank Ken for his service and partnership over the years. We wish him all the best in his next venture. 
I look forward to partnering closely with Paul Campbell, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer during this interim transition period. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv for further commentary."

I would like to extend a warm welcome to my fellow, Mylan colleagues and future Viatris colleagues joining today's call. As we continue to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of our workforce remains our #1 priority. I would like to echo Heather's remarks and thank our front-line workers who are keeping our operations running. It is because of their efforts that we have been able to maintain supply continuity and strong customer service levels across the globe without any meaningful disruption during the first half of 2020. 
I would also like to thank our sales force who have provided continued support to meet the needs of health care professionals and the patients they serve. We recognize the important role we play in fighting this pandemic and continue to seek opportunities to effectively deploy our resources and expertise. 
For example, during this quarter, we signed a global collaboration agreement with Gilead Sciences to commercialize remdesivir in 127 low and middle income countries. In less than 90 days of signing the agreement, we ramped up our science, production, received regulatory approval in India and started commercially supplying the product in that market, reflecting the strength of our scientific capabilities and global operations. 
We look forward to further expanding access to this critical medicine in other countries. As I walk through our first half financial results, I'll explain the impact of COVID-19 to our performance. 
We delivered $5.4 billion in total revenues in the first half of the year, which is a 3% constant currency growth versus the prior year. The durability and diversity of our portfolio and the strength of our underlying business allowed us to absorb a 2% negative revenue impact as a result of COVID-19. 
For North America, our net sales were $2 billion in the first 6 months, which are up 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We continue to benefit from implementing our business transformation program. In the U.S., this has helped us reshape our largely commodity oral solids portfolio to a more diversified portfolio of complex generics, biosimilar and brand products. 
Our 2 main product drivers this half are Wixela, a generic to Advair and Yupelri, our nebulized once daily LAMA. 
Regarding Wixela, we are excited that we have been able to grow our market share from 20% in the first half of 2019 to 33% in the first half of this year. Also, Yupelri achieved a 92% share of nebulized LAMA market and a 16% share of long-acting nebulized market. 
Overall, COVID-19 had a very minimal net impact in the region. In Europe, our net sales totaled $2 billion in the first half of the year. These results are up 7% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year due to the higher volumes of existing products and new launches. Similar to USA, we are realizing the benefits of applying a highly disciplined financial lens to our European business as a result of business transformation. We have not only rightsized our portfolio by eliminating certain negative contribution margin products but also have focused our investments in selling and marketing. 
As a result of this, we have seen strong growth of our key brands such as Dymista, Brufen, EpiPen and Creon and continued sales growth of folio or biosimilar to Humira. 
These core drivers helped us absorb the negative 3% revenue impact to the European segment due to the COVID-19 as a result of lower demand of certain brand and OTC products. In Rest of the World, our net sales totaled $1.3 billion for the first half of the year, which is a 3% decline on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, while our ARV business performed strongly, COVID-19 had a 3% negative revenue impact, primarily due to slower-than-anticipated recovery in Brazil, Russia, China and some other emerging markets. 
I am excited now to share some key pipeline updates. Our scientists, regulatory experts, the IP legal team, working closely with our development partners have made tremendous strides in advancing key programs. The scientific platform we have built with a diversified across dosage farm, delivery systems and therapeutic areas with a focus on moving up the science spectrum. 
Our global biosimilar franchise is one of our key long-term growth opportunities. Tony will walk you through the commercial progress we have made for the last year in several of our key markets, while I will provide updates on our development programs. 
Before Tony and I provide our respective updates, I would like to acknowledge our strong partnership with the Biocon Biologics to execute on our joint programs. 
Beginning with Semglee, our insulin glargine, we received our FDA approval in June, and we are excited to launch it in the coming weeks and expand access for the millions of Americans living with diabetes, while also reducing the cost burden to the U.S. health care system. 
Additionally, we have submitted to agency all necessary documentation to seek biosimilar interchangeability. Given the complexity in the bringing this type of product to the market, we believe Semglee will have a long revenue stream with a slower ramp up. 
Continuing with our commitment to developing more affordable insulins, we have progressed our insulin aspart program. Our BLA and marketing authorization for a biosimilar to no law is now under review with the FDA and the European health authorities. 
Our BLA for our biosimilar to Avastin is under review with FDA and is expected to be approved by the end of this year. 
Our marketing authorization remains under review with the European health authorities. Our Phase III clinical trial for our biosimilar to EYLEA remain on track to support a BLA filing for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our biosimilar to Enbrel, Nefexo received European marketing authorization in June and is on track to launch in Germany this month, followed by additional European markets by the end of the year. 
Our biosimilar to Humira, Julio received FDA approval last month, as for our patent license agreement of AbbVie, we'll be able to launch Hulio in U.S. in July 2023. 
Also, we confirmed in June that we are advancing our development program with Revance for a biosimilar to BOTOX. At this stage, we are in the process of scaling up, validating the characterization and performing preclinical work with a goal to start our clinical program, which has been pre-agreed with FDA. 
Our goal is to bring this product to the market by 2025. I will now provide you an update on some other pipeline products, beginning with [indiscernible] fumarate. 
In parallel with our significant U.S. district code when invalidating BioGen's Tecfidera 514 patent, we have been working closely with FDA to expedite and finalize the review of our ANDA. 
We believe agency is prioritizing their review to complete it before the target action date. We continue to invest in our industry-leading infectious disease portfolio. Very recently, European Commission and DCGI in India granted marketing authorization for [indiscernible] a novel compound developed by nonprofit TB alliance for use in a new regimen for treating highly drug resistant pulmonary tuberculoses. 
Mylan is proud to be at TB alliance global commercialization partner for predominant as a part of this treatment. 
Moving on to our respiratory portfolio. We remain on track to receive tentative approval from FDA for our first-to-file generic Symbicort by end of this year. Our 30 months stay date is March of 21. 
Our glatiramer acetate once-a-month program is progressing well. We announced in June an additional investment in Mapi Pharma to support continued investment on the Phase III clinical study to further strengthen our multiple viruses offering in U.S. since the approval of glatiramer acetate injection, we have been steadily strengthening our development pipeline of complex injectables. 
We currently have indulge under active review at the FDA for generics of Victoza, Invega TRINZA, Invega Sustena, venofer, injectafer and glucagon. We have a rich pipeline of long-acting and complex injectable products in development using multiple technologies such as deeper gels, microspheres, liposomes and peptides. In regards to our continued expansion into high-value product opportunities, we remain on track to initiate our Phase II clinical study by end of this year for MR-107A-01 program, which is being developed as a nonnarcotic oral analgesic for management of moderate to sever pain. 
We also remain on track to progress the development of MR-106A-01, which is a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that is being developed as a topical product for burn wound treatment. 
Our pipeline also includes a focus on key future growth markets. Like China, we are fighting dimesta for approval this quarter and will initiate clinical programs for Yupelri and performance later this year as we continue to explore more opportunities to expand our presence in China. 
Lastly, while Robert will cover certain aspects of the Upjohn transaction, I would like to take a moment to share how excited I am about the progress we have made on the integration plan. 
Over the last year, Mylan and Upjohn teams have been working together as we prepare for the deal close with a focus on quality separation and integration. Everyone's hard work is building a strong foundation for Viatris and setting us up for success on day 1 and beyond. And we look forward to sharing the Viatris story more with analysts and investors over the coming months. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."

First, I want to echo Heather and Rajiv sentiments that we are pleased with the overall performance of our business and are proud of the portfolio we have built that can withstand the short-term impacts we are experiencing in the current environment. Before I get into the -- our commercial performance for the quarter, I want to address our continued efforts to keep our sales force and customers safe and healthy in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have equipped our sales team with virtual tools to allow them to provide the same level of service their customers are used to receiving. 
With these tools, we've been able to provide continued support and service to health care providers, including hosting more than 2,500 webinars and conducting more than 0.5 million video calls. At the same time, our product service levels to customers across the markets remain strong and at the highest rates we've had in many years. We are incredibly grateful to our sales force and commercial teams for their strong performance, flexibility and continued dedication throughout the quarter and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have allowed us to continue setting new standards in health care and advance our mission. We have begun to return some of our field force to face-to-face interactions while adhering to health officials guidelines. And we will continue to monitor market conditions in all regions in which we operate to ensure that we are bringing our sales force back to the field in a way that [indiscernible] was there and our customer safety, while meeting the needs of health care providers and patients around the world. 
Turning to our commercial results for the quarter. Our ability to perform in what has continued to be a dynamic and challenging environment underscores the strength and resilience of our commercial platform. We are very proud of our first half performance, where we've seen positive growth in many of our key markets, including in North America, specifically with growth in 2 of our key respiratory products with Silla which had grown 62% and Yupelri, which has grown more than 600% in the first half of 2020 versus the prior year. 
We also had a positive growth in Europe, which helped offset Rest of World business declines, largely due to more significant impact of COVID-19 in expansion in emerging markets. 
Moving on to a vital part of our long-term strategy. I would now like to take a deep dive into our biosimilars business. We continue to be pleased with the initial growth and pockets of success in our global biosimilars franchise, as we are approaching the $1 billion milestone in expected cumulative sales with 90% of this value coming over the last 2 years. 
We have built one of the largest and most diverse franchises in the industry. Including products across multiple therapeutic categories. As we have stated in the past, the biosimilars franchises won with long-term growth opportunities with more than 100 launches spanning across more than 60 unique markets across the world. As a result, I remain confident in our ability to continue to develop and globally commercialize our biosimilars franchise with the potential of becoming a cornerstone of our business over the long term. We are seeing many positive signs in the markets, which I will expand upon. 
Turning to highlights of our biosimilars business by region. We continue to expand our biosimilars franchise in the U.S. and we're pleased FDA approval this quarter for Semglee, a biosimilar to Lantus and for Hulio, a biosimilar to Humira. As we have commented before, this is a long-term franchise strategy that will reap the rewards in the years to come. And although we know we have much work to do in these initial phases, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of products like Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin, while market share has more than tripled in the past 3 months to nearly 6% as well as renewed growth in Fulphila, a biosimilar to Neulasta. Increasing our share to nearly 16% of the prefilled syringe market in the U.S. 
In addition, Ogivri in Canada has captured 23% of the entire market, and is the #1 ranked biosimilar to trastuzumab in both value and volume. In Europe, we continue to be encouraged by the opportunities that lie ahead in many of the markets. Our Ogivri has double-digit share in 9 markets in the region and is advancing share in the critical markets like France and Sweden. Hulio has also found success in markets like Germany, France and Finland. 
In Germany, we are seeing more than 13% share of the entire market and share of the biosimilars market, exceeding 20% for the first time. 
We have double-digit biosimilar share on Hulio in 10 markets in Europe. We see significant opportunities ahead and are projecting nearly 100% growth in the early stages of the biosimilars business in Europe in 2020 over the prior year. 
For the Rest of World segment, we have seen more than 40% growth year-over-year and now offer biosimilar products in more than 40 countries. We have been very pleased with our performance in markets like Tunisia, Morocco and the Philippines, where we have retained a market leadership position for [indiscernible] our biosimilar to Herceptin, as well is in Australia, where we're now the #1 biosimilar to trastuzumab representing 75% of the biosimilars market. 
In closing, as we have mentioned, our biosimilar strategy has been and continues to be about developing and executing on this long-term global franchise, focusing on market relevance, and global leadership as it relates to this extremely important area for patient access and payer savings around the world. 
We are beginning to see signs of our hard work and efforts materialize in the market. And are pleased with the early trajectory of our biosimilars business. We remain confident that our experienced scientific capabilities and commercial platform position us to expand this business and be a leader in the biosimilar space. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ken to discuss our financial results in more detail."

As you've seen in our press release this morning, and I've heard throughout this call, our first half 2020 results showcase Mylan's ability to perform in a challenging environment and underscore the resiliency as",1111,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our press release this morning, and I've heard throughout this call, our first half 2020 results showcase Mylan's ability to perform in a challenging environment and underscore the resiliency as well as the durability of the platform we've built over the last decade. Embedded in our strong first half results was a more pronounced impact from COVID in the second quarter. Q2 revenues of $2.7 billion were 4% lower than the prior year and 2% lower on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenues were negatively impacted approximately 5% as a result of the COVID pandemic. 
A portion of this was the reversal of the accelerated buying we saw at the end of the first quarter as customers and patients, primarily in Europe, began to react to the early signs of the ramp in the pandemic. As disclosed in our first quarter conference call, we estimated this accelerated buying to be approximately $50 million or 2% of first quarter sales. As the pandemic continued to take hold globally, we saw second quarter revenues negatively impacted by lower retail pharmacy demand, lower patient hospital visits and a materially lower number of in-person meetings with prescribers and payers, mostly in Europe and the rest of world segments. That said, first half revenues were flat year-over-year and up approximately 3%, excluding the impact of currency exchange. Pricing declines remained relatively consistent at down low to mid-single digits overall and volumes of existing products grew 5%, including the negative impact of COVID. 
New product launch revenues contributed $163 million in the first half of the year, and we expect an additional $450 million of new product launches in the second half. 
Moving to gross margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted gross margins remained strong at 54.3%. That's up 50 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting higher gross profit from sales of existing products in North America, primarily driven by sales of Lexela as well as the contribution of new products. 
This impact was partially offset by lower gross margins on sales of existing products in the Rest of World segment, including China and other expansion markets. From a segment profitability standpoint, North America increased 3% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This increase reflects contributions from new product sales, higher volumes of sales from existing products, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing on existing products driven by changes in the competitive environment, including levothyroxine. Europe segment profitability also expanded up 28% in the quarter, partially driven by favorable product mix. 
Conversely, rest of world segment profitability declined, down 22%, mainly due to the negative impact of COVID-19 and lower pricing on existing products, primarily due to government pricing reductions in Japan. In addition, all segments benefited from lower selling and marketing costs, and both Europe and Rest of World segments profitability results were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. 
Second quarter adjusted R&D was down 4% compared to 2019 due to reprioritization of global programs as well as certain timing impacts in response to the pandemic. 
During the quarter, adjusted SG&A spending declined 11% year-over-year, reflecting lower-than-anticipated selling and marketing investments, lower travel and entertainment activities and lower legal expenses primarily in response to the COVID pandemic, along with the ongoing active management of the business. 
For Q2, we reported adjusted net earnings of $574 million and adjusted EBITDA of $879 million, an increase of 8% and 4%, respectively. For the first 6 months of the year, adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA grew a healthy 9% and 5% on revenues that grew 3% on a constant currency basis. 
Turning to cash flow for the first 3 months ended June 30, 2020, adjusted free cash flow was $522 million, bringing first half adjusted free cash flow to $879 million, that's up 17% and up $129 million over the same period in 2019. 
While we don't presently see any negative liquidity trends related to the pandemic, we do continue to monitor those trends very closely. We expect adjusted free cash flow to increase in the second half of the year in line with seasonally increasing profitability, coupled with ongoing realization of working capital velocity initiatives. 
During the second quarter, we repaid EUR 500 million of scheduled debt maturities and reduced our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to 3.4x, in line with our expectations and well below our covenant requirements. 
We continue to anticipate full year adjusted free cash flow generation, consistent with 2019 levels, which will support achievement of our $1 billion debt repayment target for the full year. 
We expect our cash flow from operations along with our existing borrowing facilities, which provide liquidity up to $2.6 billion will be more than sufficient to meet all possible liquidity needs in the near term. As always, we remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit ratings and to further reducing leverage. 
Finally, as you've heard earlier, we're narrowing our full year 2020 guidance ranges. Revenues are now expected to be in the range of $11.5 to $12 billion, absorbing the ongoing headwinds from the COVID pandemic. And while we're seeing savings in SG&A due to COVID, these savings are being partially offset by the delayed implementation of the restructuring portion of our business transformation plans also due to COVID. 
As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion also tightening that previous range and raising the low end of the range. 
At the midpoint of this range, $3.5 billion, this implies slightly less than $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the second half of the year. And as usual, we expect the fourth quarter to contribute relatively more adjusted EBITDA than the third quarter. We also continue to expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate between 18% and 19% and a full year average diluted share count between 516 million and 520 million shares, consistent with our earlier guidance. 
Before I wrap up my comments, I must take a minute to express my sincere thanks for the honor to have had the opportunity to serve this company, its stakeholders and most importantly, this team for the last 4 years. The unwavering dedication by all 35,000 employees to the company's mission is truly unparalleled. 
While I'm extremely excited for my next opportunity, I will always be watching my Mylan and Viatris colleagues, tiering them on as they continue to reshape the global health care landscape, ensuring access to affordable medications for the world's population.

I am proud of our management team's leadership and always put in the safety of our colleagues around the world first. 
While focus on safety remains paramount, as you heard from Heather and the management team, what is also truly impressive is Mylan's employees continues and how they can just continue to deliver on the solid performance and especially in the second quarter. While the management team provided an update on the year-to-date, I would now like to turn my attention to where we stand with respect to our pending transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn, and how I continue to see 2021 shaping up directionally with official guidance to follow directly from Viatris' management team following the close. 
As many of you know, we held an extraordinary general meeting on June 30 for shareholders to vote on the Viatris transaction. We are extremely pleased with the overwhelming support we received, which was demonstrated by the fact that 99.6% of the shares voting were in favor of the transaction. With the approval of our shareholders, the only remaining external requirements to close the transaction are a few regulatory approvals, and we are still on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
While we have continued to work towards closing, the Viatris management team recently began the process of meeting virtually with many of our top Mylan shareholders and covering sell-side analysts, as we previously promised. 
During these meetings, Michael, Rajiv and Sanjiv not only demonstrated their cohesive alignment, passion and excitement to lead this great new organization, but they also convey their confidence in being able to deliver significant long-term value to shareholders. 
We expect those conversations to continue as we expand our shareholder engagement activities, including with the Pfizer shareholders, who will become Viatris shareholders through the closing and beyond. 
I will soon be personally reaching out to the Pfizer shareholders to set up their own meeting rates with the future Viatris management team. With that said, I would like to sincerely thank all those who have participated in these meet and greet sessions to date. 
In addition to all the milestones achieved to date as we look forward to closing, I would now like to lay out a number of key next steps of interest to the future features investment community. 
Step 1, first and foremost, is to close this transaction, which we are on track to do in the fourth quarter. Without speaking for Pfizer, I can certainly tell you that both organizations remain highly focused on bringing this transaction to a successful close. 
Step 2. It is for the Viatris' Board of Directors to then immediately initiate our new business model focused on total shareholder return and a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation program, beginning with the initiation of a meaningful and attractive dividend after the first full quarter following closing, while also rapidly beginning to pay down debt to meet our stated target of 2.5x leverage ratio. 
Step 3. At the end of February or early March, when Viatris reports its fourth quarter earnings, you can expect the new Viatris management team to provide the opening guidance for Viatris' first full year 2021, which I often refer to as the trough year, during a live Investor Day. It is expected that the guidance delivered will take all relevant country-specific headwinds into consideration, for example, and among others, China's VPP, Japan Lyrica LOE and any other potential headwinds that will be known at the time, including any effects as a result of a continuing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Step 4. Viatris' management must demonstrate its ability to deliver consistent and transparent results in a predictable and measurable way. At the same time, while integrating both businesses and achieving our targets of at least $1 billion in synergies over the first 4 years of operations. 
Step 5. We will launch Viatris' new global health care gateway, which will be the house of discipline, responsible for all future capital investments to fuel Viatris' future growth. 
With that said, I will try to answer any remaining questions of interest regarding Viatris during the Q&A session. 
But before I conclude, I would like to state that given Viatris' vast global profile, with now 70% of its business outside the United States and diverse global reach as well as our commitment to total shareholder return and corporate social responsibility. We believe that Viatris will be perfectly situated to attract even a broader shareholder base around the world. Therefore, we intend to explore ways to unlock value beyond our current U.S.-centric shareholder base by exploring additional potential listings on other international exchange trading platforms. 
In closing, before turning the call over to the operator, I would like to conclude by underscoring how very excited we are to launch Viatris in its mission to empower people around the world to live healthier at every stage of life. 
As we anticipate this to be our last Mylan's quarterly earnings call. And although Heather will remain with us until we close, I would also like to thank Heather in this forum. 
Heather, on behalf of our Board of Directors and all of our Mylan employees for your exemplary true leadership and lasting contributions that you have made to Mylan, our industry and patients around the world. Thank you. 
And now as we start the Q&A session, I would ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question in the spirit of time and respect for others on the call. 
I'll now turn the call over to the operator."

But equally, because of what we created, business development and attracting partners around the globe, all of that will reside in the global health care gateway. I simply see the future of Viatris being represented on really 2 platforms. One, it will be the 2 60-plus year old companies coming together and really executing on what that base business is. And then off to the right, I see the global health care gateway, the real engine. We call it the house of discipline because that's where all capital investments will reside. And that's where you will see all excess cash flow and capital being placed to compete. Whether it's the organic R&D, whether it's business development, whether it's collaborations or joint ventures. All of it will be competing in the global health care gateway. 
I envision that The Street after envision future conference calls with the new management team, I expect to report on the base platform, and I don't really expect that to be very much. We will report the results because we have very experienced management team that will execute, deliver on the numbers, but I do expect a great majority of time being spent with Michael, Rajiv, especially on the global health care gateway for each new opportunity that we put inside there. And I really believe that's how you're going to be able to follow the company on a going-forward basis."

What I envision, Viatris being able to do is to serve as the -- really the next natural secondary source that all countries are going to need. I do see a potential upside opportunity just like we were approached on remdesivir, hydrochloric or any other needs that I see arise in the world. And it's not just limited in the United States. I think, Rajiv, you can comment on about how the India government and other governments are approaching us. So I do think that having a global supply chain especially in the health care industry, especially in pharmaceuticals, just given the global supplies we need. It's not going to become unwounded, so to speak, there's going to be a big need for, I think, our global platform, and I do see some potential opportunity."

So how should we be thinking about Viatris as a partner of choice on China going forward? And do you think that could partially be because of the deal is not done yet and maybe there is bit of a stand still? 
And secondly, Robert, I know you guys do extensive legal diligence. And one of the key sticking points and pro forma numbers is Lyrica Japan, and there's some element of mixed feedback coming up on the recent Japanese patent office ruling on whether the upheld claims do support exclusivity through 2022 or the claims that were not upheld, do they ensure that generics get in? I'd be very curious on your take on these."

But that doesn't mean, just because you haven't heard any [indiscernible] doesn't mean that we're not at work. That I could tell you. And the reason why I'm so emphatic about the 100% because the last thing we need right now is for the China Upjohn -- Pfizer Upjohn operation to take its eye off the ball. Because remember, they needed to finish separating Upjohn from Pfizer. And that work is coming along very, very well. They're not actually quite complete. They're almost done. And then I think the other thing that we've been focusing on in China is really what is the new business model going forward. I think the base that we're going to be starting from in China is quite enviable. And quite frankly, let me be clear. I think that we're going to be able to compete. And I'm watching as well. I think it was a very observant comment that you have because I'm watching as well as some of the deals that are getting done with the Chinese nationalist. I think that the Viatris is not going to be considered as a traditional multinational. I think Viatris in China is being viewed as a Chinese nationals entrepreneur as well. So I do think we represent a hybrid. I think we bring the multinational mindset, but I think we bring the entrepreneurial very quick and nimble, boutique, Chinese entrepreneurial style. And I do think it's going to have its advantage. So I'm quite excited about the opportunity in China. And I'll be teaming up, as you know, with Michael doing actually a lot of the work in China and looking forward to reporting on more opportunities that we see as we go forward. 
In terms of Lyrica, I think another very insightful question. And the way you parsed it, I think, is fair. So I'm going to try to be fair in response by telling you that I do think that it's a complicated legal issue. I think it's a complicated breakdown of the construction claims around the patent. And then I think it's also complicated. When you look at the momentum about where Japan has in the MWLH and kind of sort of what they've been thinking about. So I'd rather not -- like any other legal case, not try to handicap it, but what I do think, to be fair to The Street, at least from my perspective, what I would say and what I would be strongly recommending management to do, I think it would be wholly irresponsible, in my opinion, and just my opinion, to include the Japan Lyrica numbers in what I would call the trough year in 2021. And I think if we are successful with the Japan Lyrica in Japan, which I'm hopeful and confident. Certainly, I think we've come a long way. We could have had an outright loss. No, we didn't get an outright win. I think that the courts split the decision. And I think it's only going to be a matter of time before we know. But the numbers that you should expect in 2021, what I think investors need to appreciate, unlike the United States, is we will not lose 100% of Lyrica in Japan. What will be included in the numbers is a certain percentage that we know we will hold on to just because of the way that marketplace works. So it's actually a fairly nice base. I wouldn't take all the numbers out. But what we would do, assuming even if we have generic Lyrica as a win, I believe the responsible thing to do would be to separate what is all included in our base and anything excess that we get from Generic Lyrica and Japan or that we get from Lyrica in Japan before it goes generics. I would ask investors to more look at it almost like how they used to model the 180-day exclusivity here in the United States. It's going to be much more of a cash bolus, but I don't think as a going concern, and that, that should be included in our base business and also as part of our base -- as we project pro forma on a going-forward basis. That's what you can expect. I hope that was helpful, Umer."

That is what we're banking on as part of our upside as we see the cadence rolling forward. David, there's been a lot of questions. When we first announced the deal, people were concerned about whether or not this was a declining business. 
Today, we don't hear anybody discussing about this as a declining business. Everybody wants to talk about how are we going to return back to growth. No one's talking about it's a declining business because we quickly jumped in front as quickly as we could. We're not relying on 2020. We never did. Because we believe that 2021 is going to represent the best first starting point for Viatris as a brand-new company. 
We have all the opportunity in the world to reset these numbers, especially given our current market multiple to make sure that this new Viatris management team is set up for success quarter after quarter after quarter, not just to me but hopefully exceed. And so you should expect that that's the way we're thinking. And so to get the 2021's drop, we'll take a quick look at a couple of years out and ensure that the numbers we start with 2021, taken all the headwinds that everybody has been discussing out of the baseline business. And even to Umer's question around Japan's Lyrica, you're going to see we're going to set that aside as well because anything that is not sustainable, that doesn't really have a strong tail to it, we don't believe belongs in the base business. Those are temporary and what we want to demonstrate is the durability and the sustainability of this new base platform when we pull this together. And in that base platform, I think it will be a pleasantful surprise. We don't see any 1 meaningful catalyst that will cause the type of volatility that I think that the Mylan investors have experienced, especially in North America. 
So we really have not just diversified, but derisked our entire business model by really taking out all that noise and really addressing all the headwinds that we can envision right upfront. The cadence over the first 3, 4 years, what I think you should expect is this is going to be an EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings growth story. You know, David, earnings growth can come in many ways. 
In the first 3 to 4 years, what we were trying to convey, and I think what management was conveying in its meet and greet with you and some of our shareholders was -- you should -- you can get earnings growth by adding to your top line or you can get earnings growth like we potentially see our ability to drive earnings growth, EBITDA growth, free cash flow growth by launching the pipeline that we already have. And most importantly, garnering the synergies over the first 3 to 4 years. 
When you look at what we have to work with, I think that the Viatris shareholders should expect an extraordinarily stable top line revenue business and the early years with growth in EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings. So you're going to see an earnings growth story right away, because the dividend or the synergies will allow us to do that. In the meantime, you're going to also want to pay attention to what we load up in the global health care gateway, and how we're using -- how we're placing our capital investments in years 1, 2, 3 and 4. And as the synergies roll off at the end of year 4, you're going to start to see where the top line growth that we're going to be able to maintain earnings growth and EBITDA growth, free cash flow growth by what we add to that top line. And that's as simple as I can lay it off for you, and that's exactly what management is signing up for. It's exactly the road map that we put in all of our presentations. And I do look forward for the new management team to really give you even more color once they have -- once you have a chance to close, they have a chance to get together and really dive deep into the new combined organization to deliver on exactly what I laid out for you, David."

EpiPen is a larger quarter in the third quarter as well as many of our products in Europe, including Influvac, our bigger products in the third and then especially the fourth quarter. So you've got the typical seasonal step up to get to that growth from the 5.3% to the higher number that you calculate to get to the midpoint. But then I'll also point out one of the comments in my scripted comments, which is in the first half of the year, our new product launch revenues were about $163 million, and we're expecting another $425 million to $430 million of that that's also back-end weighted.

We have always planned, we've said this many, many times publicly. When we did our deal with Biocon and created something, I think, very, very special, in which we were way behind when we first started in 2009 but not only did we catch up, we went way ahead. What we've planned for always was for more of a global launch in our biologics because back then, we did not see the pathway to a U.S. biologics market. That happened rather quickly, and it happened over the last few years. One of the things that we had and why we're doing so well in other parts ex U.S. is because we've already had the proper infrastructure already in place, we were ready for those markets. To be very honest with you, I don't believe we had the right commercial infrastructure as well as I believe we could have had in the United States. I've seen that when a company like Coherus could come in, nobody knows the name Coherus, everybody knows the name of Amgen's sales reps. Coherus is Amgen's sales reps. So when you understand the market in the United States and understand the importance of that well-established relationship between those reps, the hospitals and the -- within that particular franchise in that food chain. I would say, absolutely, that was part because it's not just the cost, it is about some of those relationships. And that's an opportunity for us to improve going forward here in the United States. But I'm hoping now that when people look at our franchise, our global franchise, they'll start to appreciate how well we're doing ex U.S. as well."

You're absolutely correct that right now, as we're talking about adjusted free cash flows, we are adding back the cost as we're going through the Morgantown remediation and restructuring program. But also, I will point out that there's also this bucket now called manufacturing variances. And the reason I called that out is because as we've continued to operate the factory in the COVID situation, that has generated some inefficiencies. So as you asked the question about how far this goes out, we certainly and consistent with what we told you in the first quarter, expect that while the warning letter has been lifted, we have some commitments to the FDA that will take remediation and restructuring to continue through periods of the balance of this year. As the COVID pandemic continues, we will also have manufacturing variances that will continue to occur as long as we're operating in this environment. With that, I'll turn it over to Rajiv."

So that's why we are stating that cost for the time being over here.

During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including financial guidance for 2020 and the proposed transition pursuant to which Mylan will combine with Pfizer Inc.'s Upjohn business in a reverse Morris Trust transaction to create a new company that will be named Viatris. 
These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as our supplemental earnings slides, all of which are posted on our website at investor.mylan.com, for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements. 
Mylan routinely post information that may be important to investors on this website, and we use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, nonexclusionary manner for purposes of SEC's regulation fair disclosure. 
In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. 
We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures are available in our second quarter 2020 earnings release and supplemental earnings slides as well as in the Investors section of our website. 
Please note that this call relates to Mylan's second quarter 2020 earnings, and we will be limited in what we can speak during Q&A regarding Viatris, and we will not be speaking about the Upjohn business. 
Let me also remind you that the information discussed during the call, except for the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on what could be Mylan's last earnings call. While we know all good things must come to an end, the team is ready to turn the page and is looking forward to Viatris becoming a reality and a global leader in the health care sector. I'm going to start today by giving a brief overview of our performance to date, COVID impact and updated guidance for the year. Rajiv and Tony will elaborate on the performance of our regions, key products as well as an integration planning update and Ken will review the detailed financial results for Q2 and the first half of the year. 
Lastly, Robert will provide perspective on the progress we continue to make towards becoming Viatris. 
Before we dive into results, I first would like to reiterate that Mylan remains committed to the health and safety of our employees, our patients and the global health care community at large. The COVID pandemic has forced all of us to acknowledge and grapple with difficult uncertainties and our heartfelt sympathy goes out to all of those who have been directly impacted. At the same time, I continue to be inspired by our employees around the world, especially our essential workers who have allowed us to continue to deliver important medicines during these unprecedented times. Thanks to their efforts, our plans remain operational, and our supply chain and customer service levels continue unabated. Additionally, we continue to leverage our resources and expertise in the fight against COVID-19 through potential prevention and treatment efforts. 
Now turning to our results. We believe our results from the first half of the year better represent the underlying performance of the business due to the fact that any COVID-19 related gains in Q1 were more than offset by the negative impact of the pandemic in Q2. During the first 6 months of the year, we delivered a solid performance that demonstrates the strong fundamentals of our business and our continued ability to actively and successfully manage through this time. The favorable results for the first 6 months are in line with our expectations. 
We achieved $5.35 billion of total revenues, up 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA of $1.63 billion, up 5% year-over-year. While we experienced a decrease in adjusted SG&A in the first 6 months of the year, partly due to COVID, our proactive business transformation efforts targeted at aligning investments with top line returns, represent a more important example of our ability to focus on not only maintaining our margins for 2020, but also continuing to drive sustainable long-term benefits for the business. 
On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted free cash flow is up 17% over the same period in 2019, and we expect sequential growth in the second part of the year, which speaks to the durable cash flow portfolio of our business. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we're tightening our full year guidance within the ranges of our original expectations for both adjusted EBITDA and total revenue. On adjusted EBITDA, we expect to be able to substantially maintain our original target for the full year, while tightening the range to between $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion. And on revenue, we're tightening our full year range to between $11.5 billion and $12 billion. Our outlook for the rest of the year includes some important data points. 
First, it's clear that overall COVID-19 recovery efforts are occurring slower-than-anticipated and may continue at least through the end of this year. As a result, we expect that our total revenues, which absorbed a 2% net decline in the first half of the year to have an overall similar negative impact of 2% in the second half of the year. 
And on EBITDA, while we are seeing savings in SG&A due to COVID, these are being partially offset by the previously announced delay in the implementation of the restructuring portion of our business transformation initiatives also due to COVID. With all of that said, it's important to note that we do not anticipate significant change to overall demand in our underlying base business. 
Before I turn the call over and on behalf of the management team, I would like to take a minute and thank Ken for his service and partnership over the years. We wish him all the best in his next venture. 
I look forward to partnering closely with Paul Campbell, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer during this interim transition period. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv for further commentary."

I would like to extend a warm welcome to my fellow, Mylan colleagues and future Viatris colleagues joining today's call. As we continue to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of our workforce remains our #1 priority. I would like to echo Heather's remarks and thank our front-line workers who are keeping our operations running. It is because of their efforts that we have been able to maintain supply continuity and strong customer service levels across the globe without any meaningful disruption during the first half of 2020. 
I would also like to thank our sales force who have provided continued support to meet the needs of health care professionals and the patients they serve. We recognize the important role we play in fighting this pandemic and continue to seek opportunities to effectively deploy our resources and expertise. 
For example, during this quarter, we signed a global collaboration agreement with Gilead Sciences to commercialize remdesivir in 127 low and middle income countries. In less than 90 days of signing the agreement, we ramped up our science, production, received regulatory approval in India and started commercially supplying the product in that market, reflecting the strength of our scientific capabilities and global operations. 
We look forward to further expanding access to this critical medicine in other countries. As I walk through our first half financial results, I'll explain the impact of COVID-19 to our performance. 
We delivered $5.4 billion in total revenues in the first half of the year, which is a 3% constant currency growth versus the prior year. The durability and diversity of our portfolio and the strength of our underlying business allowed us to absorb a 2% negative revenue impact as a result of COVID-19. 
For North America, our net sales were $2 billion in the first 6 months, which are up 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We continue to benefit from implementing our business transformation program. In the U.S., this has helped us reshape our largely commodity oral solids portfolio to a more diversified portfolio of complex generics, biosimilar and brand products. 
Our 2 main product drivers this half are Wixela, a generic to Advair and Yupelri, our nebulized once daily LAMA. 
Regarding Wixela, we are excited that we have been able to grow our market share from 20% in the first half of 2019 to 33% in the first half of this year. Also, Yupelri achieved a 92% share of nebulized LAMA market and a 16% share of long-acting nebulized market. 
Overall, COVID-19 had a very minimal net impact in the region. In Europe, our net sales totaled $2 billion in the first half of the year. These results are up 7% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year due to the higher volumes of existing products and new launches. Similar to USA, we are realizing the benefits of applying a highly disciplined financial lens to our European business as a result of business transformation. We have not only rightsized our portfolio by eliminating certain negative contribution margin products but also have focused our investments in selling and marketing. 
As a result of this, we have seen strong growth of our key brands such as Dymista, Brufen, EpiPen and Creon and continued sales growth of folio or biosimilar to Humira. 
These core drivers helped us absorb the negative 3% revenue impact to the European segment due to the COVID-19 as a result of lower demand of certain brand and OTC products. In Rest of the World, our net sales totaled $1.3 billion for the first half of the year, which is a 3% decline on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, while our ARV business performed strongly, COVID-19 had a 3% negative revenue impact, primarily due to slower-than-anticipated recovery in Brazil, Russia, China and some other emerging markets. 
I am excited now to share some key pipeline updates. Our scientists, regulatory experts, the IP legal team, working closely with our development partners have made tremendous strides in advancing key programs. The scientific platform we have built with a diversified across dosage farm, delivery systems and therapeutic areas with a focus on moving up the science spectrum. 
Our global biosimilar franchise is one of our key long-term growth opportunities. Tony will walk you through the commercial progress we have made for the last year in several of our key markets, while I will provide updates on our development programs. 
Before Tony and I provide our respective updates, I would like to acknowledge our strong partnership with the Biocon Biologics to execute on our joint programs. 
Beginning with Semglee, our insulin glargine, we received our FDA approval in June, and we are excited to launch it in the coming weeks and expand access for the millions of Americans living with diabetes, while also reducing the cost burden to the U.S. health care system. 
Additionally, we have submitted to agency all necessary documentation to seek biosimilar interchangeability. Given the complexity in the bringing this type of product to the market, we believe Semglee will have a long revenue stream with a slower ramp up. 
Continuing with our commitment to developing more affordable insulins, we have progressed our insulin aspart program. Our BLA and marketing authorization for a biosimilar to no law is now under review with the FDA and the European health authorities. 
Our BLA for our biosimilar to Avastin is under review with FDA and is expected to be approved by the end of this year. 
Our marketing authorization remains under review with the European health authorities. Our Phase III clinical trial for our biosimilar to EYLEA remain on track to support a BLA filing for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our biosimilar to Enbrel, Nefexo received European marketing authorization in June and is on track to launch in Germany this month, followed by additional European markets by the end of the year. 
Our biosimilar to Humira, Hulio received FDA approval last month, as for our patent license agreement of AbbVie, we'll be able to launch Hulio in U.S. in July 2023. 
Also, we confirmed in June that we are advancing our development program with Revance for a biosimilar to BOTOX. At this stage, we are in the process of scaling up, validating the characterization and performing preclinical work with a goal to start our clinical program, which has been pre-agreed with FDA. 
Our goal is to bring this product to the market by 2025. I will now provide you an update on some other pipeline products, beginning with dimethyl fumarate. 
In parallel with our significant U.S. district code when invalidating BioGen's Tecfidera 514 patent, we have been working closely with FDA to expedite and finalize the review of our ANDA. 
We believe agency is prioritizing their review to complete it before the target action date. We continue to invest in our industry-leading infectious disease portfolio. Very recently, European Commission and DCGI in India granted marketing authorization for [indiscernible] a novel compound developed by nonprofit TB alliance for use in a new regimen for treating highly drug resistant pulmonary tuberculoses. 
Mylan is proud to be at TB alliance global commercialization partner for predominant as a part of this treatment. 
Moving on to our respiratory portfolio. We remain on track to receive tentative approval from FDA for our first-to-file generic Symbicort by end of this year. Our 30 months stay date is March of 21. 
Our glatiramer acetate once-a-month program is progressing well. We announced in June an additional investment in Mapi Pharma to support continued investment on the Phase III clinical study to further strengthen our multiple viruses offering in U.S. since the approval of glatiramer acetate injection, we have been steadily strengthening our development pipeline of complex injectables. 
We currently have indulge under active review at the FDA for generics of Victoza, Invega TRINZA, Invega Sustena, venofer, injectafer and glucagon. We have a rich pipeline of long-acting and complex injectable products in development using multiple technologies such as depot gels, microspheres, liposomes and peptides. In regards to our continued expansion into high-value product opportunities, we remain on track to initiate our Phase II clinical study by end of this year for our MR-107A-01 program, which is being developed as a nonnarcotic oral analgesic for management of moderate to sever pain. 
We also remain on track to progress the development of MR-106A-01, which is a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that is being developed as a topical product for burn-wound treatment. 
Our pipeline also includes a focus on key future growth markets. Like China, we are filing dimesta for approval this quarter and will initiate clinical programs for Yupelri and performance later this year as we continue to explore more opportunities to expand our presence in China. 
Lastly, while Robert will cover certain aspects of the Upjohn transaction, I would like to take a moment to share how excited I am about the progress we have made on the integration plan. 
Over the last year, Mylan and Upjohn teams have been working together, as we prepare for the deal close, we are focused on a quality separation and integration. Everyone's hard work is building a strong foundation for Viatris and setting us up for success on day 1 and beyond. And we look forward to sharing the Viatris story more with analysts and investors over the coming months. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."

First, I want to echo Heather and Rajiv sentiments that we are pleased with the overall performance of our business and are proud of the portfolio we have built that can withstand the short-term impacts we are experiencing in the current environment. Before I get into the -- our commercial performance for the quarter, I want to address our continued efforts to keep our sales force and customers safe and healthy in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have equipped our sales team with virtual tools to allow them to provide the same level of service their customers are used to receiving. 
With these tools, we've been able to provide continued support and service to health care providers, including hosting more than 2,500 webinars and conducting more than 0.5 million video calls. At the same time, our product service levels to customers across the markets remain strong and at the highest rates we've had in many years. We are incredibly grateful to our sales force and commercial teams for their strong performance, flexibility and continued dedication throughout the quarter and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have allowed us to continue setting new standards in health care and advance our mission. We have begun to return some of our field force to face-to-face interactions while adhering to health officials guidelines. And we will continue to monitor market conditions in all regions in which we operate to ensure that we are bringing our sales force back to the field in a way that [indiscernible] was there and our customer safety, while meeting the needs of health care providers and patients around the world. 
Turning to our commercial results for the quarter. Our ability to perform in what has continued to be a dynamic and challenging environment underscores the strength and resilience of our commercial platform. We are very proud of our first half performance, where we've seen positive growth in many of our key markets, including in North America, specifically with growth in 2 of our key respiratory products with Silla which has grown 62% and Yupelri, which has grown more than 600% in the first half of 2020 versus the prior year. 
We also had a positive growth in Europe, which helped offset Rest of World business declines, largely due to more significant impact of COVID-19 in expansion in emerging markets. 
Moving on to a vital part of our long-term strategy. I would now like to take a deep dive into our biosimilars business. We continue to be pleased with the initial growth and pockets of success in our global biosimilars franchise, as we are approaching the $1 billion milestone in expected cumulative sales with 90% of this value coming over the last 2 years. 
We have built one of the largest and most diverse franchises in the industry. Including products across multiple therapeutic categories. As we have stated in the past, the biosimilars franchises won with long-term growth opportunities with more than 100 launches spanning across more than 60 unique markets across the world. As a result, I remain confident in our ability to continue to develop and globally commercialize our biosimilars franchise with the potential of becoming a cornerstone of our business over the long term. We are seeing many positive signs in the markets, which I will expand upon. 
Turning to highlights of our biosimilars business by region. We continue to expand our biosimilars franchise in the U.S. and we're pleased with FDA approval this quarter for Semglee, a biosimilar to Lantus and for Hulio, a biosimilar to Humira. As we have commented before, this is a long-term franchise strategy that will reap the rewards in the years to come. And although we know we have much work to do in these initial phases, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of products like Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin, while market share has more than tripled in the past 3 months to nearly 6%, as well as the renewed growth in Fulphila, a biosimilar to Neulasta. Increasing our share to nearly 16% of the prefilled syringe market in the U.S. 
In addition, Ogivri in Canada has captured 23% of the entire market, and is the #1 ranked biosimilar to trastuzumab in both value and volume. In Europe, we continue to be encouraged by the opportunities that lie ahead in many of the markets. Our Ogivri has double-digit share in 9 markets in the region and is advancing share in the critical markets like France and Sweden. Hulio has also found success in markets like Germany, France and Finland. 
In Germany, we are seeing more than 13% share of the entire market and share of the biosimilars market, exceeding 20% for the first time. 
We have double-digit biosimilar share on Hulio in 10 markets in Europe. We see significant opportunities ahead and are projecting nearly 100% growth in the early stages of the biosimilars business in Europe in 2020 over the prior year. 
For the Rest of World segment, we have seen more than 40% growth year-over-year and now offer biosimilar products in more than 40 countries. We have been very pleased with our performance in markets like Tunisia, Morocco and the Philippines, where we have retained a market leadership position for Hertraz, our biosimilar to Herceptin, as well as in Australia, where we're now the #1 biosimilar to trastuzumab representing 75% of the biosimilars market. 
In closing, as we have mentioned, our biosimilar strategy has been, and continues to be, about developing and executing on this long-term global franchise, focusing on market relevance, and global leadership as it relates to this extremely important area for patient access and payer savings around the world. 
We are beginning to see signs of our hard work and efforts materialize in the market. And are pleased with the early trajectory of our biosimilars business. We remain confident that our experience, scientific capabilities and commercial platform position us to expand this business and be a leader in the biosimilar space. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ken to discuss our financial results in more detail."

As you've seen in our press release this morning, and I've heard throughout this call, our first half 2020 results showcase Mylan's ability to perform in a challenging environment and underscore the resiliency as",1111,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our press release this morning, and I've heard throughout this call, our first half 2020 results showcase Mylan's ability to perform in a challenging environment and underscore the resiliency as well as the durability of the platform we've built over the last decade. Embedded in our strong first half results was a more pronounced impact from COVID in the second quarter. Q2 revenues of $2.7 billion were 4% lower than the prior year and 2% lower on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenues were negatively impacted approximately 5% as a result of the COVID pandemic. 
A portion of this was the reversal of the accelerated buying we saw at the end of the first quarter as customers and patients, primarily in Europe, began to react to the early signs of the ramp in the pandemic. As disclosed in our first quarter conference call, we estimated this accelerated buying to be approximately $50 million or 2% of first quarter sales. As the pandemic continued to take hold globally, we saw second quarter revenues negatively impacted by lower retail pharmacy demand, lower patient hospital visits and a materially lower number of in-person meetings with prescribers and payers, mostly in Europe and the rest of world segments. That said, first half revenues were flat year-over-year and up approximately 3%, excluding the impact of currency exchange. Pricing declines remained relatively consistent at down low to mid-single digits overall and volumes of existing products grew 5%, including the negative impact of COVID. 
New product launch revenues contributed $163 million in the first half of the year, and we expect an additional $450 million of new product launches in the second half. 
Moving to gross margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted gross margins remained strong at 54.3%. That's up 50 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting higher gross profit from sales of existing products in North America, primarily driven by sales of Lexela as well as the contribution of new products. 
This impact was partially offset by lower gross margins on sales of existing products in the Rest of World segment, including China and other expansion markets. From a segment profitability standpoint, North America increased 3% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This increase reflects contributions from new product sales, higher volumes of sales from existing products, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing on existing products driven by changes in the competitive environment, including levothyroxine. Europe segment profitability also expanded up 28% in the quarter, partially driven by favorable product mix. 
Conversely, rest of world segment profitability declined, down 22%, mainly due to the negative impact of COVID-19 and lower pricing on existing products, primarily due to government pricing reductions in Japan. In addition, all segments benefited from lower selling and marketing costs, and both Europe and Rest of World segments profitability results were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. 
Second quarter adjusted R&D was down 4% compared to 2019 due to reprioritization of global programs as well as certain timing impacts in response to the pandemic. 
During the quarter, adjusted SG&A spending declined 11% year-over-year, reflecting lower-than-anticipated selling and marketing investments, lower travel and entertainment activities and lower legal expenses primarily in response to the COVID pandemic, along with the ongoing active management of the business. 
For Q2, we reported adjusted net earnings of $574 million and adjusted EBITDA of $879 million, an increase of 8% and 4%, respectively. For the first 6 months of the year, adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA grew a healthy 9% and 5% on revenues that grew 3% on a constant currency basis. 
Turning to cash flow for the first 3 months ended June 30, 2020, adjusted free cash flow was $522 million, bringing first half adjusted free cash flow to $879 million, that's up 17% and up $129 million over the same period in 2019. 
While we don't presently see any negative liquidity trends related to the pandemic, we do continue to monitor those trends very closely. We expect adjusted free cash flow to increase in the second half of the year in line with seasonally increasing profitability, coupled with ongoing realization of working capital velocity initiatives. 
During the second quarter, we repaid EUR 500 million of scheduled debt maturities and reduced our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to 3.4x, in line with our expectations and well below our covenant requirements. 
We continue to anticipate full year adjusted free cash flow generation, consistent with 2019 levels, which will support achievement of our $1 billion debt repayment target for the full year. 
We expect our cash flow from operations along with our existing borrowing facilities, which provide liquidity up to $2.6 billion will be more than sufficient to meet all possible liquidity needs in the near term. As always, we remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit ratings and to further reducing leverage. 
Finally, as you've heard earlier, we're narrowing our full year 2020 guidance ranges. Revenues are now expected to be in the range of $11.5 to $12 billion, absorbing the ongoing headwinds from the COVID pandemic. And while we're seeing savings in SG&A due to COVID, these savings are being partially offset by the delayed implementation of the restructuring portion of our business transformation plans also due to COVID. 
As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion also tightening that previous range and raising the low end of the range. 
At the midpoint of this range, $3.5 billion, this implies slightly less than $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the second half of the year. And as usual, we expect the fourth quarter to contribute relatively more adjusted EBITDA than the third quarter. We also continue to expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate between 18% and 19% and a full year average diluted share count between 516 million and 520 million shares, consistent with our earlier guidance. 
Before I wrap up my comments, I must take a minute to express my sincere thanks for the honor to have had the opportunity to serve this company, its stakeholders and most importantly, this team for the last 4 years. The unwavering dedication by all 35,000 employees to the company's mission is truly unparalleled. 
While I'm extremely excited for my next opportunity, I will always be watching my Mylan and Viatris colleagues, cheering them on as they continue to reshape the global health care landscape, ensuring access to affordable medications for the world's population. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Robert."

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we sincerely appreciate all your contributions and accomplishments for Mylan and do wish you all the best in the next phase of your career. 
I would like to take a moment to offer my sincere gratitude to all the Mylan employees worldwide and their families for their remarkable resilience and determination as we continue to deliver on our mission of providing patients around the globe with continued access to needed medicines, even though the global COVID-19 pandemic. I also would like to welcome our all of our future Upjohn colleagues listening to this call. I am proud of our management team's leadership and always put in the safety of our colleagues around the world first. 
While focus on safety remains paramount, as you heard from Heather and the management team, what is also truly impressive is Mylan's employees continues and how they can just continue to deliver on the solid performance and especially in the second quarter. While the management team provided an update on the year-to-date, I would now like to turn my attention to where we stand with respect to our pending transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn, and how I continue to see 2021 shaping up directionally with official guidance to follow directly from Viatris' management team following the close. 
As many of you know, we held an extraordinary general meeting on June 30 for shareholders to vote on the Viatris transaction. We are extremely pleased with the overwhelming support we received, which was demonstrated by the fact that 99.6% of the shares voting were in favor of the transaction. With the approval of our shareholders, the only remaining external requirements to close the transaction are a few regulatory approvals, and we are still on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
While we have continued to work towards closing, the Viatris management team recently began the process of meeting virtually with many of our top Mylan shareholders and covering sell-side analysts, as we previously promised. 
During these meetings, Michael, Rajiv and Sanjiv not only demonstrated their cohesive alignment, passion and excitement to lead this great new organization, but they also convey their confidence in being able to deliver significant long-term value to shareholders. 
We expect those conversations to continue as we expand our shareholder engagement activities, including with the Pfizer shareholders, who will become Viatris shareholders through the closing and beyond. 
I will soon be personally reaching out to the Pfizer shareholders to set up their own meeting rates with the future Viatris management team. With that said, I would like to sincerely thank all those who have participated in these meet and greet sessions to date. 
In addition to all the milestones achieved to date as we look forward to closing, I would now like to lay out a number of key next steps of interest to the future of Viatris investment community. 
Step 1, first and foremost, is to close this transaction, which we are on track to do in the fourth quarter. Without speaking for Pfizer, I can certainly tell you that both organizations remain highly focused on bringing this transaction to a successful close. 
Step 2. It is for the Viatris' Board of Directors to then immediately initiate our new business model focused on total shareholder return and a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation program, beginning with the initiation of a meaningful and attractive dividend after the first full quarter following closing, while also rapidly beginning to pay down debt to meet our stated target of 2.5x leverage ratio. 
Step 3. At the end of February or early March, when Viatris reports its fourth quarter earnings, you can expect the new Viatris management team to provide the opening guidance for Viatris' first full year 2021, which I often refer to as the trough year, during a live Investor Day. It is expected that the guidance delivered will take all relevant country-specific headwinds into consideration. For example, and among others, China's VPP, Japan Lyrica LOE and any other potential headwinds that will be known at the time, including any effects as a result of a continuing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Step 4. Viatris' management must demonstrate its ability to deliver consistent and transparent results in a predictable and measurable way. At the same time, while integrating both businesses and achieving our targets of at least $1 billion in synergies over the first 4 years of operations. 
Step 5. We will launch Viatris' new global healthcare gateway, which will be the house of discipline, responsible for all future capital investments to fuel Viatris' future growth. 
With that said, I will try to answer any remaining questions of interest regarding Viatris during the Q&A session. 
But before I conclude, I would like to state that given Viatris' vast global profile, with now 70% of its business outside the United States and diverse global reach as well as our commitment to total shareholder return and corporate social responsibility. We believe that Viatris will be perfectly situated to attract even a broader shareholder base around the world. Therefore, we intend to explore ways to unlock value beyond our current U.S.-centric shareholder base by exploring additional potential listings on other international exchange trading platforms. 
In closing, before turning the call over to the operator, I would like to conclude by underscoring how very excited we are to launch Viatris in its mission to empower people around the world to live healthier at every stage of life. 
As we anticipate this to be our last Mylan's quarterly earnings call. And although Heather will remain with us until we close, I would also like to thank Heather in this forum. 
Heather, on behalf of our Board of Directors and all of our Mylan employees for your exemplary true leadership and lasting contributions that you have made to Mylan, our industry and patients around the world thank you.

And then off to the right, I see the global healthcare gateway, the real engine. We call it the house of discipline because that's where all capital investments will reside. And that's where you will see all excess cash flow and capital being placed to compete. Whether it's the organic R&D, whether it's business development, whether it's collaborations or joint ventures. All of it will be competing in the global healthcare gateway. 
I envision that TheStreet after envision future conference calls with the new management team, I expect to report on the base platform, and I don't really expect that to be very much. We will report the results because we have very experienced management team that will execute, deliver on the numbers, but I do expect a great majority of time being spent with Michael, Rajiv, especially on the global healthcare gateway for each new opportunity that we put inside there. And I really believe that's how you're going to be able to follow the company on a going-forward basis."

I do see a potential upside opportunity just like we were approached on remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine or any other needs that I see arise in the world. And it's not just limited in the United States. I think, Rajiv, you can comment on about how the India government and other governments are approaching us. So I do think that having a global supply chain especially in the healthcare industry, especially in pharmaceuticals, just given the global supplies we need. It's not going to become unwounded, so to speak, there's going to be a big need for, I think, our global platform, and I do see some potential opportunity."

So how should we be thinking about Viatris as a partner of choice on China going forward? And do you think that could partially be because of the deal is not done yet and maybe there is bit of a stand still? 
And secondly, Robert, I know you guys do extensive legal diligence. And one of the key sticking points and pro forma numbers is Lyrica Japan, and there's some element of mixed feedback coming up on the recent Japanese patent office ruling on whether the upheld claims do support exclusivity through 2022 or the claims that were not upheld, do they ensure that generics get in? I'd be very curious on your take on these."

But that doesn't mean, just because you haven't heard any talks doesn't mean that we're not at work. That I could tell you. And the reason why I'm so emphatic about the 100% because the last thing we need right now is for the China Upjohn -- Pfizer Upjohn operation to take its eye off the ball. Because remember, they needed to finish separating Upjohn from Pfizer. And that work is coming along very, very well. They're not actually quite complete. They're almost done. And then I think the other thing that we've been focusing on in China is really what is the new business model going forward. I think the base that we're going to be starting from in China is quite enviable. And quite frankly, let me be clear. I think that we're going to be able to compete. And I'm watching as well. I think it was a very observant comment that you have because I'm watching as well as some of the deals that are getting done with the Chinese nationalist. I think that the Viatris is not going to be considered as a traditional multinational. I think Viatris in China is being viewed as a Chinese nationals entrepreneur as well. So I do think we represent a hybrid. I think we bring the multinational mindset, but I think we bring the entrepreneurial very quick and nimble, boutique, Chinese entrepreneurial style. And I do think it's going to have its advantage. So I'm quite excited about the opportunity in China. And I'll be teaming up, as you know, with Michael doing actually a lot of the work in China and looking forward to reporting on more opportunities that we see as we go forward. 
In terms of Lyrica, I think another very insightful question. And the way you parsed it, I think, is fair. So I'm going to try to be fair in response by telling you that I do think that it's a complicated legal issue. I think it's a complicated breakdown of the construction claims around the patent. And then I think it's also complicated. When you look at the momentum about where Japan has in the MWLH and kind of sort of what they've been thinking about. So I'd rather not -- like any other legal case, not try to handicap it, but what I do think, to be fair to TheStreet, at least from my perspective, what I would say and what I would be strongly recommending management to do, I think it would be wholly irresponsible, in my opinion, and just my opinion, to include the Japan Lyrica numbers in what I would call the trough year in 2021. And I think if we are successful with the Japan Lyrica in Japan, which I'm hopeful and confident. Certainly, I think we've come a long way. We could have had an outright loss. No, we didn't get an outright win. I think that the courts split the decision. And I think it's only going to be a matter of time before we know. But the numbers that you should expect in 2021, what I think investors need to appreciate, unlike the United States, is we will not lose 100% of Lyrica in Japan. What will be included in the numbers is a certain percentage that we know we will hold on to just because of the way that marketplace works. So it's actually a fairly nice base. I wouldn't take all the numbers out. But what we would do, assuming even if we have generic Lyrica as a win, I believe the responsible thing to do would be to separate what is all included in our base and anything excess that we get from Generic Lyrica and Japan or that we get from Lyrica in Japan before it goes Generics. I would ask investors to more look at it almost like how they used to model the 180-day exclusivity here in the United States. It's going to be much more of a cash bonus but I don't think as a going concern, and that, that should be included in our base business and also as part of our base -- as we project pro forma on a going-forward basis. That's what you can expect. I hope that was helpful, Umer."

Let me try to at least walk you through -- let me start with the trough, and then let me walk you through what I envision the cadence to be over the next 3 to 4 years, and what I expect post the fourth year, years 5, 6 and beyond. I think the numbers that we're going to give you are going to fully incorporate all the stand up costs. Therefore, we're going to take the numbers down low enough that will fully absorb all these costs that TSAs, MSAs and any other stand up cost that -- in order to start Viatris on the right foot. When you think about those TSAs and MSAs, you should also note that we have all the incentive in the world to get off of those TSAs and MSAs as we continue to build out our own infrastructure. That is what we're banking on as part of our upside as we see the cadence going forward. David, there's been a lot of questions. When we first announced the deal, people were concerned about whether or not this was a declining business. 
Today, we don't hear anybody discussing about this as a declining business. Everybody wants to talk about how are we going to return back to growth. No one's talking about it's a declining business because we quickly jumped in front as quickly as we could. We're not relying on 2020. We never did. Because we believe that 2021 is going to represent the best first starting point for Viatris as a brand-new company. 
We have all the opportunity in the world to reset these numbers, especially given our current market multiple to make sure that this new Viatris management team is set up for success quarter after quarter after quarter, not just to me but hopefully exceed. And so you should expect that that's the way we're thinking. And so to get the 2021's trough, we'll take a quick look at a couple of years out and ensure that the numbers we start with in 2021, taken all the headwinds that everybody has been discussing out of the baseline business. And even to Umer's question around Japan's Lyrica, you're going to see we're going to set that aside as well because anything that is not sustainable, that doesn't really have a strong tail to it, we don't believe belongs in the base business. Those are temporary and what we want to demonstrate is the durability and the sustainability of this new base platform when we pull this together. And in that base platform, I think it will be a pleasantful surprise. We don't see any 1 meaningful catalyst that will cause the type of volatility that I think that the Mylan investors have experienced, especially in North America. 
So we really have not just diversified, but derisked our entire business model by really taking out all that noise and really addressing all the headwinds that we can envision right upfront. The cadence over the first 3, 4 years, what I think you should expect is this is going to be an EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings growth story. You know, David, earnings growth can come in many ways. 
In the first 3 to 4 years, what we were trying to convey, and I think what management was conveying in its meet and greet with you and some of our shareholders was -- you should -- you can get earnings growth by adding to your top line or you can get earnings growth like we potentially see our ability to drive earnings growth, EBITDA growth, free cash flow growth by launching the pipeline that we already have. And most importantly, garnering the synergies over the first 3 to 4 years. 
When you look at what we have to work with, I think that the Viatris shareholders should expect an extraordinarily stable top line revenue business and the early years with growth in EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings. So you're going to see an earnings growth story right away, because the dividend or the synergies will allow us to do that. In the meantime, you're going to also want to pay attention to what we load up in the global healthcare gateway, and how we're using -- how we're placing our capital investments in years 1, 2, 3 and 4. And as the synergies roll off at the end of year 4, you're going to start to see where the top line growth that we're going to be able to maintain earnings growth and EBITDA growth, free cash flow growth by what we add to that top line. And that's as simple as I can lay it off for you, and that's exactly what management is signing up for. It's exactly the road map that we put in all of our presentations. And I do look forward for the new management team to really give you even more color once they have -- once you have a chance to close, they have a chance to get together and really dive deep into the new combined organization to deliver on exactly what I laid out for you, David."

We have always planned, we've said this many, many times publicly. When we did our deal with Biocon and created something, I think, very, very special, in which we were way behind when we first started in 2009 but not only did we catch up, we went way ahead. What we've planned for always was for more of a global launch in our biologics because back then, we did not see the pathway to a U.S. biologics market. That happened rather quickly, and it happened over the last few years. One of the things that we had and why we're doing so well in other parts ex U.S. is because we've already had the proper infrastructure already in place, we were ready for those markets. 
To be very honest with you, I don't believe we had the right commercial infrastructure as well as I believe we could have had in the United States. I've seen that when a company like Coherus could come in, nobody knows the name Coherus, everybody knows the name of Amgen's sales reps. Coherus is Amgen's sales reps. So when you understand the market in the United States and understand the importance of that well-established relationship between those reps, the hospitals and the -- within that particular franchise in that food chain. I would say, absolutely, that was part because it's not just the cost, it is about some of those relationships. And that's an opportunity for us to improve going forward here in the United States. But I'm hoping now that when people look at our franchise, our global franchise, they'll start to appreciate how well we're doing ex U.S. as well."

But also, I will point out that there's also this bucket now called manufacturing variances. And the reason I called that out is because as we've continued to operate the factory in the COVID situation, that has generated some inefficiencies. So as you asked the question about how far this goes out, we certainly and consistent with what we told you in the first quarter, expect that while the warning letter has been lifted, we have some commitments to the FDA that will take remediation and restructuring to continue through periods of the balance of this year. As the COVID pandemic continues, we will also have manufacturing variances that will continue to occur as long as we're operating in this environment. With that, I'll turn it over to Rajiv."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on what could be Mylan's last earnings call. While we know all good things must come to an end, the team is ready to turn the page and is looking forward to Viatris becoming a reality and a global leader in the health care sector. I'm going to start today by giving a brief overview of our performance to date, COVID impact and updated guidance for the year. Rajiv and Tony will elaborate on the performance of our regions, key products as well as an integration planning update and Ken will review the detailed financial results for Q2 and the first half of the year. 
Lastly, Robert will provide perspective on the progress we continue to make towards becoming Viatris. 
Before we dive into results, I first would like to reiterate that Mylan remains committed to the health and safety of our employees, our patients and the global health care community at large. The COVID pandemic has forced all of us to acknowledge and grapple with difficult uncertainties and our heartfelt sympathy goes out to all of those who have been directly impacted. At the same time, I continue to be inspired by our employees around the world, especially our essential workers who have allowed us to continue to deliver important medicines during these unprecedented times. Thanks to their efforts, our plants remain operational, and our supply chain and customer service levels continue unabated. Additionally, we continue to leverage our resources and expertise in the fight against COVID-19 through potential prevention and treatment efforts. 
Now turning to our results. We believe our results from the first half of the year better represent the underlying performance of the business due to the fact that any COVID-19 related gains in Q1 were more than offset by the negative impact of the pandemic in Q2. During the first 6 months of the year, we delivered a solid performance that demonstrates the strong fundamentals of our business and our continued ability to actively and successfully manage through this time. The favorable results for the first 6 months are in line with our expectations. 
We achieved $5.35 billion of total revenues, up 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA of $1.63 billion, up 5% year-over-year. While we experienced a decrease in adjusted SG&A in the first 6 months of the year, partly due to COVID, our proactive business transformation efforts targeted at aligning investments with top line returns, represent a more important example of our ability to focus on not only maintaining our margins for 2020, but also continuing to drive sustainable long-term benefits for the business. 
On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted free cash flow is up 17% over the same period in 2019, and we expect sequential growth in the second part of the year, which speaks to the durable cash flow portfolio of our business. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we're tightening our full year guidance within the ranges of our original expectations for both adjusted EBITDA and total revenue. On adjusted EBITDA, we expect to be able to substantially maintain our original target for the full year, while tightening the range to between $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion. And on revenue, we're tightening our full year range to between $11.5 billion and $12 billion. Our outlook for the rest of the year includes some important data points. 
First, it's clear that overall COVID-19 recovery efforts are occurring slower-than-anticipated and may continue at least through the end of this year. As a result, we expect that our total revenues, which absorbed a 2% net decline in the first half of the year to have an overall similar negative impact of 2% in the second half of the year. 
And on EBITDA, while we are seeing savings in SG&A due to COVID, these are being partially offset by the previously announced delay in the implementation of the restructuring portion of our business transformation initiatives also due to COVID. With all of that said, it's important to note that we do not anticipate significant change to overall demand in our underlying base business. 
Before I turn the call over and on behalf of the management team, I would like to take a minute and thank Ken for his service and partnership over the years. We wish him all the best in his next venture. 
I look forward to partnering closely with Paul Campbell, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer during this interim transition period. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv for further commentary."

I would like to extend a warm welcome to my fellow, Mylan colleagues and future Viatris colleagues joining today's call. As we continue to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of our workforce remains our #1 priority. I would like to echo Heather's remarks and thank our front-line workers who are keeping our operations running. It is because of their efforts that we have been able to maintain supply continuity and strong customer service levels across the globe without any meaningful disruption during the first half of 2020. 
I would also like to thank our sales force who have provided continued support to meet the needs of health care professionals and the patients they serve. We recognize the important role we play in fighting this pandemic and continue to seek opportunities to effectively deploy our resources and expertise. 
For example, during this quarter, we signed a global collaboration agreement with Gilead Sciences to commercialize remdesivir in 127 low and middle income countries. In less than 90 days of signing the agreement, we ramped up our science, production, received regulatory approval in India and started commercially supplying the product in that market, reflecting the strength of our scientific capabilities and global operations. 
We look forward to further expanding access to this critical medicine in other countries. As I walk through our first half financial results, I'll explain the impact of COVID-19 to our performance. 
We delivered $5.4 billion in total revenues in the first half of the year, which is a 3% constant currency growth versus the prior year. The durability and diversity of our portfolio and the strength of our underlying business allowed us to absorb a 2% negative revenue impact as a result of COVID-19. 
For North America, our net sales were $2 billion in the first 6 months, which are up 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We continue to benefit from implementing our business transformation program. In the U.S., this has helped us reshape our largely commodity oral solids portfolio to a more diversified portfolio of complex generics, biosimilar and brand products. 
Our 2 main product drivers this half are Wixela, a generic to Advair and Yupelri, our nebulize once daily LAMA. 
Regarding Wixela, we are excited that we have been able to grow our market share from 20% in the first half of 2019 to 33% in the first half of this year. Also, Yupelri achieved a 92% share of nebulized LAMA market and a 16% share of long-acting nebulized market. 
Overall, COVID-19 had a very minimal net impact in the region. In Europe, our net sales totaled $2 billion in the first half of the year. These results are up 7% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year due to the higher volumes of existing products and new launches. Similar to USA, we are realizing the benefits of applying a highly disciplined financial lens to our European business as a result of business transformation. We have not only rightsized our portfolio by eliminating certain negative contribution margin products but also have focused our investments in selling and marketing. 
As a result of this, we have seen strong growth of our key brands such as Dymista, Brufen, EpiPen and Creon and continued sales growth of Hulio, our biosimilar to Humira. 
These growth drivers helped us absorb the negative 3% revenue impact to the European segment due to the COVID-19 as a result of lower demand of certain brand and OTC products. In Rest of the World, our net sales totaled $1.3 billion for the first half of the year, which is a 3% decline on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, while our ARV business performed strongly, COVID-19 had a 3% negative revenue impact, primarily due to slower-than-anticipated recovery in Brazil, Russia, China and some other emerging markets. 
I am excited now to share some key pipeline updates. Our scientists, regulatory experts, the IP legal team, working closely with our development partners have made tremendous strides in advancing key programs. The scientific platform we have built is a diversified across dosage form delivery systems and therapeutic areas with a focus on moving up the science spectrum. 
Our global biosimilar franchise is one of our key long-term growth opportunities. Tony will walk you through the commercial progress we have made over the last year in several of our key markets, while I will provide updates on our development programs. 
Before Tony and I provide our respective updates, I would like to acknowledge our strong partnership with the Biocon Biologics to execute on our joint programs. 
Beginning with Semglee, our insulin glargine, we received our FDA approval in June, and we are excited to launch it in the coming weeks and expand access for the millions of Americans living with diabetes, while also reducing the cost burden to the U.S. health care system. 
Additionally, we have submitted to agency all necessary documentation to seek biosimilar interchangeability. Given the complexity in the bringing this type of product to the market, we believe Semglee will have a long revenue stream with a slower ramp up. 
Continuing with our commitment to developing more affordable insulins, we have progressed our insulin aspart program. Our BLA and marketing authorization for a biosimilar to no law is now under review with the FDA and the European health authorities. 
Our BLA for our biosimilar to Avastin is under review with FDA and is expected to be approved by the end of this year. 
Our marketing authorization remains under review with the European health authorities. Our Phase III clinical trial for our biosimilar to EYLEA remain on track to support a BLA filing for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our biosimilar to Enbrel, Nepexto received European marketing authorization in June and is on track to launch in Germany this month, followed by additional European markets by the end of the year. 
Our biosimilar to Humira, Hulio received FDA approval last month. As per our patent license agreement with AbbVie, we’ll be able to launch Hulio in the US in July 2023.
Also, we confirmed in June that we are advancing our development program with Revance for a biosimilar to BOTOX. At this stage, we are in the process of scaling up, validating the characterization and performing preclinical work with a goal to start our clinical program, which has been pre-agreed with FDA. 
Our goal is to bring this product to the market by 2025. I will now provide you an update on some other pipeline products, beginning with dimethyl fumarate. 
In parallel with our significant U.S. District Court in invalidating Biogen's Tecfidera 514 patent, we have been working closely with FDA to expedite and finalize the review of our ANDA. 
We believe agency is prioritizing their review to complete it before the target action date. We continue to invest in our industry-leading infectious disease portfolio. Very recently, European Commission and DCGI in India granted marketing authorization for pretomanid, a novel compound developed by nonprofit TB Alliance for use in a new regimen for treating highly drug resistant form of pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Mylan is proud to be a TB Alliance’s global commercialization partner for pretomanid as a part of this treatment. 
Moving on to our respiratory portfolio. We remain on track to receive tentative approval from FDA for our first-to-file generic Symbicort by end of this year. Our 30 months stay date is March of 21. 
Our glatiramer acetate once-a-month program is progressing well. We announced in June an additional investment in Mapi Pharma to support continued advancement on the Phase III clinical study to further strengthen our multiple sclerosis offering in U.S. Since the approval of glatiramer acetate injection, we have been steadily strengthening our development pipeline of complex injectables. 
We currently have and does under active review at the FDA for generics of Victoza, Invega Trinza, Invega, Sustenna, Venofer, Injectafer and glucagon. We have a rich pipeline of long-acting and complex injectable products in development using multiple technologies such as depot gels, microspheres, liposomes and peptides. In regards to our continued expansion into high-value product opportunities, we remain on track to initiate our Phase II clinical study by end of this year for our MR-107A-01 program, which is being developed as a nonnarcotic oral analgesic for management of moderate to severe pain. 
We also remain on track to progress the development of MR-106A-01, which is a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that is being developed as a topical product for burn wound treatment. Our pipeline also includes a focus on key future growth markets like China. We are filing Dymista for approval this quarter and will initiate clinical programs for Yupelri and Perforomist later this year as we continue to explore more opportunities to expand our presence in China.
Lastly, while Robert will cover certain aspects of the Upjohn transaction, I would like to take a moment to share how excited I am about the progress we have made on the integration plan. 
Over the last year, Mylan and Upjohn teams have been working together, as we prepare for the deal close, with focus on a quality separation and integration. Everyone's hard work is building a strong foundation for Viatris and setting us up for success on day 1 and beyond. And we look forward to sharing the Viatris story more with analysts and investors over the coming months. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."

First, I want to echo Heather and Rajiv sentiments that we are pleased with the overall performance of our business and are proud of the portfolio we have built that can withstand the short-term impacts we are experiencing in the current environment. Before I get into the -- our commercial performance for the quarter, I want to address our continued efforts to keep our sales force and customers safe and healthy in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have equipped our sales team with virtual tools to allow them to provide the same level of service their customers are used to receiving. 
With these tools, we've been able to provide continued support and service to health care providers, including hosting more than 2,500 webinars and conducting more than 0.5 million video calls. At the same time, our product service levels to customers across the markets remain strong and at the highest rates we've had in many years. We are incredibly grateful to our sales force and commercial teams for their strong performance, flexibility and continued dedication throughout the quarter and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have allowed us to continue setting new standards in health care and advance our mission. We have begun to return some of our field force to face-to-face interactions while adhering to health officials guidelines. And we will continue to monitor market conditions in all regions in which we operate to ensure that we are bringing our sales force back to the field in a way that ensures their and our customer safety, while meeting the needs of health care providers and patients around the world. 
Turning to our commercial results for the quarter. Our ability to perform in what has continued to be a dynamic and challenging environment underscores the strength and resilience of our commercial platform. We are very proud of our first half performance, where we've seen positive growth in many of our key markets, including in North America, specifically with growth in 2 of our key respiratory products, Wixela, which has grown 62% and Yupelri, which has grown more than 600% in the first half of 2020 versus the prior year. 
We also had a positive growth in Europe, which helped offset rest-of-world business decline, largely due to more significant impact of COVID-19 in expansion and emerging markets.
Moving on to a vital part of our long-term strategy. I would now like to take a deep dive into our biosimilars business. We continue to be pleased with the initial growth and pockets of success in our global biosimilars franchise, as we are approaching the $1 billion milestone and expected cumulative sales with 90% of this value coming over the last 2 years. 
We have built one of the largest and most diverse franchises in the industry, including products across multiple therapeutic categories. As we have stated in the past, the biosimilars franchise is one with long-term growth opportunities with more than 100 launches spanning across more than 60 unique markets across the world. As a result, I remain confident in our ability to continue to develop and globally commercialize our biosimilars franchise with the potential of becoming a cornerstone of our business over the long term. We are seeing many positive signs in the markets, which I will expand upon. 
Turning to highlights of our biosimilars business by region. We continue to expand our biosimilars franchise in the U.S. and we're pleased to receive FDA approval this quarter for Semglee, a biosimilar to Lantus and for Hulio, a biosimilar to Humira. As we have commented before, this is a long-term franchise strategy that will reap the rewards in the years to come. And although we know we have much work to do in these initial phases, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of products like Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin, where our market share has more than tripled in the past 3 months to nearly 6% as well as the renewed growth in Fulphila, a biosimilar to Neulasta. Increasing our share to nearly 16% of the prefilled syringe market in the U.S. 
In addition, Ogivri in Canada has captured 23% of the entire market, and is the #1 ranked biosimilar to trastuzumab in both value and volume. In Europe, we continue to be encouraged by the opportunities that lie ahead in many of the markets. Our Ogivri has double-digit share in 9 markets in the region and is advancing share in the critical markets like France and Sweden. Hulio has also found success in markets like Germany, France and Finland. 
In Germany, we are seeing more than 13% share of the entire market and share of the biosimilars market, exceeding 20% for the first time. 
We have double-digit biosimilar share on Hulio in 10 markets in Europe. We see significant opportunities ahead and are projecting nearly 100% growth in the early stages of the biosimilars business in Europe in 2020 over the prior year. 
For the Rest of World segment, we have seen more than 40% growth year-over-year and now offer biosimilar products in more than 40 countries. We have been very pleased with our performance in markets like Tunisia, Morocco and the Philippines, where we have retained a market leadership position for Hertraz, our biosimilar to Herceptin as well as in Australia, where we're now the #1 biosimilar to trastuzumab representing 75% of the biosimilars market. 
In closing, as we have mentioned, our biosimilar strategy has been, and continues to be, about developing and executing on this long-term global franchise, focusing on market relevance, and global leadership as it relates to this extremely important area for patient access and payer savings around the world. 
We are beginning to see signs of our hard work and efforts materialize in the market. And are pleased with the early trajectory of our biosimilars business. We remain confident that our experience, scientific capabilities and commercial platform position us to expand this business and be a leader in the biosimilar space. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ken to discuss our financial results in more detail."
290203,678008919,2097405,"Mylan, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our press release this morning, and I've heard throughout this call, our first half 2020 results showcase Mylan's ability to perform in a challenging environment and underscore the resiliency as",1112,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our press release this morning, and I've heard throughout this call, our first half 2020 results showcase Mylan's ability to perform in a challenging environment and underscore the resiliency as well as the durability of the platform we've built over the last decade. Embedded in our strong first half results was a more pronounced impact from COVID in the second quarter. Q2 revenues of $2.7 billion were 4% lower than the prior year and 2% lower on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenues were negatively impacted approximately 5% as a result of the COVID pandemic. 
A portion of this was the reversal of the accelerated buying we saw at the end of the first quarter as customers and patients, primarily in Europe, began to react to the early signs of the ramp in the pandemic. As disclosed in our first quarter conference call, we estimated this accelerated buying to be approximately $50 million or 2% of first quarter sales. As the pandemic continued to take hold globally, we saw second quarter revenues negatively impacted by lower retail pharmacy demand, lower patient hospital visits and a materially lower number of in-person meetings with prescribers and payers, mostly in Europe and the rest of world segments. That said, first half revenues were flat year-over-year and up approximately 3%, excluding the impact of currency exchange. Pricing declines remained relatively consistent at down low to mid-single digits overall, and volumes of existing products grew 5%, including the negative impact of COVID. 
New product launch revenues contributed $163 million in the first half of the year, and we expect an additional $450 million of new product launches in the second half. 
Moving to gross margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted gross margins remained strong at 54.3%. That's up 50 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting higher gross profit from sales of existing products in North America, primarily driven by sales of Wixela as well as the contribution of new products. 
This impact was partially offset by lower gross margins on sales of existing products in the Rest of World segment, including China and other expansion markets. From a segment profitability standpoint, North America increased 3% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This increase reflects contributions from new product sales, higher volumes of sales from existing products, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing on existing products driven by changes in the competitive environment, including levothyroxine. Europe segment profitability also expanded, up 28% in the quarter, partially driven by favorable product mix.
Conversely, rest of world segment profitability declined, down 22%, mainly due to the negative impact of COVID-19 and lower pricing on existing products, primarily due to government pricing reductions in Japan. In addition, all segments benefited from lower selling and marketing costs, and both Europe and Rest of World segments profitability results were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. 
Second quarter adjusted R&D was down 4% compared to 2019 due to reprioritization of global programs as well as certain timing impacts in response to the pandemic. 
During the quarter, adjusted SG&A spending declined 11% year-over-year, reflecting lower-than-anticipated selling and marketing investments, lower travel and entertainment activities and lower legal expenses primarily in response to the COVID pandemic, along with the ongoing active management of the business. 
For Q2, we reported adjusted net earnings of $574 million and adjusted EBITDA of $879 million, an increase of 8% and 4%, respectively. For the first 6 months of the year, adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA grew a healthy 9% and 5% on revenues that grew 3% on a constant currency basis. 
Turning to cash flow for the first 3 months ended June 30, 2020, adjusted free cash flow was $522 million, bringing first half adjusted free cash flow to $879 million, that's up 17% and up $129 million over the same period in 2019. 
While we don't presently see any negative liquidity trends related to the pandemic, we do continue to monitor those trends very closely. We expect adjusted free cash flow to increase in the second half of the year in line with seasonally increasing profitability, coupled with ongoing realization of working capital velocity initiatives. 
During the second quarter, we repaid EUR 500 million of scheduled debt maturities and reduced our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to 3.4x, in line with our expectations and well below our covenant requirements. 
We continue to anticipate full year adjusted free cash flow generation, consistent with 2019 levels, which will support achievement of our $1 billion debt repayment target for the full year. 
We expect our cash flow from operations along with our existing borrowing facilities, which provide liquidity up to $2.6 billion will be more than sufficient to meet all possible liquidity needs in the near term. As always, we remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit ratings and to further reducing leverage. 
Finally, as you've heard earlier, we're narrowing our full year 2020 guidance ranges. Revenues are now expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, absorbing the ongoing headwinds from the COVID pandemic. And while we're seeing savings in SG&A due to COVID, these savings are being partially offset by the delayed implementation of the restructuring portion of our business transformation plans also due to COVID. 
As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion also tightening that previous range and raising the low end of the range. 
At the midpoint of this range, $3.5 billion, this implies slightly less than $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the second half of the year. And as usual, we expect the fourth quarter to contribute relatively more adjusted EBITDA than the third quarter. We also continue to expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate between 18% and 19% and a full year average diluted share count between 516 million and 520 million shares, consistent with our earlier guidance. 
Before I wrap up my comments, I must take a minute to express my sincere thanks for the honor to have had the opportunity to serve this company, its stakeholders and most importantly, this team for the last 4 years. The unwavering dedication by all 35,000 employees to the company's mission is truly unparalleled. 
While I'm extremely excited for my next opportunity, I will always be watching my Mylan and Viatris colleagues, cheering them on as they continue to reshape the global health care landscape, ensuring access to affordable medications for the world's population. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Robert."
290203,678008919,2097405,"Mylan, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good morning.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we sincerely appreciate all your contributions and accomplishments for Mylan and do wish you all the best in the next phase of your career. 
I would like to take a moment to offer my sincere gratitude to all the Mylan employees worldwide and their families for their remarkable resilience and determination as we continue to deliver on our mission of providing patients around the globe with continued access to needed medicines, even though the global COVID-19 pandemic. I also would like to welcome all of our future Upjohn colleagues listening to this call. I am proud of our management team’s leadership in always putting the safety of our colleagues around the world first. 
While focus on safety remains paramount, as you heard from Heather and the management team, what is also truly impressive is Mylan's employees continues and how they can just continue to deliver on the solid performance and especially in the second quarter. While the management team provided an update on the year-to-date, I would now like to turn my attention to where we stand with respect to our pending transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn, and how I continue to see 2021 shaping up directionally with official guidance to follow directly from Viatris' management team following the close. 
As many of you know, we held an extraordinary general meeting on June 30 for shareholders to vote on the Viatris transaction. We are extremely pleased with the overwhelming support we received, which was demonstrated by the fact that 99.6% of the shares voting were in favor of the transaction. With the approval of our shareholders, the only remaining external requirements to close the transaction are a few regulatory approvals, and we are still on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
While we have continued to work towards closing, the Viatris management team recently began the process of meeting virtually with many of our top Mylan shareholders and covering sell-side analysts, as we previously promised. 
During these meetings, Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev not only demonstrated their cohesive alignment, passion and excitement to lead this great new organization, but they also convey their confidence in being able to deliver significant long-term value to shareholders. 
We expect those conversations to continue as we expand our shareholder engagement activities, including with the Pfizer shareholders, who will become Viatris shareholders through the closing and beyond. 
I will soon be personally reaching out to the Pfizer shareholders to set up their own meet-and-greets with the future Viatris management team. With that said, I would like to sincerely thank all those who have participated in these meet and greet sessions to date. 
In addition to all the milestones achieved to date as we look forward to closing, I would now like to lay out a number of key next steps of interest to the future Viatris investment community. 
Step 1, first and foremost, is to close this transaction, which we are on track to do in the fourth quarter. Without speaking for Pfizer, I can certainly tell you that both organizations remain highly focused on bringing this transaction to a successful close. 
Step 2. It is for the Viatris' Board of Directors to then immediately initiate our new business model focused on total shareholder return and a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation program, beginning with the initiation of a meaningful and attractive dividend after the first full quarter following closing, while also rapidly beginning to pay down debt to meet our stated target of 2.5x leverage ratio. 
Step 3. At the end of February or early March, when Viatris reports its fourth quarter earnings, you can expect the new Viatris management team to provide the opening guidance for Viatris' first full year 2021, which I often refer to as the trough year, during a live Investor Day. It is expected that the guidance delivered will take all relevant country-specific headwinds into consideration. For example, and among others, China's VPP, Japan Lyrica LOE and any other potential headwinds that will be known at the time, including any effects as a result of a continuing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Step 4. Viatris' management must demonstrate its ability to deliver consistent and transparent results in a predictable and measurable way. At the same time, while integrating both businesses and achieving our targets of at least $1 billion in synergies over the first 4 years of operations. 
Step 5. We will launch Viatris' new global healthcare gateway, which will be the house of discipline, responsible for all future capital investments to fuel Viatris' future growth. 
With that said, I will try to answer any remaining questions of interest regarding Viatris during the Q&A session. 
But before I conclude, I would like to state that given Viatris' vast global profile, with now 70% of its business outside the United States and diverse global reach as well as our commitment to total shareholder return and corporate social responsibility. We believe that Viatris will be perfectly situated to attract even a broader shareholder base around the world. Therefore, we intend to explore ways to unlock value beyond our current U.S.-centric shareholder base by exploring additional potential listings on other international exchange trading platforms. 
In closing, before turning the call over to the operator, I would like to conclude by underscoring how very excited we are to launch Viatris in its mission to empower people around the world to live healthier at every stage of life. 
As we anticipate this to be our last Mylan's quarterly earnings call. And although Heather will remain with us until we close, I would also like to thank Heather in this forum. 
Heather, on behalf of our Board of Directors and all of our Mylan employees for your exemplary true leadership and lasting contributions that you have made to Mylan, our industry and patients around the world thank you. [Operator Instructions]

But equally, because of what we created, business development and attracting partners around the globe, all of that will reside in the global healthcare gateway. I simply see the future of Viatris being represented on really 2 platforms. One, it will be the 2 60-plus year old companies coming together and really executing on what that base business is. And then off to the right, I see the global healthcare gateway, the real engine. We call it the House of Discipline because that's where all capital investments will reside. And that's where you will see all excess cash flow and capital being placed to compete. Whether it's the organic R&D, whether it's business development, whether it's collaborations or joint ventures. All of it will be competing in the global healthcare gateway. 
I envision that The Street after envision future conference calls with the new management team, I expect to report on the base platform, and I don't really expect that to be very much. We will report the results because we have very experienced management team that will execute, deliver on the numbers, but I do expect a great majority of time being spent with Michael, Rajiv, especially on the global healthcare gateway for each new opportunity that we put inside there.

I do see a potential upside opportunity just like we were approached on remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine or any other needs that I see arise in the world. And it's not just limited in the United States. I think, Rajiv, you can comment on about how the India government and other governments are approaching us. So I do think that having a global supply chain especially in the healthcare industry, especially in pharmaceuticals, just given the global supplies we need. It's not going to become unwounded, so to speak, there's going to be a big need for, I think, our global platform, and I do see some potential opportunity."

First, as we think about many of the licensing deals that are happening in China recently, I've tried to aggregate them and look at -- look through them. And the one thing that stands out is Upjohn has not been landing any -- and all of them are going to Chinese players. 
So how should we be thinking about Viatris as a partner-of-choice in China going forward and do you think that could partially be because the deals are not done yet and maybe there is a bit of a standstill?
And secondly, Robert, I know you guys do extensive legal diligence. And one of the key sticking points and pro forma numbers is Lyrica Japan, and there's some element of mixed feedback coming up on the recent Japanese patent office ruling on whether the upheld claims do support exclusivity through 2022 or the claims that were not upheld, do they ensure that generics get in? I'd be very curious on your take on these."

But that doesn't mean, just because you haven't heard any talks doesn't mean that we're not at work. That I could tell you. And the reason why I'm so emphatic about the 100% because the last thing we need right now is for the China Upjohn -- Pfizer Upjohn operation to take its eye off the ball. Because remember, they needed to finish separating Upjohn from Pfizer. And that work is coming along very, very well. They're not actually quite complete. They're almost done. And then I think the other thing that we've been focusing on in China is really what is the new business model going forward. I think the base that we're going to be starting from in China is quite enviable. And quite frankly, let me be clear. I think that we're going to be able to compete. And I'm watching as well. I think it was a very observant comment that you have because I'm watching as well as some of the deals that are getting done with the Chinese nationalist. I think that the Viatris is not going to be considered as a traditional multinational. I think Viatris in China is being viewed as a Chinese nationals entrepreneur as well. So I do think we represent a hybrid. I think we bring the multinational mindset, but I think we bring the entrepreneurial very quick and nimble, boutique, Chinese entrepreneurial style. And I do think it's going to have its advantage. So I'm quite excited about the opportunity in China. And I'll be teaming up, as you know, with Michael doing actually a lot of the work in China and looking forward to reporting on more opportunities that we see as we go forward. 
In terms of Lyrica, I think another very insightful question. And the way you parsed it, I think, is fair. So I'm going to try to be fair in response by telling you that I do think that it's a complicated legal issue. I think it's a complicated breakdown of the construction claims around the patent. And then I think it's also complicated. When you look at the momentum about where Japan has in the MWLH and kind of sort of what they've been thinking about. So I'd rather not -- like any other legal case, not try to handicap it, but what I do think, to be fair to The Street, at least from my perspective, what I would say and what I would be strongly recommending management to do, I think it would be wholly irresponsible, in my opinion, and just my opinion, to include the Japan Lyrica numbers in what I would call the trough year in 2021. And I think if we are successful with the Japan Lyrica in Japan, which I'm hopeful and confident. 
Certainly, I think we've come a long way. We could have had an outright loss. No, we didn't get an outright win. I think that the courts split the decision. And I think it's only going to be a matter of time before we know. But the numbers that you should expect in 2021, what I think investors need to appreciate, unlike the United States, is we will not lose 100% of Lyrica in Japan. What will be included in the numbers is a certain percentage that we know we will hold on to just because of the way that marketplace works. So it's actually a fairly nice base. I wouldn't take all the numbers out. But what we would do, assuming even if we have generic Lyrica as a win, I believe the responsible thing to do would be to separate what is all included in our base and anything excess that we get from generic Lyrica and Japan or that we get from Lyrica in Japan before it goes generics. I would ask investors to more look at it almost like how they used to model the 180-day exclusivity here in the United States. It's going to be much more of a cash bonus but I don't think as a going concern, and that, that should be included in our base business and also as part of our base -- as we project pro forma on a going-forward basis. That's what you can expect. I hope that was helpful, Umer."

Let me try to at least walk you through -- let me start with the trough, and then let me walk you through what I envision the cadence to be over the next 3 to 4 years, and what I expect post the fourth year, years 5, 6 and beyond. I think the numbers that we're going to give you are going to fully incorporate all the stand up costs. Therefore, we're going to take the numbers down low enough that will fully absorb all these costs that TSAs, MSAs and any other stand up cost that -- in order to start Viatris on the right foot. When you think about those TSAs and MSAs, you should also note that we have all the incentive in the world to get off of those TSAs and MSAs as we continue to build out our own infrastructure. That is what we're banking on as part of our upside as we see the cadence rolling forward. David, there's been a lot of questions. When we first announced the deal, people were concerned about whether or not this was a declining business. 
Today, we don't hear anybody discussing about this as a declining business. Everybody wants to talk about how are we going to return back to growth. No one's talking about it's a declining business because we quickly jumped in front as quickly as we could. We're not relying on 2020. We never did. Because we believe that 2021 is going to represent the best first starting point for Viatris as a brand-new company. 
We have all the opportunity in the world to reset these numbers, especially given our current market multiple to make sure that this new Viatris management team is set up for success quarter after quarter after quarter, not just to me but hopefully exceed. And so you should expect that that's the way we're thinking. And so to get the 2021's trough, we'll take a quick look at a couple of years out and ensure that the numbers we start with in 2021, taken all the headwinds that everybody has been discussing out of the baseline business. And even to Umer's question around Japan's Lyrica, you're going to see we're going to set that aside as well because anything that is not sustainable, that doesn't really have a strong tail to it, we don't believe belongs in the base business. Those are temporary and what we want to demonstrate is the durability and the sustainability of this new base platform when we pull this together. And in that base platform, I think it will be a pleasantful surprise. We don't see any one meaningful catalyst that will cause the type of volatility that I think that the Mylan investors have experienced, especially in North America. 
So we really have not just diversified, but derisked our entire business model by really taking out all that noise and really addressing all the headwinds that we can envision right upfront. The cadence over the first 3, 4 years, what I think you should expect is this is going to be an EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings growth story. You know, David, earnings growth can come in many ways. 
In the first 3 to 4 years, what we were trying to convey, and I think what management was conveying in its meet and greet with you and some of our shareholders was -- you should -- you can get earnings growth by adding to your top line or you can get earnings growth like we potentially see our ability to drive earnings growth, EBITDA growth, free cash flow growth by launching the pipeline that we already have. And most importantly, garnering the synergies over the first 3 to 4 years. 
When you look at what we have to work with, I think that the Viatris shareholders should expect an extraordinarily stable top line revenue business and the early years with growth in EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings. So you're going to see an earnings growth story right away, because the dividend or the synergies will allow us to do that. In the meantime, you're going to also want to pay attention to what we load up in the global healthcare gateway, and how we're using -- how we're placing our capital investments in years 1, 2, 3 and 4. And as the synergies roll off at the end of year 4, you're going to start to see where the top line growth that we're going to be able to maintain earnings growth and EBITDA growth, free cash flow growth by what we add to that top line. And that's as simple as I can lay it off for you, and that's exactly what management is signing up for. It's exactly the road map that we put in all of our presentations. And I do look forward for the new management team to really give you even more color once they have -- once you have a chance to close, they have a chance to get together and really dive deep into the new combined organization to deliver on exactly what I laid out for you, David."

We have always planned, we've said this many, many times publicly. When we did our deal with Biocon and created something, I think, very, very special, in which we were way behind when we first started in 2009 but not only did we catch up, we went way ahead. What we've planned for always was for more of a global launch in our biologics because back then, we did not see the pathway to a U.S. biologics market. That happened rather quickly, and it happened over the last few years. One of the things that we had and why we're doing so well in other parts ex U.S. is because we've already had the proper infrastructure already in place, we were ready for those markets.
To be very honest with you, I don't believe we had the right commercial infrastructure as well as I believe we could have had in the United States. I've seen that when a company like Coherus could come in, nobody knows the name Coherus. Everybody knows the name of Amgen's sales reps. Coherus is Amgen's sales reps. So when you understand the market in the United States and understand the importance of that well-established relationship between those reps, the hospitals and the -- within that particular franchise in that food chain. I would say, absolutely, that was part because it's not just the cost, it is about some of those relationships. And that's an opportunity for us to improve going forward here in the United States. But I'm hoping now that when people look at our franchise, our global franchise, they'll start to appreciate how well we're doing ex U.S. as well."

But also, I will point out that there's also this bucket now called manufacturing variances. And the reason I called that out is because as we've continued to operate the factory in the COVID situation, that has generated some inefficiencies. So as you asked the question about how far this goes out, we certainly and consistent with what we told you in the first quarter, expect that while the warning letter has been lifted, we have some commitments to the FDA that will take remediation and restructuring to continue through periods of the balance of this year. As the COVID pandemic continues, we will also have manufacturing variances that will continue to occur as long as we're operating in this environment. With that, I'll turn it over to Rajiv."

So that's why we are carrying the cost for the time being over here. 
Now as we go into the Viatris, I'm pretty sure we have already stated that we will be moving to the GAAP cash flow and not adjusted cash flow.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on what could be Mylan's last earnings call. While we know all good things must come to an end, the team is ready to turn the page and is looking forward to Viatris becoming a reality and a global leader in the health care sector. I'm going to start today by giving a brief overview of our performance to date, COVID impact and updated guidance for the year. Rajiv and Tony will elaborate on the performance of our regions, key products as well as an integration planning update and Ken will review the detailed financial results for Q2 and the first half of the year. 
Lastly, Robert will provide perspective on the progress we continue to make towards becoming Viatris. 
Before we dive into results, I first would like to reiterate that Mylan remains committed to the health and safety of our employees, our patients and the global health care community at large. The COVID pandemic has forced all of us to acknowledge and grapple with difficult uncertainties and our heartfelt sympathy goes out to all of those who have been directly impacted. At the same time, I continue to be inspired by our employees around the world, especially our essential workers who have allowed us to continue to deliver important medicines during these unprecedented times. Thanks to their efforts, our plants remain operational, and our supply chain and customer service levels continue unabated. Additionally, we continue to leverage our resources and expertise in the fight against COVID-19 through potential prevention and treatment efforts. 
Now turning to our results. We believe our results from the first half of the year better represent the underlying performance of the business due to the fact that any COVID-19 related gains in Q1 were more than offset by the negative impact of the pandemic in Q2. During the first 6 months of the year, we delivered a solid performance that demonstrates the strong fundamentals of our business and our continued ability to actively and successfully manage through this time. The favorable results for the first 6 months are in line with our expectations. 
We achieved $5.35 billion of total revenues, up 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA of $1.63 billion, up 5% year-over-year. While we experienced a decrease in adjusted SG&A in the first 6 months of the year, partly due to COVID, our proactive business transformation efforts targeted at aligning investments with top line returns, represent a more important example of our ability to focus on not only maintaining our margins for 2020, but also continuing to drive sustainable long-term benefits for the business. 
On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted free cash flow is up 17% over the same period in 2019, and we expect sequential growth in the second part of the year, which speaks to the durable cash flow portfolio of our business. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we're tightening our full year guidance within the ranges of our original expectations for both adjusted EBITDA and total revenue. On adjusted EBITDA, we expect to be able to substantially maintain our original target for the full year, while tightening the range to between $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion. And on revenue, we're tightening our full year range to between $11.5 billion and $12 billion. Our outlook for the rest of the year includes some important data points. 
First, it's clear that overall COVID-19 recovery efforts are occurring slower-than-anticipated and may continue at least through the end of this year. As a result, we expect that our total revenues, which absorbed a 2% net decline in the first half of the year to have an overall similar negative impact of 2% in the second half of the year. 
And on EBITDA, while we are seeing savings in SG&A due to COVID, these are being partially offset by the previously announced delay in the implementation of the restructuring portion of our business transformation initiatives also due to COVID. With all of that said, it's important to note that we do not anticipate significant change to overall demand in our underlying base business. 
Before I turn the call over and on behalf of the management team, I would like to take a minute and thank Ken for his service and partnership over the years. We wish him all the best in his next venture. 
I look forward to partnering closely with Paul Campbell, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer during this interim transition period. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv for further commentary."

I would like to extend a warm welcome to my fellow, Mylan colleagues and future Viatris colleagues joining today's call. As we continue to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of our workforce remains our #1 priority. I would like to echo Heather's remarks and thank our front-line workers who are keeping our operations running. It is because of their efforts that we have been able to maintain supply continuity and strong customer service levels across the globe without any meaningful disruption during the first half of 2020. 
I would also like to thank our sales force who have provided continued support to meet the needs of health care professionals and the patients they serve. We recognize the important role we play in fighting this pandemic and continue to seek opportunities to effectively deploy our resources and expertise. 
For example, during this quarter, we signed a global collaboration agreement with Gilead Sciences to commercialize remdesivir in 127 low and middle income countries. In less than 90 days of signing the agreement, we ramped up our science, production, received regulatory approval in India and started commercially supplying the product in that market, reflecting the strength of our scientific capabilities and global operations. 
We look forward to further expanding access to this critical medicine in other countries. As I walk through our first half financial results, I'll explain the impact of COVID-19 to our performance. 
We delivered $5.4 billion in total revenues in the first half of the year, which is a 3% constant currency growth versus the prior year. The durability and diversity of our portfolio and the strength of our underlying business allowed us to absorb a 2% negative revenue impact as a result of COVID-19. 
For North America, our net sales were $2 billion in the first 6 months, which are up 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We continue to benefit from implementing our business transformation program. In the U.S., this has helped us reshape our largely commodity oral solids portfolio to a more diversified portfolio of complex generics, biosimilar and brand products. 
Our 2 main product drivers this half are Wixela, a generic to Advair and Yupelri, our nebulize once daily LAMA. 
Regarding Wixela, we are excited that we have been able to grow our market share from 20% in the first half of 2019 to 33% in the first half of this year. Also, Yupelri achieved a 92% share of nebulized LAMA market and a 16% share of long-acting nebulized market. 
Overall, COVID-19 had a very minimal net impact in the region. In Europe, our net sales totaled $2 billion in the first half of the year. These results are up 7% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year due to the higher volumes of existing products and new launches. Similar to USA, we are realizing the benefits of applying a highly disciplined financial lens to our European business as a result of business transformation. We have not only rightsized our portfolio by eliminating certain negative contribution margin products but also have focused our investments in selling and marketing. 
As a result of this, we have seen strong growth of our key brands such as Dymista, Brufen, EpiPen and Creon and continued sales growth of Hulio, our biosimilar to Humira. 
These growth drivers helped us absorb the negative 3% revenue impact to the European segment due to the COVID-19 as a result of lower demand of certain brand and OTC products. In Rest of the World, our net sales totaled $1.3 billion for the first half of the year, which is a 3% decline on a constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, while our ARV business performed strongly, COVID-19 had a 3% negative revenue impact, primarily due to slower-than-anticipated recovery in Brazil, Russia, China and some other emerging markets. 
I am excited now to share some key pipeline updates. Our scientists, regulatory experts, the IP legal team, working closely with our development partners have made tremendous strides in advancing key programs. The scientific platform we have built is a diversified across dosage form delivery systems and therapeutic areas with a focus on moving up the science spectrum. 
Our global biosimilar franchise is one of our key long-term growth opportunities. Tony will walk you through the commercial progress we have made over the last year in several of our key markets, while I will provide updates on our development programs. 
Before Tony and I provide our respective updates, I would like to acknowledge our strong partnership with the Biocon Biologics to execute on our joint programs. 
Beginning with Semglee, our insulin glargine, we received our FDA approval in June, and we are excited to launch it in the coming weeks and expand access for the millions of Americans living with diabetes, while also reducing the cost burden to the U.S. health care system. 
Additionally, we have submitted to agency all necessary documentation to seek biosimilar interchangeability. Given the complexity in the bringing this type of product to the market, we believe Semglee will have a long revenue stream with a slower ramp up. 
Continuing with our commitment to developing more affordable insulins, we have progressed our insulin aspart program. Our BLA and marketing authorization for a biosimilar to no law is now under review with the FDA and the European health authorities. 
Our BLA for our biosimilar to Avastin is under review with FDA and is expected to be approved by the end of this year. 
Our marketing authorization remains under review with the European health authorities. Our Phase III clinical trial for our biosimilar to EYLEA remain on track to support a BLA filing for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our biosimilar to Enbrel, Nepexto received European marketing authorization in June and is on track to launch in Germany this month, followed by additional European markets by the end of the year. 
Our biosimilar to Humira, Hulio received FDA approval last month. As per our patent license agreement with AbbVie, we’ll be able to launch Hulio in the US in July 2023.
Also, we confirmed in June that we are advancing our development program with Revance for a biosimilar to BOTOX. At this stage, we are in the process of scaling up, validating the characterization and performing preclinical work with a goal to start our clinical program, which has been pre-agreed with FDA. 
Our goal is to bring this product to the market by 2025. I will now provide you an update on some other pipeline products, beginning with dimethyl fumarate. 
In parallel with our significant U.S. District Court in invalidating Biogen's Tecfidera 514 patent, we have been working closely with FDA to expedite and finalize the review of our ANDA. 
We believe agency is prioritizing their review to complete it before the target action date. We continue to invest in our industry-leading infectious disease portfolio. Very recently, European Commission and DCGI in India granted marketing authorization for pretomanid, a novel compound developed by nonprofit TB Alliance for use in a new regimen for treating highly drug resistant form of pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Mylan is proud to be a TB Alliance’s global commercialization partner for pretomanid as a part of this treatment. 
Moving on to our respiratory portfolio. We remain on track to receive tentative approval from FDA for our first-to-file generic Symbicort by end of this year. Our 30 months stay date is March of 21. 
Our glatiramer acetate once-a-month program is progressing well. We announced in June an additional investment in Mapi Pharma to support continued advancement on the Phase III clinical study to further strengthen our multiple sclerosis offering in U.S. Since the approval of glatiramer acetate injection, we have been steadily strengthening our development pipeline of complex injectables. 
We currently have and does under active review at the FDA for generics of Victoza, Invega Trinza, Invega, Sustenna, Venofer, Injectafer and glucagon. We have a rich pipeline of long-acting and complex injectable products in development using multiple technologies such as depot gels, microspheres, liposomes and peptides. In regards to our continued expansion into high-value product opportunities, we remain on track to initiate our Phase II clinical study by end of this year for our MR-107A-01 program, which is being developed as a nonnarcotic oral analgesic for management of moderate to severe pain. 
We also remain on track to progress the development of MR-106A-01, which is a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide that is being developed as a topical product for burn wound treatment. Our pipeline also includes a focus on key future growth markets like China. We are filing Dymista for approval this quarter and will initiate clinical programs for Yupelri and Perforomist later this year as we continue to explore more opportunities to expand our presence in China.
Lastly, while Robert will cover certain aspects of the Upjohn transaction, I would like to take a moment to share how excited I am about the progress we have made on the integration plan. 
Over the last year, Mylan and Upjohn teams have been working together, as we prepare for the deal close, with focus on a quality separation and integration. Everyone's hard work is building a strong foundation for Viatris and setting us up for success on day 1 and beyond. And we look forward to sharing the Viatris story more with analysts and investors over the coming months. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tony."

At the same time, our product service levels to customers across the markets remain strong and at the highest rates we've had in many years.

We have begun to return some of our field force to face-to-face interactions while adhering to health officials guidelines. And we will continue to monitor market conditions in all regions in which we operate to ensure that we are bringing our sales force back to the field in a way that ensures their and our customer safety, while meeting the needs of health care providers and patients around the world. 
Turning to our commercial results for the quarter. Our ability to perform in what has continued to be a dynamic and challenging environment underscores the strength and resilience of our commercial platform. We are very proud of our first half performance, where we've seen positive growth in many of our key markets, including in North America, specifically with growth in 2 of our key respiratory products, Wixela, which has grown 62% and Yupelri, which has grown more than 600% in the first half of 2020 versus the prior year. 
We also had a positive growth in Europe, which helped offset rest-of-world business decline, largely due to more significant impact of COVID-19 in expansion and emerging markets.
Moving on to a vital part of our long-term strategy. I would now like to take a deep dive into our biosimilars business. We continue to be pleased with the initial growth and pockets of success in our global biosimilars franchise, as we are approaching the $1 billion milestone and expected cumulative sales with 90% of this value coming over the last 2 years. 
We have built one of the largest and most diverse franchises in the industry, including products across multiple therapeutic categories. As we have stated in the past, the biosimilars franchise is one with long-term growth opportunities with more than 100 launches spanning across more than 60 unique markets across the world. As a result, I remain confident in our ability to continue to develop and globally commercialize our biosimilars franchise with the potential of becoming a cornerstone of our business over the long term. We are seeing many positive signs in the markets, which I will expand upon. 
Turning to highlights of our biosimilars business by region. We continue to expand our biosimilars franchise in the U.S. and we're pleased to receive FDA approval this quarter for Semglee, a biosimilar to Lantus and for Hulio, a biosimilar to Humira. As we have commented before, this is a long-term franchise strategy that will reap the rewards in the years to come. And although we know we have much work to do in these initial phases, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of products like Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin, where our market share has more than tripled in the past 3 months to nearly 6% as well as the renewed growth in Fulphila, a biosimilar to Neulasta. Increasing our share to nearly 16% of the prefilled syringe market in the U.S. 
In addition, Ogivri in Canada has captured 23% of the entire market, and is the #1 ranked biosimilar to trastuzumab in both value and volume. In Europe, we continue to be encouraged by the opportunities that lie ahead in many of the markets. Our Ogivri has double-digit share in 9 markets in the region and is advancing share in the critical markets like France and Sweden. Hulio has also found success in markets like Germany, France and Finland. 
In Germany, we are seeing more than 13% share of the entire market and share of the biosimilars market, exceeding 20% for the first time. 
We have double-digit biosimilar share on Hulio in 10 markets in Europe. We see significant opportunities ahead and are projecting nearly 100% growth in the early stages of the biosimilars business in Europe in 2020 over the prior year. 
For the Rest of World segment, we have seen more than 40% growth year-over-year and now offer biosimilar products in more than 40 countries. We have been very pleased with our performance in markets like Tunisia, Morocco and the Philippines, where we have retained a market leadership position for Hertraz, our biosimilar to Herceptin as well as in Australia, where we're now the #1 biosimilar to trastuzumab representing 75% of the biosimilars market. 
In closing, as we have mentioned, our biosimilar strategy has been, and continues to be, about developing and executing on this long-term global franchise, focusing on market relevance, and global leadership as it relates to this extremely important area for patient access and payer savings around the world. 
We are beginning to see signs of our hard work and efforts materialize in the market. And are pleased with the early trajectory of our biosimilars business. We remain confident that our experience, scientific capabilities and commercial platform position us to expand this business and be a leader in the biosimilar space. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ken to discuss our financial results in more detail."

As you've seen in our press release this morning, and I've heard throughout this call, our first half 2020 results showcase Mylan's ability to perform in a challenging environment and underscore the resiliency as",1112,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our press release this morning, and I've heard throughout this call, our first half 2020 results showcase Mylan's ability to perform in a challenging environment and underscore the resiliency as well as the durability of the platform we've built over the last decade. Embedded in our strong first half results was a more pronounced impact from COVID in the second quarter. Q2 revenues of $2.7 billion were 4% lower than the prior year and 2% lower on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenues were negatively impacted approximately 5% as a result of the COVID pandemic. 
A portion of this was the reversal of the accelerated buying we saw at the end of the first quarter as customers and patients, primarily in Europe, began to react to the early signs of the ramp in the pandemic. As disclosed in our first quarter conference call, we estimated this accelerated buying to be approximately $50 million or 2% of first quarter sales. As the pandemic continued to take hold globally, we saw second quarter revenues negatively impacted by lower retail pharmacy demand, lower patient hospital visits and a materially lower number of in-person meetings with prescribers and payers, mostly in Europe and the rest of world segments. That said, first half revenues were flat year-over-year and up approximately 3%, excluding the impact of currency exchange. Pricing declines remained relatively consistent at down low to mid-single digits overall, and volumes of existing products grew 5%, including the negative impact of COVID. 
New product launch revenues contributed $163 million in the first half of the year, and we expect an additional $450 million of new product launches in the second half. 
Moving to gross margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted gross margins remained strong at 54.3%. That's up 50 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting higher gross profit from sales of existing products in North America, primarily driven by sales of Wixela as well as the contribution of new products. 
This impact was partially offset by lower gross margins on sales of existing products in the Rest of World segment, including China and other expansion markets. From a segment profitability standpoint, North America increased 3% in the quarter, excluding costs associated with the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program. This increase reflects contributions from new product sales, higher volumes of sales from existing products, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing on existing products driven by changes in the competitive environment, including levothyroxine. Europe segment profitability also expanded, up 28% in the quarter, partially driven by favorable product mix.
Conversely, rest of world segment profitability declined, down 22%, mainly due to the negative impact of COVID-19 and lower pricing on existing products, primarily due to government pricing reductions in Japan. In addition, all segments benefited from lower selling and marketing costs, and both Europe and Rest of World segments profitability results were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. 
Second quarter adjusted R&D was down 4% compared to 2019 due to reprioritization of global programs as well as certain timing impacts in response to the pandemic. 
During the quarter, adjusted SG&A spending declined 11% year-over-year, reflecting lower-than-anticipated selling and marketing investments, lower travel and entertainment activities and lower legal expenses primarily in response to the COVID pandemic, along with the ongoing active management of the business. 
For Q2, we reported adjusted net earnings of $574 million and adjusted EBITDA of $879 million, an increase of 8% and 4%, respectively. For the first 6 months of the year, adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA grew a healthy 9% and 5% on revenues that grew 3% on a constant currency basis. 
Turning to cash flow for the first 3 months ended June 30, 2020, adjusted free cash flow was $522 million, bringing first half adjusted free cash flow to $879 million, that's up 17% and up $129 million over the same period in 2019. 
While we don't presently see any negative liquidity trends related to the pandemic, we do continue to monitor those trends very closely. We expect adjusted free cash flow to increase in the second half of the year in line with seasonally increasing profitability, coupled with ongoing realization of working capital velocity initiatives. 
During the second quarter, we repaid EUR 500 million of scheduled debt maturities and reduced our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to 3.4x, in line with our expectations and well below our covenant requirements. 
We continue to anticipate full year adjusted free cash flow generation, consistent with 2019 levels, which will support achievement of our $1 billion debt repayment target for the full year. 
We expect our cash flow from operations along with our existing borrowing facilities, which provide liquidity up to $2.6 billion will be more than sufficient to meet all possible liquidity needs in the near term. As always, we remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit ratings and to further reducing leverage. 
Finally, as you've heard earlier, we're narrowing our full year 2020 guidance ranges. Revenues are now expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, absorbing the ongoing headwinds from the COVID pandemic. And while we're seeing savings in SG&A due to COVID, these savings are being partially offset by the delayed implementation of the restructuring portion of our business transformation plans also due to COVID. 
As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion also tightening that previous range and raising the low end of the range. 
At the midpoint of this range, $3.5 billion, this implies slightly less than $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the second half of the year. And as usual, we expect the fourth quarter to contribute relatively more adjusted EBITDA than the third quarter. We also continue to expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate between 18% and 19% and a full year average diluted share count between 516 million and 520 million shares, consistent with our earlier guidance. 
Before I wrap up my comments, I must take a minute to express my sincere thanks for the honor to have had the opportunity to serve this company, its stakeholders and most importantly, this team for the last 4 years. The unwavering dedication by all 35,000 employees to the company's mission is truly unparalleled. 
While I'm extremely excited for my next opportunity, I will always be watching my Mylan and Viatris colleagues, cheering them on as they continue to reshape the global health care landscape, ensuring access to affordable medications for the world's population. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Robert."
290203,678008919,2097411,"Mylan, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good morning. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we sincerely appreciate all your contributions and accomplishments for Mylan and do wish you all the best in the next phase of your career. I would like to take a moment to offer my sin",991,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we sincerely appreciate all your contributions and accomplishments for Mylan and do wish you all the best in the next phase of your career. 
I would like to take a moment to offer my sincere gratitude to all the Mylan employees worldwide and their families for their remarkable resilience and determination as we continue to deliver on our mission of providing patients around the globe with continued access to needed medicines, even though the global COVID-19 pandemic. I also would like to welcome all of our future Upjohn colleagues listening to this call. I am proud of our management team’s leadership in always putting the safety of our colleagues around the world first. 
While focus on safety remains paramount, as you heard from Heather and the management team, what is also truly impressive is Mylan's employees continues and how they can just continue to deliver on the solid performance and especially in the second quarter. While the management team provided an update on the year-to-date, I would now like to turn my attention to where we stand with respect to our pending transaction with Pfizer's Upjohn, and how I continue to see 2021 shaping up directionally with official guidance to follow directly from Viatris' management team following the close. 
As many of you know, we held an extraordinary general meeting on June 30 for shareholders to vote on the Viatris transaction. We are extremely pleased with the overwhelming support we received, which was demonstrated by the fact that 99.6% of the shares voting were in favor of the transaction. With the approval of our shareholders, the only remaining external requirements to close the transaction are a few regulatory approvals, and we are still on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
While we have continued to work towards closing, the Viatris management team recently began the process of meeting virtually with many of our top Mylan shareholders and covering sell-side analysts, as we previously promised. 
During these meetings, Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev not only demonstrated their cohesive alignment, passion and excitement to lead this great new organization, but they also convey their confidence in being able to deliver significant long-term value to shareholders. 
We expect those conversations to continue as we expand our shareholder engagement activities, including with the Pfizer shareholders, who will become Viatris shareholders through the closing and beyond. 
I will soon be personally reaching out to the Pfizer shareholders to set up their own meet-and-greets with the future Viatris management team. With that said, I would like to sincerely thank all those who have participated in these meet and greet sessions to date. 
In addition to all the milestones achieved to date as we look forward to closing, I would now like to lay out a number of key next steps of interest to the future Viatris investment community. 
Step 1, first and foremost, is to close this transaction, which we are on track to do in the fourth quarter. Without speaking for Pfizer, I can certainly tell you that both organizations remain highly focused on bringing this transaction to a successful close. 
Step 2. It is for the Viatris' Board of Directors to then immediately initiate our new business model focused on total shareholder return and a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation program, beginning with the initiation of a meaningful and attractive dividend after the first full quarter following closing, while also rapidly beginning to pay down debt to meet our stated target of 2.5x leverage ratio. 
Step 3. At the end of February or early March, when Viatris reports its fourth quarter earnings, you can expect the new Viatris management team to provide the opening guidance for Viatris' first full year 2021, which I often refer to as the trough year, during a live Investor Day. It is expected that the guidance delivered will take all relevant country-specific headwinds into consideration. For example, and among others, China's VPP, Japan Lyrica LOE and any other potential headwinds that will be known at the time, including any effects as a result of a continuing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Step 4. Viatris' management must demonstrate its ability to deliver consistent and transparent results in a predictable and measurable way. At the same time, while integrating both businesses and achieving our targets of at least $1 billion in synergies over the first 4 years of operations. 
Step 5. We will launch Viatris' new global healthcare gateway, which will be the house of discipline, responsible for all future capital investments to fuel Viatris' future growth. 
With that said, I will try to answer any remaining questions of interest regarding Viatris during the Q&A session. 
But before I conclude, I would like to state that given Viatris' vast global profile, with now 70% of its business outside the United States and diverse global reach as well as our commitment to total shareholder return and corporate social responsibility. We believe that Viatris will be perfectly situated to attract even a broader shareholder base around the world. Therefore, we intend to explore ways to unlock value beyond our current U.S.-centric shareholder base by exploring additional potential listings on other international exchange trading platforms. 
In closing, before turning the call over to the operator, I would like to conclude by underscoring how very excited we are to launch Viatris in its mission to empower people around the world to live healthier at every stage of life. 
As we anticipate this to be our last Mylan's quarterly earnings call. And although Heather will remain with us until we close, I would also like to thank Heather in this forum. 
Heather, on behalf of our Board of Directors and all of our Mylan employees for your exemplary true leadership and lasting contributions that you have made to Mylan, our industry and patients around the world thank you. [Operator Instructions]

But equally, because of what we created, business development and attracting partners around the globe, all of that will reside in the global healthcare gateway. I simply see the future of Viatris being represented on really 2 platforms. One, it will be the 2 60-plus year old companies coming together and really executing on what that base business is. And then off to the right, I see the global healthcare gateway, the real engine. We call it the House of Discipline because that's where all capital investments will reside. And that's where you will see all excess cash flow and capital being placed to compete. Whether it's the organic R&D, whether it's business development, whether it's collaborations or joint ventures. All of it will be competing in the global healthcare gateway. 
I envision that The Street after envision future conference calls with the new management team, I expect to report on the base platform, and I don't really expect that to be very much. We will report the results because we have very experienced management team that will execute, deliver on the numbers, but I do expect a great majority of time being spent with Michael, Rajiv, especially on the global healthcare gateway for each new opportunity that we put inside there.

What I envision, Viatris being able to do is to serve as the -- really the next natural secondary source that all countries are going to need. I do see a potential upside opportunity just like we were approached on remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine or any other needs that I see arise in the world. And it's not just limited in the United States. I think, Rajiv, you can comment on about how the India government and other governments are approaching us. So I do think that having a global supply chain especially in the healthcare industry, especially in pharmaceuticals, just given the global supplies we need. It's not going to become unwounded, so to speak, there's going to be a big need for, I think, our global platform, and I do see some potential opportunity."

So how should we be thinking about Viatris as a partner-of-choice in China going forward and do you think that could partially be because the deals are not done yet and maybe there is a bit of a standstill?
And secondly, Robert, I know you guys do extensive legal diligence. And one of the key sticking points and pro forma numbers is Lyrica Japan, and there's some element of mixed feedback coming up on the recent Japanese patent office ruling on whether the upheld claims do support exclusivity through 2022 or the claims that were not upheld, do they ensure that generics get in? I'd be very curious on your take on these."

But that doesn't mean, just because you haven't heard any talks doesn't mean that we're not at work. That I could tell you. And the reason why I'm so emphatic about the 100% because the last thing we need right now is for the China Upjohn -- Pfizer Upjohn operation to take its eye off the ball. Because remember, they needed to finish separating Upjohn from Pfizer. And that work is coming along very, very well. They're not actually quite complete. They're almost done. And then I think the other thing that we've been focusing on in China is really what is the new business model going forward. I think the base that we're going to be starting from in China is quite enviable. And quite frankly, let me be clear. I think that we're going to be able to compete. And I'm watching as well. I think it was a very observant comment that you have because I'm watching as well as some of the deals that are getting done with the Chinese nationalist. I think that the Viatris is not going to be considered as a traditional multinational. I think Viatris in China is being viewed as a Chinese nationals entrepreneur as well. So I do think we represent a hybrid. I think we bring the multinational mindset, but I think we bring the entrepreneurial very quick and nimble, boutique, Chinese entrepreneurial style. And I do think it's going to have its advantage. So I'm quite excited about the opportunity in China. And I'll be teaming up, as you know, with Michael doing actually a lot of the work in China and looking forward to reporting on more opportunities that we see as we go forward. 
In terms of Lyrica, I think another very insightful question. And the way you parsed it, I think, is fair. So I'm going to try to be fair in response by telling you that I do think that it's a complicated legal issue. I think it's a complicated breakdown of the construction claims around the patent. And then I think it's also complicated. When you look at the momentum about where Japan has in the MWLH and kind of sort of what they've been thinking about. So I'd rather not -- like any other legal case, not try to handicap it, but what I do think, to be fair to The Street, at least from my perspective, what I would say and what I would be strongly recommending management to do, I think it would be wholly irresponsible, in my opinion, and just my opinion, to include the Japan Lyrica numbers in what I would call the trough year in 2021. And I think if we are successful with the Japan Lyrica in Japan, which I'm hopeful and confident. 
Certainly, I think we've come a long way. We could have had an outright loss. No, we didn't get an outright win. I think that the courts split the decision. And I think it's only going to be a matter of time before we know. But the numbers that you should expect in 2021, what I think investors need to appreciate, unlike the United States, is we will not lose 100% of Lyrica in Japan. What will be included in the numbers is a certain percentage that we know we will hold on to just because of the way that marketplace works. So it's actually a fairly nice base. I wouldn't take all the numbers out. But what we would do, assuming even if we have generic Lyrica as a win, I believe the responsible thing to do would be to separate what is all included in our base and anything excess that we get from generic Lyrica and Japan or that we get from Lyrica in Japan before it goes generics. I would ask investors to more look at it almost like how they used to model the 180-day exclusivity here in the United States. It's going to be much more of a cash bonus but I don't think as a going concern, and that, that should be included in our base business and also as part of our base -- as we project pro forma on a going-forward basis. That's what you can expect. I hope that was helpful, Umer."

Let me try to at least walk you through -- let me start with the trough, and then let me walk you through what I envision the cadence to be over the next 3 to 4 years, and what I expect post the fourth year, years 5, 6 and beyond. I think the numbers that we're going to give you are going to fully incorporate all the stand up costs. Therefore, we're going to take the numbers down low enough that will fully absorb all these costs that TSAs, MSAs and any other stand up cost that -- in order to start Viatris on the right foot. When you think about those TSAs and MSAs, you should also note that we have all the incentive in the world to get off of those TSAs and MSAs as we continue to build out our own infrastructure. That is what we're banking on as part of our upside as we see the cadence rolling forward. David, there's been a lot of questions. When we first announced the deal, people were concerned about whether or not this was a declining business. 
Today, we don't hear anybody discussing about this as a declining business. Everybody wants to talk about how are we going to return back to growth. No one's talking about it's a declining business because we quickly jumped in front as quickly as we could. We're not relying on 2020. We never did. Because we believe that 2021 is going to represent the best first starting point for Viatris as a brand-new company. 
We have all the opportunity in the world to reset these numbers, especially given our current market multiple to make sure that this new Viatris management team is set up for success quarter after quarter after quarter, not just to me but hopefully exceed. And so you should expect that that's the way we're thinking. And so to get the 2021's trough, we'll take a quick look at a couple of years out and ensure that the numbers we start with in 2021, taken all the headwinds that everybody has been discussing out of the baseline business. And even to Umer's question around Japan's Lyrica, you're going to see we're going to set that aside as well because anything that is not sustainable, that doesn't really have a strong tail to it, we don't believe belongs in the base business. Those are temporary and what we want to demonstrate is the durability and the sustainability of this new base platform when we pull this together. And in that base platform, I think it will be a pleasantful surprise. We don't see any one meaningful catalyst that will cause the type of volatility that I think that the Mylan investors have experienced, especially in North America. 
So we really have not just diversified, but derisked our entire business model by really taking out all that noise and really addressing all the headwinds that we can envision right up front. The cadence over the first 3, 4 years, what I think you should expect is this is going to be an EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings growth story. You know, David, earnings growth can come in many ways. 
In the first 3 to 4 years, what we were trying to convey, and I think what management was conveying in its meet and greet with you and some of our shareholders was -- you should -- you can get earnings growth by adding to your top line or you can get earnings growth like we potentially see our ability to drive earnings growth, EBITDA growth, free cash flow growth by launching the pipeline that we already have. And most importantly, garnering the synergies over the first 3 to 4 years. 
When you look at what we have to work with, I think that the Viatris shareholders should expect an extraordinarily stable top line revenue business and the early years with growth in EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings. So you're going to see an earnings growth story right away, because the dividend or the synergies will allow us to do that. In the meantime, you're going to also want to pay attention to what we load up in the global healthcare gateway, and how we're using -- how we're placing our capital investments in years 1, 2, 3 and 4. And as the synergies roll off at the end of year 4, you're going to start to see where the top line growth that we're going to be able to maintain earnings growth and EBITDA growth, free cash flow growth by what we add to that top line. And that's as simple as I can lay it off for you, and that's exactly what management is signing up for. It's exactly the road map that we put in all of our presentations. And I do look forward for the new management team to really give you even more color once they have -- once you have a chance to close, they have a chance to get together and really dive deep into the new combined organization to deliver on exactly what I laid out for you, David."

EpiPen is a larger quarter in the third quarter as well as many of our products in Europe, including Influvac, our bigger products in the third and then especially the fourth quarter. So you've got the typical seasonal step up to get to that growth from the $5.3 billion to the higher number that you calculate to get to the midpoint. But then I'll also point out one of the comments in my scripted comments, which is in the first half of the year, our new product launch revenues were about $163 million, and we're expecting another $425 million to $430 million of that.

We have always planned, we've said this many, many times publicly. When we did our deal with Biocon and created something, I think, very, very special, in which we were way behind when we first started in 2009 but not only did we catch up, we went way ahead. What we've planned for always was for more of a global launch in our biologics because back then, we did not see the pathway to a U.S. biologics market. That happened rather quickly, and it happened over the last few years. One of the things that we had and why we're doing so well in other parts ex U.S. is because we've already had the proper infrastructure already in place, we were ready for those markets.
To be very honest with you, I don't believe we had the right commercial infrastructure as well as I believe we could have had in the United States. I've seen that when a company like Coherus could come in, nobody knows the name Coherus. Everybody knows the name of Amgen's sales reps. Coherus is Amgen's sales reps. So when you understand the market in the United States and understand the importance of that well-established relationship between those reps, the hospitals and the -- within that particular franchise in that food chain. I would say, absolutely, that was part because it's not just the cost, it is about some of those relationships. And that's an opportunity for us to improve going forward here in the United States. But I'm hoping now that when people look at our franchise, our global franchise, they'll start to appreciate how well we're doing ex U.S. as well."

And then it has restructuring costs related to Morgantown, including some manufacturing variances stopped. But as you said, we very recently, in the last call, we said we have crossed everything related to restructuring because of the COVID. So that's why we are carrying the cost for the time being over here. 
Now as we go into the Viatris, I'm pretty sure we have already stated that we will be moving to the GAAP cash flow and not adjusted cash flow. 
Tony, you can confirm that."

And we have not talked about how much of the pipeline rolls in. I do believe that when we come together on the Investor Day, we fully intend on breaking down. And Rajiv, I know when we started in -- when we announced the transaction, we had approximately $3 billion to launch. That was July of 2019. We've already began to launch a large portion of that portfolio. We also are continuing to load up into our research and development. So we'll need to update those numbers and be more sustained when we get to you on Investor Day."

Certainly, we are extremely excited to get ready to launch. You heard Rajiv mention in the coming weeks. It's a competitive market, one that I think we've stated it's going to be a slow ramp, but we do see this as a very good long-term opportunity. The diabetes population, the demographics are growing and this is one where you think of payer healthcare professional and pharmacy, that triangulation will be critical in long-term success. So we're ready. But like I said, I think it will be a slow ramp in the initial phases of the launch.
