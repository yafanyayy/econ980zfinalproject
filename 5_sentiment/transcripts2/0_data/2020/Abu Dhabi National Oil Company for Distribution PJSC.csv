Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to be hosting my [indiscernible] call with you. I humbly recognize the responsibilities placed and need to drive the business to new heights. Somebody coming from -- somebody coming in from outside ADNOC Distribution, I hope to bring fresh perspective how to create further value. Placing our customers and our employees at the heart of everything we do.
In short, my 2 key objectives are driving further growth and delivering solid shareholder returns. For those who don't know my background, my expertise is an asset optimization and marketing products on an international scale in the downstream industry. I was also very much involved in a number of large-scale and successful transformation initiatives with Enbridge, my former company. I'm looking forward to interacting with you in the coming months. The day, I want to run you through a solid full year performance and further progress on our growth strategy. I would like to reiterate that Cary remains a core value to our business. We continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions evidenced by extremely low lost time injury frequency and total reportable energy during 2019. I will provide key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance. We saw a solid operational performance in both fuel and nonfuel businesses. Our net profit increased by 11.3% to USD 135 million in Q4 2019 for the first times since the IPO. In Q3 2019, we witnessed growth in retail fuel volumes, which represents around 70% of our total volumes. We saw this continue in the fourth quarter of 2019, representing a 1.2% year-on-year growth. For full year 2019, net profit increased by 4.2% and to USD 604 million compared to 2018.
We continue to adapt to our customers' needs, offering them innovative solutions, a seamless digital experience and smart payment solutions. Our recent offering of 3 assets at Fueling recently unveiled innovative next-generation fuel as well as retail stations adblocking, new reality program at no rewards and our next-generation ADNOC Oasis convenience stores, reflect our true commitment towards our customers. These initiatives would also position us to effectively tackle competition with superior customer offering, faster, more efficient deployment to our fuel station to our fuel stations, while optimizing Capex.
Finally, the company generated strong free cash flows of USD 635 million in 2019, increasing by 16.4% compared to 2018, which supports our progressive dividend policy. Our board recommended yesterday a cash dividend of USD 325 million or [ USD 9.55 ] per share for the second half of 2019, taking full year 2019 dividend to USD 650 million a 62% increase over the previous year, demonstrating confidence in our ability to generate cash and our strong financial position.
Finally, for 2020, our priorities are creating superior customer experience and delivering on our accelerated expansion plan to drive profitable earnings growth and obtains to our shareholders.
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy."

Two things I want to point out that we are focused on now. One, delivering our ambitious strategy and to building long-term shareholder value through our next phase of growth. So first off, I'm going to start off by giving you an update",812,"Thank you, Ahmed. Two things I want to point out that we are focused on now. One, delivering our ambitious strategy and to building long-term shareholder value through our next phase of growth. So first off, I'm going to start off by giving you an update on the first strategic pillar of our business, which is the fuel segment. Total fuel volumes have increased by 2% in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter of 2018. Now this was driven by an improvement in our core Abu Dhabi market as well as market share gains in the Northern Emirates following the implementation of free assisted fueling for all our customers. We also saw an increase due to the contribution from new stations in Dubai as well as new marketing campaigns and growth in our corporate business. So throughout 2019, we introduced a series of customer-focused initiatives. All of these initiatives were introduced to enhance the overall customer experience and offer superior customer services.
So 3 marketing campaigns were launched in the summer. One was Good Morning UAE, the second one was Fuel Up & Fly Off, and the third one was Hello Summer. The intention here was to drive higher traffic to the ADNOC Distribution service stations. Now these marketing campaigns were a huge success. They generated growth as far as retail fuel volumes. But also, they allowed us to gain really good insight into our customers' needs. So based on the feedback from this extensive customer engagement program, and from our customer behavior following the 3 marketing campaigns, we began offering free assisted fueling to all our customers from the third of November 2019. This has been very, very well received by our customers. It's driven growth in retail fuel volumes, which have grown by 1.2% year-on-year in Q4 2019. Now this was in line with our guidance to the market. Q4 2019 retail fuel volumes growth reflect positive impact of free assisted fueling for 2 months. Now we expect the full benefit of volume growth to be visible starting in Q1 2020. Coming back to our network expansion, our UAE network has now reached 382 retail fuel stations as of December 31, 2019.
In 2019, we've opened 6 new stations in UAE, of which 3 were in Dubai, bringing the total number of fuel stations we operate in Dubai to 6 as of December 31, 2019.
Now in our third quarter 2019 results conference call, we indicated that our domestic network expansion would accelerate starting 2020. After obtaining necessary approvals as well as awarding construction contracts last year, we're now in a position to accelerate deployment of our network plan, as guided earlier. So in our corporate business, we also witnessed strong growth across all our products on the back of dynamic product pricing strategy as well as increase in our market share in Dubai and the Northern Emirates.
On the international expansion front, our strategy is in full execution mode with the establishment of legal entities and ongoing discussions with several players. Now we will announce in due course to the market, more updates in line with our commitment to best disclosure standards and regulatory compliance.
Moving onto nonfuel retail, the second pillar of our strategy. Our UAE network increased to 264 convenience stores as of December 31, 2019, and with the addition of 14 new convenient stores in the UAE in 2019. Our convenience store revitalization program offers our customers have very improved shopping experience. Now this is underway and has already started contributing to strong convenience store performance. Our convenient store gross profit increased by 20.6% year-on-year. And we also witnessed a significant uplift in average basket size by 5% in 2019 compared to 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we unveiled our next-generation ADNOC Oasis convenience store with a fresh look and feel, upgraded amenities that a family-friendly environment. The new stores also offer fresh food choices, premium coffee and on-site bakery and convenient digital payment options. So far, we're very encouraged by positive results from our newly refurbished store.
Last but not least, I'm going to give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative, which remains the third pillar of our strategic [indiscernible]. So we achieved a reduction of USD 46 million in like-for-like operating expenditure in 2019 compared to 2018. But during 2018 and '19, it brings the total to approximately USD 100 million in like-for-like operating expenditure savings. This is fully in line with our guidance to the market. In terms of capital expenditure, we've spent USD 138 million of CapEx in 2019, which is slightly lower than our guidance before. However, as we pointed out, we expect acceleration in CapEx in 2020, which reflects our ambitious new network delivery schedule.
So at this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance."

As Ahmed already mentioned, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in Q4 as well as in 2019. Q4 net profit increased by 11.3% to USD 135 million compared to USD 221 millio",954,"Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, and many thanks, Mohamed. As Ahmed already mentioned, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in Q4 as well as in 2019. Q4 net profit increased by 11.3% to USD 135 million compared to USD 221 million in Q4 2018. This was driven by growth in the total fuel volumes, strong results in our nonfuel business as well as successful customer initiatives and cost optimization efforts. 2019 net profit increased by 4.2% to USD 604 million compared to USD 579 million in 2018, driven by recovery in fuel volumes, growth in our corporate business, continued momentum in our nonfuel business and reduction in operating costs, which were partially offset by lower inventory gains in 2019.
The underlying EBITDA, which is measured by EBITDA, excluding inventory gains in 2019 was USD 740 million, representing a 7.2% increase compared to 2018. Inventory gains, as mentioned, well over at USD 33 million compared to 2018 when we reached USD 65 million in inventory cash.
We continue to make good progress in rationalizing our Opex, achieving the USD 46 million savings in like-for-like OpEx, representing a 7.4% reduction on a like-for-like basis. On the CapEx side, in 2019, we've been focusing on defining a network expansion allocation and strategy. Our network rollout is scheduled for operational deployment in the first half of 2020 and beyond. Our CapEx in 2019 was USD 138 million. And finally, we generated very strong free cash flow, measured as EBITDA minus CapEx. Free cash flow increased by 16.4% year-on-year to USD 635 million, driven by strong cash flows from operations as well as lower CapEx.
Let me now briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for 2019. As already mentioned earlier, total fuel volumes sold increased by 0.7% compared to 2018, driven by growth in corporate and aviation fuel volumes and growth in retail fuel volumes in the second half of 2019. We are very pleased to report that we have now recorded 2 successive quarters of growth in our retail fuel volumes, which grew by 1.2% in Q4 2019. As Mohamed already pointed out, the benefits of implementing free assisted fueling are not fully reflected in Q4 2019, as this decision only came into the effect on 3rd of November, i.e., for less than 2 months of the quarter. Our core retail market here in Abu Dhabi, continued to show growth, while we also gained market share in the Northern Emirates as well as in Dubai.
On the corporate segment side, volumes increased in 2019 by 6% compared to '18, driven by higher sales of diesel, LPG, lubricant and base oils. Our aviation segment volumes are sold to strategic customers increased by 3.8% compared to 2018.
And finally, in the nonfuel business, as mentioned, we continue to see very good momentum throughout the year with strong increase in transactions as well as an uplift in average basket size.
Now let me make a few comments and remarks on gross profit performance by segment. Fuel retail gross profit decreased in 2019 by 5.9%, driven by lower volumes as well as lower inventory gains, as mentioned. However, retail fuel volumes started to grow beginning Q3. And fuel retail gross profit increased by 6.7% in Q4 compared to Q4 2018. This was also a result of higher margins following the renegotiation of our fuel supply contract effective in November 2019. As we see a continued pickup in volumes in 2020, we are expecting to see further improvement in retail fuel gross profit.
Gross profit for nonfuel retail, mainly C-stores or convenience stores continued to show strong momentum and increased by 11.8% year-on-year in 2019. This is reflecting our diversification strategy towards nonfuel retail as well as the implementation of new initiatives to improve customer shopping experience including also a much more focused stores revitalization program.
In the corporate segment, gross profit increased by 10.8% year-on-year on the back of the increase in volumes as well as higher margins. And finally, aviation gross profit decreased by 2.7% year-on-year.
Moving onto EBITDA per segment. Our retail segment EBITDA increased by 3.4%, mainly driven by higher operating efficiencies as well as better nonfuel performance despite the lower volumes as well as lower inventory gains, as mentioned. In the corporate segment, EBITDA increased by 10.2% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes, margins as well as cost efficiency. I'd like to note that corporate segment EBITDA actually declined in Q4 despite higher gross profit. This was mainly due to the presence of one of receivables recovery that we recovered in Q4 2018. Aviation EBITDA increased by 7.7%, driven by higher cost efficiencies.
At this point in time, I would also like to highlight that from Q1 2020 onwards, we will introduce new segment reporting structure, which is based on a natural characterization of our businesses into 2 pockets of retail, B2C as well as commercial B2B segments. As a reference, we've included as an appendix to the 2019 management discussion and analysis report, the quarterly as well as full year results of 2019 as per the new segment reporting structure.
Finally, looking at the cash movements. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations, partially offset by negative movement in working capital, mainly as a result of reduction in payment terms under the principal retail fuel supply agreement from 60 days to 30 days, as disclosed already in our Q3 2019 results. Strong cash flow generation has resulted in a very low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.26x at the end of the year as well as the cash position of approximately USD 1.3 billion.
Now let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered solid underlying results in 2019. For 2020, we are focusing to deliver on our accelerated expansion plan in both fuel and nonfuel businesses to drive profitable earnings growth and returns for our shareholders. After a 7.2% year-on-year underlining EBITDA growth in 2019, we are focused on continuing to grow EBITDA across our businesses, to pursue cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives and to maintain growth momentum.
Coming to further details on our guidance. Starting with fuel business, we are targeting to open at least 60 new stations, including a mix of traditional and ADNOC on-the-go stations. In Dubai, we plan to open between 20 to 25 new stations, most of which will be traditional stations. We have made good progress on the awarding of contracts for these stations, which gives us confidence in achieving our targets. We anticipate our Dubai expansion will bring market share gains and contribute to higher growth in retail fuel volumes starting in 2020.
We expect overall fuel volume growth of low single digits in 2020. Retail growth is expected to be driven by market growth, recovery of volumes and the Northern Emirates and gain in market share in Dubai. In commercial business, we have signed new contracts with our corporate clients and thus expect to sustain volume growth in 2020.
In nonfuel business, in 2020, we will accelerate our convenience store revitalization program [ 200 of ] our stores with a focus of refurbishment and a refreshed look and feel. We will also continue to enhance and improve the overall customer experience with further improvements on category management and introduction of new fresh food and great coffee products with high margins. We will also add further enhancements to our customer-centric offerings with more benefits expected under our new loyalty program ADNOC Rewards as well as on the back of station optimization across our network, which will focus on enhancing the use of space to maximize revenue potential. For cost efficiency, in line with our previous guidance, we are targeting to realize further like-for-like OpEx savings of approximately USD 100 million over 2020 to 2023 period, of which up to USD 25 million is expected in 2020. In terms of Capex, we plan to spend USD 300 million to USD 400 million of CapEx in 2020, which is significantly higher than in 2019, reflecting our ambitious new stations delivery schedule.
For 2020, we expect to pay USD 700 million in debit as per approved dividend policy and subject to board and shareholder approval. Half of this dividend was paid in October 2020, and the second half would be paid in April 2021.
Before concluding, I would like to reiterate our commitment to our shareholders. We continue to transform ADNOC Distribution into a world-class, customer-focused, commercially-driven company with a determined focus on driving profitable growth. As we sharpen our focus on customer experience and pursue growth opportunities, both domestically and internationally. We will expand all our distribution channels to reach larger market segments and sustained volume growth.
This concludes today's presentation. We are happy to take on any questions that you may have. Thank you."

Just to start one more mechanical, just running through the retail gross profit per liter in Q4 versus Q4 2018. I mean, it just indicates that the margin per liter is going down, assuming that you've booked 0 inventory gains in Q4 '19. And if I'm not mistaken, around USD 16 million in inventory losses in Q4 '18. I just want to know if I'm missing something? I mean, we should assume margin per liter should be up given that the cost of supply structure changed in November. So if you can just help me reconcile the numbers on that front? So that's the first question. The other question is on the volume growth. I mean, again, a good quarter in terms of retail volume growth on a year-over-year basis. Can we just get more clarity on the drivers of this growth? You mentioned Abu Dhabi is positive. Northern Emirates, you took market share, and Dubai is supporting. Can we get some more details in terms of the extent of growth in Abu Dhabi on a stand-alone in terms of how much market share are you gaining in Northern Emirates? And I think the most interesting out of it is, how are the Dubai stations performing in terms of throughput per station or potentially contribution to this total volume, if you can disclose that? And my third question is on the working capital. It just feels that the working capital pressures continue into 2019, and this is mainly maybe related to the change in the payment terms. Should we expect this trend to continue into 2020 in terms of negative working capital cash flow -- on your cash flow statement? And the last one, I think the COO was quoted on Bloomberg talking about growth markets being India, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. On Saudi, is there any update on how you're looking to expand into the market, assuming that now the margin structure has changed? And keeping in mind that everyone wants to be in Saudi Arabia, including Aramco, which is now apparently doing fuel retail. So maybe your thoughts on the growth angle in Saudi? Sorry, it's lots of questions, but that's it from my end."

The second question you had on the volume was what about Abu Dhabi, what about Northern Emirates. What we can tell you is we have now seen 2 successive quarters of growth in Abu Dhabi market. So Q3 and Q4, which is encouraging. In the Northern Emirates, since the implementation of the free-assisted fueling, we have seen volumes starting to grow as we gain market share. In a nutshell, the like-for-like growth actually is slight growth in pure retail volume overall, including Abu Dhabi. Regarding the question on working capital. Petri, do you want to take it?"

So under this new regime, the IRR that we expect from expansion in the Saudia is expected to clear a minimum hurdle rate of 15%. And as I mentioned earlier today, we're in advanced stages of establishing a legal structure as well as an operating entity in Saudi. And currently in discussion with several players, including landlords and fuel operators to grow organically or through any actions that we intend to make. As far as the business line and our strategy for the child market going forward. We have full clarity.

We know that our experience and strength in the brand that we -- the brand offering as well as how we are perceived in the Saudi market, this can be leveraged to capture growth. And we can take our customer experience and offering in that market. The customers there know us well, and we're very, very confident we're going to be successful. So we've got the balance sheet strength. Once again, we're going to grow our network organically or acquire small players. We have the balance sheet to do that.

Of course, the starting point is that the operating cash flow is fundamentally gathering for the Capex. When it comes to dividend, faster capacity to service that as well. We have no problem whatsoever in terms of more optimal capital structure, which would point to a higher leverage. I would like to remind everyone about our thoughts at IPO when we communicated that on a longer-term basis, 1.5 to 2x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio seems a bit more optimum in a business where we have strong underlying market share, predictable cash flows and a very strong market position that we are leveraging.

I was also very much involved in a number of large-scale and successful transformation initiatives within Borouge, my former company. I'm looking forward to interacting with you in the coming months. Today I want to run you through a solid full year performance and further progress on our growth strategy. I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. We continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions evidenced by extremely low lost time injury frequency and total reportable injury during 2019. I will provide key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance. We saw a solid operational performance in both fuel and nonfuel businesses. Our net profit increased by 11.3% to USD 135 million in Q4 2019 for the first times since the IPO. In Q3 2019, we witnessed growth in retail fuel volumes, which represents around 70% of our total volumes. We saw this continue in the fourth quarter of 2019, representing a 1.2% year-on-year growth. For full year 2019, net profit increased by 4.2% and to USD 604 million compared to 2018.
We continue to adapt to our customers' needs, offering them innovative solutions, a seamless digital experience and smart payment solutions. Our recent offering of free assisted fueling recently unveiled innovative next-generation fuel as well as retail stations ADNOC on the go, new loyalty program ADNOC Rewards, and our next-generation ADNOC Oasis convenience store, reflect our true commitment towards our customers. These initiatives would also position us to effectively tackle competition with superior customer offering, faster, more efficient deployment to our fuel stations while optimizing Capex.
Finally, the company generated strong free cash flows of USD 635 million in 2019, increasing by 16.4% compared to 2018, which supports our progressive dividend policy. Our board recommended yesterday a cash dividend of USD 325 million or 9.55 fils per share, for the second half of 2019, taking full year 2019 dividend to USD 650 million a 62% increase over the previous year, demonstrating confidence in our ability to generate cash and our strong financial position.
Finally, for 2020, our priorities are creating superior customer experience and delivering on our accelerated expansion plan to drive profitable earnings growth and returns to our shareholders.
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy."

One, delivering on our ambitious strategy and two, building long-term shareholder value through our next phase of growth. So first off, I'm going to start off by giving you an update on the first strategic pillar of our business, which is the fuel segment. Total fuel volumes have increased by 2% in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter of 2018. Now, this was driven by an improvement in our core Abu Dhabi market as well as market share gains in the Northern Emirates following the implementation of free assisted fueling for all our customers. We also saw an increase due to the contribution from new stations in Dubai as well as new marketing campaigns and growth in our corporate business. So throughout 2019, we introduced a series of customer-focused initiatives. All of these initiatives were introduced to enhance the overall customer experience and offer superior customer services.
So 3 marketing campaigns were launched in the summer. One was Good Morning UAE, the second one was Fuel Up & Fly Off, and the third one was Hello Summer. The intention here was to drive higher traffic to the ADNOC Distribution service stations. Now, these marketing campaigns were a huge success. They generated growth as far as retail fuel volumes. But also, they allowed us to gain really good insight into our customers' needs. So based on the feedback from this extensive customer engagement program, and from our customer behavior following the 3 marketing campaigns, we began offering free assisted fueling to all our customers from the 3rd of November 2019. This has been very, very well received by our customers. It's driven growth in retail fuel volumes, which have grown by 1.2% year-on-year in Q4 2019. Now, this was in line with our guidance to the market. Q4 2019 retail fuel volumes growth reflect positive impact of free assisted fueling for 2 months. Now we expect the full benefit of volume growth to be visible starting in Q1 2020. Coming back to our network expansion, our UAE network has now reached 382 retail fuel stations as of December 31, 2019.
In 2019, we've opened 6 new stations in UAE, of which 3 were in Dubai, bringing the total number of fuel stations we operate in Dubai to 6 as of December 31, 2019.
Now in our third quarter 2019 results conference call, we indicated that our domestic network expansion would accelerate starting 2020. After obtaining necessary approvals as well as awarding construction contracts last year, we're now in a position to accelerate deployment of our network plan, as guided earlier. So in our corporate business, we also witnessed strong growth across all our products on the back of dynamic product pricing strategy as well as increase in our market share in Dubai and the Northern Emirates.
On the international expansion front, our strategy is in full execution mode with the establishment of legal entities and ongoing discussions with several players. Now we will announce in due course to the market, more updates in line with our commitment to best disclosure standards and regulatory compliance.
Moving onto nonfuel retail, the second pillar of our strategy. Our UAE network increased to 264 convenience stores as of December 31, 2019, with the addition of 14 new convenience stores in the UAE in 2019. Our convenience store revitalization program offers our customers a very improved shopping experience. Now, this is underway and has already started contributing to strong convenience store performance. Our convenience store gross profit increased by 20.6% year-on-year. And we also witnessed a significant uplift in average basket size by 5% in 2019 compared to 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we unveiled our next-generation ADNOC Oasis convenience store with a fresh look and feel, upgraded amenities and a family-friendly environment. The new stores also offer fresh food choices, premium coffee and on-site bakery and convenient digital payment options. So far, we're very encouraged by positive results from our newly refurbished store.
Last but not least, I'm going to give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative, which remains the third pillar of our strategic plan. So we achieved a reduction of USD 46 million in like-for-like operating expenditure in 2019 compared to 2018. So during 2018 and '19, it brings the total to approximately USD 100 million in like-for-like operating expenditure savings. This is fully in line with our guidance to the market. In terms of capital expenditure, we've spent USD 138 million of CapEx in 2019, which is slightly lower than our guidance before. However, as we pointed out, we expect acceleration in CapEx in 2020, which reflects our ambitious new network delivery schedule.
So at this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance."

As Ahmed already mentioned, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in Q4 as well as in 2019. Q4 net profit increased by 11.3% to USD 135 million compared to USD 121 millio",950,"Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, and many thanks, Mohamed. As Ahmed already mentioned, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in Q4 as well as in 2019. Q4 net profit increased by 11.3% to USD 135 million compared to USD 121 million in Q4 2018. This was driven by growth in the total fuel volumes, strong results in our nonfuel business as well as successful customer initiatives and cost optimization efforts. 2019 net profit increased by 4.2% to USD 604 million compared to USD 579 million in 2018, driven by recovery in fuel volumes, growth in our corporate business, continued momentum in our nonfuel business and reduction in operating costs, which were partially offset by lower inventory gains in 2019.
The underlying EBITDA, which is measured by EBITDA excluding inventory gains in 2019 was USD 740 million, representing a 7.2% increase compared to 2018. Inventory gains, as mentioned, well over at USD 33 million compared to 2018 when we reached USD 65 million in inventory cash.
We continue to make good progress in rationalizing our Opex, achieving the USD 46 million savings in like-for-like OpEx, representing a 7.4% reduction on a like-for-like basis. On the CapEx side, in 2019, we've been focusing on defining a network expansion allocation and strategy. Our network rollout is scheduled for operational deployment in the first half of 2020 and beyond. Our CapEx in 2019 was USD 138 million. And finally, we generated very strong free cash flow, measured as EBITDA minus CapEx. Free cash flow increased by 16.4% year-on-year to USD 635 million, driven by strong cash flows from operations as well as lower CapEx.
Let me now briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for 2019. As already mentioned earlier, total fuel volumes sold increased by 0.7% compared to 2018, driven by growth in corporate and aviation fuel volumes and growth in retail fuel volumes in the second half of 2019. We are very pleased to report that we have now recorded 2 successive quarters of growth in our retail fuel volumes, which grew by 1.2% in Q4 2019. As Mohamed already pointed out, the benefits of implementing free assisted fueling are not fully reflected in Q4 2019, as this decision only came into the effect on 3rd of November, i.e., for less than 2 months of the quarter. Our core retail market here in Abu Dhabi, continued to show growth, while we also gained market share in the Northern Emirates as well as in Dubai.
On the corporate segment side, volumes increased in 2019 by 6% compared to '18, driven by higher sales of diesel, LPG, lubricant and base oils. Our aviation segment volumes sold to strategic customers increased by 3.8% compared to 2018.
And finally, in the nonfuel business, as mentioned, we continue to see very good momentum throughout the year with strong increase in transactions as well as an uplift in average basket size.
Now let me make a few comments and remarks on gross profit performance by segment. Fuel retail gross profit decreased in 2019 by 5.9%, driven by lower volumes as well as lower inventory gains, as mentioned. However, retail fuel volumes started to grow beginning Q3. And fuel retail gross profit increased by 6.7% in Q4 compared to Q4 2018. This was also a result of higher margins following the renegotiation of our fuel supply contract effective November 2019. As we see a continued pickup in volumes in 2020, we are expecting to see further improvement in retail fuel gross profit.
Gross profit for nonfuel retail, mainly C-stores or convenience stores continued to show strong momentum and increased by 11.8% year-on-year in 2019. This is reflecting our diversification strategy towards nonfuel retail as well as implementation of new initiatives to improve customer shopping experience including also a much more focused stores revitalization program.
In the corporate segment, gross profit increased by 10.8% year-on-year on the back of the increase in volumes as well as higher margins. And finally, aviation gross profit decreased by 2.7% year-on-year.
Moving onto EBITDA per segment. Our retail segment EBITDA increased by 3.4%, mainly driven by higher operating efficiencies as well as better nonfuel performance despite the lower volumes as well as lower inventory gains, as mentioned. In the corporate segment, EBITDA increased by 10.2% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes, margins as well as cost efficiency. I'd like to note that corporate segment EBITDA actually declined in Q4 despite higher gross profit. This was mainly due to the presence of one-off receivables recovery that we recovered in Q4 2018. Aviation EBITDA increased by 7.7%, driven by higher cost efficiencies.
At this point in time, I would also like to highlight that from Q1 2020 onwards, we will introduce new segment reporting structure, which is based on a natural characterization of our businesses into 2 buckets of retail, B2C as well as commercial B2B segments. As a reference, we've included as an appendix to the 2019 management discussion and analysis report, the quarterly as well as full year results of 2019 as per the new segment reporting structure.
Finally, looking at the cash movements. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations, partially offset by negative movement in working capital, mainly as a result of reduction in payment terms under the principal retail fuel supply agreement from 60 days to 30 days, as disclosed already in our Q3 2019 results. Strong cash flow generation has resulted in a very low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.26x at the end of the year as well as the cash position of approximately USD 1.3 billion.
Now let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered solid underlying results in 2019. For 2020, we are focusing to deliver on our accelerated expansion plan in both fuel and nonfuel businesses to drive profitable earnings growth and returns for our shareholders. After a 7.2% year-on-year underlying EBITDA growth in 2019, we are focused on continuing to grow EBITDA across our businesses, to pursue cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives and to maintain growth momentum.
Coming to further details on our guidance. Starting with fuel business, we are targeting to open at least 60 new stations, including a mix of traditional and ADNOC on the go stations. In Dubai, we plan to open between 20 to 25 new stations, most of which will be traditional stations. We have made good progress on the awarding of contracts for these stations, which gives us confidence in achieving our targets. We anticipate our Dubai expansion will bring market share gains and contribute to higher growth in retail fuel volumes starting in 2020.
We expect overall fuel volume growth of low single digits in 2020. Retail growth is expected to be driven by market growth, recovery of volumes and the Northern Emirates and gain in market share in Dubai. In commercial business, we have signed new contracts with our corporate clients and thus expect to sustain volume growth in 2020.
In nonfuel business, in 2020, we will accelerate our convenience store revitalization program to 100 of our stores with a focus of refurbishment and a refreshed look and feel. We will also continue to enhance and improve the overall customer experience with further improvements on category management, introduction of new fresh food and great coffee products with high margins. We will also add further enhancements to our customer-centric offerings with more benefits expected under our new loyalty program ADNOC Rewards as well as on the back of station optimization across our network, which will focus on enhancing the use of space to maximize revenue potential. For cost efficiency, in line with our previous guidance, we are targeting to realize further like-for-like OpEx savings of approximately USD 100 million over 2020 to 2023 period, of which up to USD 25 million is expected in 2020. In terms of Capex, we plan to spend USD 300 million to USD 400 million of CapEx in 2020, which is significantly higher than in 2019, reflecting our ambitious new stations delivery schedule.
For 2020, we expect to pay USD 700 million in dividend as per approved dividend policy and subject to Board and shareholder approval. Half of this dividend would be paid in October 2020, and the second half would be paid in April 2021.
Before concluding, I would like to reiterate our commitment to our shareholders. We continue to transform ADNOC Distribution into a world-class, customer-focused, commercially-driven company with a determined focus on driving profitable growth. As we sharpen our focus on customer experience and pursue growth opportunities, both domestically and internationally. We will expand all our distribution channels to reach larger market segments and sustained volume growth.
This concludes today's presentation. We are happy to take on any questions that you may have. Thank you."

Just to start one more mechanical, just running through the retail gross profit per liter in Q4 versus Q4 2018. I mean, it just indicates that the margin per liter is going down, assuming that you've booked 0 inventory gains in Q4 '19. And if I'm not mistaken, around USD 16 million in inventory losses in Q4 '18. I just want to know if I'm missing something? I mean, we should assume margin per liter should be up given that the cost of supply structure changed in November. So if you can just help me reconcile the numbers on that front? So that's the first question. The other question is on the volume growth. I mean, again, a good quarter in terms of retail volume growth on a year-over-year basis. Can we just get more clarity on the drivers of this growth? You mentioned Abu Dhabi is positive, Northern Emirates, you took market share, and Dubai is supporting. Can we get some more details in terms of the extent of growth in Abu Dhabi on a stand-alone in terms of how much market share are you gaining in Northern Emirates? And I think the most interesting out of it is, how are the Dubai stations performing in terms of throughput per station or potentially contribution to this total volume if you can disclose that? And my third question is on the working capital. It just feels that the working capital pressures continue into 2019, and this is mainly may be related to the change in the payment terms. Should we expect this trend to continue into 2020 in terms of negative working capital cash flow  on your cash flow statement? And the last one, I think the COO was quoted on Bloomberg talking about growth markets being India, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. On Saudi, is there any update on how you're looking to expand into the market, assuming that now the margin structure has changed? And keeping in mind that everyone wants to be in Saudi Arabia, including Aramco, which is now apparently doing fuel retail. So maybe your thoughts on the growth angle in Saudi? Sorry, it's lots of questions, but that's it from my end."

The second question you had on the volume was what about Abu Dhabi, what about Northern Emirates. What we can tell you is we have now seen 2 successive quarters of growth in Abu Dhabi market. So Q3 and Q4, which is encouraging. In the Northern Emirates, since the implementation of the free assisted fueling, we have seen volumes starting to grow as we gain market share. In a nutshell, the like-for-like growth actually is slight growth in pure retail volume overall, including Abu Dhabi. Regarding the question on working capital. Petri, do you want to take it?"

This once again is partly offset by the fact that our receivables due from the various related parties within the ADNOC Group have come down quite substantially towards the end. And the basic message going forward for 2020 is that we expect to have normalized our working capital cycle, both with respect to payables within the group as well as receivables. Of course, we will be working hard to bring down the receivables levels even further."

And currently in discussion with several players, including landlords and fuel operators to grow organically or through any acquisitions that we intend to make. As far as the business plan and our strategy for the Saudi market going forward, we have full clarity. So our investment proposals that I mentioned this morning, they're under review by the investment committee. Once we get the necessary approvals, we're going to make the announcement at the appropriate timing. So your other question was Saudi Aramco and Total deal, right?"

I mean, it's a very similar, I mean, beast, which is Aramco doing fuel retail with Total. And then you have also some of the existing players like ALDREES really talking about a very aggressive expansion now given that the margin structure has changed. ENOC is already there. So I just want to get your thoughts on -- I mean, how lucrative is Saudi for you? I mean, especially that you're coming from a very low base. I mean, you're still just testing the waters so far, you haven't gone into the market on a proper expansion."

Now we know what we're doing, as I said, we're in advanced stages. It's a large, fragmented market. There is much, much room for many potential competitors and as well as ourselves, of course. So it's a very underdeveloped customer offering and a lot of these players, including ourselves, are going to consolidate the market. Because the intention as to how the margin under the new margin regime is to encourage consolidation. So again, we're very, very well placed. We know that our experience and strength and the brand that we -- the brand offering as well as how we are perceived in the Saudi market, this can be leveraged to capture growth. And we can take our customer experience and offering in that market. The customers there know us well, and we're very, very confident we're going to be successful. So we've got the balance sheet strength. Once again, we're going to grow our network organically or acquire small players. We have the balance sheet to do that. But we're in discussions, proposals about to clear, hopefully, the investment committee. So soon, we're going to make some good exciting announcements."

Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to be hosting my first call with you. I humbly recognize the responsibilities placed in me to drive the business to new heights. As somebody coming from -- somebody coming in from outside ADNOC Distribution, I hope to bring fresh perspective how to create further value, placing our customers and our employees at the heart of everything we do.
In short, my 2 key objectives are driving further growth and delivering solid shareholder returns. For those who don't know my background, my expertise is in asset optimization and marketing products on an international scale in the downstream industry. I was also very much involved in a number of large-scale and successful transformation initiatives within Borouge, my former company. I'm looking forward to interacting with you in the coming months.
Today I want to run you through a solid full year performance and further progress on our growth strategy. I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. We continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions evidenced by extremely low lost time injury frequency and total reportable injury during 2019.
I will provide key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance. We saw a solid operational performance in both fuel and nonfuel businesses. Our net profit increased by 11.3% to $135 million in Q4 2019 for the first time since the IPO. In Q3 2019, we witnessed growth in retail fuel volumes, which represents around 70% of our total volumes. We saw this continue in the fourth quarter of 2019, representing a 1.2% year-on-year growth. For full year 2019, net profit increased by 4.2% to $604 million compared to 2018.
We continue to adapt to our customers' needs, offering them innovative solutions, a seamless digital experience and smart payment solutions. Our recent offering of free assisted fueling, recently unveiled innovative next-generation fuel as well as retail stations ADNOC on the go, new loyalty program ADNOC Rewards, and our next-generation ADNOC Oasis convenience store, reflect our true commitment towards our customers. These initiatives would also position us to effectively tackle competition with superior customer offering, faster, more efficient deployment to our fuel stations while optimizing Capex.
Finally, the company generated strong free cash flows of $635 million in 2019, increasing by 16.4% compared to 2018, which supports our progressive dividend policy. Our board recommended yesterday a cash dividend of $325 million or 9.55 fils per share for the second half of 2019, taking full year 2019 dividend to $650 million, a 62% increase over the previous year, demonstrating confidence in our ability to generate cash and our strong financial position.
Finally, for 2020, our priorities are creating superior customer experience and delivering on our accelerated expansion plan to drive profitable earnings growth and returns to our shareholders.
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy."

Two things I want to point out that we are focused on now: one, delivering our business strategy; and two, building long-term shareholder value through our next phase of growth. 
So first off, I'm going to start off by giving you an update on the first strategic pillar of our business, which is the fuel segment. Total fuel volumes have increased by 2% in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter of 2018. Now, this was driven by an improvement in our core Abu Dhabi market as well as market share gains in the Northern Emirates following the implementation of free assisted fueling for all our customers. We also saw an increase due to the contribution from new stations in Dubai as well as new marketing campaigns and growth in our corporate business. So throughout 2019, we introduced a series of customer-focused initiatives. All of these initiatives were introduced to enhance the overall customer experience and offer superior customer services.
So 3 marketing campaigns were launched in the summer. One was Good Morning UAE, the second one was Fuel Up & Fly Off, and the third one was Hello Summer. The intention here was to drive higher traffic to the ADNOC Distribution service stations. Now, these marketing campaigns were a huge success. They generated growth as far as retail fuel volumes. But also, they allowed us to gain really good insight into our customers' needs. So based on the feedback from this extensive customer engagement program and from our customer behavior following the 3 marketing campaigns, we began offering free assisted fueling to all our customers from the 3rd of November 2019. This has been very, very well received by our customers. It's driven growth in retail fuel volumes, which have grown by 1.2% year-on-year in Q4 2019. Now, this was in line with our guidance to the market. Q4 2019 retail fuel volumes growth reflect positive impact of free assisted fueling for 2 months. Now we expect the full benefit of volume growth to be visible starting in Q1 2020.
Coming back to our network expansion, our UAE network has now reached 382 retail fuel stations as of December 31, 2019. In 2019, we've opened 6 new stations in UAE, of which 3 were in Dubai, bringing the total number of fuel stations we operate in Dubai to 6 as of December 31, 2019.
Now in our third quarter 2019 results conference call, we indicated that our domestic network expansion would accelerate starting 2020. After obtaining necessary approvals as well as awarding construction contracts last year, we're now in a position to accelerate deployment of our network plan, as guided earlier. So in our corporate business, we also witnessed strong growth across all our products on the back of dynamic product pricing strategy as well as increase in our market share in Dubai and the Northern Emirates. On the international expansion front, our strategy is in full execution mode with the establishment of legal entities and ongoing discussions with several players. Now we will announce in due course to the market more updates in line with our commitment to best disclosure standards and regulatory compliance.
Moving onto nonfuel retail, the second pillar of our strategy. Our UAE network increased to 264 convenience stores as of 31st December 2019, with the addition of 14 new convenience stores in the UAE in 2019. Our convenience store revitalization program offers our customers a very improved shopping experience. Now, this is underway and has already started contributing to strong convenience store performance. Our convenience store gross profit increased by 20.6% year-on-year. And we also witnessed a significant uplift in average basket size by 5% in 2019 compared to 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we unveiled our next-generation ADNOC Oasis convenience store with a fresh look and feel, upgraded amenities and a family-friendly environment. The new stores also offer fresh food choices, premium coffee, an on-site bakery and convenient digital payment options. So far, we're very encouraged by positive results from our newly refurbished store.
Last but not least, I'm going to give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative, which remains the third pillar of our strategic plan. So we achieved a reduction of $46 million in like-for-like operating expenditure in 2019 compared to 2018. So during 2018 and '19, it brings the total to approximately $100 million in like-for-like operating expenditure savings. This is fully in line with our guidance to the market. In terms of capital expenditure, we've spent $138 million of CapEx in 2019, which is slightly lower than our guidance before. However, as we pointed out, we expect acceleration in CapEx in 2020, which reflects our ambitious new network delivery schedule.
So at this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance."

Good afternoon, everyone, and many thanks, Mohamed. As Ahmed already mentioned, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in Q4 as well as in 2019. Q4 net profit increased by 11.3% to USD 135 million compared to USD 121 millio",950,"Good morning. Good afternoon, everyone, and many thanks, Mohamed. As Ahmed already mentioned, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in Q4 as well as in 2019. Q4 net profit increased by 11.3% to USD 135 million compared to USD 121 million in Q4 2018. This was driven by growth in the total fuel volumes, strong results in our nonfuel business as well as successful customer initiatives and cost optimization efforts. 2019 net profit increased by 4.2% to USD 604 million compared to USD 579 million in 2018, driven by recovery in fuel volumes, growth in our corporate business, continued momentum in our nonfuel business and reduction in operating costs, which were partially offset by lower inventory gains in 2019.
The underlying EBITDA, which is measured by EBITDA excluding inventory gains in 2019 was USD 740 million, representing a 7.2% increase compared to 2018. Inventory gains, as mentioned, well over at USD 33 million compared to 2018 when we reached USD 65 million in inventory cash.
We continue to make good progress in rationalizing our Opex, achieving the USD 46 million savings in like-for-like OpEx, representing a 7.4% reduction on a like-for-like basis. On the CapEx side, in 2019, we've been focusing on defining a network expansion allocation and strategy. Our network rollout is scheduled for operational deployment in the first half of 2020 and beyond. Our CapEx in 2019 was USD 138 million. And finally, we generated very strong free cash flow, measured as EBITDA minus CapEx. Free cash flow increased by 16.4% year-on-year to USD 635 million, driven by strong cash flows from operations as well as lower CapEx.
Let me now briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for 2019. As already mentioned earlier, total fuel volumes sold increased by 0.7% compared to 2018, driven by growth in corporate and aviation fuel volumes and growth in retail fuel volumes in the second half of 2019. We are very pleased to report that we have now recorded 2 successive quarters of growth in our retail fuel volumes, which grew by 1.2% in Q4 2019. As Mohamed already pointed out, the benefits of implementing free assisted fueling are not fully reflected in Q4 2019, as this decision only came into the effect on 3rd of November, i.e., for less than 2 months of the quarter. Our core retail market here in Abu Dhabi continued to show growth, while we also gained market share in the Northern Emirates as well as in Dubai.
On the Corporate segment side, volumes increased in 2019 by 6% compared to '18, driven by higher sales of diesel, LPG, lubricants and base oils. Our Aviation segment volumes sold to strategic customers increased by 3.8% compared to 2018. And finally, in the nonfuel business, as mentioned, we continue to see very good momentum throughout the year with strong increase in transactions as well as an uplift in average basket size.
Now let me make a few comments and remarks on gross profit performance by segment. Fuel retail gross profit decreased in 2019 by 5.9%, driven by lower volumes as well as lower inventory gains, as mentioned. However, retail fuel volumes started to grow beginning Q3. And fuel retail gross profit increased by 6.7% in Q4 compared to Q4 2018. This was also a result of higher margins following the renegotiation of our fuel supply contract effective November 2019. As we see a continued pickup in volumes in 2020, we are expecting to see further improvement in retail fuel gross profit.
Gross profit for nonfuel retail, mainly C-stores or convenience stores, continued to show strong momentum and increased by 11.8% year-on-year in 2019. This is reflecting our diversification strategy towards nonfuel retail as well as implementation of new initiatives to improve customer shopping experience including also a much more focused stores revitalization program.
In the Corporate segment, gross profit increased by 10.8% year-on-year on the back of the increase in volumes as well as higher margins. And finally, aviation gross profit decreased by 2.7% year-on-year.
Moving onto EBITDA per segment. Our Retail segment EBITDA increased by 3.4%, mainly driven by higher operating efficiencies as well as better nonfuel performance despite the lower volumes as well as lower inventory gains, as mentioned. In the Corporate segment, EBITDA increased by 10.2% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes, margins as well as cost efficiency. I'd like to note that Corporate segment EBITDA actually declined in Q4 despite higher gross profit. This was mainly due to the presence of one-off receivables recovery that we recovered in Q4 2018. Aviation EBITDA increased by 7.7%, driven by higher cost efficiencies.
At this point in time, I would also like to highlight that from Q1 2020 onwards, we will introduce new segment reporting structure, which is based on a natural categorization of our business into 2 buckets of retail B2C as well as commercial B2B segments. As a reference, we've included as an appendix to the 2019 management discussion and analysis report, the quarterly as well as full year results of 2019 as per the new segment reporting structure.
Finally, looking at the cash movements. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations, partially offset by negative movement in working capital, mainly as a result of reduction in payment terms under the principal retail fuel supply agreement from 60 days to 30 days, as disclosed already in our Q3 2019 results. Strong cash flow generation has resulted in a very low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.26x at the end of the year as well as a cash position of approximately USD 1.3 billion.
Now let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered solid underlying results in 2019. For 2020, we are focusing to deliver on our accelerated expansion plan in both fuel and nonfuel businesses to drive profitable earnings growth and returns for our shareholders. After a 7.2% year-on-year underlying EBITDA growth in 2019, we are focused on continuing to grow EBITDA across our businesses, to pursue cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives and to maintain growth momentum.
Coming to further details on our guidance. Starting with fuel business, we are targeting to open at least 60 new stations, including a mix of traditional and ADNOC on the go stations. In Dubai, we plan to open between 20 to 25 new stations, most of which will be traditional stations. We have made good progress on the awarding of contracts for these stations, which gives us confidence in achieving our targets. We anticipate our Dubai expansion will bring market share gains and contribute to higher growth in retail fuel volumes starting in 2020.
We expect overall fuel volume growth of low single digits in 2020. Retail growth is expected to be driven by market growth, recovery of volumes in the Northern Emirates and gain in market share in Dubai. In commercial business, we have signed new contracts with our corporate clients and thus expect to sustain volume growth in 2020.
In nonfuel business, in 2020, we will accelerate our convenience store revitalization program to 100 of our stores with a focus of refurbishment and a refreshed look and feel. We will also continue to enhance and improve the overall customer experience with further improvements on category management, introduction of new fresh food and great coffee products with high margins. We will also add further enhancements to our customer-centric offerings with more benefits expected under our new loyalty program ADNOC Rewards as well as on the back of station optimization across our network, which will focus on enhancing the use of space to maximize revenue potential. For cost efficiency, in line with our previous guidance, we are targeting to realize further like-for-like OpEx savings of approximately USD 100 million over 2020 to 2023 period, of which up to USD 25 million is expected in 2020. In terms of Capex, we plan to spend USD 300 million to USD 400 million of CapEx in 2020, which is significantly higher than in 2019, reflecting our ambitious new stations delivery schedule.
For 2020, we expect to pay USD 700 million in dividends as per approved dividend policy and subject to Board and shareholder approval. Half of this dividend would be paid in October 2020 and the second half would be paid in April 2021.
Before concluding, I would like to reiterate our commitment to our shareholders. We continue to transform ADNOC Distribution into a world-class, customer-focused, commercially-driven company with a determined focus on driving profitable growth. As we sharpen our focus on customer experience and pursue growth opportunities, both domestically and internationally, we will expand all our distribution channels to reach larger market segments and sustained volume growth.
This concludes today's presentation. We are happy to take on any questions that you may have. Thank you."

Just to start one more mechanical, just running through the retail gross profit per liter in Q4 versus Q4 2018. I mean, it just indicates that the margin per liter is going down, assuming that you've booked 0 inventory gains in Q4 '19. And if I'm not mistaken, around USD 16 million in inventory losses in Q4 '18. I just want to know if I'm missing something? I mean, we should assume margin per liter should be up given that the cost of supply structure changed in November. So if you can just help me reconcile the numbers on that front? So that's the first question.
The other question is on the volume growth. I mean, again, a good quarter in terms of retail volume growth on a year-over-year basis. Can we just get more clarity on the drivers of this growth? You mentioned Abu Dhabi is positive, Northern Emirates, you took market share, and Dubai is supporting. Can we get some more details in terms of the extent of growth in Abu Dhabi on a stand-alone in terms of how much market share are you gaining in Northern Emirates? And I think the most interesting out of it is, how are the Dubai stations performing in terms of throughput per station or potentially contribution to this total volume, if you can disclose that?
And my third question is on the working capital. It just feels that the working capital pressures continue into 2019, and this is mainly maybe related to the change in the payment terms. Should we expect this trend to continue into 2020 in terms of negative working capital cash flow on your cash flow statement? And the last one, I think the COO was quoted on Bloomberg talking about growth markets being India, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. On Saudi, is there any update on how you're looking to expand into the market, assuming that now the margin structure has changed? And keeping in mind that everyone wants to be in Saudi Arabia, including Aramco, which is now apparently doing fuel retail. So maybe your thoughts on the growth angle in Saudi? Sorry, it's lots of questions, but that's it from my end."

The second question you had on the volume was what about Abu Dhabi? What about Northern Emirates? What we can tell you is we have now seen 2 successive quarters of growth in Abu Dhabi market. So Q3 and Q4, which is encouraging. In the Northern Emirates, since the implementation of the free assisted fueling, we have seen volumes starting to grow as we gain market share.

This once again is partly offset by the fact that our receivables due from the various related parties within the ADNOC Group have come down quite substantially towards the end. And the basic message going forward for 2020 is that we expect to have normalized our working capital cycle, both with respect to payables within the group as well as receivables. Of course, we will be working hard to bring down the receivables levels even further."

So under this new regime, the IRR that we expect from expansion into Saudi is expected to clear a minimum hurdle rate of 15%.

So it's a very underdeveloped customer offering and a lot of these players, including ourselves, are going to consolidate the market, because the intention as to how the margin under the new margin regime is to encourage consolidation. So again, we're very, very well placed. We know that our experience and strength and the brand that we -- the brand offering as well as how we are perceived in the Saudi market, this can be leveraged to capture growth. And we can take our customer experience and offering in that market. The customers there know us well, and we're very, very confident we're going to be successful. So we've got the balance sheet strength. Once again, we're going to grow our network organically or acquire small players. We have the balance sheet to do that.

And you're planning quite a hefty amount of CapEx this year. I would appreciate some color on how to think about the relationship there."

We have no problem whatsoever in terms of more optimal capital structure, which would point to a higher leverage. I would like to remind everyone about our thoughts at IPO when we communicated that on a longer-term basis, 1.5 to 2x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio seems a bit more optimum in a business where we have strong underlying market share, predictable cash flows and a very strong market position that we are leveraging. We have access to funding facilities as well. So funding really is not an issue that we see as such."

As somebody coming from -- somebody coming in from outside ADNOC Distribution, I hope to bring fresh perspective how to create further value, placing our customers and our employees at the heart of everything we do.
In short, my 2 key objectives are driving further growth and delivering solid shareholder returns. For those who don't know my background, my expertise is in asset optimization and marketing products on an international scale in the downstream industry. I was also very much involved in a number of large-scale and successful transformation initiatives within Borouge, my former company. I'm looking forward to interacting with you in the coming months.
Today I want to run you through a solid full year performance and further progress on our growth strategy. I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. We continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions evidenced by extremely low lost time injury frequency and total reportable injury during 2019.
I will provide key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance. We saw a solid operational performance in both fuel and nonfuel businesses. Our net profit increased by 11.3% to $135 million in Q4 2019 for the first time since the IPO. In Q3 2019, we witnessed growth in retail fuel volumes, which represents around 70% of our total volumes. We saw this continue in the fourth quarter of 2019, representing a 1.2% year-on-year growth. For full year 2019, net profit increased by 4.2% to $604 million compared to 2018.
We continue to adapt to our customers' needs, offering them innovative solutions, a seamless digital experience and smart payment solutions. Our recent offering of free assisted fueling, recently unveiled innovative next-generation fuel as well as retail stations ADNOC on the go, new loyalty program ADNOC Rewards, and our next-generation ADNOC Oasis convenience store, reflect our true commitment towards our customers. These initiatives would also position us to effectively tackle competition with superior customer offering, faster, more efficient deployment to our fuel stations while optimizing Capex.
Finally, the company generated strong free cash flows of $635 million in 2019, increasing by 16.4% compared to 2018, which supports our progressive dividend policy. Our board recommended yesterday a cash dividend of $325 million or 9.55 fils per share for the second half of 2019, taking full year 2019 dividend to $650 million, a 62% increase over the previous year, demonstrating confidence in our ability to generate cash and our strong financial position.
Finally, for 2020, our priorities are creating superior customer experience and delivering on our accelerated expansion plan to drive profitable earnings growth and returns to our shareholders.
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy."

Two things I want to point out that we are focused on now: one, delivering our business strategy; and two, building long-term shareholder value through our next phase of growth. 
So first off, I'm going to start off by giving you an update on the first strategic pillar of our business, which is the fuel segment. Total fuel volumes have increased by 2% in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter of 2018. Now, this was driven by an improvement in our core Abu Dhabi market as well as market share gains in the Northern Emirates following the implementation of free assisted fueling for all our customers. We also saw an increase due to the contribution from new stations in Dubai as well as new marketing campaigns and growth in our corporate business. So throughout 2019, we introduced a series of customer-focused initiatives. All of these initiatives were introduced to enhance the overall customer experience and offer superior customer services.
So 3 marketing campaigns were launched in the summer. One was Good Morning UAE, the second one was Fuel Up & Fly Off, and the third one was Hello Summer. The intention here was to drive higher traffic to the ADNOC Distribution service stations. Now, these marketing campaigns were a huge success. They generated growth as far as retail fuel volumes. But also, they allowed us to gain really good insight into our customers' needs. So based on the feedback from this extensive customer engagement program and from our customer behavior following the 3 marketing campaigns, we began offering free assisted fueling to all our customers from the 3rd of November 2019. This has been very, very well received by our customers. It's driven growth in retail fuel volumes, which have grown by 1.2% year-on-year in Q4 2019. Now, this was in line with our guidance to the market. Q4 2019 retail fuel volumes growth reflect positive impact of free assisted fueling for 2 months. Now we expect the full benefit of volume growth to be visible starting in Q1 2020.
Coming back to our network expansion, our UAE network has now reached 382 retail fuel stations as of December 31, 2019. In 2019, we've opened 6 new stations in UAE, of which 3 were in Dubai, bringing the total number of fuel stations we operate in Dubai to 6 as of December 31, 2019.
Now in our third quarter 2019 results conference call, we indicated that our domestic network expansion would accelerate starting 2020. After obtaining necessary approvals as well as awarding construction contracts last year, we're now in a position to accelerate deployment of our network plan, as guided earlier. So in our corporate business, we also witnessed strong growth across all our products on the back of dynamic product pricing strategy as well as increase in our market share in Dubai and the Northern Emirates. On the international expansion front, our strategy is in full execution mode with the establishment of legal entities and ongoing discussions with several players. Now we will announce in due course to the market more updates in line with our commitment to best disclosure standards and regulatory compliance.
Moving onto nonfuel retail, the second pillar of our strategy. Our UAE network increased to 264 convenience stores as of 31st December 2019, with the addition of 14 new convenience stores in the UAE in 2019. Our convenience store revitalization program offers our customers a very improved shopping experience. Now, this is underway and has already started contributing to strong convenience store performance. Our convenience store gross profit increased by 20.6% year-on-year. And we also witnessed a significant uplift in average basket size by 5% in 2019 compared to 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we unveiled our next-generation ADNOC Oasis convenience store with a fresh look and feel, upgraded amenities and a family-friendly environment. The new stores also offer fresh food choices, premium coffee, an on-site bakery and convenient digital payment options. So far, we're very encouraged by positive results from our newly refurbished store.
Last but not least, I'm going to give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative, which remains the third pillar of our strategic plan. So we achieved a reduction of $46 million in like-for-like operating expenditure in 2019 compared to 2018. So during 2018 and '19, it brings the total to approximately $100 million in like-for-like operating expenditure savings. This is fully in line with our guidance to the market. In terms of capital expenditure, we've spent $138 million of CapEx in 2019, which is slightly lower than our guidance before. However, as we pointed out, we expect acceleration in CapEx in 2020, which reflects our ambitious new network delivery schedule.
So at this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance."

As Ahmed already mentioned, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in Q4 as well as in 2019. Q4 net profit increased by 11.3% to USD 135 million compared to USD 121 million in Q4 2018. This was driven by growth in the total fuel volumes, strong results in our nonfuel business as well as successful customer initiatives and cost optimization efforts. 2019 net profit increased by 4.2% to USD 604 million compared to USD 579 million in 2018, driven by recovery in fuel volumes, growth in our corporate business, continued momentum in our nonfuel business and reduction in operating costs, which were partially offset by lower inventory gains in 2019.
The underlying EBITDA, which is measured by EBITDA excluding inventory gains in 2019 was USD 740 million, representing a 7.2% increase compared to 2018. Inventory gains, as mentioned, well over at USD 33 million compared to 2018 when we reached USD 65 million in inventory cash.
We continue to make good progress in rationalizing our OpEx, achieving the USD 46 million savings in like-for-like OpEx, representing a 7.4% reduction on a like-for-like basis. On the CapEx side, in 2019, we've been focusing on defining a network expansion allocation and strategy. Our network rollout is scheduled for operational deployment in the first half of 2020 and beyond. Our CapEx in 2019 was USD 138 million. And finally, we generated very strong free cash flow, measured as EBITDA minus CapEx. Free cash flow increased by 16.4% year-on-year to USD 635 million, driven by strong cash flows from operations as well as lower CapEx.
Let me now briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for 2019. As already mentioned earlier, total fuel volumes sold increased by 0.7% compared to 2018, driven by growth in corporate and aviation fuel volumes and growth in retail fuel volumes in the second half of 2019. We are very pleased to report that we have now recorded 2 successive quarters of growth in our retail fuel volumes, which grew by 1.2% in Q4 2019. As Mohamed already pointed out, the benefits of implementing free assisted fueling are not fully reflected in Q4 2019, as this decision only came into the effect on 3rd of November, i.e., for less than 2 months of the quarter. Our core retail market here in Abu Dhabi continued to show growth, while we also gained market share in the Northern Emirates as well as in Dubai.
On the Corporate segment side, volumes increased in 2019 by 6% compared to '18, driven by higher sales of diesel, LPG, lubricants and base oils. Our Aviation segment volumes sold to strategic customers increased by 3.8% compared to 2018. And finally, in the nonfuel business, as mentioned, we continue to see very good momentum throughout the year with strong increase in transactions as well as an uplift in average basket size.
Now let me make a few comments and remarks on gross profit performance by segment. Fuel retail gross profit decreased in 2019 by 5.9%, driven by lower volumes as well as lower inventory gains, as mentioned. However, retail fuel volumes started to grow beginning Q3. And fuel retail gross profit increased by 6.7% in Q4 compared to Q4 2018. This was also a result of higher margins following the renegotiation of our fuel supply contract effective November 2019. As we see a continued pickup in volumes in 2020, we are expecting to see further improvement in retail fuel gross profit.
Gross profit for nonfuel retail, mainly C-stores or convenience stores, continued to show strong momentum and increased by 11.8% year-on-year in 2019. This is reflecting our diversification strategy towards nonfuel retail as well as implementation of new initiatives to improve customer shopping experience including also a much more focused stores revitalization program.
In the Corporate segment, gross profit increased by 10.8% year-on-year on the back of the increase in volumes as well as higher margins. And finally, aviation gross profit decreased by 2.7% year-on-year.
Moving onto EBITDA per segment. Our Retail segment EBITDA increased by 3.4%, mainly driven by higher operating efficiencies as well as better nonfuel performance despite the lower volumes as well as lower inventory gains, as mentioned. In the Corporate segment, EBITDA increased by 10.2% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes, margins as well as cost efficiency. I'd like to note that Corporate segment EBITDA actually declined in Q4 despite higher gross profit. This was mainly due to the presence of one-off receivables recovery that we recovered in Q4 2018. Aviation EBITDA increased by 7.7%, driven by higher cost efficiencies.
At this point in time, I would also like to highlight that from Q1 2020 onwards, we will introduce new segment reporting structure, which is based on a natural categorization of our business into 2 buckets of retail B2C as well as commercial B2B segments. As a reference, we've included as an appendix to the 2019 management discussion and analysis report, the quarterly as well as full year results of 2019 as per the new segment reporting structure.
Finally, looking at the cash movements. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations, partially offset by negative movement in working capital, mainly as a result of reduction in payment terms under the principal retail fuel supply agreement from 60 days to 30 days, as disclosed already in our Q3 2019 results. Strong cash flow generation has resulted in a very low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.26x at the end of the year as well as a cash position of approximately USD 1.3 billion.
Now let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered solid underlying results in 2019. For 2020, we are focusing to deliver on our accelerated expansion plan in both fuel and nonfuel businesses to drive profitable earnings growth and returns for our shareholders. After a 7.2% year-on-year underlying EBITDA growth in 2019, we are focused on continuing to grow EBITDA across our businesses, to pursue cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives and to maintain growth momentum.
Coming to further details on our guidance. Starting with fuel business, we are targeting to open at least 60 new stations, including a mix of traditional and ADNOC on the go stations. In Dubai, we plan to open between 20 to 25 new stations, most of which will be traditional stations. We have made good progress on the awarding of contracts for these stations, which gives us confidence in achieving our targets. We anticipate our Dubai expansion will bring market share gains and contribute to higher growth in retail fuel volumes starting in 2020.
We expect overall fuel volume growth of low single digits in 2020. Retail growth is expected to be driven by market growth, recovery of volumes in the Northern Emirates and gain in market share in Dubai. In commercial business, we have signed new contracts with our corporate clients and thus expect to sustain volume growth in 2020.
In nonfuel business, in 2020, we will accelerate our convenience store revitalization program to 100 of our stores with a focus of refurbishment and a refreshed look and feel. We will also continue to enhance and improve the overall customer experience with further improvements on category management, introduction of new fresh food and great coffee products with high margins. We will also add further enhancements to our customer-centric offerings with more benefits expected under our new loyalty program ADNOC Rewards as well as on the back of station optimization across our network, which will focus on enhancing the use of space to maximize revenue potential. For cost efficiency, in line with our previous guidance, we are targeting to realize further like-for-like OpEx savings of approximately USD 100 million over 2020 to 2023 period, of which up to USD 25 million is expected in 2020. In terms of Capex, we plan to spend USD 300 million to USD 400 million of CapEx in 2020, which is significantly higher than in 2019, reflecting our ambitious new stations delivery schedule.
For 2020, we expect to pay USD 700 million in dividends as per approved dividend policy and subject to Board and shareholder approval. Half of this dividend would be paid in October 2020 and the second half would be paid in April 2021.
Before concluding, I would like to reiterate our commitment to our shareholders. We continue to transform ADNOC Distribution into a world-class, customer-focused, commercially-driven company with a determined focus on driving profitable growth. As we sharpen our focus on customer experience and pursue growth opportunities, both domestically and internationally, we will expand all our distribution channels to reach larger market segments and sustained volume growth.
This concludes today's presentation. We are happy to take on any questions that you may have. Thank you."

Just to start one more mechanical, just running through the retail gross profit per liter in Q4 versus Q4 2018. I mean, it just indicates that the margin per liter is going down, assuming that you've booked 0 inventory gains in Q4 '19. And if I'm not mistaken, around USD 16 million in inventory losses in Q4 '18. I just want to know if I'm missing something. I mean we should assume margin per liter should be up given that the cost of supply structure changed in November. So if you can just help me reconcile the numbers on that front? So that's the first question.
The other question is on the volume growth. I mean, again, a good quarter in terms of retail volume growth on a year-over-year basis. Can we just get more clarity on the drivers of this growth? You mentioned Abu Dhabi is positive, Northern Emirates, you took market share, and Dubai is supporting. Can we get some more details in terms of the extent of growth in Abu Dhabi on a stand-alone in terms of how much market share are you gaining in Northern Emirates? And I think the most interesting out of it is, how are the Dubai stations performing in terms of throughput per station or potentially contribution to this total volume, if you can disclose that?
And my third question is on the working capital. It just feels that the working capital pressures continue into 2019, and this is mainly maybe related to the change in the payment terms. Should we expect this trend to continue into 2020 in terms of negative working capital cash flow on your cash flow statement? And the last one, I think the COO was quoted on Bloomberg talking about growth markets being India, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. On Saudi, is there any update on how you're looking to expand into the market, assuming that now the margin structure has changed? And keeping in mind that everyone wants to be in Saudi Arabia, including Aramco, which is now apparently doing fuel retail. So maybe your thoughts on the growth angle in Saudi? Sorry, it's lots of questions, but that's it from my end."

The second question you had on the volume was what about Abu Dhabi? What about Northern Emirates? What we can tell you is we have now seen 2 successive quarters of growth in Abu Dhabi market. So Q3 and Q4, which is encouraging. In the Northern Emirates, since the implementation of the free assisted fueling, we have seen volumes starting to grow as we gain market share. In a nutshell, the like-for-like growth actually is slight growth in pure retail volume overall, including Abu Dhabi."

This once again is partly offset by the fact that our receivables due from the various related parties within the ADNOC Group have come down quite substantially towards the end. And the basic message going forward for 2020 is that we expect to have normalized our working capital cycle, both with respect to payables within the group as well as receivables. Of course, we will be working hard to bring down the receivables levels even further."

So again, we're very, very well placed. We know that our experience and strength and the brand that we -- the brand offering as well as how we are perceived in the Saudi market, this can be leveraged to capture growth. And we can take our customer experience and offering in that market. The customers there know us well, and we're very, very confident we're going to be successful.

In",578,"Thank you, Athmane, and good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
Before we take you through our first quarter results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. In Q1 2020, we have shown strength and agility as a business. We have taken and will continue to take every step to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our employees and our customers, which includes daily cleaning of sites and providing personal protected equipment to our front-line colleagues. During this period, we have strengthened our focus and understanding customers' needs by engaging with them and staying connected. We were quick to adapt our products and services to the evolving situation and took this as an opportunity to accelerate our digital transformation strategy. We widened our portfolio of services, such as enhancing contactless payment technology, a new low-cost grocery essentials range at our ADNOC Oasis stores, online home delivery for more than 1,000 of our Oasis products. Mobile fuel delivery services and complementary car interior sanitization with every auto carwash.
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first quarter and outlook for 2020. Despite the challenging operating environment and the uncertainties ahead, our core business fundamentals remain robust and resilient, and we are well in place to navigate the current times. The company has demonstrated resilience in Q1 2020, with underlying EBITDA, excluding inventory movements and one-offs, increasing by 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Adjusting for one-offs, which Petri will talk about in details while discussing financial performance. The company's earnings showed growth despite impact of COVID-19 in the month of March. Cash flow generation remains strong, during the quarter, and the company maintained a strong financial position at the end of March 2020, with ample liquidity to help weather the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments. We also remain focused on our business strategy of smart growth and bringing further efficiencies in our operations.
For the full year 2020, we expect to attend 50 to 60 new stations in the UAE. We have assessed the impact of COVID-19 on our business plan and capital structure. We maintain our CapEx guidance of $300 million to $400 million in 2020, reiterating our commitment to deliver smart growth beyond 2020 and offer best-in-class services to our customers. We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. Our focus is to ensure CapEx is allocated more efficiently towards our growth and value assertive Dubai expansion. We are, therefore, targeting 20 to 25 new stations in Dubai, the majority of which will be traditional stations.
Delivering on our international expansion also remains integral to our ambitious smart growth strategy. We continue to assess potential opportunities to achieve disciplined growth and operational success, while targeting the highest return on investment.
In our nonfuel business, we remain focused on providing superior customer experience, and we'll continue with our convenience store revitalization program. As a company, we are always looking to optimize our cost base. Ensuring our margins and cash flows remain healthy. Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive, long-term shareholders returns, underpinned by a progressive dividend policy, smart growth and supported by strong balance sheet. For 2020, company's dividend policy asset continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to Board and shareholders' approval.
I will now hand over to Mohamed for an update on our strategy. Thank you."

First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes",1587,"Thank you, Ahmed. First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.
In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes we've sold has decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Commercial fuel volumes, on the other hand, remained stable year-on-year. Retail fuel volumes declined by 1.9% compared to the same period last year. Despite growth acceleration in the first 2 months of 2020. But this was mainly due to the business impact of COVID-19 in the month of March. Our school, retail malls and offices have started to close starting in the month of March, we saw an impact on demand. And we saw that impact in both fuel and nonfuel sales. So the full impact of the COVID-19 restrictions became apparent in the month of April. This is when our retail fuel sales volume declined by around 40%.
Commercial fuel sales volume in the month of April declined by around 20%. So despite this decline in volumes in the short term, we do expect the impact on our EBITDA to be partially mitigated. Now this is on account of various initiatives that we've undertaken, like widening our portfolio of services, optimizing our operating expenditure as well as the port we've received due to the higher retail fuel margin in the short term. The retail pump prices for the months of April and May 2020 have not dropped in line with crude oil prices.  
So despite the challenging operating environment, we continue to deliver on our growth strategy. We've opened 7 new stations in the first quarter of 2020 and 3 additional stations in the month of April. So of the 10 new stations that we opened in the UAE across the UAE in April alone, 5 of these were in Dubai. So total number of fuel stations we now operate in Dubai is 11. Now as part of our drive to effectively tackle competition with faster and more efficient deployment of our fuel stations and while also optimizing our capital expenditure, we also opened our first 5 ADNOC on the go neighborhood service stations in Abu Dhabi as of April 2020.
So I'd like to give you a brief update -- further update on the construction progress of our new stations. New stations that we were expecting to open during the first half of 2020 are now in advanced stages of completion from a construction standpoint. However, the COVID-19 situation has reduced our productivity of the labor at these sites, given the mobility restrictions of our labor. This would also have an impact on our ability to make these stations fully operational in time. So we now expect to open around 15 additional stations by the first half of 2020. And these stations under progress, under construction at the moment have achieved an average completion rate of around 75%. So this makes us very confident in achieving our target. While some of these stations, we expect it to be operational during the first half of 2020, have now been pushed back to the second half of 2020. We still expect to open 50 to 60 new stations in 2020. This is, of course, versus the 60 stations that we guided to earlier.
As we continue to innovate and seek new ways to grow our fuels business, we've also extended our current B2B mobile fuel delivery services that we call My Station. We've extended this to retail customers in select areas of Abu Dabi. We've already deployed about 8 trailers and 22 trucks to provide effectively on demand fuel delivery to serve our large customers as part of our growth plan, and our commitment to providing our customers with a fast and reliable fueling service.
In addition to the 30 mobile assets that serve our B2B business, we continue to see opportunities to grow our mobile fuel delivery service in both B2B and B2C segment. So we've got 15 new trucks that are set to join our existing fleet during 2020. We will continue to explore options to further expand this service to enhance their overall customer experience, whether that's B2B or B2C.
Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy. We're in various stages of discussions with several players in different markets to expand organically as well as pursuing inorganic opportunities. Obviously, the ongoing travel restriction could impact the overall timing of concluding these discussions. So we will announce further updates at an appropriate time.
Moving on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience store network increased to 269 in March as of end of March 2020. So we've added 5 new convenient stores in the UAE during Q1 2020. Our focus on category management contributed to an increase in average gross par asset size by 12% year-on-year in Q1 2020. Our convenience store revitalization program that we introduced to you the last time was expected to pick up pace starting early Q2 2020. However, given the current COVID-19 situation and safety restrictions that are in place, we are now targeting 40 to 50 convenience stores to be refurbished in 2020, based over the rest of the year.
Also, we are accelerating our digital transformation strategy, particularly in response to the current pandemic, which has evolved the needs of our customers, thereby enhancing the company's position as the best-in-class fuel and convenience retailer. 
[Audio Gap] 
a key element of it. A key element of our digital transformation strategy has been providing customers with a seamless digital experience and activating advanced mobile pay technology, which allows our customers totally contactless, refueling and payments. As a result, we saw significant uptick in the ADNOC Distribution Wallet users. This increased by more than 100,000 users in the first quarter of the year. So now the total stands at approximately 730,000 users. So obviously, we're going to continue to focus with the aim to further grow our ADNOC Wallet user base, which will allow us to deliver targeted promotional offers to our users, to our customers. Thereby increasing customer loyalty.
In the second quarter of 2020, also, we will introduce a new point base system to our ADNOC Rewards loyalty program. This will enable our customers to enable points against ADNOC Oasis convenience store products as well as the various services in the ADNOC distribution stations.
Now we've also responded to new social distancing measures by launching a new essential product range in our convenience stores. This includes fresh food, household and health care products at a low-cost to help customers across the UAE. At a low cost. More recently, we also launched an online home delivery service of more than 1,000 products from the Oasis convenience store. This includes groceries. This includes hot beverages. Ultimately, our aim is for the convenience and safety of our customers, particularly during the ongoing pandemic. As a service is already proving popular. We've seen an increase in basket size for the participating stores. So stores, which have participated in the online home delivery service, the basket size has gone up quite significantly.
We've also currently piloted this team in 12 of our stores. So far, the results are very encouraging, and the customer feedback is very positive. So we see a great opportunity in our recently launched online food and grocery delivery service from our ADNOC Oasis convenience stores. Now we're expecting we hope to expand the service to more convenience stores by the end of this year. We're confident that we will because this supports our ambition of sustaining strong growth in our nonfuel offering.
Finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative. That is, of course, the third pillar of our strategic plan. Now during the first quarter of 2020, there was an increase in like-for-like operating expenditure by USD 4 million compared to Q1 2019. Now this increase was mainly due to an increase in maintenance as well as smart technology utilities costs. In addition, total operating expenditure also increased due to the cost of additional staff to implement the free assisted fueling, given that we have completely dropped the Flex initiative. So this was in line with our guidance and pertaining to our growth and new stations operating expenditure. So we remain focused on accelerating delivery of our cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives. We are now moving in the process of moving to a more efficient and effective retail site operating model. This allows us to focus on staffing optimization as well as staff redeployment leading to a like-for-like reduction in full-time employees per station.
We are also accelerating operating efficiency as well as the asset optimization initiatives across our network. In light of those initiatives, we will reiterate our target of like-for-like OpEx savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020. Now in line with our guidance and plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we've spent $50 million during the first quarter of the year. Now this is much higher than the Q1 2019 capital expenditure of USD 13 million. This, of course, reiterates our commitment to deliver growth beyond 2020, while providing best-in-class services to our customers.
Of course, we will continue to improve CapEx efficiency, including the rollout of Flex capital-intensive station format, such as ADNOC on the go and My Station.
At this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, from my side as well. As stated by Ahmed and Mohamed, we've delivered a resilient financial and operational performance during the first quarter despite the challenging operating environment.",1069,"Many thanks, Mohamed. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, from my side as well. As stated by Ahmed and Mohamed, we've delivered a resilient financial and operational performance during the first quarter despite the challenging operating environment.
Q1 2020 revenue increased by 3.6% compared to last year, driven by an increase in fuel retail revenues. This was, of course, as a result of higher pump prices and higher corporate volumes, partially offset by lower volumes in our retail and Aviation businesses as well as lower nonfuel retail revenues. Q2 2020 gross profit is at USD 302 million, representing a decrease of 3.1% compared to last year. Fuel retail business posted a strong operating performance. However, total gross profit for the first quarter was negatively impacted by USD 16 million due to inventory losses and other one-offs in the commercial business, whereas last year, first quarter included one-off recoveries of $15 million at gross profit level. So when excluding these inventory losses and one-offs, Q1 2020 total gross profit grew at 7.1% compared to last year.
First quarter EBITDA was USD 151 million, representing a decrease of 24.1% over Q1 '19. Reported EBITDA was negatively impacted by a total of USD 20 million in Q1 2020 due to inventory losses as well as prudent provisioning on trade receivables and other one-offs, whereas last year, was benefiting from one-off reversals of prior period accruals as well as recoveries totaling $36 million. Hence, our underlying EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA excluding inventory losses as well as one-offs, remained resilient with a growth of 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Net profit for the first quarter is at USD 109 million, declining by 30.9% compared to last year. And once again, mainly due to the inventory losses as well as one-off losses for the first quarter as well as due to the presence of the one-off gains I mentioned for Q1 last year. However, adjusting for the sale elements, we've reported earnings at 6% up despite the business impact of COVID-19 for the month of March. And finally, cash generation remained strong, with free cash flow of USD 145 million for the first quarter.
Okay. Let me now briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for the first quarter. Total fuel volumes decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of last year. This is mainly as a result of the business impact of COVID-19 in March. However, in the period prior to COVID-19, we actually saw higher year-on-year growth compared to Q3 as well as Q4 of 2019. Our commercial fuel volumes were up marginally, 5.1% year-on-year, driven by an increase in Corporate volumes by 1.9%, and partially offset by a decrease of 4.9% in Aviation volumes sold to our strategic customers in the first quarter.
In the nonfuel business, transactions decreased by 17.1% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of vouchers after implementing free assisted fueling. As Mohamed mentioned, this was effective November 2019 as well as the impact of COVID-19 once again in the month of March. However, average gross basket size has increased by 12% year-on-year, driven by improvement in category management and also as a result of the COVID-19 once again with customers visiting less frequently, but spending more during each visit.
I'm now moving on to talk about gross profit performance by segment. Firstly, let me also highlight and remind that effective with this first quarter 2020, we've implemented new segment reporting structure, which is based on natural categorization of our businesses into 2 buckets of retail or B2C and commercial B2B segments. First quarter retail segment gross profit increased by 9.5% driven by fuel retail business. Fuel retail business posted a strong operating performance with gross profit growth of 13.1% year-on-year. And this is on the back of higher retail fuel margins. Reduction impact from the cost following renegotiation of our fuel supply contract effective last November as well as higher retail volumes during the first 2 months of the year. Our nonfuel gross profit in the retail decreased by 7.5% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of the voucher redemption I already mentioned as a result of implementing free assisted fueling, together with the impact from COVID-19 in March.
Commercial business performance was negatively impacted by USD 16 million at gross profit level. This is due to the revaluation of our inventory. Our stock at the end of March, USD 10 million following lower oil prices as well as one-off items of $6 million. Whereas in Q1 2019, we had one-off recoveries of USD 15 million. Excluding the inventory losses and one-offs for the Commercial business, commercial gross profit would have grown by 1.6% year-on-year.
And moving on to EBITDA per segment. Q1 retail EBITDA declined due to the lower fuel volumes as well as the additional cost of staff to implement the free assisted fueling and the OpEx related to new stations and, of course, due to the presence of OpEx reversals, I mentioned in Q1 2019. For commercial EBITDA declined due to the lower aviation volumes, inventory losses. And once again, the one-offs in Q1 2020, whereas we had one-off recoveries present in Q1 2019.
And finally, a few comments about our cash flow and the capital structure. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to stable cash flows as well as positive working capital movements. Working capital requirement reduced as a result of decrease in rate receivables as well as in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in trade payables, given the big swings in oil prices and the decline in our volumes towards the end of the quarter.
As of 31st of March, we have a very strong liquidity position of USD 2.2 billion in the form of $1.4 billion in cash. And then we have a revolving unutilized credit facility of USD 750 million. And our existing term debt is maturing at the end of 2022 with no covenants in place. As a result, the balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x as of 31st of March. However, when adjusting for the final dividend that got paid early days of April, the adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 0.55x. Strong as such at the end of March 2020.
Now let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered resilience underlying results in Q1 2020. While demand for fuel and nonfuel products may take time to recover to normalized levels, we expect decline in volumes to be partially offset by various management initiatives. And higher retail volume margin in the short term.
As retail pump prices for the months of April and May have remained comparatively high despite drop in crude oil prices. Our ability in managing our capital expenditures and cost base as well as our diverse product platform and strong balance sheet provide us with an important flexibility to respond in this volatile operating environment. We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans in a disciplined manner as well as delivering an enhanced customer experience. Both of which are expected to drive future earnings growth.
We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. We remain confident that we will responsibly manage the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments.
This concludes today's presentation. We are happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you."

In terms of forward-looking and going forward, we cannot really make any estimates or forecast for how long, et cetera. But given that behind in second quarter, we can limit ourselves and then have some visibility for the Q2 itself. Partially offsetting the lower volumes, we've stated that April month, retail volumes are down by 40%, whereas our commercial volumes are down, half of that, at minus 20%."

Or is it something different? That's my first question. And then secondly, on the volume impact. Appreciate if you could give me a breakdown on commercial and there is no mass that is because aviation is about 25% of your volumes. So I was surprised to hear that you only lost only 20% for the month of April. And then finally, on the dividend. From what I look on Slide 6, it looks like you've got an intention of paying 75% of on earnings from 2021. Should I take that would be at least the same in dollar terms or as the year before?

So it's relatively straightforward bearing in mind that we have the backstop guarantee provided by ADNOC parent company. So we have very limited downside in terms of inventory volumes carried for retail business. Of course, retail volumes overall represent 2/3 close to 70% of our total sales volumes. So mainly the exposure is coming from our corporate volumes as well as aviation volumes. And if you just look at the first quarter itself, you can see that our gross profit has taken a more serious hit because the inventory -- net realizable value, NRV valuation as per IFRS had to be booked. We managed, of course, our inventories, nominal inventories are down in line with our view about the oil market. So there's a tactical element to some degree as well. And that was partly the reason why working capital and inventory levels at the end of March were down compared to earlier periods."

So regarding the dividend policy and especially the 75% minimum, 75% of the suitable profit let me, first of all, start with what is our dividend policy. So during the general assembly 1 month back on 31st of March, the company shareholders approved a couple of things. So first of all, the segment and final dividend payment of $300 million for the year of 2019 -- in the 2019. And this dividend payment came on the top of an interim dividend of $325 million for the year, which was paid in October 2019. All in all, the -- this resulted in a full dividend payment of $650 million. So this is consistent with our dividend policy approved by the shareholders in 2019 and representing a 62% increase versus 2018. Then the -- during the general assembly, we maintained the company's 2020 dividend policy, which is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million. An increase of 7.5% compared to 2019, and this is for 2020. Amendments to the dividend policy for 2021 onwards with an expected dividend of $700 million for 2021, okay, compared to a minimum 75% of the distributable profit as the produce policy. And the dividend equals to at least 75% of the distributor income for 2022 onwards. And this is obviously subject to the discussion of the Board of Directors and the shareholder approval. So we said clearly, the minimum 75% will not provide obviously today if it's this 75% minimum means a number that we can compare to 2021. The philosophy of the company is that we have strong balance sheet. We have ample cash reserves. We invest in growth. This is our priority in the future business. And we have set clearly a minimum of dividend for our shareholders with 2020 and 2021, clearly stated as per the statement that had made and also beyond this with a minimum 75% payout."

So where we have exposures is in the commercial part, where we have 3 categories of customers. We have government-related entities, where we do not request typically any bank guarantees. We have nongovernment-related parties where we have substantially, in most cases, bank guarantees issued by creditory banks. And then we have a third bucket of nongovernment-related customers without bank guarantees. This would include also our food and beverage, F&P tenants across our retail network as rental agreements are regarded. So basically, the external metrics are very clear. When we look at credit default swaps and other metrics that can be considered in this market for the banks that have issued bank guarantees or even for the government entities, clearly, as indications are that the prudent provisioning is required. And indeed, we have doubled the amount of bad provisions as of 31st of March. We continue monitoring the developments very carefully and closely.

We have seen an impairment losses of $19 million was reported, I mean, again, in the first quarter. Can you explain -- I mean, again, what is that for?

So you made a reference to the Expo being postponed from 2020 to 2021. So our whole strategy, the growth strategy, particularly in Dubai, is based on capturing a segment of the market that we do not capture in any way, shape or form today outside of the 11 stations that we have there today. So when we say, when we focus on Dubai, the Expo piece was the added potential uplift. But today, even in present market conditions, I'm better off, we are better off, opening a station in Dubai than not having a station there or opening a station anywhere else in the UAE because that is the offensive part of the strategy. That is where we capture volumes that are not part of our system today. We are not selling those volumes today. These are not volumes that are cannibalized from 1 station ADNOC Distribution versus another ADNOC Distribution station. That is the processed cornerstone of our strategy, particularly when it comes to the expansion in Dubai. So again, hopefully, this answers your question. Expo being kicked out, postponed by a year. That's fine. Has no detrimental impact on our expansion plans in Dubai.
Once again, alluding back to the earlier question, yes, we've revised our estimate of the number of stations we can possibly deliver in 2020. And the number of C-stores we hope to have refurbished in 2020, as Ahmed pointed out as well, we've revised that to keep in mind that the lockdown has constrained mobility of our contractors and labors. Hence, we expect some kind of an impact there. Outside of that, we're fully conscious, aware. We don't know when the crisis will end. But as soon as it does, which gradually as it ends, gradually as the markets pick up, we want our growth to be on track. Particularly coming back to the Dubai side. And on the Corporate side, I'll leave it to Petri again."

Today, we have a COVID situation. But looking at even the impact of COVID, you can see that this company is able to generate substantial cash flows, plus the balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA [ 0.1 ] gives you room to anyway, be able to raise that to invest. And I would say that the way to look at this company is operating cash flows are able to match with the dividend in a normal circumstances, and we have room to invest and to increase -- to use our cash to invest in future growth plus using potentially our $750 million of credit facility if requires for future growth.

So 20 to 25 in Dubai and the remaining across Abu Dhabi and the other Emirates. So you raised a point where you said, why not put those on hold? But the ones that are opening up, particularly in Dubai, I have said this on 2 other questions. It's an important part of the strategy. It's irrespective of the crisis going on at the moment. At some point, we cannot anticipate nor do we want to predict when it's going to end. But at some point, we will. Even during the crisis, it makes sense to have stations in Dubai. Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirate, there's a larger play here that is also for nonfuel retail. What we found out, particularly with the stations that we've opened up in the past few weeks, Q1 2020, the ones where we're piloting the home delivery, those neighborhoods, on the go stations that are a big part of what we're rolling out in Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates, they are returning absolutely good results. Customer feedback has been absolutely positive. That was the intent to be in the neighborhoods, that's the defensive part of the strategy, but also the second part is take that nonfuel retail piece to people, our customers in the neighborhood. Well, because of the crisis, where we got lucky, where we're able to exploit a part of this crisis was the nonfuel retail piece, something we had been contemplating and building up, which is the online delivery. Now that has taken off where we piloted. It's taken off, it's increased the basket size, and we are set to roll it out across a wider part of our network. And that -- for that, beyond on the go station, the neighborhood stations are important. So I'm confident, we are confident the way we're progressing in light of the crisis, we've contemplated, we've relooked at the strategy. It is important that we continue and wait while even the volumes are low, there's other parts of the business that are doing well, exceptionally well in light because of the crisis. So I'm still confident we made the right decision to progress as is.

Yes. On the fuel retail. Tom business. Sorry, I was -- sorry. So first of all, if you look at the UAE, actually, the -- in the UAE, there is a stable regulatory environment for the pump prices. So UAE pump prices are monthly Bio committee in which ADNOC Distribution is represented by our CEO, Ahmed Al Shamsi. So the comp prices countries of the base price and the regulated unit margin that has not changed since August 2015, if I am right. So and then although there is no change in the margin that is currently contemplated. Any reduction will be backstopped by ADNOC Group. So our main shareholder, throughout December 2022. So the short answer is, in the UAE, since end of 2015, the pump prices and the margins are regulated, offering us minimum margin of roughly 22% gross profit margin, if you look at the historical trend. And the additional, I would say, trick that we have compared to the 2 other competitors is given the shareholders that we have, at the IPO, we have been able to get a backstop for the fuel retail margin in case there is inventory losses. We will not incur any inventory loss, and we'll have a minimum margin. And we can also benefit from higher pump prices, which leads to inventory gains."

And good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
Before we take you through our first quarter results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. In Q1 2020, we have shown strength and agility as a business. We have taken and will continue to take every step to ensure the health and well-being of our employees and our customers, which includes daily cleaning of sites and providing personal protective equipment to our front-line colleagues. During this period, we have strengthened our focus and understanding customers' needs by engaging with them and staying connected. We were quick to adapt our products and services to the evolving situation and took this as an opportunity to accelerate our digital transformation strategy. We widened our portfolio of services, such as enhancing contactless payment technology, a new low-cost grocery essentials range at our ADNOC Oasis stores, online home delivery for more than 1,000 of our Oasis products, mobile fuel delivery services and complementary car interior sanitization with every auto carwash.
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first quarter and outlook for 2020. Despite the challenging operating environment and the uncertainties ahead, our core business fundamentals remain robust and resilient, and we are well in place to navigate the current times. The company has demonstrated resilience in Q1 2020, with underlying EBITDA, excluding inventory movements and one-offs, increasing by 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Adjusting for one-offs, which Petri will talk about in details while discussing financial performance, the company's earnings showed growth despite impact of COVID-19 in the month of March. Cash flow generation remained strong during the quarter, and the company maintained a strong financial position at the end of March 2020 with ample liquidity to help weather the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments. We also remain focused on our business strategy of smart growth and bringing further efficiencies in our operations.
For the full year 2020, we expect to attend 50 to 60 new stations in the UAE. We have assessed the impact of COVID-19 on our business plan and capital structure. We maintain our CapEx guidance of $300 million to $400 million in 2020, reiterating our commitment to deliver smart growth beyond 2020 and offer best-in-class services to our customers. We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. Our focus is to ensure CapEx is allocated more efficiently towards our growth and value assertive Dubai expansion. We are, therefore, targeting 20 to 25 new stations in Dubai, the majority of which will be traditional stations.
Delivering on our international expansion also remains integral to our ambitious smart growth strategy. We continue to assess potential opportunities to achieve disciplined growth and operational success, while targeting the highest return on investment.
In our nonfuel business, we remain focused on providing superior customer experience, and we'll continue with our convenience store revitalization program. As a company, we are always looking to optimize our cost base, ensuring our margins and cash flows remain healthy.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by a progressive dividend policy, smart growth and supported by strong balance sheet. For 2020, company's dividend policy is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to Board and shareholders' approval.
I will now hand over to Mohamed for an update on our strategy. Thank you."

First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes",1585,"Thank you, Ahmed. First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.
In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes we've sold has decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Commercial fuel volumes on the other hand remained stable year-on-year. Retail fuel volumes declined by 1.9% compared to the same period last year despite growth acceleration in the first 2 months of 2020, but this was mainly due to the business impact of COVID-19 in the month of March.
Our school, retail malls and offices had started to close starting in the month of March. We saw an impact on demand, and we saw that impact in both fuel and nonfuel sales. So the full impact of the COVID-19 restrictions became apparent in the month of April. This is when our retail fuel sales volume declined by around 40%.
Commercial fuel sales volume in the month of April declined by around 20%. So despite this decline in volumes in the short term, we do expect the impact on our EBITDA to be partially mitigated. Now this is on account of various initiatives that we've undertaken, like widening our portfolio of services, optimizing our operating expenditure as well as support we've received due to the higher retail fuel margin in the short term. The retail pump prices for the months of April and May 2020 have not dropped in line with crude oil prices.
So despite the challenging operating environment, we continue to deliver on our growth strategy. We've opened 7 new stations in the first quarter of 2020 and 3 additional stations in the month of April. So of the 10 new stations that we opened in the UAE across the UAE in April alone, 5 of these were in Dubai. So total number of fuel stations we now operate in Dubai is 11.
Now as part of our drive to effectively tackle competition with faster and more efficient deployment of our fuel stations and while also optimizing our capital expenditure, we also opened our first 5 ADNOC on the go neighborhood service stations in Abu Dhabi as of April 2020.
So I'd like to give you a brief update -- further update on the construction progress of our new stations. New stations that we were expecting to open during the first half of 2020 are now in advanced stages of completion from a construction standpoint. However, the COVID-19 situation has reduced our productivity of the labor at these sites, given the mobility restrictions of our labor. This would also have an impact on our ability to make these stations fully operational in time. So we now expect to open around 15 additional stations by the first half of 2020. And these stations under progress, under construction at the moment have achieved an average completion rate of around 75%. So this makes us very confident in achieving our target. While some of the stations we expected to be operational during the first half of 2020 have now been pushed back to the second half of 2020. We still expect to open 50 to 60 new stations in 2020. This is, of course, versus the 60 stations that we guided to earlier.
As we continue to innovate and seek new ways to grow our fuels business, we've also extended our current B2B mobile fuel delivery services that we call My Station. We've extended this to retail customers in select areas of Abu Dhabi. We've already deployed about 8 trailers and 22 trucks to provide effectively on-demand fuel delivery to serve our large customers as part of our growth plan and our commitment to providing our customers with a fast and reliable fueling service.
In addition to the 30 mobile assets that serve our B2B business, we continue to see opportunities to grow our mobile fuel delivery service in both B2B and B2C segments. So we've got 15 new trucks that are set to join our existing fleet during 2020. We will continue to explore options to further expand this service to enhance the overall customer experience, whether that's B2B or B2C.
Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy. We're in various stages of discussions with several players in different markets to expand organically as well as pursuing inorganic opportunities. Obviously, the ongoing travel restriction could impact the overall timing of concluding these discussions. So we will announce further updates at an appropriate time.
Moving on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience stores network increased to 269 in March -- as of end of March 2020. So we've added 5 new convenience stores in the UAE during Q1 2020. Our focus on category management contributed to an increase in average gross basket size by 12% year-on-year in Q1 2020. Our convenience store revitalization program that we introduced to you the last time was expected to pick up pace starting early Q2 2020. However, given the current COVID-19 situation and safety restrictions that are in place, we are now targeting 40 to 50 convenience stores to be refurbished in 2020 phased over the rest of the year.
Also, we are accelerating our digital transformation strategy, particularly in response to the current pandemic, which has evolved the needs of our customers, thereby enhancing the company's position as the best-in-class fuel and convenience retailer.
[Audio Gap] 
a key element of it. A key element of our digital transformation strategy has been providing customers with a seamless digital experience and activating advanced Mobile Pay technology, which allows our customers totally contactless refueling and payment. As a result, we saw significant uptick in the ADNOC Distribution Wallet users. This increased by more than 100,000 users in the first quarter of the year, so now the total stands at approximately 730,000 users. So obviously, we're going to continue to focus with the aim to further grow our ADNOC Wallet user base, which will allow us to deliver targeted promotional offers to our users, to our customers, thereby increasing customer loyalty.
In the second quarter of 2020, also, we will introduce a new point-based system to our ADNOC Rewards loyalty program. This will enable our customers to enable points against ADNOC Oasis convenience store products as well as the various services in the ADNOC Distribution stations.
Now we've also responded to new social distancing measures by launching a new essential products range in our convenience stores. This includes fresh food, household and health care products at a low cost -- to help customers across the UAE at a low cost. More recently, we also launched an online home delivery service of more than 1,000 products from the Oasis convenience stores. This includes groceries. This includes hot beverages. Ultimately, our aim is for the convenience and safety of our customers, particularly during the ongoing pandemic. And the service is already proving popular. We've seen an increase in basket size for the participating stores. So stores which have participated in the online home delivery service, the basket size has gone up quite significantly.
We've also currently piloted this theme in 12 of our stores. So far, the results are very encouraging, and the customer feedback is very positive. So we see a great opportunity in our recently launched online food and grocery delivery service from our ADNOC Oasis convenience stores. Now we're expecting the hope to expand this service to more convenience stores by the end of this year. We're confident that we will because this supports our ambition of sustaining strong growth in our nonfuel offering.
Finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiatives. That is, of course, the third pillar of our strategic plan. Now during the first quarter of 2020, there was an increase in like-for-like operating expenditure by USD 4 million compared to Q1 2019. Now this increase was mainly due to an increase in maintenance as well as smart technology utilities costs.
In addition, total operating expenditure also increased due to the cost of additional staff to implement the free assisted fueling, given that we have completely dropped the Flex initiative. So this was in line with our guidance and pertaining to our growth and new stations operating expenditure. So we remain focused on accelerating delivery of our cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives. We are now moving in the process of moving to a more efficient and effective retail site operating model. This allows us to focus on staffing optimization as well as staff redeployment leading to a like-for-like reduction in full-time employees per station.
We are also accelerating operating efficiency as well as the asset optimization initiatives across our network. In light of those initiatives, we will reiterate our target of like-for-like OpEx savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020. Now in line with our guidance and plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we've spent $50 million during the first quarter of the year. Now this is much higher than the Q1 2019 capital expenditure of USD 13 million. This, of course, reiterates our commitment to deliver growth beyond 2020, while providing best-in-class services to our customers.
Of course, we will continue to improve CapEx efficiency, including the rollout of Flex capital-intensive station format, such as ADNOC on the go and My Station.
At this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, from my side as well. As stated by Ahmed and Mohamed, we've delivered resilient financial and operational performance during the first quarter despite the challenging operating environment.Q1",1062,"Many thanks, Mohamed. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, from my side as well. As stated by Ahmed and Mohamed, we've delivered resilient financial and operational performance during the first quarter despite the challenging operating environment.
Q1 2020 revenue increased by 3.6% compared to last year, driven by an increase in fuel retail revenues. This was, of course, as a result of higher pump prices and higher corporate volumes, partially offset by lower volumes in our retail and aviation businesses as well as lower nonfuel retail revenues.
Q2 2020 gross profit is at USD 302 million, representing a decrease of 3.1% compared to last year. Fuel retail business posted strong operating performance. However, total gross profit for the first quarter was negatively impacted by USD 16 million due to inventory losses and other one-offs in the commercial business, whereas last year, first quarter included one-off recoveries of $15 million at gross profit level. So when excluding these inventory losses and one-offs, Q1 2020 total gross profit grew at 7.1% compared to last year.
First quarter EBITDA was USD 151 million, representing a decrease of 24.1% over Q1 '19. Reported EBITDA was negatively impacted by a total of USD 20 million in Q1 2020 due to inventory losses as well as prudent provisioning on trade receivables and other one-offs, whereas last year was benefiting from one-off reversals of prior period accruals as well as recoveries totaling $36 million. Hence, our underlying EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA excluding inventory losses as well as one-offs, remained resilient with a growth of 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Net profit for the first quarter is at USD 109 million, declining by 30.9% compared to last year, and once again, mainly due to the inventory losses as well as one-off losses for the first quarter as well as due to the presence of the one-off gains I mentioned for Q1 last year. However, adjusting for these elements, we've reported earnings at 6% up despite the business impact of COVID-19 for the month of March. And finally, cash generation remained strong with free cash flow of USD 145 million for the first quarter.
Okay. Let me now briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for the first quarter. Total fuel volumes decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of last year. This is mainly as a result of the business impact of COVID-19 in March. However, in the period prior to COVID-19, we actually saw higher year-on-year growth compared to Q3 as well as Q4 of 2019. Our commercial fuel volumes were up marginally, 5.1% year-on-year, driven by an increase in corporate volumes by 1.9% and partially offset by a decrease of 4.9% in aviation volumes sold to our strategic customers in the first quarter.
In the nonfuel business, transactions decreased by 17.1% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of vouchers after implementing free assisted fueling, as Mohamed mentioned. This was effective November 2019 as well as the impact of COVID-19, once again, in the month of March. However, average gross basket size has increased by 12% year-on-year, driven by improvement in category management and also as a result of the COVID-19, once again, with customers visiting less frequently, but spending more during each visit.
I'm now moving on to talk about gross profit performance by segment. Firstly, let me also highlight and remind that effective this first quarter 2020, we've implemented new segment reporting structure, which is based on natural categorization of our businesses into 2 buckets of retail or B2C and commercial B2B segments. First quarter retail segment gross profit increased by 9.5%, driven by fuel retail business. Fuel retail business posted strong operating performance with gross profit growth of 13.1% year-on-year. And this is on the back of higher retail fuel margins, reduction impact from the costs following renegotiation of our fuel supply contract effective last November as well as higher retail volumes during the first 2 months of the year.
Our nonfuel gross profit in the retail decreased by 7.5% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of the voucher redemption I already mentioned as a result of implementing free assisted fueling, together with the impact from COVID-19 in March.
Commercial business performance was negatively impacted by USD 16 million at gross profit level. This is due to the revaluation of our inventory, our stock at the end of March, USD 10 million following lower oil prices as well as one-off items of $6 million. Whereas in Q1 2019, we had one-off recoveries of USD 15 million. Excluding the inventory losses and one-offs for the commercial business, commercial gross profit would have grown by 1.6% year-on-year.
And moving on to EBITDA per segment. Q1 retail EBITDA declined due to the lower fuel volumes as well as the additional cost of staff to implement the free assisted fueling and the OpEx related to new stations and, of course, due to the presence of OpEx reversals, I mentioned, in Q1 2019. Commercial EBITDA declined due to the lower aviation volumes, inventory losses and, once again, the one-offs in Q1 2020, whereas we had one-off recoveries present in Q1 2019.
And finally, a few comments about our cash flow and capital structure. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to stable cash flows as well as positive working capital movements. Working capital requirement reduced as a result of decrease in trade receivables as well as in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in trade payables, given the big swings in oil prices and the decline in our volumes towards the end of the quarter.
As of 31st of March, we have a very strong liquidity position of USD 2.2 billion in the form of $1.4 billion in cash. And then we have a revolving unutilized credit facility of USD 750 million. And our existing term debt is maturing at the end of 2022 with no covenants in place. As a result, the balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x as of 31st of March. However, when adjusting for the final dividend that got paid early days of April, the adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 0.55x, strong as such at the end of March 2020.
Now let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered resilient underlying results in Q1 2020. While demand for fuel and nonfuel products may take time to recover to normalized levels, we expect decline in volumes to be partially offset by various management initiatives and higher retail volume margin in the short term. As retail pump prices for the months of April and May have remained comparatively high despite drop in crude oil prices. Our ability in managing our capital expenditures and cost base as well as our diverse product platform and strong balance sheet provide us with an important flexibility to respond in this volatile operating environment. We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans in a disciplined manner as well as delivering an enhanced customer experience, both of which are expected to drive future earnings growth.
We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. We remain confident that we will responsibly manage the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments.

And of course, given what's going on in terms of oil market and product prices, the Ministry of Energy, who regulates the pump prices on a monthly basis in UAE has made a decision to maintain pump prices.
In terms of forward-looking and going forward, we cannot really make any estimates or forecast for how long, et cetera. But given that we are in second quarter, we can limit ourselves and then have some visibility for the Q2 itself. Partially offsetting the lower volumes, we've stated that April month retail volumes are down by 40%, whereas our commercial volumes are down half of that at minus 20%."

And then on top of that, you've got the ADNOC margins for like stabilization mechanism. So I'm trying to understand, when it goes through of course writing down inventory, what is that inventory write-down? Is it the excess of, say, what you got versus what you're going to sell it for or is it something different? That's my first question.
And then secondly, on the volume impact. I appreciate if you could give me a breakdown on commercials and the reason I'm asking about is because aviation is about 25% of your volumes. So I was surprised to hear that you only lost only 20% for the month of April.
And then finally, on the dividend. From what I look on Slide 6, it looks like you've got an intention of paying 75% on earnings from 2021. Should I take that would be at least the same in dollar terms as the year before? Or is that -- is it a progressive dividend is what I'm saying with the floor?"

So if I take the first one on the inventory valuation. So it's relatively straightforward. Bearing in mind that we have the backstop guarantee provided by ADNOC parent company, so we have very limited downside in terms of inventory volumes carried for retail business. Of course, retail volumes overall represent 2/3, close to 70% of our total sales volumes. So mainly the exposure is coming from our corporate volumes as well as aviation volumes.
And if you just look at the first quarter itself, you can see that our gross profit has taken a more serious hit because the inventory -- net realizable value, NRV, valuation as per IFRS had to be booked. We've managed, of course, our inventories. Nominal inventories are down in line with our view about the oil market, so there's a tactical element to some degree as well. And that was partly the reason why working capital and inventory levels at the end of March were down compared to earlier periods."

So regarding the dividend policy and especially the 75% -- minimum 75% distributable profit, let me, first of all, start with what is our dividend policy. So during the general assembly 1 month back on 31st of March, the company shareholders approved a couple of things. So first of all, the segment and final dividend payment of $300 million for the year of 2019 -- in 2019. And this dividend payment came on the top of an interim dividend of $325 million for the year, which was paid in October 2019. All in all, the -- this resulted in a full dividend payment of $650 million. So this is consistent with our dividend policy approved by the shareholders in 2019 and representing a 62% increase versus 2018.
Then the -- during the general assembly, we maintained the company's 2020 dividend policy, which is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, an increase of 7.5% compared to 2019, and this is for 2020. Amendments to the dividend policy for 2021 onwards with an expected dividend of $700 million for 2021, okay, compared to a minimum 75% of the distributable profit as the previous policy. And the dividend equals to at least 75% of the distributable income for 2022 onwards. And this is obviously subject to the discussion of the Board of Directors and the shareholder approval. So we said clearly, the minimum 75% will not provide obviously today if it's -- this 75% means a number that we can compare to 2021. The philosophy of the company is that we have strong balance sheet. We have ample cash reserves. We invest in growth. This is our priority in the future business. And we have set clearly a minimum of dividend for our shareholders with 2020 and 2021 clearly stated as per the statement that I made and also beyond this with
a minimum 75% payout."

You've mentioned that you're 50 to 60 station this year compared to previous guidance, I believe, of 60. I just want you to explain this better. Does that mean that you guys think this COVID is very temporary and you're keeping your plans on this? A lot of companies or other companies in the market are ruling back the expansion plan. So I just wanted to understand a bit more on this guidance. Is this a reflection of you being very confident about the economy? Is it a reflection of your business model being very strong and thinking that we'll do well no matter how the economic situation of the country is? And my second question has to do with the one-off items. So you explained very well the inventory losses due to fuel. But I believe there was also a mention in the earnings release about provisions. So maybe on the Corporate side, if you could just remind us what's your provisioning policy in general when it comes to receivables? That's it from my side."

So we're not trying to forecast how long the crisis is going to last. Always stating that simply at some point, there will be a return of normalcy. The lockdown will end. And whenever that happens, rather than put our growth plans on the back burner and pick them up at that point, we've contemplated on this point, and the decision we made is that we keep our growth on track. Particularly, as we pointed out, we are not going to set back is the Dubai jurisdiction. Why? Because any time we open a station there, those are organic volume that we are not capturing today. So while we will continue to focus on our growth and expansion plans, you've seen because of the constraints, the numbers have been slightly revised downward, that both on the same-store refurbishment side as well as the number of stations we had committed to a few months back. It went from 60 to now it's 50 to 60. But we haven't moved away from is the number of stations we intend to open in Dubai. Again, that's the resiliency in our business model. We're not trying to forecast when, how long it's going to last, but when it does, we're ready to capture that growth. As far as your second question, which was on the provision side, I will let Petri address that question."

I guess that we are all aware as a management that the COVID situation is clearly bringing us some challenging times, especially on delivering the stations and also on refurbish -- refurbishing, sorry, the C-stores. What happened and just to build on what Mohamed Al Hashemi was saying is we had a target of 60 -- minimum 60 stations for this year. We have now come down to 50 to 60. But if you look at the way we have looked at our numbers is, first of all, the first half, if you remember well, we said roughly 40 to 45 stations in H1. And we are putting this number at 50. And then we believe that the situation will improve gradually. And the 50 based on the fact that we have today, 75% completion. On the C-store side, we have clearly factored the COVID impact today. We had a target of 100 C-stores to be revitalized this year. More towards Q2, Q3 and Q4. And we have banked this number to 40 to 50 as per the feedback from our development business team, actually looking at each of the C-stores and how we believe we can deliver the digitalization program. I hope that this answers your question."

So first of all, it is good to remember that the core part of our Retail fuel business. We don't really have exposures given that the whole business nature is cash-based or people pay with credit cards or ADNOC Wallet and Mobile pay, et cetera. So where we have exposures is in the commercial part, where we have 3 categories of customers. We have government-related entities, where we do not request typically any bank guarantees. We have nongovernment-related parties where we have substantially, in most cases, bank guarantees issued by creditory banks. And then we have a third bucket of nongovernment-related customers without bank guarantees. This would include also our food and beverage, F&P tenants across our retail network as rental agreements are regarded. So basically, the external metrics are very clear. When we look at credit default swaps and other metrics that can be considered in this market for the banks that have issued bank guarantees or even for the government entities, clearly, as indications are that the prudent provisioning is required. And indeed, we have doubled the amount of bad provisions as of 31st of March. We continue monitoring the developments very carefully and closely. And this is, of course, a recurring evaluation once we get to the end of Q2."

So you made a reference to the Expo being postponed from 2020 to 2021. So our whole strategy, the growth strategy, particularly in Dubai, is based on capturing a segment of the market that we do not capture in any way, shape or form today outside of the 11 stations that we have here today. So when we say, when we focus on Dubai, the Expo piece was the added potential uplift. But today, even in present market conditions, I'm better off, we are better off, opening a station in Dubai than not having a station there or opening a station anywhere else in the UAE because that is the offensive part of the strategy. That is where we capture volumes that are not part of our system today. We are not selling those volumes today. These are not volumes that are cannibalized from 1 station ADNOC Distribution versus another ADNOC Distribution station. That is the processed cornerstone of our strategy, particularly when it comes to the expansion in Dubai. So again, hopefully, this answers your question. Expo being kicked out, postponed by a year. That's fine. Has no detrimental impact on our expansion plans in Dubai.
Once again, alluding back to the earlier question, yes, we've revised our estimate of the number of stations we can possibly deliver in 2020. And the number of C-stores we hope to have refurbished in 2020, as Ahmed pointed out as well, we've revised that. To keep in mind that the lockdown has constrained mobility of our contractors and labors. Hence, we expect some kind of an impact there. Outside of that, we're fully conscious, aware. We don't know when the crisis will end. But as soon as it does, which gradually as it ends, gradually as the markets pick up, we want our growth to be on track, particularly, coming back to the Dubai side. And on the Corporate side, I'll leave it to Petri again."

So the first part of your question, we -- look, we have not revised it downwards. We're seeing as we originally said 60 stations at least, out of which 20 to 25 in Dubai, that continues, but the 60 is now 50 to 60 in light of the crisis. So 20 to 25 in Dubai and the remaining across Abu Dhabi and the other Emirates. So you raised a point where you said, why not put those on hold? But the ones that are opening up, particularly in Dubai, I have said this on 2 other questions, it's an important part of the strategy. It's irrespective of the crisis going on at the moment. At some point, we cannot anticipate nor do we want to predict when it's going to end. But at some point, we will. Even during the crisis, it makes sense to have stations in Dubai. Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirate, there's a larger play here that is also for nonfuel retail. What we found out, particularly with the stations that we've opened up in the past few weeks, Q1 2020, the ones where we're piloting the home delivery, those neighborhoods, on the go stations that are a big part of what we're rolling out in Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates, they are returning absolutely good results. 
Customer feedback has been absolutely positive. That was the intent to be in the neighborhoods, that's the defensive part of the strategy, but also the second part is take that nonfuel retail piece to people, our customers in the neighborhood. Well, because of the crisis, where we got lucky, where we're able to exploit a part of this crisis was the nonfuel retail piece, something we had been contemplating and building up, which is the online delivery. Now that has taken off where we piloted. It's taken off, it's increased the basket size, and we are set to roll it out across a wider part of our network. And that -- for that, beyond on the go station, the neighborhood stations are important. So I'm confident, we are confident the way we're progressing in light of the crisis, we've contemplated, we've relooked at the strategy. It is important that we continue and wait while even the volumes are low, there's other parts of the business that are doing well, exceptionally well in light because of the crisis. So I'm still confident we made the right decision to progress as is.
The second part of your question was -- remind me again."

The concrete message we got back, and this was based on the volumes that we've sold in these stations is that there is room, most certainly room for more and more stations in Dubai. That's why we felt confident by committing a portion of our growth strategy, focused solely on Dubai. The volume, again, without talking numbers, are much higher than even some of our busiest stations outside of Dubai."

The focus is just telling, thank our investors that the focus is still Dubai and we are committed to this growth because this is the only market where we can really gain market share. For the other markets, and especially for Abu Dhabi, we have a solution. We have brought a solution, which is the on the go station, compact stations, which have much lower CapEx requirements and can leave us the opportunity to protect our market because this is where we have 100% market share. 
So the way we are adapting to the market conditions is to still, and thanks to the balance sheet that we have, focusing on Dubai. And choosing -- have a much more, I would say, linear approach on the other address through an answer on the go station. Last point on Dubai, the volumes, as Mohamed was mentioning. If you look at the total volume that we have, average is 18 -- 17 million, 18 million liters per station per year. In Dubai, you are above this number. And this was our investment case for the past 1.5 years to clearly say, should we go to Dubai? If yes, what will be the returns? Today, the returns are double digit, and the volumes are above this 18 million, 20 million liters per station."

Are you talking about the business? Yes. On the fuel retail. Business. Sorry, I was -- sorry. So first of all, if you look at the UAE, actually, the -- in the UAE, there is a stable regulatory environment for the pump prices. So UAE pump prices are set monthly by committee in which ADNOC Distribution is represented by our CEO, Ahmed Al Shamsi. So the pump prices countries of the base price and the regulated unit margin that has not changed since August 2015, [indiscernible]. 
So and then although there is no change in the margin that is currently contemplated. Any reduction will be backstopped by ADNOC Group. So our main shareholder, throughout December 2022. So the short answer is, in the UAE, since end of 2015, the pump prices and the margins are regulated, offering us minimum margin of roughly 22% gross profit margin, if you look at the historical trend. And the additional, I would say, trick that we have compared to the 2 other competitors is given the shareholders that we have, at the IPO, we have been able to get a backstop for the fuel retail margin in case there is inventory losses. We will not incur any inventory loss, and we'll have a minimum margin. And we can also benefit from higher pump prices, which leads to inventory gains."

Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.Before we take you through our first quarter results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19.",580,"Thank you, Athmane. And good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
Before we take you through our first quarter results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. In Q1 2020, we have shown strength and agility as a business. We have taken and will continue to take every step to ensure the health and well-being of our employees and our customers, which includes daily cleaning of sites and providing personal protective equipment to our front-line colleagues. During this period, we have strengthened our focus and understanding customers' needs by engaging with them and staying connected. We were quick to adapt our products and services to the evolving situation and took this as an opportunity to accelerate our digital transformation strategy. We widened our portfolio of services, such as enhancing contactless payment technology, a new low-cost grocery essentials range at our ADNOC Oasis stores, online home delivery for more than 1,000 of our Oasis products, mobile fuel delivery services and complementary car interior sanitization with every auto carwash.
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first quarter and outlook for 2020. Despite the challenging operating environment and the uncertainties ahead, our core business fundamentals remain robust and resilient, and we are well in place to navigate the current times. The company has demonstrated resilience in Q1 2020, with underlying EBITDA, excluding inventory movements and one-offs, increasing by 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Adjusting for one-offs, which Petri will talk about in details while discussing financial performance, the company's earnings showed growth despite impact of COVID-19 in the month of March. Cash flow generation remained strong during the quarter, and the company maintained a strong financial position at the end of March 2020 with ample liquidity to help weather the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments. We also remain focused on our business strategy of smart growth and bringing further efficiencies in our operations.
For the full year 2020, we expect to attend 50 to 60 new stations in the UAE. We have assessed the impact of COVID-19 on our business plan and capital structure. We maintain our CapEx guidance of $300 million to $400 million in 2020, reiterating our commitment to deliver smart growth beyond 2020 and offer best-in-class services to our customers. We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. Our focus is to ensure CapEx is allocated more efficiently towards our growth and value assertive Dubai expansion. We are, therefore, targeting 20 to 25 new stations in Dubai, the majority of which will be traditional stations.
Delivering on our international expansion also remains integral to our ambitious smart growth strategy. We continue to assess potential opportunities to achieve disciplined growth and operational success, while targeting the highest return on investment.
In our nonfuel business, we remain focused on providing superior customer experience, and we'll continue with our convenience store revitalization program. As a company, we are always looking to optimize our cost base, ensuring our margins and cash flows remain healthy.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by a progressive dividend policy, smart growth and supported by strong balance sheet. For 2020, company's dividend policy is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to Board and shareholders' approval.
I will now hand over to Mohamed for an update on our strategy. Thank you."

First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes",1585,"Thank you, Ahmed. First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.
In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes we've sold has decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Commercial fuel volumes on the other hand remained stable year-on-year. Retail fuel volumes declined by 1.9% compared to the same period last year despite growth acceleration in the first 2 months of 2020, but this was mainly due to the business impact of COVID-19 in the month of March.
Our school, retail malls and offices had started to close starting in the month of March. We saw an impact on demand, and we saw that impact in both fuel and nonfuel sales. So the full impact of the COVID-19 restrictions became apparent in the month of April. This is when our retail fuel sales volume declined by around 40%.
Commercial fuel sales volume in the month of April declined by around 20%. So despite this decline in volumes in the short term, we do expect the impact on our EBITDA to be partially mitigated. Now this is on account of various initiatives that we've undertaken, like widening our portfolio of services, optimizing our operating expenditure as well as support we've received due to the higher retail fuel margin in the short term. The retail pump prices for the months of April and May 2020 have not dropped in line with crude oil prices.
So despite the challenging operating environment, we continue to deliver on our growth strategy. We've opened 7 new stations in the first quarter of 2020 and 3 additional stations in the month of April. So of the 10 new stations that we opened in the UAE across the UAE in April alone, 5 of these were in Dubai. So total number of fuel stations we now operate in Dubai is 11.
Now as part of our drive to effectively tackle competition with faster and more efficient deployment of our fuel stations and while also optimizing our capital expenditure, we also opened our first 5 ADNOC on the go neighborhood service stations in Abu Dhabi as of April 2020.
So I'd like to give you a brief update -- further update on the construction progress of our new stations. New stations that we were expecting to open during the first half of 2020 are now in advanced stages of completion from a construction standpoint. However, the COVID-19 situation has reduced our productivity of the labor at these sites, given the mobility restrictions of our labor. This would also have an impact on our ability to make these stations fully operational in time. So we now expect to open around 15 additional stations by the first half of 2020. And these stations under progress, under construction at the moment have achieved an average completion rate of around 75%. So this makes us very confident in achieving our target. While some of the stations we expected to be operational during the first half of 2020 have now been pushed back to the second half of 2020. We still expect to open 50 to 60 new stations in 2020. This is, of course, versus the 60 stations that we guided to earlier.
As we continue to innovate and seek new ways to grow our fuels business, we've also extended our current B2B mobile fuel delivery services that we call My Station. We've extended this to retail customers in select areas of Abu Dhabi. We've already deployed about 8 trailers and 22 trucks to provide effectively on-demand fuel delivery to serve our large customers as part of our growth plan and our commitment to providing our customers with a fast and reliable fueling service.
In addition to the 30 mobile assets that serve our B2B business, we continue to see opportunities to grow our mobile fuel delivery service in both B2B and B2C segments. So we've got 15 new trucks that are set to join our existing fleet during 2020. We will continue to explore options to further expand this service to enhance the overall customer experience, whether that's B2B or B2C.
Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy. We're in various stages of discussions with several players in different markets to expand organically as well as pursuing inorganic opportunities. Obviously, the ongoing travel restriction could impact the overall timing of concluding these discussions. So we will announce further updates at an appropriate time.
Moving on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience stores network increased to 269 in March -- as of end of March 2020. So we've added 5 new convenience stores in the UAE during Q1 2020. Our focus on category management contributed to an increase in average gross basket size by 12% year-on-year in Q1 2020. Our convenience store revitalization program that we introduced to you the last time was expected to pick up pace starting early Q2 2020. However, given the current COVID-19 situation and safety restrictions that are in place, we are now targeting 40 to 50 convenience stores to be refurbished in 2020 phased over the rest of the year.
Also, we are accelerating our digital transformation strategy, particularly in response to the current pandemic, which has evolved the needs of our customers, thereby enhancing the company's position as the best-in-class fuel and convenience retailer.
[Audio Gap] 
a key element of it. A key element of our digital transformation strategy has been providing customers with a seamless digital experience and activating advanced Mobile Pay technology, which allows our customers totally contactless refueling and payment. As a result, we saw significant uptick in the ADNOC Distribution Wallet users. This increased by more than 100,000 users in the first quarter of the year, so now the total stands at approximately 730,000 users. So obviously, we're going to continue to focus with the aim to further grow our ADNOC Wallet user base, which will allow us to deliver targeted promotional offers to our users, to our customers, thereby increasing customer loyalty.
In the second quarter of 2020, also, we will introduce a new point-based system to our ADNOC Rewards loyalty program. This will enable our customers to enable points against ADNOC Oasis convenience store products as well as the various services in the ADNOC Distribution stations.
Now we've also responded to new social distancing measures by launching a new essential products range in our convenience stores. This includes fresh food, household and health care products at a low cost -- to help customers across the UAE at a low cost. More recently, we also launched an online home delivery service of more than 1,000 products from the Oasis convenience stores. This includes groceries. This includes hot beverages. Ultimately, our aim is for the convenience and safety of our customers, particularly during the ongoing pandemic. And the service is already proving popular. We've seen an increase in basket size for the participating stores. So stores which have participated in the online home delivery service, the basket size has gone up quite significantly.
We've also currently piloted this theme in 12 of our stores. So far, the results are very encouraging, and the customer feedback is very positive. So we see a great opportunity in our recently launched online food and grocery delivery service from our ADNOC Oasis convenience stores. Now we're expecting the hope to expand this service to more convenience stores by the end of this year. We're confident that we will because this supports our ambition of sustaining strong growth in our nonfuel offering.
Finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiatives. That is, of course, the third pillar of our strategic plan. Now during the first quarter of 2020, there was an increase in like-for-like operating expenditure by USD 4 million compared to Q1 2019. Now this increase was mainly due to an increase in maintenance as well as smart technology utilities costs.
In addition, total operating expenditure also increased due to the cost of additional staff to implement the free assisted fueling, given that we have completely dropped the Flex initiative. So this was in line with our guidance and pertaining to our growth and new stations operating expenditure. So we remain focused on accelerating delivery of our cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives. We are now moving in the process of moving to a more efficient and effective retail site operating model. This allows us to focus on staffing optimization as well as staff redeployment leading to a like-for-like reduction in full-time employees per station.
We are also accelerating operating efficiency as well as the asset optimization initiatives across our network. In light of those initiatives, we will reiterate our target of like-for-like OpEx savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020. Now in line with our guidance and plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we've spent $50 million during the first quarter of the year. Now this is much higher than the Q1 2019 capital expenditure of USD 13 million. This, of course, reiterates our commitment to deliver growth beyond 2020, while providing best-in-class services to our customers.
Of course, we will continue to improve CapEx efficiency, including the rollout of Flex capital-intensive station format, such as ADNOC on the go and My Station.
At this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, from my side as well. As stated by Ahmed and Mohamed, we've delivered resilient financial and operational performance during the first quarter despite the challenging operating environment.Q1",1062,"Many thanks, Mohamed. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, from my side as well. As stated by Ahmed and Mohamed, we've delivered resilient financial and operational performance during the first quarter despite the challenging operating environment.
Q1 2020 revenue increased by 3.6% compared to last year, driven by an increase in fuel retail revenues. This was, of course, as a result of higher pump prices and higher corporate volumes, partially offset by lower volumes in our retail and aviation businesses as well as lower nonfuel retail revenues.
Q2 2020 gross profit is at USD 302 million, representing a decrease of 3.1% compared to last year. Fuel retail business posted strong operating performance. However, total gross profit for the first quarter was negatively impacted by USD 16 million due to inventory losses and other one-offs in the commercial business, whereas last year, first quarter included one-off recoveries of $15 million at gross profit level. So when excluding these inventory losses and one-offs, Q1 2020 total gross profit grew at 7.1% compared to last year.
First quarter EBITDA was USD 151 million, representing a decrease of 24.1% over Q1 '19. Reported EBITDA was negatively impacted by a total of USD 20 million in Q1 2020 due to inventory losses as well as prudent provisioning on trade receivables and other one-offs, whereas last year was benefiting from one-off reversals of prior period accruals as well as recoveries totaling $36 million. Hence, our underlying EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA excluding inventory losses as well as one-offs, remained resilient with a growth of 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Net profit for the first quarter is at USD 109 million, declining by 30.9% compared to last year, and once again, mainly due to the inventory losses as well as one-off losses for the first quarter as well as due to the presence of the one-off gains I mentioned for Q1 last year. However, adjusting for these elements, we've reported earnings at 6% up despite the business impact of COVID-19 for the month of March. And finally, cash generation remained strong with free cash flow of USD 145 million for the first quarter.
Okay. Let me now briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for the first quarter. Total fuel volumes decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of last year. This is mainly as a result of the business impact of COVID-19 in March. However, in the period prior to COVID-19, we actually saw higher year-on-year growth compared to Q3 as well as Q4 of 2019. Our commercial fuel volumes were up marginally, 5.1% year-on-year, driven by an increase in corporate volumes by 1.9% and partially offset by a decrease of 4.9% in aviation volumes sold to our strategic customers in the first quarter.
In the nonfuel business, transactions decreased by 17.1% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of vouchers after implementing free assisted fueling, as Mohamed mentioned. This was effective November 2019 as well as the impact of COVID-19, once again, in the month of March. However, average gross basket size has increased by 12% year-on-year, driven by improvement in category management and also as a result of the COVID-19, once again, with customers visiting less frequently, but spending more during each visit.
I'm now moving on to talk about gross profit performance by segment. Firstly, let me also highlight and remind that effective this first quarter 2020, we've implemented new segment reporting structure, which is based on natural categorization of our businesses into 2 buckets of retail or B2C and commercial B2B segments. First quarter retail segment gross profit increased by 9.5%, driven by fuel retail business. Fuel retail business posted strong operating performance with gross profit growth of 13.1% year-on-year. And this is on the back of higher retail fuel margins, reduction impact from the costs following renegotiation of our fuel supply contract effective last November as well as higher retail volumes during the first 2 months of the year.
Our nonfuel gross profit in the retail decreased by 7.5% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of the voucher redemption I already mentioned as a result of implementing free assisted fueling, together with the impact from COVID-19 in March.
Commercial business performance was negatively impacted by USD 16 million at gross profit level. This is due to the revaluation of our inventory, our stock at the end of March, USD 10 million following lower oil prices as well as one-off items of $6 million. Whereas in Q1 2019, we had one-off recoveries of USD 15 million. Excluding the inventory losses and one-offs for the commercial business, commercial gross profit would have grown by 1.6% year-on-year.
And moving on to EBITDA per segment. Q1 retail EBITDA declined due to the lower fuel volumes as well as the additional cost of staff to implement the free assisted fueling and the OpEx related to new stations and, of course, due to the presence of OpEx reversals, I mentioned, in Q1 2019. Commercial EBITDA declined due to the lower aviation volumes, inventory losses and, once again, the one-offs in Q1 2020, whereas we had one-off recoveries present in Q1 2019.
And finally, a few comments about our cash flow and capital structure. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to stable cash flows as well as positive working capital movements. Working capital requirement reduced as a result of decrease in trade receivables as well as in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in trade payables, given the big swings in oil prices and the decline in our volumes towards the end of the quarter.
As of 31st of March, we have a very strong liquidity position of USD 2.2 billion in the form of $1.4 billion in cash. And then we have a revolving unutilized credit facility of USD 750 million. And our existing term debt is maturing at the end of 2022 with no covenants in place. As a result, the balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x as of 31st of March. However, when adjusting for the final dividend that got paid early days of April, the adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 0.55x, strong as such at the end of March 2020.
Now let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered resilient underlying results in Q1 2020. While demand for fuel and nonfuel products may take time to recover to normalized levels, we expect decline in volumes to be partially offset by various management initiatives and higher retail volume margin in the short term. As retail pump prices for the months of April and May have remained comparatively high despite drop in crude oil prices. Our ability in managing our capital expenditures and cost base as well as our diverse product platform and strong balance sheet provide us with an important flexibility to respond in this volatile operating environment. We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans in a disciplined manner as well as delivering an enhanced customer experience, both of which are expected to drive future earnings growth.
We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. We remain confident that we will responsibly manage the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments.

In terms of forward-looking and going forward, we cannot really make any estimates or forecast for how long, et cetera. But given that we are in second quarter, we can limit ourselves and then have some visibility for the Q2 itself. Partially offsetting the lower volumes, we've stated that April month retail volumes are down by 40%, whereas our commercial volumes are down half of that at minus 20%."

So I'm trying to understand, when it goes through of course writing down inventory, what is that inventory write-down? Is it the excess of, say, what you got versus what you're going to sell it for or is it something different? That's my first question.
And then secondly, on the volume impact. I appreciate if you could give me a breakdown on commercials and the reason I'm asking about is because aviation is about 25% of your volumes. So I was surprised to hear that you only lost only 20% for the month of April.
And then finally, on the dividend. From what I look on Slide 6, it looks like you've got an intention of paying 75% on earnings from 2021. Should I take that would be at least the same in dollar terms as the year before? Or is that -- is it a progressive dividend is what I'm saying with the floor?"

So if I take the first one on the inventory valuation. So it's relatively straightforward. Bearing in mind that we have the backstop guarantee provided by ADNOC parent company, so we have very limited downside in terms of inventory volumes carried for retail business. Of course, retail volumes overall represent 2/3, close to 70% of our total sales volumes. So mainly the exposure is coming from our corporate volumes as well as aviation volumes.
And if you just look at the first quarter itself, you can see that our gross profit has taken a more serious hit because the inventory -- net realizable value, NRV, valuation as per IFRS had to be booked. We've managed, of course, our inventories. Nominal inventories are down in line with our view about the oil market, so there's a tactical element to some degree as well. And that was partly the reason why working capital and inventory levels at the end of March were down compared to earlier periods."

So regarding the dividend policy and especially the 75% -- minimum 75% distributable profit, let me, first of all, start with what is our dividend policy. So during the general assembly 1 month back on 31st of March, the company shareholders approved a couple of things. So first of all, the segment and final dividend payment of $300 million for the year of 2019 -- in 2019. And this dividend payment came on the top of an interim dividend of $325 million for the year, which was paid in October 2019. All in all, the -- this resulted in a full dividend payment of $650 million. So this is consistent with our dividend policy approved by the shareholders in 2019 and representing a 62% increase versus 2018.
Then the -- during the general assembly, we maintained the company's 2020 dividend policy, which is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, an increase of 7.5% compared to 2019, and this is for 2020. Amendments to the dividend policy for 2021 onwards with an expected dividend of $700 million for 2021, okay, compared to a minimum 75% of the distributable profit as the previous policy. And the dividend equals to at least 75% of the distributable income for 2022 onwards. And this is obviously subject to the discussion of the Board of Directors and the shareholder approval. So we said clearly, the minimum 75% will not provide obviously today if it's -- this 75% means a number that we can compare to 2021. The philosophy of the company is that we have strong balance sheet. We have ample cash reserves. We invest in growth. This is our priority in the future business. And we have set clearly a minimum of dividend for our shareholders with 2020 and 2021 clearly stated as per the statement that I made and also beyond this with a minimum 75% payout."

Is it a reflection of your business model being very strong and thinking that we'll do well no matter how the economic situation of the country is?

And whenever that happens, rather than put our growth plans on the back burner and pick them up at that point, we've contemplated on this point, and the decision we made is that we keep our growth on track. Particularly, as we pointed out, we are not going to set back is the Dubai jurisdiction. Why? Because any time we open a station there, those are organic volume that we are not capturing today. So while we will continue to focus on our growth and expansion plans, you've seen because of the constraints, the numbers have been slightly revised downward, that both on the same-store refurbishment side as well as the number of stations we had committed to a few months back. It went from 60 to now it's 50 to 60. But we haven't moved away from is the number of stations we intend to open in Dubai. Again, that's the resiliency in our business model.

What happened and just to build on what Mohamed Al Hashemi was saying is we had a target of 60 -- minimum 60 stations for this year. We have now come down to 50 to 60. But if you look at the way we have looked at our numbers is, first of all, the first half, if you remember well, we said roughly 40 to 45 stations in H1. And we are putting this number at 50. And then we believe that the situation will improve gradually. And the 50 based on the fact that we have today, 75% completion. On the C-store side, we have clearly factored the COVID impact today. We had a target of 100 C-stores to be revitalized this year. More towards Q2, Q3 and Q4. And we have banked this number to 40 to 50 as per the feedback from our development business team, actually looking at each of the C-stores and how we believe we can deliver the digitalization program.

So first of all, it is good to remember that the core part of our Retail fuel business. We don't really have exposures given that the whole business nature is cash-based or people pay with credit cards or ADNOC Wallet and Mobile pay, et cetera. So where we have exposures is in the commercial part, where we have 3 categories of customers. We have government-related entities, where we do not request typically any bank guarantees. We have nongovernment-related parties where we have substantially, in most cases, bank guarantees issued by creditory banks. And then we have a third bucket of nongovernment-related customers without bank guarantees. This would include also our food and beverage, F&P tenants across our retail network as rental agreements are regarded. So basically, the external metrics are very clear. When we look at credit default swaps and other metrics that can be considered in this market for the banks that have issued bank guarantees or even for the government entities, clearly, as indications are that the prudent provisioning is required. And indeed, we have doubled the amount of bad provisions as of 31st of March. We continue monitoring the developments very carefully and closely. And this is, of course, a recurring evaluation once we get to the end of Q2."

So you made a reference to the Expo being postponed from 2020 to 2021. So our whole strategy, the growth strategy, particularly in Dubai, is based on capturing a segment of the market that we do not capture in any way, shape or form today outside of the 11 stations that we have here today. So when we say, when we focus on Dubai, the Expo piece was the added potential uplift. But today, even in present market conditions, I'm better off, we are better off, opening a station in Dubai than not having a station there or opening a station anywhere else in the UAE because that is the offensive part of the strategy. That is where we capture volumes that are not part of our system today. We are not selling those volumes today. These are not volumes that are cannibalized from 1 station ADNOC Distribution versus another ADNOC Distribution station. That is the processed cornerstone of our strategy, particularly when it comes to the expansion in Dubai. So again, hopefully, this answers your question. Expo being kicked out, postponed by a year. That's fine. Has no detrimental impact on our expansion plans in Dubai.
Once again, alluding back to the earlier question, yes, we've revised our estimate of the number of stations we can possibly deliver in 2020. And the number of C-stores we hope to have refurbished in 2020, as Ahmed pointed out as well, we've revised that. To keep in mind that the lockdown has constrained mobility of our contractors and labors. Hence, we expect some kind of an impact there. Outside of that, we're fully conscious, aware. We don't know when the crisis will end. But as soon as it does, which gradually as it ends, gradually as the markets pick up, we want our growth to be on track, particularly, coming back to the Dubai side.

We're seeing as we originally said 60 stations at least, out of which 20 to 25 in Dubai, that continues, but the 60 is now 50 to 60 in light of the crisis. So 20 to 25 in Dubai and the remaining across Abu Dhabi and the other Emirates. So you raised a point where you said, why not put those on hold? But the ones that are opening up, particularly in Dubai, I have said this on 2 other questions, it's an important part of the strategy. It's irrespective of the crisis going on at the moment. At some point, we cannot anticipate nor do we want to predict when it's going to end. But at some point, we will. Even during the crisis, it makes sense to have stations in Dubai. Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirate, there's a larger play here that is also for nonfuel retail. What we found out, particularly with the stations that we've opened up in the past few weeks, Q1 2020, the ones where we're piloting the home delivery, those neighborhoods, on the go stations that are a big part of what we're rolling out in Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates, they are returning absolutely good results. 
Customer feedback has been absolutely positive. That was the intent to be in the neighborhoods, that's the defensive part of the strategy, but also the second part is take that nonfuel retail piece to people, our customers in the neighborhood. Well, because of the crisis, where we got lucky, where we're able to exploit a part of this crisis was the nonfuel retail piece, something we had been contemplating and building up, which is the online delivery. Now that has taken off where we piloted. It's taken off, it's increased the basket size, and we are set to roll it out across a wider part of our network. And that -- for that, beyond on the go station, the neighborhood stations are important. So I'm confident, we are confident the way we're progressing in light of the crisis, we've contemplated, we've relooked at the strategy. It is important that we continue and wait while even the volumes are low, there's other parts of the business that are doing well, exceptionally well in light because of the crisis. So I'm still confident we made the right decision to progress as is.
The second part of your question was -- remind me again."

We have brought a solution, which is the on the go station, compact stations, which have much lower CapEx requirements and can leave us the opportunity to protect our market because this is where we have 100% market share. 
So the way we are adapting to the market conditions is to still, and thanks to the balance sheet that we have, focusing on Dubai. And choosing -- have a much more, I would say, linear approach on the other address through an answer on the go station. Last point on Dubai, the volumes, as Mohamed was mentioning. If you look at the total volume that we have, average is 18 -- 17 million, 18 million liters per station per year. In Dubai, you are above this number. And this was our investment case for the past 1.5 years to clearly say, should we go to Dubai? If yes, what will be the returns?

So first of all, if you look at the UAE, actually, the -- in the UAE, there is a stable regulatory environment for the pump prices. So UAE pump prices are set monthly by committee in which ADNOC Distribution is represented by our CEO, Ahmed Al Shamsi. So the pump prices countries of the base price and the regulated unit margin that has not changed since August 2015, [indiscernible]. 
So and then although there is no change in the margin that is currently contemplated. Any reduction will be backstopped by ADNOC Group. So our main shareholder, throughout December 2022. So the short answer is, in the UAE, since end of 2015, the pump prices and the margins are regulated, offering us minimum margin of roughly 22% gross profit margin, if you look at the historical trend. And the additional, I would say, trick that we have compared to the 2 other competitors is given the shareholders that we have, at the IPO, we have been able to get a backstop for the fuel retail margin in case there is inventory losses. We will not incur any inventory loss, and we'll have a minimum margin. And we can also benefit from higher pump prices, which leads to inventory gains."

And good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
Before we take you through our first quarter results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. In Q1 2020, we have shown strength and agility as a business. We have taken and will continue to take every step to ensure the health and well-being of our employees and our customers, which includes daily cleaning of sites and providing personal protective equipment to our front-line colleagues. During this period, we have strengthened our focus and understanding customers' needs by engaging with them and staying connected. We were quick to adapt our products and services to the evolving situation and took this as an opportunity to accelerate our digital transformation strategy. We widened our portfolio of services, such as enhancing contactless payment technology, a new low-cost grocery essentials range at our ADNOC Oasis stores, online home delivery for more than 1,000 of our Oasis products, mobile fuel delivery services and complementary car interior sanitization with every auto carwash.
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first quarter and outlook for 2020. Despite the challenging operating environment and the uncertainties ahead, our core business fundamentals remain robust and resilient, and we are well in place to navigate the current times. The company has demonstrated resilience in Q1 2020, with underlying EBITDA, excluding inventory movements and one-offs, increasing by 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Adjusting for one-offs, which Petri will talk about in details while discussing financial performance, the company's earnings showed growth despite impact of COVID-19 in the month of March. Cash flow generation remained strong during the quarter, and the company maintained a strong financial position at the end of March 2020 with ample liquidity to help weather the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments. We also remain focused on our business strategy of smart growth and bringing further efficiencies in our operations.
For the full year 2020, we expect to attend 50 to 60 new stations in the UAE. We have assessed the impact of COVID-19 on our business plan and capital structure. We maintain our CapEx guidance of $300 million to $400 million in 2020, reiterating our commitment to deliver smart growth beyond 2020 and offer best-in-class services to our customers. We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. Our focus is to ensure CapEx is allocated more efficiently towards our growth and value assertive Dubai expansion. We are, therefore, targeting 20 to 25 new stations in Dubai, the majority of which will be traditional stations.
Delivering on our international expansion also remains integral to our ambitious smart growth strategy. We continue to assess potential opportunities to achieve disciplined growth and operational success, while targeting the highest return on investment.
In our nonfuel business, we remain focused on providing superior customer experience, and we'll continue with our convenience store revitalization program. As a company, we are always looking to optimize our cost base, ensuring our margins and cash flows remain healthy.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by a progressive dividend policy, smart growth and supported by strong balance sheet. For 2020, company's dividend policy is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to Board and shareholders' approval.
I will now hand over to Mohamed for an update on our strategy. Thank you."

First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes",1585,"Thank you, Ahmed. First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.
In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes we've sold has decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Commercial fuel volumes on the other hand remained stable year-on-year. Retail fuel volumes declined by 1.9% compared to the same period last year despite growth acceleration in the first 2 months of 2020, but this was mainly due to the business impact of COVID-19 in the month of March.
Our school, retail malls and offices had started to close starting in the month of March. We saw an impact on demand, and we saw that impact in both fuel and nonfuel sales. So the full impact of the COVID-19 restrictions became apparent in the month of April. This is when our retail fuel sales volume declined by around 40%.
Commercial fuel sales volume in the month of April declined by around 20%. So despite this decline in volumes in the short term, we do expect the impact on our EBITDA to be partially mitigated. Now this is on account of various initiatives that we've undertaken, like widening our portfolio of services, optimizing our operating expenditure as well as support we've received due to the higher retail fuel margin in the short term. The retail pump prices for the months of April and May 2020 have not dropped in line with crude oil prices.
So despite the challenging operating environment, we continue to deliver on our growth strategy. We've opened 7 new stations in the first quarter of 2020 and 3 additional stations in the month of April. So of the 10 new stations that we opened in the UAE across the UAE in April alone, 5 of these were in Dubai. So total number of fuel stations we now operate in Dubai is 11.
Now as part of our drive to effectively tackle competition with faster and more efficient deployment of our fuel stations and while also optimizing our capital expenditure, we also opened our first 5 ADNOC on the go neighborhood service stations in Abu Dhabi as of April 2020.
So I'd like to give you a brief update -- further update on the construction progress of our new stations. New stations that we were expecting to open during the first half of 2020 are now in advanced stages of completion from a construction standpoint. However, the COVID-19 situation has reduced our productivity of the labor at these sites, given the mobility restrictions of our labor. This would also have an impact on our ability to make these stations fully operational in time. So we now expect to open around 15 additional stations by the first half of 2020. And these stations under progress, under construction at the moment have achieved an average completion rate of around 75%. So this makes us very confident in achieving our target. While some of the stations we expected to be operational during the first half of 2020 have now been pushed back to the second half of 2020. We still expect to open 50 to 60 new stations in 2020. This is, of course, versus the 60 stations that we guided to earlier.
As we continue to innovate and seek new ways to grow our fuels business, we've also extended our current B2B mobile fuel delivery services that we call My Station. We've extended this to retail customers in select areas of Abu Dhabi. We've already deployed about 8 trailers and 22 trucks to provide effectively on-demand fuel delivery to serve our large customers as part of our growth plan and our commitment to providing our customers with a fast and reliable fueling service.
In addition to the 30 mobile assets that serve our B2B business, we continue to see opportunities to grow our mobile fuel delivery service in both B2B and B2C segments. So we've got 15 new trucks that are set to join our existing fleet during 2020. We will continue to explore options to further expand this service to enhance the overall customer experience, whether that's B2B or B2C.
Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy. We're in various stages of discussions with several players in different markets to expand organically as well as pursuing inorganic opportunities. Obviously, the ongoing travel restriction could impact the overall timing of concluding these discussions. So we will announce further updates at an appropriate time.
Moving on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience stores network increased to 269 in March -- as of end of March 2020. So we've added 5 new convenience stores in the UAE during Q1 2020. Our focus on category management contributed to an increase in average gross basket size by 12% year-on-year in Q1 2020. Our convenience store revitalization program that we introduced to you the last time was expected to pick up pace starting early Q2 2020. However, given the current COVID-19 situation and safety restrictions that are in place, we are now targeting 40 to 50 convenience stores to be refurbished in 2020 phased over the rest of the year.
Also, we are accelerating our digital transformation strategy, particularly in response to the current pandemic, which has evolved the needs of our customers, thereby enhancing the company's position as the best-in-class fuel and convenience retailer.
[Audio Gap] 
a key element of it. A key element of our digital transformation strategy has been providing customers with a seamless digital experience and activating advanced Mobile Pay technology, which allows our customers totally contactless refueling and payment. As a result, we saw significant uptick in the ADNOC Distribution Wallet users. This increased by more than 100,000 users in the first quarter of the year, so now the total stands at approximately 730,000 users. So obviously, we're going to continue to focus with the aim to further grow our ADNOC Wallet user base, which will allow us to deliver targeted promotional offers to our users, to our customers, thereby increasing customer loyalty.
In the second quarter of 2020, also, we will introduce a new point-based system to our ADNOC Rewards loyalty program. This will enable our customers to enable points against ADNOC Oasis convenience store products as well as the various services in the ADNOC Distribution stations.
Now we've also responded to new social distancing measures by launching a new essential products range in our convenience stores. This includes fresh food, household and health care products at a low cost -- to help customers across the UAE at a low cost. More recently, we also launched an online home delivery service of more than 1,000 products from the Oasis convenience stores. This includes groceries. This includes hot beverages. Ultimately, our aim is for the convenience and safety of our customers, particularly during the ongoing pandemic. And the service is already proving popular. We've seen an increase in basket size for the participating stores. So stores which have participated in the online home delivery service, the basket size has gone up quite significantly.
We've also currently piloted this theme in 12 of our stores. So far, the results are very encouraging, and the customer feedback is very positive. So we see a great opportunity in our recently launched online food and grocery delivery service from our ADNOC Oasis convenience stores. Now we're expecting the hope to expand this service to more convenience stores by the end of this year. We're confident that we will because this supports our ambition of sustaining strong growth in our nonfuel offering.
Finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiatives. That is, of course, the third pillar of our strategic plan. Now during the first quarter of 2020, there was an increase in like-for-like operating expenditure by USD 4 million compared to Q1 2019. Now this increase was mainly due to an increase in maintenance as well as smart technology utilities costs.
In addition, total operating expenditure also increased due to the cost of additional staff to implement the free assisted fueling, given that we have completely dropped the Flex initiative. So this was in line with our guidance and pertaining to our growth and new stations operating expenditure. So we remain focused on accelerating delivery of our cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives. We are now moving in the process of moving to a more efficient and effective retail site operating model. This allows us to focus on staffing optimization as well as staff redeployment leading to a like-for-like reduction in full-time employees per station.
We are also accelerating operating efficiency as well as the asset optimization initiatives across our network. In light of those initiatives, we will reiterate our target of like-for-like OpEx savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020. Now in line with our guidance and plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we've spent $50 million during the first quarter of the year. Now this is much higher than the Q1 2019 capital expenditure of USD 13 million. This, of course, reiterates our commitment to deliver growth beyond 2020, while providing best-in-class services to our customers.
Of course, we will continue to improve CapEx efficiency, including the rollout of Flex capital-intensive station format, such as ADNOC on the go and My Station.
At this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, from my side as well. As stated by Ahmed and Mohamed, we've delivered resilient financial and operational performance during the first quarter despite the challenging operating environment.Q1",1062,"Many thanks, Mohamed. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, from my side as well. As stated by Ahmed and Mohamed, we've delivered resilient financial and operational performance during the first quarter despite the challenging operating environment.
Q1 2020 revenue increased by 3.6% compared to last year, driven by an increase in fuel retail revenues. This was, of course, as a result of higher pump prices and higher corporate volumes, partially offset by lower volumes in our retail and aviation businesses as well as lower nonfuel retail revenues.
Q2 2020 gross profit is at USD 302 million, representing a decrease of 3.1% compared to last year. Fuel retail business posted strong operating performance. However, total gross profit for the first quarter was negatively impacted by USD 16 million due to inventory losses and other one-offs in the commercial business, whereas last year, first quarter included one-off recoveries of $15 million at gross profit level. So when excluding these inventory losses and one-offs, Q1 2020 total gross profit grew at 7.1% compared to last year.
First quarter EBITDA was USD 151 million, representing a decrease of 24.1% over Q1 '19. Reported EBITDA was negatively impacted by a total of USD 20 million in Q1 2020 due to inventory losses as well as prudent provisioning on trade receivables and other one-offs, whereas last year was benefiting from one-off reversals of prior period accruals as well as recoveries totaling $36 million. Hence, our underlying EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA excluding inventory losses as well as one-offs, remained resilient with a growth of 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Net profit for the first quarter is at USD 109 million, declining by 30.9% compared to last year, and once again, mainly due to the inventory losses as well as one-off losses for the first quarter as well as due to the presence of the one-off gains I mentioned for Q1 last year. However, adjusting for these elements, we've reported earnings at 6% up despite the business impact of COVID-19 for the month of March. And finally, cash generation remained strong with free cash flow of USD 145 million for the first quarter.
Okay. Let me now briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for the first quarter. Total fuel volumes decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of last year. This is mainly as a result of the business impact of COVID-19 in March. However, in the period prior to COVID-19, we actually saw higher year-on-year growth compared to Q3 as well as Q4 of 2019. Our commercial fuel volumes were up marginally, 5.1% year-on-year, driven by an increase in corporate volumes by 1.9% and partially offset by a decrease of 4.9% in aviation volumes sold to our strategic customers in the first quarter.
In the nonfuel business, transactions decreased by 17.1% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of vouchers after implementing free assisted fueling, as Mohamed mentioned. This was effective November 2019 as well as the impact of COVID-19, once again, in the month of March. However, average gross basket size has increased by 12% year-on-year, driven by improvement in category management and also as a result of the COVID-19, once again, with customers visiting less frequently, but spending more during each visit.
I'm now moving on to talk about gross profit performance by segment. Firstly, let me also highlight and remind that effective this first quarter 2020, we've implemented new segment reporting structure, which is based on natural categorization of our businesses into 2 buckets of retail or B2C and commercial B2B segments. First quarter retail segment gross profit increased by 9.5%, driven by fuel retail business. Fuel retail business posted strong operating performance with gross profit growth of 13.1% year-on-year. And this is on the back of higher retail fuel margins, reduction impact from the costs following renegotiation of our fuel supply contract effective last November as well as higher retail volumes during the first 2 months of the year.
Our nonfuel gross profit in the retail decreased by 7.5% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of the voucher redemption I already mentioned as a result of implementing free assisted fueling, together with the impact from COVID-19 in March.
Commercial business performance was negatively impacted by USD 16 million at gross profit level. This is due to the revaluation of our inventory, our stock at the end of March, USD 10 million following lower oil prices as well as one-off items of $6 million. Whereas in Q1 2019, we had one-off recoveries of USD 15 million. Excluding the inventory losses and one-offs for the commercial business, commercial gross profit would have grown by 1.6% year-on-year.
And moving on to EBITDA per segment. Q1 retail EBITDA declined due to the lower fuel volumes as well as the additional cost of staff to implement the free assisted fueling and the OpEx related to new stations and, of course, due to the presence of OpEx reversals, I mentioned, in Q1 2019. Commercial EBITDA declined due to the lower aviation volumes, inventory losses and, once again, the one-offs in Q1 2020, whereas we had one-off recoveries present in Q1 2019.
And finally, a few comments about our cash flow and capital structure. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to stable cash flows as well as positive working capital movements. Working capital requirement reduced as a result of decrease in trade receivables as well as in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in trade payables, given the big swings in oil prices and the decline in our volumes towards the end of the quarter.
As of 31st of March, we have a very strong liquidity position of USD 2.2 billion in the form of $1.4 billion in cash. And then we have a revolving unutilized credit facility of USD 750 million. And our existing term debt is maturing at the end of 2022 with no covenants in place. As a result, the balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x as of 31st of March. However, when adjusting for the final dividend that got paid early days of April, the adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 0.55x, strong as such at the end of March 2020.
Now let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered resilient underlying results in Q1 2020. While demand for fuel and nonfuel products may take time to recover to normalized levels, we expect decline in volumes to be partially offset by various management initiatives and higher retail volume margin in the short term. As retail pump prices for the months of April and May have remained comparatively high despite drop in crude oil prices. Our ability in managing our capital expenditures and cost base as well as our diverse product platform and strong balance sheet provide us with an important flexibility to respond in this volatile operating environment. We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans in a disciplined manner as well as delivering an enhanced customer experience, both of which are expected to drive future earnings growth.
We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. We remain confident that we will responsibly manage the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments.

And of course, given what's going on in terms of oil market and product prices, the Ministry of Energy, who regulates the pump prices on a monthly basis in UAE has made a decision to maintain pump prices.
In terms of forward-looking and going forward, we cannot really make any estimates or forecast for how long, et cetera. But given that we are in second quarter, we can limit ourselves and then have some visibility for the Q2 itself. Partially offsetting the lower volumes, we've stated that April month retail volumes are down by 40%, whereas our commercial volumes are down half of that at minus 20%."

So I'm trying to understand, when it goes through of course writing down inventory, what is that inventory write-down? Is it the excess of, say, what you got versus what you're going to sell it for or is it something different? That's my first question.
And then secondly, on the volume impact. I appreciate if you could give me a breakdown on commercials and the reason I'm asking about is because aviation is about 25% of your volumes. So I was surprised to hear that you only lost only 20% for the month of April.
And then finally, on the dividend. From what I look on Slide 6, it looks like you've got an intention of paying 75% on earnings from 2021. Should I take that would be at least the same in dollar terms as the year before? Or is that -- is it a progressive dividend is what I'm saying with the floor?"

Bearing in mind that we have the backstop guarantee provided by ADNOC parent company, so we have very limited downside in terms of inventory volumes carried for retail business. Of course, retail volumes overall represent 2/3, close to 70% of our total sales volumes. So mainly the exposure is coming from our corporate volumes as well as aviation volumes.
And if you just look at the first quarter itself, you can see that our gross profit has taken a more serious hit because the inventory -- net realizable value, NRV, valuation as per IFRS had to be booked. We've managed, of course, our inventories. Nominal inventories are down in line with our view about the oil market, so there's a tactical element to some degree as well.

So regarding the dividend policy and especially the 75% -- minimum 75% distributable profit, let me, first of all, start with what is our dividend policy. So during the general assembly 1 month back on 31st of March, the company shareholders approved a couple of things. So first of all, the segment and final dividend payment of $300 million for the year of 2019 -- in 2019. And this dividend payment came on the top of an interim dividend of $325 million for the year, which was paid in October 2019. All in all, the -- this resulted in a full dividend payment of $650 million. So this is consistent with our dividend policy approved by the shareholders in 2019 and representing a 62% increase versus 2018.
Then the -- during the general assembly, we maintained the company's 2020 dividend policy, which is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, an increase of 7.5% compared to 2019, and this is for 2020. Amendments to the dividend policy for 2021 onwards with an expected dividend of $700 million for 2021, okay, compared to a minimum 75% of the distributable profit as the previous policy. And the dividend equals to at least 75% of the distributable income for 2022 onwards. And this is obviously subject to the discussion of the Board of Directors and the shareholder approval. So we said clearly, the minimum 75% will not provide obviously today if it's -- this 75% means a number that we can compare to 2021. The philosophy of the company is that we have strong balance sheet. We have ample cash reserves. We invest in growth. This is our priority in the future business. And we have set clearly a minimum of dividend for our shareholders with 2020 and 2021 clearly stated as per the statement that I made and also beyond this with a minimum 75% payout."

Particularly, as we pointed out, we are not going to set back is the Dubai jurisdiction. Why? Because any time we open a station there, those are organic volume that we are not capturing today. So while we will continue to focus on our growth and expansion plans, you've seen because of the constraints, the numbers have been slightly revised downward, that both on the same-store refurbishment side as well as the number of stations we had committed to a few months back. It went from 60 to now it's 50 to 60. But we haven't moved away from is the number of stations we intend to open in Dubai. Again, that's the resiliency in our business model.

We have nongovernment-related parties where we have substantially, in most cases, bank guarantees issued by creditory banks. And then we have a third bucket of nongovernment-related customers without bank guarantees. This would include also our food and beverage, F&P tenants across our retail network as rental agreements are regarded. So basically, the external metrics are very clear. When we look at credit default swaps and other metrics that can be considered in this market for the banks that have issued bank guarantees or even for the government entities, clearly, as indications are that the prudent provisioning is required. And indeed, we have doubled the amount of bad provisions as of 31st of March. We continue monitoring the developments very carefully and closely.

So our whole strategy, the growth strategy, particularly in Dubai, is based on capturing a segment of the market that we do not capture in any way, shape or form today outside of the 11 stations that we have here today. So when we say, when we focus on Dubai, the Expo piece was the added potential uplift. But today, even in present market conditions, I'm better off, we are better off, opening a station in Dubai than not having a station there or opening a station anywhere else in the UAE because that is the offensive part of the strategy. That is where we capture volumes that are not part of our system today. We are not selling those volumes today. These are not volumes that are cannibalized from 1 station ADNOC Distribution versus another ADNOC Distribution station. That is the processed cornerstone of our strategy, particularly when it comes to the expansion in Dubai. So again, hopefully, this answers your question. Expo being kicked out, postponed by a year. That's fine. Has no detrimental impact on our expansion plans in Dubai.
Once again, alluding back to the earlier question, yes, we've revised our estimate of the number of stations we can possibly deliver in 2020. And the number of C-stores we hope to have refurbished in 2020, as Ahmed pointed out as well, we've revised that. To keep in mind that the lockdown has constrained mobility of our contractors and labors. Hence, we expect some kind of an impact there. Outside of that, we're fully conscious, aware. We don't know when the crisis will end.

And I guess, this would be something that any business that has customer trade receivables unfortunately, in the current circumstances, would need to evaluate. It's not an easy exercise. It's a fluid picture. And hence, we need to carefully consider what's going on during the second quarter. Including every relevant customer segment, including the F&P tenants that we have across our retail network in UAE."

Today, we have a COVID situation. But looking at even the impact of COVID, you can see that this company is able to generate substantial cash flows, plus the balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA 0.1 gives you room to anyway, be able to raise that to invest. And I would say that the way to look at this company is operating cash flows are able to match with the dividend in a normal circumstances, and we have room to invest and to increase -- to use our cash to invest in future growth plus using potentially our $750 million of credit facility if requires for future growth.

We're seeing as we originally said 60 stations at least, out of which 20 to 25 in Dubai, that continues, but the 60 is now 50 to 60 in light of the crisis. So 20 to 25 in Dubai and the remaining across Abu Dhabi and the other Emirates. So you raised a point where you said, why not put those on hold? But the ones that are opening up, particularly in Dubai, I have said this on 2 other questions, it's an important part of the strategy. It's irrespective of the crisis going on at the moment. At some point, we cannot anticipate nor do we want to predict when it's going to end. But at some point, we will. Even during the crisis, it makes sense to have stations in Dubai. Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirate, there's a larger play here that is also for nonfuel retail. What we found out, particularly with the stations that we've opened up in the past few weeks, Q1 2020, the ones where we're piloting the home delivery, those neighborhoods, on the go stations that are a big part of what we're rolling out in Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates, they are returning absolutely good results. 
Customer feedback has been absolutely positive. That was the intent to be in the neighborhoods, that's the defensive part of the strategy, but also the second part is take that nonfuel retail piece to people, our customers in the neighborhood. Well, because of the crisis, where we got lucky, where we're able to exploit a part of this crisis was the nonfuel retail piece, something we had been contemplating and building up, which is the online delivery. Now that has taken off where we piloted. It's taken off, it's increased the basket size, and we are set to roll it out across a wider part of our network. And that -- for that, beyond on the go station, the neighborhood stations are important. So I'm confident, we are confident the way we're progressing in light of the crisis, we've contemplated, we've relooked at the strategy. It is important that we continue and wait while even the volumes are low, there's other parts of the business that are doing well, exceptionally well in light because of the crisis. So I'm still confident we made the right decision to progress as is.
The second part of your question was -- remind me again."

So the way we are adapting to the market conditions is to still, and thanks to the balance sheet that we have, focusing on Dubai.

If you look at the total volume that we have, average is 18 -- 17 million, 18 million liters per station per year. In Dubai, you are above this number.

Are you talking about the business? Yes. On the fuel retail. Business. Sorry, I was -- sorry. So first of all, if you look at the UAE, actually, the -- in the UAE, there is a stable regulatory environment for the pump prices. So UAE pump prices are set monthly by committee in which ADNOC Distribution is represented by our CEO, Ahmed Al Shamsi. So the pump prices countries of the base price and the regulated unit margin that has not changed since August 2015, [indiscernible]. 
So and then although there is no change in the margin that is currently contemplated. Any reduction will be backstopped by ADNOC Group. So our main shareholder, throughout December 2022. So the short answer is, in the UAE, since end of 2015, the pump prices and the margins are regulated, offering us minimum margin of roughly 22% gross profit margin, if you look at the historical trend. And the additional, I would say, trick that we have compared to the 2 other competitors is given the shareholders that we have, at the IPO, we have been able to get a backstop for the fuel retail margin in case there is inventory losses. We will not incur any inventory loss, and we'll have a minimum margin. And we can also benefit from higher pump prices, which leads to inventory gains."

And good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
Before we take you through our first quarter results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. In Q1 2020, we have shown strength and agility as a business. We have taken and will continue to take every step to ensure the health and well-being of our employees and our customers, which includes daily cleaning of sites and providing personal protective equipment to our front-line colleagues. During this period, we have strengthened our focus and understanding customers' needs by engaging with them and staying connected. We were quick to adapt our products and services to the evolving situation and took this as an opportunity to accelerate our digital transformation strategy. We widened our portfolio of services, such as enhancing contactless payment technology, a new low-cost grocery essentials range at our ADNOC Oasis stores, online home delivery for more than 1,000 of our Oasis products, mobile fuel delivery services and complementary car interior sanitization with every auto carwash.
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first quarter and outlook for 2020. Despite the challenging operating environment and the uncertainties ahead, our core business fundamentals remain robust and resilient, and we are well in place to navigate the current times. The company has demonstrated resilience in Q1 2020, with underlying EBITDA, excluding inventory movements and one-offs, increasing by 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Adjusting for one-offs, which Petri will talk about in details while discussing financial performance, the company's earnings showed growth despite impact of COVID-19 in the month of March. Cash flow generation remained strong during the quarter, and the company maintained a strong financial position at the end of March 2020 with ample liquidity to help weather the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments. We also remain focused on our business strategy of smart growth and bringing further efficiencies in our operations.
For the full year 2020, we expect to attend 50 to 60 new stations in the UAE. We have assessed the impact of COVID-19 on our business plan and capital structure. We maintain our CapEx guidance of $300 million to $400 million in 2020, reiterating our commitment to deliver smart growth beyond 2020 and offer best-in-class services to our customers. We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. Our focus is to ensure CapEx is allocated more efficiently towards our growth and value assertive Dubai expansion. We are, therefore, targeting 20 to 25 new stations in Dubai, the majority of which will be traditional stations.
Delivering on our international expansion also remains integral to our ambitious smart growth strategy. We continue to assess potential opportunities to achieve disciplined growth and operational success, while targeting the highest return on investment.
In our nonfuel business, we remain focused on providing superior customer experience, and we'll continue with our convenience store revitalization program. As a company, we are always looking to optimize our cost base, ensuring our margins and cash flows remain healthy.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by a progressive dividend policy, smart growth and supported by strong balance sheet. For 2020, company's dividend policy is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to Board and shareholders' approval.
I will now hand over to Mohamed for an update on our strategy. Thank you."

First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes",1585,"Thank you, Ahmed. First of all, good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me begin by giving you an update on our fuels business, which, of course, includes our B2C and B2B segments.
In the first quarter of 2020, our total fuel volumes we've sold has decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Commercial fuel volumes on the other hand remained stable year-on-year. Retail fuel volumes declined by 1.9% compared to the same period last year despite growth acceleration in the first 2 months of 2020, but this was mainly due to the business impact of COVID-19 in the month of March.
Our school, retail malls and offices had started to close starting in the month of March. We saw an impact on demand, and we saw that impact in both fuel and nonfuel sales. So the full impact of the COVID-19 restrictions became apparent in the month of April. This is when our retail fuel sales volume declined by around 40%.
Commercial fuel sales volume in the month of April declined by around 20%. So despite this decline in volumes in the short term, we do expect the impact on our EBITDA to be partially mitigated. Now this is on account of various initiatives that we've undertaken, like widening our portfolio of services, optimizing our operating expenditure as well as support we've received due to the higher retail fuel margin in the short term. The retail pump prices for the months of April and May 2020 have not dropped in line with crude oil prices.
So despite the challenging operating environment, we continue to deliver on our growth strategy. We've opened 7 new stations in the first quarter of 2020 and 3 additional stations in the month of April. So of the 10 new stations that we opened in the UAE across the UAE in April alone, 5 of these were in Dubai. So total number of fuel stations we now operate in Dubai is 11.
Now as part of our drive to effectively tackle competition with faster and more efficient deployment of our fuel stations and while also optimizing our capital expenditure, we also opened our first 5 ADNOC on the go neighborhood service stations in Abu Dhabi as of April 2020.
So I'd like to give you a brief update -- further update on the construction progress of our new stations. New stations that we were expecting to open during the first half of 2020 are now in advanced stages of completion from a construction standpoint. However, the COVID-19 situation has reduced our productivity of the labor at these sites, given the mobility restrictions of our labor. This would also have an impact on our ability to make these stations fully operational in time. So we now expect to open around 15 additional stations by the first half of 2020. And these stations under progress, under construction at the moment have achieved an average completion rate of around 75%. So this makes us very confident in achieving our target. While some of the stations we expected to be operational during the first half of 2020 have now been pushed back to the second half of 2020. We still expect to open 50 to 60 new stations in 2020. This is, of course, versus the 60 stations that we guided to earlier.
As we continue to innovate and seek new ways to grow our fuels business, we've also extended our current B2B mobile fuel delivery services that we call My Station. We've extended this to retail customers in select areas of Abu Dhabi. We've already deployed about 8 trailers and 22 trucks to provide effectively on-demand fuel delivery to serve our large customers as part of our growth plan and our commitment to providing our customers with a fast and reliable fueling service.
In addition to the 30 mobile assets that serve our B2B business, we continue to see opportunities to grow our mobile fuel delivery service in both B2B and B2C segments. So we've got 15 new trucks that are set to join our existing fleet during 2020. We will continue to explore options to further expand this service to enhance the overall customer experience, whether that's B2B or B2C.
Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy. We're in various stages of discussions with several players in different markets to expand organically as well as pursuing inorganic opportunities. Obviously, the ongoing travel restriction could impact the overall timing of concluding these discussions. So we will announce further updates at an appropriate time.
Moving on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience stores network increased to 269 in March -- as of end of March 2020. So we've added 5 new convenience stores in the UAE during Q1 2020. Our focus on category management contributed to an increase in average gross basket size by 12% year-on-year in Q1 2020. Our convenience store revitalization program that we introduced to you the last time was expected to pick up pace starting early Q2 2020. However, given the current COVID-19 situation and safety restrictions that are in place, we are now targeting 40 to 50 convenience stores to be refurbished in 2020 phased over the rest of the year.
Also, we are accelerating our digital transformation strategy, particularly in response to the current pandemic, which has evolved the needs of our customers, thereby enhancing the company's position as the best-in-class fuel and convenience retailer.
[Audio Gap] 
a key element of it. A key element of our digital transformation strategy has been providing customers with a seamless digital experience and activating advanced Mobile Pay technology, which allows our customers totally contactless refueling and payment. As a result, we saw significant uptick in the ADNOC Distribution Wallet users. This increased by more than 100,000 users in the first quarter of the year, so now the total stands at approximately 730,000 users. So obviously, we're going to continue to focus with the aim to further grow our ADNOC Wallet user base, which will allow us to deliver targeted promotional offers to our users, to our customers, thereby increasing customer loyalty.
In the second quarter of 2020, also, we will introduce a new point-based system to our ADNOC Rewards loyalty program. This will enable our customers to enable points against ADNOC Oasis convenience store products as well as the various services in the ADNOC Distribution stations.
Now we've also responded to new social distancing measures by launching a new essential products range in our convenience stores. This includes fresh food, household and health care products at a low cost -- to help customers across the UAE at a low cost. More recently, we also launched an online home delivery service of more than 1,000 products from the Oasis convenience stores. This includes groceries. This includes hot beverages. Ultimately, our aim is for the convenience and safety of our customers, particularly during the ongoing pandemic. And the service is already proving popular. We've seen an increase in basket size for the participating stores. So stores which have participated in the online home delivery service, the basket size has gone up quite significantly.
We've also currently piloted this theme in 12 of our stores. So far, the results are very encouraging, and the customer feedback is very positive. So we see a great opportunity in our recently launched online food and grocery delivery service from our ADNOC Oasis convenience stores. Now we're expecting the hope to expand this service to more convenience stores by the end of this year. We're confident that we will because this supports our ambition of sustaining strong growth in our nonfuel offering.
Finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiatives. That is, of course, the third pillar of our strategic plan. Now during the first quarter of 2020, there was an increase in like-for-like operating expenditure by USD 4 million compared to Q1 2019. Now this increase was mainly due to an increase in maintenance as well as smart technology utilities costs.
In addition, total operating expenditure also increased due to the cost of additional staff to implement the free assisted fueling, given that we have completely dropped the Flex initiative. So this was in line with our guidance and pertaining to our growth and new stations operating expenditure. So we remain focused on accelerating delivery of our cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives. We are now moving in the process of moving to a more efficient and effective retail site operating model. This allows us to focus on staffing optimization as well as staff redeployment leading to a like-for-like reduction in full-time employees per station.
We are also accelerating operating efficiency as well as the asset optimization initiatives across our network. In light of those initiatives, we will reiterate our target of like-for-like OpEx savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020. Now in line with our guidance and plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we've spent $50 million during the first quarter of the year. Now this is much higher than the Q1 2019 capital expenditure of USD 13 million. This, of course, reiterates our commitment to deliver growth beyond 2020, while providing best-in-class services to our customers.
Of course, we will continue to improve CapEx efficiency, including the rollout of Flex capital-intensive station format, such as ADNOC on the go and My Station.
At this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the financial highlights of our performance."

Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, from my side as well. As stated by Ahmed and Mohamed, we've delivered resilient financial and operational performance during the first quarter despite the challenging operating environment.
Q1 2020 revenue increased by 3.6% compared to last year, driven by an increase in fuel retail revenues. This was, of course, as a result of higher pump prices and higher corporate volumes, partially offset by lower volumes in our retail and aviation businesses as well as lower nonfuel retail revenues.
Q2 2020 gross profit is at USD 302 million, representing a decrease of 3.1% compared to last year. Fuel retail business posted strong operating performance. However, total gross profit for the first quarter was negatively impacted by USD 16 million due to inventory losses and other one-offs in the commercial business, whereas last year, first quarter included one-off recoveries of $15 million at gross profit level. So when excluding these inventory losses and one-offs, Q1 2020 total gross profit grew at 7.1% compared to last year.
First quarter EBITDA was USD 151 million, representing a decrease of 24.1% over Q1 '19. Reported EBITDA was negatively impacted by a total of USD 20 million in Q1 2020 due to inventory losses as well as prudent provisioning on trade receivables and other one-offs, whereas last year was benefiting from one-off reversals of prior period accruals as well as recoveries totaling $36 million. Hence, our underlying EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA excluding inventory losses as well as one-offs, remained resilient with a growth of 4.7% compared to Q1 2019.
Net profit for the first quarter is at USD 109 million, declining by 30.9% compared to last year, and once again, mainly due to the inventory losses as well as one-off losses for the first quarter as well as due to the presence of the one-off gains I mentioned for Q1 last year. However, adjusting for these elements, we've reported earnings at 6% up despite the business impact of COVID-19 for the month of March. And finally, cash generation remained strong with free cash flow of USD 145 million for the first quarter.
Okay. Let me now briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for the first quarter. Total fuel volumes decreased by 1.2% compared to the first quarter of last year. This is mainly as a result of the business impact of COVID-19 in March. However, in the period prior to COVID-19, we actually saw higher year-on-year growth compared to Q3 as well as Q4 of 2019. Our commercial fuel volumes were up marginally, 5.1% year-on-year, driven by an increase in corporate volumes by 1.9% and partially offset by a decrease of 4.9% in aviation volumes sold to our strategic customers in the first quarter.
In the nonfuel business, transactions decreased by 17.1% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of vouchers after implementing free assisted fueling, as Mohamed mentioned. This was effective November 2019 as well as the impact of COVID-19, once again, in the month of March. However, average gross basket size has increased by 12% year-on-year, driven by improvement in category management and also as a result of the COVID-19, once again, with customers visiting less frequently, but spending more during each visit.
I'm now moving on to talk about gross profit performance by segment. Firstly, let me also highlight and remind that effective this first quarter 2020, we've implemented new segment reporting structure, which is based on natural categorization of our businesses into 2 buckets of retail or B2C and commercial B2B segments. First quarter retail segment gross profit increased by 9.5%, driven by fuel retail business. Fuel retail business posted strong operating performance with gross profit growth of 13.1% year-on-year. And this is on the back of higher retail fuel margins, reduction impact from the costs following renegotiation of our fuel supply contract effective last November as well as higher retail volumes during the first 2 months of the year.
Our nonfuel gross profit in the retail decreased by 7.5% compared to last year, and this is due to the absence of the voucher redemption I already mentioned as a result of implementing free assisted fueling, together with the impact from COVID-19 in March.
Commercial business performance was negatively impacted by USD 16 million at gross profit level. This is due to the revaluation of our inventory, our stock at the end of March, USD 10 million following lower oil prices as well as one-off items of $6 million. Whereas in Q1 2019, we had one-off recoveries of USD 15 million. Excluding the inventory losses and one-offs for the commercial business, commercial gross profit would have grown by 1.6% year-on-year.
And moving on to EBITDA per segment. Q1 retail EBITDA declined due to the lower fuel volumes as well as the additional cost of staff to implement the free assisted fueling and the OpEx related to new stations and, of course, due to the presence of OpEx reversals, I mentioned, in Q1 2019. Commercial EBITDA declined due to the lower aviation volumes, inventory losses and, once again, the one-offs in Q1 2020, whereas we had one-off recoveries present in Q1 2019.
And finally, a few comments about our cash flow and capital structure. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to stable cash flows as well as positive working capital movements. Working capital requirement reduced as a result of decrease in trade receivables as well as in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in trade payables, given the big swings in oil prices and the decline in our volumes towards the end of the quarter.
As of 31st of March, we have a very strong liquidity position of USD 2.2 billion in the form of $1.4 billion in cash. And then we have a revolving unutilized credit facility of USD 750 million. And our existing term debt is maturing at the end of 2022 with no covenants in place. As a result, the balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.1x as of 31st of March. However, when adjusting for the final dividend that got paid early days of April, the adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 0.55x, strong as such at the end of March 2020.
Now let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered resilient underlying results in Q1 2020. While demand for fuel and nonfuel products may take time to recover to normalized levels, we expect decline in volumes to be partially offset by various management initiatives and higher retail volume margin in the short term. As retail pump prices for the months of April and May have remained comparatively high despite drop in crude oil prices. Our ability in managing our capital expenditures and cost base as well as our diverse product platform and strong balance sheet provide us with an important flexibility to respond in this volatile operating environment. We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans in a disciplined manner as well as delivering an enhanced customer experience, both of which are expected to drive future earnings growth.
We are also exploring new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. We remain confident that we will responsibly manage the impact of COVID-19 on our long-term strategic commitments.
This concludes today's presentation. We are happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you."

In terms of forward-looking and going forward, we cannot really make any estimates or forecast for how long, et cetera. But given that we are in second quarter, we can limit ourselves and then have some visibility for the Q2 itself. Partially offsetting the lower volumes, we've stated that April month retail volumes are down by 40%, whereas our commercial volumes are down half of that at minus 20%."

So I'm trying to understand, when it goes through of course writing down inventory, what is that inventory write-down? Is it the excess of, say, what you got versus what you're going to sell it for or is it something different? That's my first question.
And then secondly, on the volume impact. I appreciate if you could give me a breakdown on commercials and the reason I'm asking about is because aviation is about 25% of your volumes. So I was surprised to hear that you only lost only 20% for the month of April.
And then finally, on the dividend. From what I look on Slide 6, it looks like you've got an intention of paying 75% on earnings from 2021. Should I take that would be at least the same in dollar terms as the year before? Or is that -- is it a progressive dividend is what I'm saying with the floor?"

So if I take the first one on the inventory valuation. So it's relatively straightforward. Bearing in mind that we have the backstop guarantee provided by ADNOC parent company, so we have very limited downside in terms of inventory volumes carried for retail business. Of course, retail volumes overall represent 2/3, close to 70% of our total sales volumes. So mainly the exposure is coming from our corporate volumes as well as aviation volumes.
And if you just look at the first quarter itself, you can see that our gross profit has taken a more serious hit because the inventory -- net realizable value, NRV, valuation as per IFRS had to be booked. We've managed, of course, our inventories. Nominal inventories are down in line with our view about the oil market, so there's a tactical element to some degree as well. And that was partly the reason why working capital and inventory levels at the end of March were down compared to earlier periods."

So regarding the dividend policy and especially the 75% -- minimum 75% distributable profit, let me, first of all, start with what is our dividend policy. So during the general assembly 1 month back on 31st of March, the company shareholders approved a couple of things. So first of all, the segment and final dividend payment of $300 million for the year of 2019 -- in 2019. And this dividend payment came on the top of an interim dividend of $325 million for the year, which was paid in October 2019. All in all, the -- this resulted in a full dividend payment of $650 million. So this is consistent with our dividend policy approved by the shareholders in 2019 and representing a 62% increase versus 2018.
Then the -- during the general assembly, we maintained the company's 2020 dividend policy, which is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, an increase of 7.5% compared to 2019, and this is for 2020. Amendments to the dividend policy for 2021 onwards with an expected dividend of $700 million for 2021, okay, compared to a minimum 75% of the distributable profit as the previous policy. And the dividend equals to at least 75% of the distributable income for 2022 onwards. And this is obviously subject to the discussion of the Board of Directors and the shareholder approval. So we said clearly, the minimum 75% will not provide obviously today if it's -- this 75% means a number that we can compare to 2021. The philosophy of the company is that we have strong balance sheet. We have ample cash reserves. We invest in growth. This is our priority in the future business. And we have set clearly a minimum of dividend for our shareholders with 2020 and 2021 clearly stated as per the statement that I made and also beyond this with a minimum 75% payout."

This would include also our food and beverage, F&P tenants across our retail network as rental agreements are regarded. So basically, the external metrics are very clear. When we look at credit default swaps and other metrics that can be considered in this market for the banks that have issued bank guarantees or even for the government entities, clearly, as indications are that the prudent provisioning is required. And indeed, we have doubled the amount of bad provisions as of 31st of March. We continue monitoring the developments very carefully and closely. And this is, of course, a recurring evaluation once we get to the end of Q2."

So you made a reference to the Expo being postponed from 2020 to 2021. So our whole strategy, the growth strategy, particularly in Dubai, is based on capturing a segment of the market that we do not capture in any way, shape or form today outside of the 11 stations that we have here today. So when we say, when we focus on Dubai, the Expo piece was the added potential uplift. But today, even in present market conditions, I'm better off, we are better off, opening a station in Dubai than not having a station there or opening a station anywhere else in the UAE because that is the offensive part of the strategy. That is where we capture volumes that are not part of our system today. We are not selling those volumes today. These are not volumes that are cannibalized from 1 station ADNOC Distribution versus another ADNOC Distribution station. That is the processed cornerstone of our strategy, particularly when it comes to the expansion in Dubai. So again, hopefully, this answers your question. Expo being kicked out, postponed by a year. That's fine. Has no detrimental impact on our expansion plans in Dubai.
Once again, alluding back to the earlier question, yes, we've revised our estimate of the number of stations we can possibly deliver in 2020. And the number of C-stores we hope to have refurbished in 2020, as Ahmed pointed out as well, we've revised that. To keep in mind that the lockdown has constrained mobility of our contractors and labors. Hence, we expect some kind of an impact there. Outside of that, we're fully conscious, aware. We don't know when the crisis will end. But as soon as it does, which gradually as it ends, gradually as the markets pick up, we want our growth to be on track, particularly, coming back to the Dubai side.

Today, we have a COVID situation. But looking at even the impact of COVID, you can see that this company is able to generate substantial cash flows, plus the balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA 0.1 gives you room to anyway, be able to raise that to invest. And I would say that the way to look at this company is operating cash flows are able to match with the dividend in a normal circumstances, and we have room to invest and to increase -- to use our cash to invest in future growth plus using potentially our $750 million of credit facility if requires for future growth.

So 20 to 25 in Dubai and the remaining across Abu Dhabi and the other Emirates. So you raised a point where you said, why not put those on hold? But the ones that are opening up, particularly in Dubai, I have said this on 2 other questions, it's an important part of the strategy. It's irrespective of the crisis going on at the moment. At some point, we cannot anticipate nor do we want to predict when it's going to end. But at some point, we will. Even during the crisis, it makes sense to have stations in Dubai. Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirate, there's a larger play here that is also for nonfuel retail. What we found out, particularly with the stations that we've opened up in the past few weeks, Q1 2020, the ones where we're piloting the home delivery, those neighborhoods, on the go stations that are a big part of what we're rolling out in Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates, they are returning absolutely good results. 
Customer feedback has been absolutely positive. That was the intent to be in the neighborhoods, that's the defensive part of the strategy, but also the second part is take that nonfuel retail piece to people, our customers in the neighborhood. Well, because of the crisis, where we got lucky, where we're able to exploit a part of this crisis was the nonfuel retail piece, something we had been contemplating and building up, which is the online delivery. Now that has taken off where we piloted. It's taken off, it's increased the basket size, and we are set to roll it out across a wider part of our network. And that -- for that, beyond on the go station, the neighborhood stations are important. So I'm confident, we are confident the way we're progressing in light of the crisis, we've contemplated, we've relooked at the strategy. It is important that we continue and wait while even the volumes are low, there's other parts of the business that are doing well, exceptionally well in light because of the crisis. So I'm still confident we made the right decision to progress as is.

So first of all, if you look at the UAE, actually, the -- in the UAE, there is a stable regulatory environment for the pump prices. So UAE pump prices are set monthly by committee in which ADNOC Distribution is represented by our CEO, Ahmed Al Shamsi. So the pump prices countries of the base price and the regulated unit margin that has not changed since August 2015, [indiscernible]. 
So and then although there is no change in the margin that is currently contemplated. Any reduction will be backstopped by ADNOC Group. So our main shareholder, throughout December 2022. So the short answer is, in the UAE, since end of 2015, the pump prices and the margins are regulated, offering us minimum margin of roughly 22% gross profit margin, if you look at the historical trend. And the additional, I would say, trick that we have compared to the 2 other competitors is given the shareholders that we have, at the IPO, we have been able to get a backstop for the fuel retail margin in case there is inventory losses. We will not incur any inventory loss, and we'll have a minimum margin. And we can also benefit from higher pump prices, which leads to inventory gains."

Before I take you through our first half results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. The results and protection of rigorous health and safety measures, ADD as a company ensures that stations remain open to make services accessible to the health care sector and to keep customers moving on their essential journeys. Furthermore, we implemented a range of measures to respond to evolving customer needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including new services to protect our staff and customers, such as daily deep cleaning of sites and car interior sanitization. 
Aligned with the UAE's efforts to reopen the economy, we have successfully and safely relaunched services that we have entirely suspended during the peak for COVID-19 and then including car wash, oil change and food bakery offerings in our convenience stores. We responded swiftly to the evolving environment by accelerating e-commerce strategy and launching new services to enhance customer experience. Our digital initiatives include contactless payment solutions, online delivery from our convenience and Dubai fuel and LPG delivery. 
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first half of 2020 performance and results. Despite the challenging operating environment, the company remained resilient delivering a 7.6% increase in underlying EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. We continue to make significant progress in executing smart growth strategy during the first half of 2020 by accelerating delivery of new stations and launching new services and products. The company remains on track to deliver 50 to 60 new stations by full year of 2020, which includes 20 to 25 stations in Dubai. We are constantly looking to enhance customer satisfaction and increase customer loyalty. As a result, we have launched the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fueling provider, we call this ADNOC Rewards. ADNOC Rewards is a point-based system, allowing customers to earn and redeem points upon their purchases at our service stations and convenience stores. The ADNOC Distribution mobile app, which includes the Wallet, mobile pay and the ADNOC Rewards program, now has more than 750,000 registered users. The company reinforced its commitment to sustainability and supporting customers adoption of new efficient and hybrid vehicles by launching a new range of ADNOC Voyager lubricant for hybrid vehicle engines. The new range of ADNOC Voyager vehicle engine oils is the [indiscernible] to meet the needs of the latest engine technologies to be certified by the world-leading industry body, the American Petroleum Institute. 
In LPG space, more recently, we announced a significant change in LPG pricing, introducing uniform rates for LPG cylinders sold to all our customers, whether retail or commercial across the whole country, in UAE. We expect increase in LPG cylinder rising and have positive impact on our earning, which Mohamed will share more light on. 
In nonfuel business area, we remain focused on provided superior shopping experience for our customers through revitalization program. Despite the lockdown restrictions, we were in the first half of 2020, we successfully refurbished ADNOC Oasis convenience stores, including [indiscernible] in Q2 of 2020. 
In OpEx area, we started to see initial results of our cost organization efforts. The $7 million reduction in like-for-like projects in Q2 2020, which comes after an increase of $4 million in Q1 2020. We remain on track to bring further efficiency in our operations and meet our full year targeted savings. The company maintained a robust balance sheet and remains well positioned to expand both its domestic and international portfolio, in line with our growth strategy. 
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by our progressive dividend policy that offers high dividend visibility to our shareholders. 
For 2020, company's dividend policy is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to our Board and shareholders' approval.

I'm going to start off by giving you an update on our fuel business, which, of course, includes B2C and B2B segments. 
So during the first half of 2020, as the CEO has mentioned, fuel margins have declined by 12% -- 12.2% compared to the first half of 2019. This is, of course, mainly owing to the COVID-19 impact on our retail business. 
Retail fuel volumes decreased by 17.2% year-on-year in the first half of 2020. Commercial fuel volumes, on the other hand, declined only marginally by 1.3% in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period of last year. And this was mainly due lower uplift from the [indiscernible] and aviation customers. Following the ease of lockdown and moving restrictions in the UAE, which started towards the end of May, we've noted a -- and experienced a significant recovery in fuel volumes. In the month of June and July of this year, our retail fuel volumes, which account for about [ 65% ] of our total volumes, they recovered almost 90% of volume compared to the same period last year. 
Speaking to our network expansion. We brought in 25 stations in the UAE during the first half of the year. And 18 out of those 25 were during the second quarter of the year. Now, of course, we remained focus on value exceeded Dubai expansion with the opening of 7 new stations during the first half of 2020. The performance of our Dubai stations remained strong with double-digit growth in fuel sales during the first half of the year. This was driven by new station opening in an under-penetrated market. Despite COVID-19, our Dubai fuel sales continued to grow in high single digits during the second quarter of 2020. Of course, we expect our Dubai expansion to contribute meaningfully going forward as we open more stations in the second half of 2020 and beyond. 
Continuing with our delivery momentum, we opened 7 additional stations, of those 3 in Dubai in the month of July. The due date in 2020, we have opened 32 new stations. This brings the total stations we operate in the UAE to 413. Out of the 413, 16 stations are in Dubai. As part of our strategy, we're extensively tackling competition with faster and more efficient deployment of fuel station,while also optimizing our capital expenditure. We've now opened 21 ADNOC on the go. And these are neighborhood service stations, which are both in Dubai and Abu Dhabi as of July 2020. 
During the second quarter of 2020, we also added 10 new trucks to our My Station fleet. It is to expand on demand fuel delivery service for P&C as well as B2B customers. The objective here is to, of course  provide our customers with a faster and reliable fueling service. 
As the CEO referenced before, we've announced a major change in LPG pricing, discovering the Abu Dhabi in the Northern Emirates, so the price of LPG cylinders has been increased from AED 20 to AED 35  the 25-pound cylinder. And AED 30 to AED 65 for the 50-pound canister. Now this change brings greater parity to the pricing of LPG cylinders across the UAE. Of course, you'll note that our prices are still below competitors. This, of course, gives us an opportunity to potentially expand our market share in markets where we currently are underpenetrated, such as Dubai and the Northern Emirates. 
So given the LPG still under price increase, we're expecting an uplift of approximately USD 20 million to our EBITDA on an annualized basis. 
So finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy, and we are progressing well on our international expansion strategy in Saudi Arabia, in India as well as other countries. Of course, we will announce further updates at the appropriate time, once we obtain all the approvals. 
So talking and -- about our nonfuel retail business. Let's move on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience stores have increased to 288 as of the end of June 2020. So we have added 24 new convenience stores in the UAE during the first half of the year. 
Revitalization, as you may recall, we've got our convenience store revitalization program to have slowed down at the -- during the [indiscernible] of the COVID-19 crisis. But now it's picked up pace, starting early in Q2, 2020. So during the first half of 2020, we have refurbished 11 of our Oasis convenience stores. 
That was [indiscernible] during the second quarter of 2020 as the movement restriction started to improve. For the month of July, we've refurbished 10 additional Oasis convenience stores. So we are focused on offering a superior customer experience as a smaller recurring e-commerce site. Our online home delivery service has more than 1,700 products from our Oasis convenience stores. [indiscernible] been received very well during the pilot phase. We've now expanded it to more than 100 [indiscernible] convenience stores. So this [indiscernible], it has resulted in an increase in back to life for those stores, which are part of the 100 stores from the program. 
So the average food basket size has increased by 19.7% [indiscernible] and this was driven by changes in the consumer shopping pattern in 2019. The customers were visiting our stores our stores like [indiscernible], but they were buying more on the site. And this increase in basket size was also supported by various customer-centric initiatives. This included improved category management, introduction of fresh foods and the premium coffee offering. In addition to the [indiscernible] potential of the Oasis C-store business, relative to growing their other non [indiscernible], we launched our first vehicle inspection center during the second quarter, and we're expecting to open more vehicle inspection centers over the coming year, along with the expansion other nonfuel services, such as car washes and [indiscernible] change. 
Finally, I'd like to give you a brief update on our cost positions [indiscernible] it is and always remains the key pillar of our strategic platform competition. The benefits of the cost reduction initiatives taken in before the COVID-19, [indiscernible] is now starting to show up now financials as seen by reduction in operating expenditures of $7 million during the second quarter of the year. Now this is after an increase of $4 million in the first quarter of 2020. So the $7 million reduction is mainly a result of optimization in op cost as well as the decrease in general and management expenses. We've also then submitted a more efficient [indiscernible] My Station and [indiscernible]. And we plan on maintaining this leaner staffing model moving forward. So we're well on track to give [indiscernible] and meet for operation, much more efficient. The relation to realizing for the benefits of [indiscernible], we also expect results of additional initiatives and commented during the first half of this year, you have positive impact on our OpEx resumption, both in the second half of the year and beyond. As we have given guidance in the past, we reiterate our target of sites for light, operational expenditure savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020, are in line with our guidance in line to continue with our expansion strategy. In short, higher capital expenditure of USD 105 million during the first half of 2020. Compared to the first half of last year, the CapEx was about USD 38 million. Our 2020 CapEx, capital expenditures, we expect to accelerate compared to 2019 as significantly higher number of units casing are expected to be on delivery this year. This, of course, reiterates our strong commitment to [indiscernible] future growth and deliver [indiscernible] fuel and retail operating for our customers to [indiscernible]. So we have also continued to improve our capital expenditure efficiency. We're going to focus on rolling out invested capital and [indiscernible] of My Station. 
So at this point, I will hand over to Petri Pentti to present the highlights of our financial performance. Over to you, Petri."

So what we have already demonstrated as Mohamed [indiscernible] financial performance for the first half, despite the challenging operating environment. First half of 2020 revenue d",990,"Many thanks, Mohamed, and good afternoon, good morning also from my side. So what we have already demonstrated as Mohamed [indiscernible] financial performance for the first half, despite the challenging operating environment. First half of 2020 revenue decreased by 22.6% compared to last year, and this was driven by lower fuel volumes and nonfuel revenues asdue to the lower oil prices compared to last year. During the first half of 2020, gross profit reached USD 666 million, representing a decrease of 1.3% compared to last year. And this was driven by lower fuel volumes, lower retail and commercial profitability as well as the fact that last year, we had inventory gains of USD 33 million. Overall, this was mostly offset by higher retail fuel margins in the second quarter of 2020 as the retail fuel pump prices in the U.S. -- UAE did not fall in line with the future [indiscernible] this little crude oil and product prices. And as Mohamed mentioned, our cost of realization initiatives are underway to bring further efficiencies in number of prisons. Having said total operating expenses have increased in the first half by 11.8% year-on-year. And this is mainly due to the one-off expenses related to the additional pension costs. So as of course I COVID-19, while growth of [indiscernible] with our network expansion and cost of resonate effective early November last year, also contributed materially to the increase in OpEx. The first half EBITDA was[  342 million ]. This is a decrease of 15.4% compared to the first half of last year. Reported EBITDA, however, was negatively impacted by total one-offs of USD 46 million due to the onetime expenses and original prudent provisioning on traceable as well as right of capital working so whereas last year, first half benefited from one-off recoveries and reversals and inventory gains overall of USD 43 million -- USD 44 million. Importantly, underlying EBITDA, which is excluding inventory gains and losses as well as the one-offs has remained resilient with growth of 7.6% OpEx last year [indiscernible] retail margin. 
The first half net profit is reported at USD 148 million and by 22.4% compared to last year. Mainly due to the one-off expenses and [indiscernible] provision in my [indiscernible] main as well as due to the preference of one-off gains, once again, as I mentioned last year. However, we have just for inventory gains and these one-offs, the company's reported earnings would have been higher by 6.9%, despite the business impact of COVID-19 during Q2. 
Now let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights in the first [indiscernible] the first half our total fuel volumes in [indiscernible] '19. As a result, fuel volumes sold decreased by [indiscernible] in the second 2020 [indiscernible] in the first quarter of 2020. And as you can see in this slide, retail fuel volumes were impacted more than commercial business are [ 32.6% ] year-on-year in Q2 after a marginal decline of only 1.9% year-on-year and during the first quarter. Our commercial fuel vol were supported by a part from industrial customers, leading to an increase in corporate volumes by 4.1% year-on-year in Q2. And this was partially offset by a decrease of 33.9% in aviation volumes. So our strategic customer in Q2 of '23. In our Asia business, nodular transactions have decreased by 33.5% the first half compared to last year, almost again, of course, maybe due to the from COVID-19, which is set to do to in customer visits as well as the absence of the vouchers after we implemented treating average cost basket, however, has increased by 19.7% year-on-year due to the first half, and this was driven by our customer-centric initiatives, like improvement in category management. 
Online [indiscernible] report of [indiscernible] COVID-19 impact with customers be heating [indiscernible] are spending more during this. 
So let me now turn on the gross profit by segment. In the first half 2020. Retail segment overall, gross profit increased by 7.7% in the last year, [indiscernible] mainly by fuel retail business. Fuel retail posted strong operating performance in gross profit growth of 14.8% year-on-year. On the back of higher retail fuel margins mainly and regards to new costs following also the real cautious that our fuel supply contract or last November, partially offset by the [indiscernible] nonfuel cost profit decreased by 29% in the first half in the lower transactions. As a result, of COVID-19 lockdown on restrictions as well as to do the action to answer [indiscernible] after implementing, as I mentioned, the [indiscernible] field. 
And in the commercial business, the performance was negatively impacted by lower margins and aviation volumes as well as the line of items of $6 million. Whereas last year, during the first half, it included a one-off recovery of [indiscernible] USD [ 10 million ].  
Moving on to EBITDA by segment. First half retail EBITDA stable overall given the higher retail margins at Disa, but offset by lower fuel volumes prior inventory gains as well as the decline in nonfuel gross profit as explained. And finally in OpEx. First half, commercially, we declined due to the lower margins, lower aviation volumes as well as prudent debt provisions in the commercial business. And then finally, a few words about cash flow, cash generation, it was impacted and decline due to the negative working capital movement as well as the dividend payment in the second quarter, partially offset by [indiscernible] from underlying operations. Specifically, the negative working capital movement was mainly as a result of a significant decrease in our payables from a supplier outlook. Which is driven by lower purchases, together with the lower gold prices. We have continued to pay for our fuel supply in line with a 30-day payable period. While receivers have not decreased the receivable base in current environment, therefore, leading to an increased working capital. 
And with that, let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

In terms of CapEx, we expect CapEx of up to $300 million in 2020 versus our previous guidance of $300 million to $400 million, mainly due to COVID-19 impact on contractor's mobilization and supply chain mechanics.

Th",679,"Thank you, Athmane, and good afternoon, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I hope that everyone is staying safe and healthy. Before we take you through our first half results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. The rigorous introduction of rigorous health and safety measures, ADD as a company ensure that stations remain open to make services accessible to the healthcare sector and to keep customers moving on essential journeys. Furthermore, we implemented a range of measures to respond to evolving customer needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including new services to protect our staff and customers, such as daily deep cleaning of sites and car interior sanitization.
Aligned with the UAE's efforts to reopen the economy, we have successfully and safely relaunched services that we have entirely suspended during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic, including car wash, oil change and food bakery offerings in our convenience stores. We responded swiftly to the evolving environment by accelerating e-commerce strategy and launching new services to enhance customer experience. Our digital initiatives include contactless payment solutions, online delivery from our convenience stores and mobile fuel and LPG delivery.
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first half 2020 performance and results. Despite the challenging operating environment, the company remained resilient delivering a 7.6% increase in underlying EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. We continue to make significant progress in executing smart growth strategy during the first half of 2020 by accelerating delivery of new stations and launching new services and products. The company remains on track to deliver 50 to 60 new stations by full year of 2020, which includes 20 to 25 stations in Dubai.
We are constantly looking to enhance customer satisfaction and increase customer loyalty. As a result, we have launched the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fueling provider, we call this ADNOC Rewards. ADNOC Rewards is a point-based system, allowing customers to earn and they can redeem points upon their purchases at our service stations and convenience stores. The ADNOC Distribution mobile app, which includes the wallet, mobile pay and the ADNOC Rewards program, now has more than 750,000 registered users.
The company reinforced its commitment to sustainability and supporting customers adoption for fuel efficient and hybrid vehicles by launching a new range of ADNOC Voyager lubricant for hybrid vehicle engines. The new range of ADNOC Voyager vehicle engine oils is the only first to meet the needs of the latest engine technologies and to be certified by the world-leading industry body, the American Petroleum Institute.
In LPG space, more recently, we announced a significant change in LPG pricing, introducing uniform rates for LPG cylinders sold to all our customers, whether retail or commercial across the whole country, in UAE. We expect increase in LPG cylinders pricing have positive impact on our earnings, which Mohamed will share more light on.
In nonfuel business area, we remain focused on providing superior shopping experience for our customers through revitalization program. Despite the lockdown restrictions, we were in the first half of 2020, we successfully refurbished ADNOC Oasis convenience stores, including [indiscernible] and Q2 of 2020.
In OpEx area, we started to see initial results of our cost optimization efforts. The $7 million reduction in like-for-like OpEx in Q2 2020, which comes after an increase of $4 million in Q1 2020. We remain on track to bring further efficiency in our operations and meet our full year targeted savings.
The company maintained a robust balance sheet and remains well positioned to expand both its domestic and international portfolio, in line with our growth strategy.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by our progressive dividend policy that offers high dividend visibility to our shareholders. For 2020, company's dividend policy is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to Board and shareholders' approval.
I will now hand over to Mohamed for an update on our strategy. Mohamed, over to you."

Everyone, good morning and good afternoon. I'm going to start off by giving you an update on our fuel business, which, of course, includes B2C and B2B segments.So during the first half of 2020, as the CEO has mentioned, fuel volumes ha",1356,"Thank you, Ahmed. Everyone, good morning and good afternoon. I'm going to start off by giving you an update on our fuel business, which, of course, includes B2C and B2B segments.
So during the first half of 2020, as the CEO has mentioned, fuel volumes have declined by 12% -- 12.2% compared to the first half of 2019. This is, of course, mainly owing to the COVID-19 impact on our retail business.
Retail fuel volumes decreased by 17.2% year-on-year in the first half of 2020. Commercial fuel volumes, on the other hand, declined only marginally by 1.3% in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period of last year. And this was mainly due to lower uplift from the strategic aviation customers. Following the ease of lockdown and movement restrictions in the UAE, which started towards the end of May, we've noted a -- and experienced a significant recovery in fuel volumes. In the month of June and July this year, our retail fuel volumes, which account for about [ 65% ] of our total volumes, they recovered almost 90% of volume compared to the same period last year.
Speaking to our network expansion. We brought in 25 stations in the UAE during the first half of the year. And 18 out of those 25 were during the second quarter of the year. Now, of course, we remain focused on value exceeded Dubai expansion with the opening of 7 new stations during the first half of 2020. The performance of our Dubai stations remained very strong with double-digit growth in fuel sales during the first half of the year. This was driven by new station opening in an under-penetrated market. Despite COVID-19, our Dubai fuel sales continue to grow in high single digit during the second quarter of 2020. Of course, we expect our Dubai expansion to contribute meaningfully going forward as we open more stations in the second half of 2020 and beyond.
Continuing with our delivery momentum, we opened 7 additional stations, including 3 in Dubai in the month of July. To date in 2020, we have opened 32 new stations. This takes the total stations we operate in the UAE to 413. Out of the 413, 16 stations are in Dubai. As part of our strategy, we extensively tackle competition with faster and more efficient deployment of our fuel station,while also optimizing our capital expenditure. We've now opened 21 ADNOC On the go. And these are neighborhood service stations, which we've opened in Abu Dhabi as of July 2020.
During the second quarter of 2020, we also added 10 new trucks to our My Station fleet. It is to expand on demand fuel delivery service for P&C as well as B2B customers. The objective here is to, of course  provide our customers with a faster and reliable fueling service.
As the CEO referenced before, we've announced a major change in LPG pricing, discovery of the Abu Dhabi in the Northern Emirates, so the price of LPG cylinders has been increased from AED 20 to AED 35  for the 25-pound cylinder. And AED 30 to AED 65 for the 50-pound canister. Now this change brings greater parity to the pricing of LPG cylinders across the UAE. Of course, you'll note that our prices are still below competitors. This, of course, gives us an opportunity to potentially expand our market share in markets where we currently are underpenetrated, such as Dubai and the Northern Emirates.
So given the LPG still underprice increase, we're expecting an uplift of approximately USD 20 million to our EBITDA on an annualized basis.
So finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy, and we are progressing well on our international expansion strategy in Saudi Arabia, in India as well as other countries. Of course, we will announce further updates on the appropriate time, once we obtain all the approvals.
So talking and -- about our nonfuel retail business. Let's move on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience stores network have increased to 288 as of the end of June 2020. So we have added 24 new convenience stores in the UAE during the first half of the year. In addition, as you may recall, we've got our convenience store revitalization program to slow down at -- during the [indiscernible] of the COVID-19 crisis. But now it's picked up pace, starting early in Q2, 2020. So during the first half of 2020, we have refurbished 11 of our Oasis convenience stores. That was [indiscernible] during the second quarter of 2020 as the movement restriction started to improve. For the month of July, we've refurbished 10 additional Oasis convenience stores.
So we are focused on offering a superior customer experience as well as recovering in the e-commerce side. For online home delivery service has more than 1,700 products from our Oasis convenience stores has been received very well during the pilot phase. So we've now expanded it to more than 100 convenience stores. So this tariff has resulted in an increase in back to life for those stores, which are part of the 100 stores from the program.
So the average food basket size has increased by 19.7% during the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2019, and this was driven by changes in the consumer shopping pattern during COVID-2019. The customers were visiting our stores last week on 8th, but they were buying more on the site. And this increase in basket size was also supported by various customer-centric initiatives. This included improved category management, introduction of fresh food and the premium coffee offering. In addition to the growth potential of the Oasis and C-store business, relative to growing their other non [indiscernible], we launched our first vehicle inspection center during the second quarter, and we're expecting to open more vehicle inspection centers over the coming year along with the expansion of our other nonfuel services, such as car washes and lube change.
Finally, I'd like to give you a brief update on our cost positions [indiscernible], it is and always remains the key pillar of our strategic platform competition. The benefits of the cost reduction initiatives taken before the COVID-19 [indiscernible], it's now starting to show up now in our financials as seen by slight reduction in operating expenditures of $7 million during the second quarter of the year. Now this was after an increase of $4 million in the first quarter of 2020. So the $7 million reduction is mainly a result of optimization in op cost as well as the decrease in general and management expenses. We've also implemented a more efficient operating model as our [indiscernible] My Station and other convenience stores. And we plan on maintaining this leaner staffing model moving forward.
So we're well on track to give [indiscernible] and need for operation, much more efficient. The relation to realizing for the benefits of capitalization, we also expect the results of additional initiatives implemented during the first half of this year, you have positive impact on our OpEx resumption, both in the second half of the year and beyond. As we have given guidance in the past, we reiterate our target of like-for-like operational expenditure savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020, are in line with our guidance in line to continue with our expansion strategy. In short, higher capital expenditure of USD 105 million during the first half of 2020. Compared to the first half of last year, the CapEx was about USD 38 million.
Our 2020 CapEx, capital expenditures, we expect to accelerate compared to 2019 as significantly higher number of units, stations are expected to be on live delivery this year. This, of course, reiterates our strong commitment to secure future growth and deliver [indiscernible] fuel and retail operating for our customers to [indiscernible]. So we have also continued to improve our capital expenditure efficiency. We're going to focus on rolling out invested capital and [indiscernible] of My Station.
So at this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance. Over to you, Petri."

So what we have already demonstrated as Mohamed [indiscernible] financial performance for the first half, despite the challenging and operating environment. First half of 2020 rev",1013,"Many thanks to Mohamed, and good afternoon, good morning also from my side. So what we have already demonstrated as Mohamed [indiscernible] financial performance for the first half, despite the challenging and operating environment. First half of 2020 revenue decreased by 22.6% compared to last year, and this was driven by lower fuel volumes and nonfuel revenues as due to the lower oil prices compared to last year.
During the first half of 2020, gross profit reached USD 666 million, representing a decrease of 1.3% compared to last year. And this was driven by lower fuel volumes, lower retail nonfuel and commercial profitability as well as the fact that last year, we had inventory gains of USD 33 million. And overall, this was mostly offset by higher retail fuel margins in the second quarter of 2020 as the retail fuel pump prices in the U.S. -- UAE did not fall in line with the future play cost [indiscernible] for crude oil and product prices. And as Mohamed mentioned, our cost of realization initiatives are underway to bring further efficiencies in number of [indiscernible].
And having said that, total operating expenses have increased during the first half by 11.8% year-on-year. And this is mainly due to the one-off expenses related to the additional pension costs. And so as, of course, we've had COVID-19, while growth of OpEx associated with our network expansion and cost of [indiscernible] effective early November last year, also contributed materially to the increase in OpEx.
The first half EBITDA was $342 million, this is a decrease of 15.4% compared to the first half of last year. Reported EBITDA, however, was negatively impacted by total one-offs of USD 46 million due to the onetime expenses and additional prudent provisioning on [indiscernible] cost as well as right of capital working progress. Whereas last year, first half benefited from one-off recoveries and reversals and inventory gains of total overall of USD 44 million. Importantly, underlying EBITDA, which is excluding inventory gains and losses as well as the one-offs, has remained resilient with growth of 7.6% compared to last year to the entire oil/fuel retail margin.
The first half net profit is reported at USD 248 million, decline by 22.4% compared to last year, mainly due to the one-off expenses and due to provisioning My Station as well as due to the presence of one-off gains, once again, I've mentioned last year. However, we have just for inventory gains and these one-offs, the company's reported earnings would have been higher by 6.9%, despite the business impact of COVID-19, specifically during Q2.
Now let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights in the first [indiscernible] the first half our total fuel volumes in [indiscernible] '19. As a result, fuel volumes sold decreased by [indiscernible] in the second 2020 [indiscernible] in the first quarter of 2020. And as you can see in this slide, retail fuel volumes were impacted more than commercial business [indiscernible] [ 32.6% ] year-on-year in Q2 after a marginal decline of only 1.9% year-on-year and during the first quarter. Our commercial fuel volume were supported by a part from industrial customers, leading to an increase in corporate volumes by 4.1% year-on-year in Q2. And this was partially offset by a decrease of 33.9% in aviation volumes. So our strategic customer in Q2 of 2020.
In our nonfuel business, nonfuel transactions have decreased by 33.5% during the first half compared to last year, almost again, of course, maybe due to the [indiscernible] from COVID-19, which was led due to in customer visits as well as due to the absence of the vouchers after we implemented [indiscernible]. Average cost basket, however, has increased by 19.7% year-on-year due to the first half, and this was driven by our customer-centric initiatives, like improvement in category management, online delivery and also as a result of COVID-19 impact with customers visiting just frequently are spending more during this.
So let me now turn on the gross profit by segment. During the first half 2020, retail segment overall, gross profit increased by 7.7% last year. So that made fuel retail business. Fuel retail posted strong operating performance in gross profit growth of 14.8% year-on-year. On the back of higher retail fuel margins mainly in Q2 and regards to new fuel costs following also the renegotiations of our fuel supply contract in last November, partially offset by the clear increase [indiscernible]. Nonfuel cost profit decreased by 29% in the first half in the lower transactions as a result of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions as well as contribute the actions to larger prevention after implementing, and as I mentioned, the free assisted fueling.
And in the commercial business, the performance was negatively impacted by lower margins and aviation volumes as well as the line of items of $6 million. Whereas last year, during the first half, it included a one-off recovery USD [indiscernible].
Moving on to EBITDA by segment. First half retail EBITDA B2C was stable overall given the higher retail margins [indiscernible], but offset by lower fuel volumes prior inventory gains as well as the decline in nonfuel gross profit as explained. And finally the increases in OpEx. First half, commercial EBITDA B2B declined due to the lower margins, lower aviation volumes as well as prudent debt provisions in the commercial business.
And then finally, a few words about cash flow, cash generation, it was impacted and declined primarily due to the negative working capital movement as well as the dividend payment in the second quarter, partially offset by [indiscernible] from underlying operations. Specifically, the negative working capital movement was mainly as a result of a significant decrease in our payables from a supplier outlook, which is driven by lower purchases, together with the lower oil prices. We have continued to pay for our fuel supply in line with a 30-day payable period. While receivables have not decreased the receivable base in current environment, therefore, leading to an increased working capital during the quarter.
And with that, let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

So we start with our fuel business, lockdown [indiscernible], the spread of COVID-19 in the UAE started to ease from end of May with the further reopening of the economy income. In line with the economy reopening, our fuel volumes has started to recover. The further ease in movement restrictions between various emirates in UAE, gradual resumption of life and blessing of international travel restrictions and the expected to be opening of schools, and our volumes took rather pace. We also expect our retail fuel margins to remain relatively high in Q3 2020 as some prices for July and August remained stable since April 2020. We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans and [indiscernible] manner and to deliver an enhanced customer experience, both of which are expected to deliver additional earnings growth. We expect delivery momentum to sustain in the second half of 2020 in light of the full year.
We expect to open 30 to 60 more stations in the UAE. Our focus is to ensure CapEx is allocated more effectively towards our growth and value effective Dubai expansion. Therefore, we are targeting to open a total of 20 to 25 new stations in Dubai in 2020. The majority of which will be traditional stations. In our nonfuel business, we reiterate our target  to refurbish 40 to 50 C-stores by the end of 2020. Customer-centric initiatives are under way, like improvement and profitability management and reduction of fresh food and premium coffee products across our network.
We see great opportunities in our recently launched online foods and grocery delivery service from our ADNOC Oasis convenience stores. We expect to further expand our average in Dubai and expand in Northern Emirates, supporting our ambition of sustaining strongs of in our nonfuel offerings.
In terms of CapEx, we expect CapEx of up to $300 million in 2020 versus our previous guidance of $300 million to $400 million, mainly due to COVID-19 impact on contractor's mobilization and supply chain mechanics. We continue to explore new growth opportunities presented by the current environment.

We are now accelerating the deliveries of cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives across all our corporations and business lines.

Th",679,"Thank you, Athmane, and good afternoon, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I hope that everyone is staying safe and healthy. Before we take you through our first half results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. The rigorous introduction of rigorous health and safety measures, ADD as a company ensure that stations remain open to make services accessible to the healthcare sector and to keep customers moving on essential journeys. Furthermore, we implemented a range of measures to respond to evolving customer needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including new services to protect our staff and customers, such as daily deep cleaning of sites and car interior sanitization.
Aligned with the UAE's efforts to reopen the economy, we have successfully and safely relaunched services that we have entirely suspended during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic, including car wash, oil change and food bakery offerings in our convenience stores. We responded swiftly to the evolving environment by accelerating e-commerce strategy and launching new services to enhance customer experience. Our digital initiatives include contactless payment solutions, online delivery from our convenience stores and mobile fuel and LPG delivery.
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first half 2020 performance and results. Despite the challenging operating environment, the company remained resilient delivering a 7.6% increase in underlying EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. We continue to make significant progress in executing smart growth strategy during the first half of 2020 by accelerating delivery of new stations and launching new services and products. The company remains on track to deliver 50 to 60 new stations by full year of 2020, which includes 20 to 25 stations in Dubai.
We are constantly looking to enhance customer satisfaction and increase customer loyalty. As a result, we have launched the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fueling provider, we call this ADNOC Rewards. ADNOC Rewards is a point-based system, allowing customers to earn and they can redeem points upon their purchases at our service stations and convenience stores. The ADNOC Distribution mobile app, which includes the wallet, mobile pay and the ADNOC Rewards program, now has more than 750,000 registered users.
The company reinforced its commitment to sustainability and supporting customers adoption for fuel efficient and hybrid vehicles by launching a new range of ADNOC Voyager lubricant for hybrid vehicle engines. The new range of ADNOC Voyager vehicle engine oils is the only first to meet the needs of the latest engine technologies and to be certified by the world-leading industry body, the American Petroleum Institute.
In LPG space, more recently, we announced a significant change in LPG pricing, introducing uniform rates for LPG cylinders sold to all our customers, whether retail or commercial across the whole country, in UAE. We expect increase in LPG cylinders pricing have positive impact on our earnings, which Mohamed will share more light on.
In nonfuel business area, we remain focused on providing superior shopping experience for our customers through revitalization program. Despite the lockdown restrictions, we were in the first half of 2020, we successfully refurbished ADNOC Oasis convenience stores, including [indiscernible] and Q2 of 2020.
In OpEx area, we started to see initial results of our cost optimization efforts. The $7 million reduction in like-for-like OpEx in Q2 2020, which comes after an increase of $4 million in Q1 2020. We remain on track to bring further efficiency in our operations and meet our full year targeted savings.
The company maintained a robust balance sheet and remains well positioned to expand both its domestic and international portfolio, in line with our growth strategy.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by our progressive dividend policy that offers high dividend visibility to our shareholders. For 2020, company's dividend policy is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to Board and shareholders' approval.
I will now hand over to Mohamed for an update on our strategy. Mohamed, over to you."

Everyone, good morning and good afternoon. I'm going to start off by giving you an update on our fuel business, which, of course, includes B2C and B2B segments.So during the first half of 2020, as the CEO has mentioned, fuel volumes ha",1355,"Thank you, Ahmed. Everyone, good morning and good afternoon. I'm going to start off by giving you an update on our fuel business, which, of course, includes B2C and B2B segments.
So during the first half of 2020, as the CEO has mentioned, fuel volumes have declined by 12% -- 12.2% compared to the first half of 2019. This is, of course, mainly owing to the COVID-19 impact on our retail business.
Retail fuel volumes decreased by 17.2% year-on-year in the first half of 2020. Commercial fuel volumes, on the other hand, declined only marginally by 1.3% in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period of last year. And this was mainly due to lower uplift from the strategic aviation customers. Following the ease of lockdown and movement restrictions in the UAE, which started towards the end of May, we've noted a -- and experienced a significant recovery in fuel volumes. In the month of June and July this year, our retail fuel volumes, which account for about [ 65% ] of our total volumes, they recovered almost 90% of volume compared to the same period last year.
Speaking to our network expansion. We brought in 25 stations in the UAE during the first half of the year. And 18 out of those 25 were during the second quarter of the year. Now, of course, we remain focused on value exceeded Dubai expansion with the opening of 7 new stations during the first half of 2020. The performance of our Dubai stations remained very strong with double-digit growth in fuel sales during the first half of the year. This was driven by new station opening in an under-penetrated market. Despite COVID-19, our Dubai fuel sales continue to grow in high single digit during the second quarter of 2020. Of course, we expect our Dubai expansion to contribute meaningfully going forward as we open more stations in the second half of 2020 and beyond.
Continuing with our delivery momentum, we opened 7 additional stations, including 3 in Dubai in the month of July. To date in 2020, we have opened 32 new stations. This takes the total stations we operate in the UAE to 413. Out of the 413, 16 stations are in Dubai. As part of our strategy, we extensively tackle competition with faster and more efficient deployment of our fuel station,while also optimizing our capital expenditure. We've now opened 21 ADNOC On the go. And these are neighborhood service stations, which we've opened in Abu Dhabi as of July 2020.
During the second quarter of 2020, we also added 10 new trucks to our My Station fleet. It is to expand on-demand fuel delivery service for P&C as well as B2B customers. The objective here is to, of course provide our customers with a faster and reliable fueling service.
As the CEO referenced before, we've announced a major change in LPG pricing, discovery of the Abu Dhabi in the Northern Emirates, so the price of LPG cylinders has been increased from AED 20 to AED 35  for the 25-pound cylinder. And AED 30 to AED 65 for the 50-pound canister. Now this change brings greater parity to the pricing of LPG cylinders across the UAE. Of course, you'll note that our prices are still below competitors. This, of course, gives us an opportunity to potentially expand our market share in markets where we currently are underpenetrated, such as Dubai and the Northern Emirates.
So given the LPG still underprice increase, we're expecting an uplift of approximately USD 20 million to our EBITDA on an annualized basis.
So finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy, and we are progressing well on our international expansion strategy in Saudi Arabia, in India as well as other countries. Of course, we will announce further updates on the appropriate time, once we obtain all the approvals.
So talking and -- about our nonfuel retail business. Let's move on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience stores network have increased to 288 as of the end of June 2020. So we have added 24 new convenience stores in the UAE during the first half of the year. In addition, as you may recall, we've got our convenience store revitalization program to slow down at -- during the [indiscernible] of the COVID-19 crisis. But now it's picked up pace, starting early in Q2, 2020. So during the first half of 2020, we have refurbished 11 of our Oasis convenience stores. That was [indiscernible] during the second quarter of 2020 as the movement restriction started to improve. For the month of July, we've refurbished 10 additional Oasis convenience stores.
So we are focused on offering a superior customer experience as well as recovering in the e-commerce side. For online home delivery service has more than 1,700 products from our Oasis convenience stores has been received very well during the pilot phase. So we've now expanded it to more than 100 convenience stores. So this tariff has resulted in an increase in back to life for those stores, which are part of the 100 stores from the program.
So the average food basket size has increased by 19.7% during the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2019, and this was driven by changes in the consumer shopping pattern during COVID-2019. The customers were visiting our stores last week on 8th, but they were buying more on the site. And this increase in basket size was also supported by various customer-centric initiatives. This included improved category management, introduction of fresh food and the premium coffee offering. In addition to the growth potential of the Oasis and C-store business, relative to growing their other non [indiscernible], we launched our first vehicle inspection center during the second quarter, and we're expecting to open more vehicle inspection centers over the coming year along with the expansion of our other nonfuel services, such as car washes and lube change.
Finally, I'd like to give you a brief update on our cost positions [indiscernible], it is and always remains the key pillar of our strategic platform competition. The benefits of the cost reduction initiatives taken before the COVID-19 [indiscernible], it's now starting to show up now in our financials as seen by slight reduction in operating expenditures of $7 million during the second quarter of the year. Now this was after an increase of $4 million in the first quarter of 2020. So the $7 million reduction is mainly a result of optimization in op cost as well as the decrease in general and management expenses. We've also implemented a more efficient operating model as our [indiscernible] My Station and other convenience stores. And we plan on maintaining this leaner staffing model moving forward.
So we're well on track to give [indiscernible] and need for operation, much more efficient. The relation to realizing for the benefits of capitalization, we also expect the results of additional initiatives implemented during the first half of this year, you have positive impact on our OpEx resumption, both in the second half of the year and beyond. As we have given guidance in the past, we reiterate our target of like-for-like operational expenditure savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020, are in line with our guidance in line to continue with our expansion strategy. In short, higher capital expenditure of USD 105 million during the first half of 2020. Compared to the first half of last year, the CapEx was about USD 38 million.
Our 2020 CapEx, capital expenditures, we expect to accelerate compared to 2019 as significantly higher number of units, stations are expected to be on live delivery this year. This, of course, reiterates our strong commitment to secure future growth and deliver [indiscernible] fuel and retail operating for our customers to [indiscernible]. So we have also continued to improve our capital expenditure efficiency. We're going to focus on rolling out invested capital and [indiscernible] of My Station.
So at this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance. Over to you, Petri."

So what we have already demonstrated as Mohamed [indiscernible] financial performance for the first half, despite the challenging and operating environment. First half of 2020 rev",1014,"Many thanks to Mohamed, and good afternoon, good morning also from my side. So what we have already demonstrated as Mohamed [indiscernible] financial performance for the first half, despite the challenging and operating environment. First half of 2020 revenue decreased by 22.6% compared to last year, and this was driven by lower fuel volumes and nonfuel revenues as due to the lower oil prices compared to last year.
During the first half of 2020, gross profit reached USD 666 million, representing a decrease of 1.3% compared to last year. And this was driven by lower fuel volumes, lower retail nonfuel and commercial profitability as well as the fact that last year, we had inventory gains of USD 33 million. And overall, this was mostly offset by higher retail fuel margins in the second quarter of 2020 as the retail fuel pump prices in the U.S. -- UAE did not fall in line with the future play cost [indiscernible] for crude oil and product prices. And as Mohamed mentioned, our cost of realization initiatives are underway to bring further efficiencies in number of [indiscernible].
And having said that, total operating expenses have increased during the first half by 11.8% year-on-year. And this is mainly due to the one-off expenses related to the additional pension costs. And so as, of course, we've had COVID-19, while growth of OpEx associated with our network expansion and cost of [indiscernible] effective early November last year, also contributed materially to the increase in OpEx.
The first half EBITDA was $342 million, this is a decrease of 15.4% compared to the first half of last year. Reported EBITDA, however, was negatively impacted by total one-offs of USD 46 million due to the onetime expenses and additional prudent provisioning on [indiscernible] cost as well as right of capital working progress. Whereas last year, first half benefited from one-off recoveries and reversals and inventory gains of total overall of USD 44 million. Importantly, underlying EBITDA, which is excluding inventory gains and losses as well as the one-offs, has remained resilient with growth of 7.6% compared to last year to the entire oil/fuel retail margin.
The first half net profit is reported at USD 248 million, decline by 22.4% compared to last year, mainly due to the one-off expenses and due to provisioning My Station as well as due to the presence of one-off gains, once again, I've mentioned last year. However, we have just for inventory gains and these one-offs, the company's reported earnings would have been higher by 6.9%, despite the business impact of COVID-19, specifically during Q2.
Now let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights in the first [indiscernible] the first half our total fuel volumes in [indiscernible] '19. As a result, fuel volumes sold decreased by [indiscernible] in the second 2020 [indiscernible] in the first quarter of 2020. And as you can see in this slide, retail fuel volumes were impacted more than commercial business [indiscernible] [ 32.6% ] year-on-year in Q2 after a marginal decline of only 1.9% year-on-year and during the first quarter. Our commercial fuel volume were supported by a part from industrial customers, leading to an increase in corporate volumes by 4.1% year-on-year in Q2. And this was partially offset by a decrease of 33.9% in aviation volumes. So our strategic customer in Q2 of 2020.
In our nonfuel business, nonfuel transactions have decreased by 33.5% during the first half compared to last year, almost again, of course, may be due to the [indiscernible] from COVID-19, which was led due to in customer visits as well as due to the absence of the vouchers after we implemented [indiscernible]. Average cost basket, however, has increased by 19.7% year-on-year due to the first half, and this was driven by our customer-centric initiatives, like improvement in category management, online delivery and also as a result of COVID-19 impact with customers visiting just frequently are spending more during this.
So let me now turn on the gross profit by segment. During the first half 2020, retail segment overall, gross profit increased by 7.7% last year. So that made fuel retail business. Fuel retail posted strong operating performance in gross profit growth of 14.8% year-on-year. On the back of higher retail fuel margins mainly in Q2 and regards to new fuel costs following also the renegotiations of our fuel supply contract in last November, partially offset by the clear increase [indiscernible]. Nonfuel cost profit decreased by 29% in the first half in the lower transactions as a result of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions as well as contribute the actions to larger prevention after implementing, and as I mentioned, the free assisted fueling.
And in the commercial business, the performance was negatively impacted by lower margins and aviation volumes as well as the line of items of $6 million. Whereas last year, during the first half, it included a one-off recovery USD [indiscernible].
Moving on to EBITDA by segment. First half retail EBITDA B2C was stable overall given the higher retail margins [indiscernible], but offset by lower fuel volumes prior inventory gains as well as the decline in nonfuel gross profit as explained. And finally the increases in OpEx. First half, commercial EBITDA B2B declined due to the lower margins, lower aviation volumes as well as prudent debt provisions in the commercial business.
And then finally, a few words about cash flow, cash generation, it was impacted and declined primarily due to the negative working capital movement as well as the dividend payment in the second quarter, partially offset by [indiscernible] from underlying operations. Specifically, the negative working capital movement was mainly as a result of a significant decrease in our payables from a supplier outlook, which is driven by lower purchases, together with the lower oil prices. We have continued to pay for our fuel supply in line with a 30-day payable period. While receivables have not decreased the receivable base in current environment, therefore, leading to an increased working capital during the quarter.
And with that, let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

So we start with our fuel business, lockdown [indiscernible], the spread of COVID-19 in the UAE started to ease from end of May with the further reopening of the economy income. In line with the economy reopening, our fuel volumes has started to recover. The further ease in movement restrictions between various emirates in UAE, gradual resumption of life and blessing of international travel restrictions and the expected to be opening of schools, and our volumes took rather pace. We also expect our retail fuel margins to remain relatively high in Q3 2020 as some prices for July and August remained stable since April 2020. We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans and [indiscernible] manner and to deliver an enhanced customer experience, both of which are expected to deliver additional earnings growth. We expect delivery momentum to sustain in the second half of 2020 in light of the full year.
We expect to open 30 to 60 more stations in the UAE. Our focus is to ensure CapEx is allocated more effectively towards our growth and value-effective Dubai expansion. Therefore, we are targeting to open a total of 20 to 25 new stations in Dubai in 2020. The majority of which will be traditional stations. In our nonfuel business, we reiterate our target  to refurbish 40 to 50 C-stores by the end of 2020. Customer-centric initiatives are under way, like improvement and profitability management and reduction of fresh food and premium coffee products across our network.
We see great opportunities in our recently launched online foods and grocery delivery service from our ADNOC Oasis convenience stores. We expect to further expand our average in Dubai and expand in Northern Emirates, supporting our ambition of sustaining strongs of in our nonfuel offerings.
In terms of CapEx, we expect CapEx of up to $300 million in 2020 versus our previous guidance of $300 million to $400 million, mainly due to COVID-19 impact on contractor's mobilization and supply chain mechanics. We continue to explore new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. We continue to assess potential opportunities to achieve [indiscernible] growth and operational success in international markets. We are targeting the highest [indiscernible] on industry. We are now accelerating the deliveries of cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives across all our corporations and business lines.

Th",679,"Thank you, Athmane, and good afternoon, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I hope that everyone is staying safe and healthy. Before we take you through our first half results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. The rigorous introduction of rigorous health and safety measures, ADD as a company ensure that stations remain open to make services accessible to the healthcare sector and to keep customers moving on essential journeys. Furthermore, we implemented a range of measures to respond to evolving customer needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including new services to protect our staff and customers, such as daily deep cleaning of sites and car interior sanitization.
Aligned with the UAE's efforts to reopen the economy, we have successfully and safely relaunched services that we have entirely suspended during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic, including car wash, oil change and food bakery offerings in our convenience stores. We responded swiftly to the evolving environment by accelerating e-commerce strategy and launching new services to enhance customer experience. Our digital initiatives include contactless payment solutions, online delivery from our convenience stores and mobile fuel and LPG delivery.
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first half 2020 performance and results. Despite the challenging operating environment, the company remained resilient delivering a 7.6% increase in underlying EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. We continue to make significant progress in executing smart growth strategy during the first half of 2020 by accelerating delivery of new stations and launching new services and products. The company remains on track to deliver 50 to 60 new stations by full year of 2020, which includes 20 to 25 stations in Dubai.
We are constantly looking to enhance customer satisfaction and increase customer loyalty. As a result, we have launched the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fueling provider, we call this ADNOC Rewards. ADNOC Rewards is a point-based system, allowing customers to earn and they can redeem points upon their purchases at our service stations and convenience stores. The ADNOC Distribution mobile app, which includes the wallet, mobile pay and the ADNOC Rewards program, now has more than 750,000 registered users.
The company reinforced its commitment to sustainability and supporting customers adoption for fuel efficient and hybrid vehicles by launching a new range of ADNOC Voyager lubricant for hybrid vehicle engines. The new range of ADNOC Voyager vehicle engine oils is the only first to meet the needs of the latest engine technologies and to be certified by the world-leading industry body, the American Petroleum Institute.
In LPG space, more recently, we announced a significant change in LPG pricing, introducing uniform rates for LPG cylinders sold to all our customers, whether retail or commercial across the whole country, in UAE. We expect increase in LPG cylinders pricing have positive impact on our earnings, which Mohamed will share more light on.
In nonfuel business area, we remain focused on providing superior shopping experience for our customers through revitalization program. Despite the lockdown restrictions, we were in the first half of 2020, we successfully refurbished ADNOC Oasis convenience stores, including [indiscernible] and Q2 of 2020.
In OpEx area, we started to see initial results of our cost optimization efforts. The $7 million reduction in like-for-like OpEx in Q2 2020, which comes after an increase of $4 million in Q1 2020. We remain on track to bring further efficiency in our operations and meet our full year targeted savings.
The company maintained a robust balance sheet and remains well positioned to expand both its domestic and international portfolio, in line with our growth strategy.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by our progressive dividend policy that offers high dividend visibility to our shareholders. For 2020, company's dividend policy is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to Board and shareholders' approval.
I will now hand over to Mohamed for an update on our strategy. Mohamed, over to you."

I'm going to start off by giving you an update on our fuel business, which, of course, includes B2C and B2B segments.So during the first half of 2020, as the CEO has mentioned, fuel volumes ha",1355,"Thank you, Ahmed. Everyone, good morning and good afternoon. I'm going to start off by giving you an update on our fuel business, which, of course, includes B2C and B2B segments.
So during the first half of 2020, as the CEO has mentioned, fuel volumes have declined by 12% -- 12.2% compared to the first half of 2019. This is, of course, mainly owing to the COVID-19 impact on our retail business.
Retail fuel volumes decreased by 17.2% year-on-year in the first half of 2020. Commercial fuel volumes, on the other hand, declined only marginally by 1.3% in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period of last year. And this was mainly due to lower uplift from the strategic aviation customers. Following the ease of lockdown and movement restrictions in the UAE, which started towards the end of May, we've noted a -- and experienced a significant recovery in fuel volumes. In the month of June and July this year, our retail fuel volumes, which account for about [ 65% ] of our total volumes, they recovered almost 90% of volume compared to the same period last year.
Speaking to our network expansion. We brought in 25 stations in the UAE during the first half of the year. And 18 out of those 25 were during the second quarter of the year. Now, of course, we remain focused on value exceeded Dubai expansion with the opening of 7 new stations during the first half of 2020. The performance of our Dubai stations remained very strong with double-digit growth in fuel sales during the first half of the year. This was driven by new station opening in an under-penetrated market. Despite COVID-19, our Dubai fuel sales continue to grow in high single digit during the second quarter of 2020. Of course, we expect our Dubai expansion to contribute meaningfully going forward as we open more stations in the second half of 2020 and beyond.
Continuing with our delivery momentum, we opened 7 additional stations, including 3 in Dubai in the month of July. To date in 2020, we have opened 32 new stations. This takes the total stations we operate in the UAE to 413. Out of the 413, 16 stations are in Dubai. As part of our strategy, we extensively tackle competition with faster and more efficient deployment of our fuel station,while also optimizing our capital expenditure. We've now opened 21 ADNOC On the go. And these are neighborhood service stations, which we've opened in Abu Dhabi as of July 2020.
During the second quarter of 2020, we also added 10 new trucks to our My Station fleet. It is to expand on-demand fuel delivery service for P&C as well as B2B customers. The objective here is to, of course provide our customers with a faster and reliable fueling service.
As the CEO referenced before, we've announced a major change in LPG pricing, discovery of the Abu Dhabi in the Northern Emirates, so the price of LPG cylinders has been increased from AED 20 to AED 35  for the 25-pound cylinder. And AED 30 to AED 65 for the 50-pound canister. Now this change brings greater parity to the pricing of LPG cylinders across the UAE. Of course, you'll note that our prices are still below competitors. This, of course, gives us an opportunity to potentially expand our market share in markets where we currently are underpenetrated, such as Dubai and the Northern Emirates.
So given the LPG still underprice increase, we're expecting an uplift of approximately USD 20 million to our EBITDA on an annualized basis.
So finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy, and we are progressing well on our international expansion strategy in Saudi Arabia, in India as well as other countries. Of course, we will announce further updates on the appropriate time, once we obtain all the approvals.
So talking and -- about our nonfuel retail business. Let's move on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience stores network have increased to 288 as of the end of June 2020. So we have added 24 new convenience stores in the UAE during the first half of the year. In addition, as you may recall, we've got our convenience store revitalization program to slow down at -- during the [indiscernible] of the COVID-19 crisis. But now it's picked up pace, starting early in Q2, 2020. So during the first half of 2020, we have refurbished 11 of our Oasis convenience stores. That was [indiscernible] during the second quarter of 2020 as the movement restriction started to improve. For the month of July, we've refurbished 10 additional Oasis convenience stores.
So we are focused on offering a superior customer experience as well as recovering in the e-commerce side. For online home delivery service has more than 1,700 products from our Oasis convenience stores has been received very well during the pilot phase. So we've now expanded it to more than 100 convenience stores. So this tariff has resulted in an increase in back to life for those stores, which are part of the 100 stores from the program.
So the average food basket size has increased by 19.7% during the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2019, and this was driven by changes in the consumer shopping pattern during COVID-2019. The customers were visiting our stores last week on 8th, but they were buying more on the site. And this increase in basket size was also supported by various customer-centric initiatives. This included improved category management, introduction of fresh food and the premium coffee offering. In addition to the growth potential of the Oasis and C-store business, relative to growing their other non [indiscernible], we launched our first vehicle inspection center during the second quarter, and we're expecting to open more vehicle inspection centers over the coming year along with the expansion of our other nonfuel services, such as car washes and lube change.
Finally, I'd like to give you a brief update on our cost positions [indiscernible], it is and always remains the key pillar of our strategic platform competition. The benefits of the cost reduction initiatives taken before the COVID-19 [indiscernible], it's now starting to show up now in our financials as seen by slight reduction in operating expenditures of $7 million during the second quarter of the year. Now this was after an increase of $4 million in the first quarter of 2020. So the $7 million reduction is mainly a result of optimization in op cost as well as the decrease in general and management expenses. We've also implemented a more efficient operating model as our [indiscernible] My Station and other convenience stores. And we plan on maintaining this leaner staffing model moving forward.
So we're well on track to give [indiscernible] and need for operation, much more efficient. The relation to realizing for the benefits of capitalization, we also expect the results of additional initiatives implemented during the first half of this year, you have positive impact on our OpEx resumption, both in the second half of the year and beyond. As we have given guidance in the past, we reiterate our target of like-for-like operational expenditure savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020, are in line with our guidance in line to continue with our expansion strategy. In short, higher capital expenditure of USD 105 million during the first half of 2020. Compared to the first half of last year, the CapEx was about USD 38 million.
Our 2020 CapEx, capital expenditures, we expect to accelerate compared to 2019 as significantly higher number of units, stations are expected to be on live delivery this year. This, of course, reiterates our strong commitment to secure future growth and deliver [indiscernible] fuel and retail operating for our customers to [indiscernible]. So we have also continued to improve our capital expenditure efficiency. We're going to focus on rolling out invested capital and [indiscernible] of My Station.
So at this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance. Over to you, Petri."

During the first half of 2020, gross profit reached USD 666 million, representing a decrease of 1.3% compared to last year. And this was driven by lower fuel volumes, lower retail nonfuel and commercial profitability as well as the fact that last year, we had inventory gains of USD 33 million. And overall, this was mostly offset by higher retail fuel margins in the second quarter of 2020 as the retail fuel pump prices in the U.S. -- UAE did not fall in line with the future play cost [indiscernible] for crude oil and product prices. And as Mohamed mentioned, our cost of realization initiatives are underway to bring further efficiencies in number of [indiscernible].
And having said that, total operating expenses have increased during the first half by 11.8% year-on-year. And this is mainly due to the one-off expenses related to the additional pension costs. And so as, of course, we've had COVID-19, while growth of OpEx associated with our network expansion and cost of [indiscernible] effective early November last year, also contributed materially to the increase in OpEx.
The first half EBITDA was $342 million, this is a decrease of 15.4% compared to the first half of last year. Reported EBITDA, however, was negatively impacted by total one-offs of USD 46 million due to the onetime expenses and additional prudent provisioning on [indiscernible] cost as well as right of capital working progress. Whereas last year, first half benefited from one-off recoveries and reversals and inventory gains of total overall of USD 44 million. Importantly, underlying EBITDA, which is excluding inventory gains and losses as well as the one-offs, has remained resilient with growth of 7.6% compared to last year to the entire oil/fuel retail margin.
The first half net profit is reported at USD 248 million, decline by 22.4% compared to last year, mainly due to the one-off expenses and due to provisioning My Station as well as due to the presence of one-off gains, once again, I've mentioned last year. However, we have just for inventory gains and these one-offs, the company's reported earnings would have been higher by 6.9%, despite the business impact of COVID-19, specifically during Q2.
Now let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights in the first [indiscernible] the first half our total fuel volumes in [indiscernible] '19. As a result, fuel volumes sold decreased by [indiscernible] in the second 2020 [indiscernible] in the first quarter of 2020. And as you can see in this slide, retail fuel volumes were impacted more than commercial business [indiscernible] [ 32.6% ] year-on-year in Q2 after a marginal decline of only 1.9% year-on-year and during the first quarter. Our commercial fuel volume were supported by a part from industrial customers, leading to an increase in corporate volumes by 4.1% year-on-year in Q2. And this was partially offset by a decrease of 33.9% in aviation volumes. So our strategic customer in Q2 of 2020.
In our nonfuel business, nonfuel transactions have decreased by 33.5% during the first half compared to last year, almost again, of course, may be due to the [indiscernible] from COVID-19, which was led due to in customer visits as well as due to the absence of the vouchers after we implemented [indiscernible]. Average cost basket, however, has increased by 19.7% year-on-year due to the first half, and this was driven by our customer-centric initiatives, like improvement in category management, online delivery and also as a result of COVID-19 impact with customers visiting just frequently are spending more during this.
So let me now turn on the gross profit by segment. During the first half 2020, retail segment overall, gross profit increased by 7.7% last year. So that made fuel retail business. Fuel retail posted strong operating performance in gross profit growth of 14.8% year-on-year. On the back of higher retail fuel margins mainly in Q2 and regards to new fuel costs following also the renegotiations of our fuel supply contract in last November, partially offset by the clear increase [indiscernible]. Nonfuel cost profit decreased by 29% in the first half in the lower transactions as a result of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions as well as contribute the actions to larger prevention after implementing, and as I mentioned, the free assisted fueling.
And in the commercial business, the performance was negatively impacted by lower margins and aviation volumes as well as the line of items of $6 million. Whereas last year, during the first half, it included a one-off recovery USD [indiscernible].
Moving on to EBITDA by segment. First half retail EBITDA B2C was stable overall given the higher retail margins [indiscernible], but offset by lower fuel volumes prior inventory gains as well as the decline in nonfuel gross profit as explained. And finally the increases in OpEx. First half, commercial EBITDA B2B declined due to the lower margins, lower aviation volumes as well as prudent debt provisions in the commercial business.
And then finally, a few words about cash flow, cash generation, it was impacted and declined primarily due to the negative working capital movement as well as the dividend payment in the second quarter, partially offset by [indiscernible] from underlying operations. Specifically, the negative working capital movement was mainly as a result of a significant decrease in our payables from a supplier outlook, which is driven by lower purchases, together with the lower oil prices. We have continued to pay for our fuel supply in line with a 30-day payable period. While receivables have not decreased the receivable base in current environment, therefore, leading to an increased working capital during the quarter.
And with that, let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

As mentioned during today's presentation, we have delivered resilient underlying revenues in the first half of 2020. Allow me to update you on outlook and strategic priorities for 2020.
So we start with our fuel business, lockdown [indiscernible], the spread of COVID-19 in the UAE started to ease from end of May with the further reopening of the economy income. In line with the economy reopening, our fuel volumes has started to recover. The further ease in movement restrictions between various emirates in UAE, gradual resumption of life and blessing of international travel restrictions and the expected to be opening of schools, and our volumes took rather pace. We also expect our retail fuel margins to remain relatively high in Q3 2020 as some prices for July and August remained stable since April 2020. We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans and [indiscernible] manner and to deliver an enhanced customer experience, both of which are expected to deliver additional earnings growth. We expect delivery momentum to sustain in the second half of 2020 in light of the full year.
We expect to open 30 to 60 more stations in the UAE. Our focus is to ensure CapEx is allocated more effectively towards our growth and value-effective Dubai expansion. Therefore, we are targeting to open a total of 20 to 25 new stations in Dubai in 2020. The majority of which will be traditional stations. In our nonfuel business, we reiterate our target  to refurbish 40 to 50 C-stores by the end of 2020. Customer-centric initiatives are under way, like improvement and profitability management and reduction of fresh food and premium coffee products across our network.
We see great opportunities in our recently launched online foods and grocery delivery service from our ADNOC Oasis convenience stores. We expect to further expand our average in Dubai and expand in Northern Emirates, supporting our ambition of sustaining strongs of in our nonfuel offerings.
In terms of CapEx, we expect CapEx of up to $300 million in 2020 versus our previous guidance of $300 million to $400 million, mainly due to COVID-19 impact on contractor's mobilization and supply chain mechanics. We continue to explore new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. We continue to assess potential opportunities to achieve [indiscernible] growth and operational success in international markets. We are targeting the highest [indiscernible] on industry. We are now accelerating the deliveries of cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives across all our corporations and business lines.

Th",679,"Thank you, Athmane, and good afternoon, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I hope that everyone is staying safe and healthy. Before we take you through our first half results, let me first update you on our response to COVID-19. The rigorous introduction of rigorous health and safety measures, ADD as a company ensure that stations remain open to make services accessible to the healthcare sector and to keep customers moving on essential journeys. Furthermore, we implemented a range of measures to respond to evolving customer needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including new services to protect our staff and customers, such as daily deep cleaning of sites and car interior sanitization.
Aligned with the UAE's efforts to reopen the economy, we have successfully and safely relaunched services that we have entirely suspended during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic, including car wash, oil change and food bakery offerings in our convenience stores. We responded swiftly to the evolving environment by accelerating e-commerce strategy and launching new services to enhance customer experience. Our digital initiatives include contactless payment solutions, online delivery from our convenience stores and mobile fuel and LPG delivery.
Let me now take you through the key highlights of our first half 2020 performance and results. Despite the challenging operating environment, the company remained resilient delivering a 7.6% increase in underlying EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. We continue to make significant progress in executing smart growth strategy during the first half of 2020 by accelerating delivery of new stations and launching new services and products. The company remains on track to deliver 50 to 60 new stations by full year of 2020, which includes 20 to 25 stations in Dubai.
We are constantly looking to enhance customer satisfaction and increase customer loyalty. As a result, we have launched the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fueling provider, we call this ADNOC Rewards. ADNOC Rewards is a point-based system, allowing customers to earn and they can redeem points upon their purchases at our service stations and convenience stores. The ADNOC Distribution mobile app, which includes the wallet, mobile pay and the ADNOC Rewards program, now has more than 750,000 registered users.
The company reinforced its commitment to sustainability and supporting customers adoption for fuel efficient and hybrid vehicles by launching a new range of ADNOC Voyager lubricant for hybrid vehicle engines. The new range of ADNOC Voyager vehicle engine oils is the only first to meet the needs of the latest engine technologies and to be certified by the world-leading industry body, the American Petroleum Institute.
In LPG space, more recently, we announced a significant change in LPG pricing, introducing uniform rates for LPG cylinders sold to all our customers, whether retail or commercial across the whole country, in UAE. We expect increase in LPG cylinders pricing have positive impact on our earnings, which Mohamed will share more light on.
In nonfuel business area, we remain focused on providing superior shopping experience for our customers through revitalization program. Despite the lockdown restrictions, we were in the first half of 2020, we successfully refurbished ADNOC Oasis convenience stores, including [indiscernible] and Q2 of 2020.
In OpEx area, we started to see initial results of our cost optimization efforts. The $7 million reduction in like-for-like OpEx in Q2 2020, which comes after an increase of $4 million in Q1 2020. We remain on track to bring further efficiency in our operations and meet our full year targeted savings.
The company maintained a robust balance sheet and remains well positioned to expand both its domestic and international portfolio, in line with our growth strategy.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by our progressive dividend policy that offers high dividend visibility to our shareholders. For 2020, company's dividend policy is set to continue with an expected dividend of $700 million, subject to Board and shareholders' approval.
I will now hand over to Mohamed for an update on our strategy. Mohamed, over to you."

Everyone, good morning and good afternoon. I'm going to start off by giving you an update on our fuel business, which, of course, includes B2C and B2B segments.
So during the first half of 2020, as the CEO has mentioned, fuel volumes have declined by 12% -- 12.2% compared to the first half of 2019. This is, of course, mainly owing to the COVID-19 impact on our retail business.
Retail fuel volumes decreased by 17.2% year-on-year in the first half of 2020. Commercial fuel volumes, on the other hand, declined only marginally by 1.3% in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period of last year. And this was mainly due to lower uplift from the strategic aviation customers. Following the ease of lockdown and movement restrictions in the UAE, which started towards the end of May, we've noted a -- and experienced a significant recovery in fuel volumes. In the month of June and July this year, our retail fuel volumes, which account for about [ 65% ] of our total volumes, they recovered almost 90% of volume compared to the same period last year.
Speaking to our network expansion. We brought in 25 stations in the UAE during the first half of the year. And 18 out of those 25 were during the second quarter of the year. Now, of course, we remain focused on value exceeded Dubai expansion with the opening of 7 new stations during the first half of 2020. The performance of our Dubai stations remained very strong with double-digit growth in fuel sales during the first half of the year. This was driven by new station opening in an under-penetrated market. Despite COVID-19, our Dubai fuel sales continue to grow in high single digit during the second quarter of 2020. Of course, we expect our Dubai expansion to contribute meaningfully going forward as we open more stations in the second half of 2020 and beyond.
Continuing with our delivery momentum, we opened 7 additional stations, including 3 in Dubai in the month of July. To date in 2020, we have opened 32 new stations. This takes the total stations we operate in the UAE to 413. Out of the 413, 16 stations are in Dubai. As part of our strategy, we extensively tackle competition with faster and more efficient deployment of our fuel station,while also optimizing our capital expenditure. We've now opened 21 ADNOC On the go. And these are neighborhood service stations, which we've opened in Abu Dhabi as of July 2020.
During the second quarter of 2020, we also added 10 new trucks to our My Station fleet. It is to expand on-demand fuel delivery service for P&C as well as B2B customers. The objective here is to, of course provide our customers with a faster and reliable fueling service.
As the CEO referenced before, we've announced a major change in LPG pricing, discovery of the Abu Dhabi in the Northern Emirates, so the price of LPG cylinders has been increased from AED 20 to AED 35  for the 25-pound cylinder. And AED 30 to AED 65 for the 50-pound canister. Now this change brings greater parity to the pricing of LPG cylinders across the UAE. Of course, you'll note that our prices are still below competitors. This, of course, gives us an opportunity to potentially expand our market share in markets where we currently are underpenetrated, such as Dubai and the Northern Emirates.
So given the LPG still underprice increase, we're expecting an uplift of approximately USD 20 million to our EBITDA on an annualized basis.
So finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy, and we are progressing well on our international expansion strategy in Saudi Arabia, in India as well as other countries. Of course, we will announce further updates on the appropriate time, once we obtain all the approvals.
So talking and -- about our nonfuel retail business. Let's move on to the nonfuel retail business. Our convenience stores network have increased to 288 as of the end of June 2020. So we have added 24 new convenience stores in the UAE during the first half of the year. In addition, as you may recall, we've got our convenience store revitalization program to slow down at -- during the [indiscernible] of the COVID-19 crisis. But now it's picked up pace, starting early in Q2, 2020. So during the first half of 2020, we have refurbished 11 of our Oasis convenience stores. That was [indiscernible] during the second quarter of 2020 as the movement restriction started to improve. For the month of July, we've refurbished 10 additional Oasis convenience stores.
So we are focused on offering a superior customer experience as well as recovering in the e-commerce side. For online home delivery service has more than 1,700 products from our Oasis convenience stores has been received very well during the pilot phase. So we've now expanded it to more than 100 convenience stores. So this tariff has resulted in an increase in back to life for those stores, which are part of the 100 stores from the program.
So the average food basket size has increased by 19.7% during the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2019, and this was driven by changes in the consumer shopping pattern during COVID-2019. The customers were visiting our stores last week on 8th, but they were buying more on the site. And this increase in basket size was also supported by various customer-centric initiatives. This included improved category management, introduction of fresh food and the premium coffee offering. In addition to the growth potential of the Oasis and C-store business, relative to growing their other non [indiscernible], we launched our first vehicle inspection center during the second quarter, and we're expecting to open more vehicle inspection centers over the coming year along with the expansion of our other nonfuel services, such as car washes and lube change.
Finally, I'd like to give you a brief update on our cost positions [indiscernible], it is and always remains the key pillar of our strategic platform competition. The benefits of the cost reduction initiatives taken before the COVID-19 [indiscernible], it's now starting to show up now in our financials as seen by slight reduction in operating expenditures of $7 million during the second quarter of the year. Now this was after an increase of $4 million in the first quarter of 2020. So the $7 million reduction is mainly a result of optimization in op cost as well as the decrease in general and management expenses. We've also implemented a more efficient operating model as our [indiscernible] My Station and other convenience stores. And we plan on maintaining this leaner staffing model moving forward.
So we're well on track to give [indiscernible] and need for operation, much more efficient. The relation to realizing for the benefits of capitalization, we also expect the results of additional initiatives implemented during the first half of this year, you have positive impact on our OpEx resumption, both in the second half of the year and beyond. As we have given guidance in the past, we reiterate our target of like-for-like operational expenditure savings of approximately USD 25 million in 2020, are in line with our guidance in line to continue with our expansion strategy. In short, higher capital expenditure of USD 105 million during the first half of 2020. Compared to the first half of last year, the CapEx was about USD 38 million.
Our 2020 CapEx, capital expenditures, we expect to accelerate compared to 2019 as significantly higher number of units, stations are expected to be on live delivery this year. This, of course, reiterates our strong commitment to secure future growth and deliver [indiscernible] fuel and retail operating for our customers to [indiscernible]. So we have also continued to improve our capital expenditure efficiency. We're going to focus on rolling out invested capital and [indiscernible] of My Station.
So at this point, I will hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance. Over to you, Petri."

So what we have already demonstrated as Mohamed [indiscernible] financial performance for the first half, despite the challenging and operating environment. First half of 2020 rev",1014,"Many thanks to Mohamed, and good afternoon, good morning also from my side. So what we have already demonstrated as Mohamed [indiscernible] financial performance for the first half, despite the challenging and operating environment. First half of 2020 revenue decreased by 22.6% compared to last year, and this was driven by lower fuel volumes and nonfuel revenues as due to the lower oil prices compared to last year.
During the first half of 2020, gross profit reached USD 666 million, representing a decrease of 1.3% compared to last year. And this was driven by lower fuel volumes, lower retail nonfuel and commercial profitability as well as the fact that last year, we had inventory gains of USD 33 million. And overall, this was mostly offset by higher retail fuel margins in the second quarter of 2020 as the retail fuel pump prices in the U.S. -- UAE did not fall in line with the future play cost [indiscernible] for crude oil and product prices. And as Mohamed mentioned, our cost of realization initiatives are underway to bring further efficiencies in number of [indiscernible].
And having said that, total operating expenses have increased during the first half by 11.8% year-on-year. And this is mainly due to the one-off expenses related to the additional pension costs. And so as, of course, we've had COVID-19, while growth of OpEx associated with our network expansion and cost of [indiscernible] effective early November last year, also contributed materially to the increase in OpEx.
The first half EBITDA was $342 million, this is a decrease of 15.4% compared to the first half of last year. Reported EBITDA, however, was negatively impacted by total one-offs of USD 46 million due to the onetime expenses and additional prudent provisioning on [indiscernible] cost as well as right of capital working progress. Whereas last year, first half benefited from one-off recoveries and reversals and inventory gains of total overall of USD 44 million. Importantly, underlying EBITDA, which is excluding inventory gains and losses as well as the one-offs, has remained resilient with growth of 7.6% compared to last year to the entire oil/fuel retail margin.
The first half net profit is reported at USD 248 million, decline by 22.4% compared to last year, mainly due to the one-off expenses and due to provisioning My Station as well as due to the presence of one-off gains, once again, I've mentioned last year. However, we have just for inventory gains and these one-offs, the company's reported earnings would have been higher by 6.9%, despite the business impact of COVID-19, specifically during Q2.
Now let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights in the first [indiscernible] the first half our total fuel volumes in [indiscernible] '19. As a result, fuel volumes sold decreased by [indiscernible] in the second 2020 [indiscernible] in the first quarter of 2020. And as you can see in this slide, retail fuel volumes were impacted more than commercial business [indiscernible] [ 32.6% ] year-on-year in Q2 after a marginal decline of only 1.9% year-on-year and during the first quarter. Our commercial fuel volume were supported by a part from industrial customers, leading to an increase in corporate volumes by 4.1% year-on-year in Q2. And this was partially offset by a decrease of 33.9% in aviation volumes. So our strategic customer in Q2 of 2020.
In our nonfuel business, nonfuel transactions have decreased by 33.5% during the first half compared to last year, almost again, of course, may be due to the [indiscernible] from COVID-19, which was led due to in customer visits as well as due to the absence of the vouchers after we implemented [indiscernible]. Average cost basket, however, has increased by 19.7% year-on-year due to the first half, and this was driven by our customer-centric initiatives, like improvement in category management, online delivery and also as a result of COVID-19 impact with customers visiting just frequently are spending more during this.
So let me now turn on the gross profit by segment. During the first half 2020, retail segment overall, gross profit increased by 7.7% last year. So that made fuel retail business. Fuel retail posted strong operating performance in gross profit growth of 14.8% year-on-year. On the back of higher retail fuel margins mainly in Q2 and regards to new fuel costs following also the renegotiations of our fuel supply contract in last November, partially offset by the clear increase [indiscernible]. Nonfuel cost profit decreased by 29% in the first half in the lower transactions as a result of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions as well as contribute the actions to larger prevention after implementing, and as I mentioned, the free assisted fueling.
And in the commercial business, the performance was negatively impacted by lower margins and aviation volumes as well as the line of items of $6 million. Whereas last year, during the first half, it included a one-off recovery USD [indiscernible].
Moving on to EBITDA by segment. First half retail EBITDA B2C was stable overall given the higher retail margins [indiscernible], but offset by lower fuel volumes prior inventory gains as well as the decline in nonfuel gross profit as explained. And finally the increases in OpEx. First half, commercial EBITDA B2B declined due to the lower margins, lower aviation volumes as well as prudent debt provisions in the commercial business.
And then finally, a few words about cash flow, cash generation, it was impacted and declined primarily due to the negative working capital movement as well as the dividend payment in the second quarter, partially offset by [indiscernible] from underlying operations. Specifically, the negative working capital movement was mainly as a result of a significant decrease in our payables from a supplier outlook, which is driven by lower purchases, together with the lower oil prices. We have continued to pay for our fuel supply in line with a 30-day payable period. While receivables have not decreased the receivable base in current environment, therefore, leading to an increased working capital during the quarter.
And with that, let me hand it back over to Ahmed for the closing remarks."

So we start with our fuel business, lockdown [indiscernible], the spread of COVID-19 in the UAE started to ease from end of May with the further reopening of the economy income. In line with the economy reopening, our fuel volumes has started to recover. The further ease in movement restrictions between various emirates in UAE, gradual resumption of life and blessing of international travel restrictions and the expected to be opening of schools, and our volumes took rather pace. We also expect our retail fuel margins to remain relatively high in Q3 2020 as some prices for July and August remained stable since April 2020. We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans and [indiscernible] manner and to deliver an enhanced customer experience, both of which are expected to deliver additional earnings growth. We expect delivery momentum to sustain in the second half of 2020 in light of the full year.
We expect to open 30 to 60 more stations in the UAE. Our focus is to ensure CapEx is allocated more effectively towards our growth and value-effective Dubai expansion. Therefore, we are targeting to open a total of 20 to 25 new stations in Dubai in 2020. The majority of which will be traditional stations. In our nonfuel business, we reiterate our target  to refurbish 40 to 50 C-stores by the end of 2020. Customer-centric initiatives are under way, like improvement and profitability management and reduction of fresh food and premium coffee products across our network.
We see great opportunities in our recently launched online foods and grocery delivery service from our ADNOC Oasis convenience stores. We expect to further expand our average in Dubai and expand in Northern Emirates, supporting our ambition of sustaining strongs of in our nonfuel offerings.
In terms of CapEx, we expect CapEx of up to $300 million in 2020 versus our previous guidance of $300 million to $400 million, mainly due to COVID-19 impact on contractor's mobilization and supply chain mechanics. We continue to explore new growth opportunities presented by the current environment. We continue to assess potential opportunities to achieve [indiscernible] growth and operational success in international markets. We are targeting the highest [indiscernible] on industry. We are now accelerating the deliveries of cost optimization and margin improvement initiatives across all our corporations and business lines.
