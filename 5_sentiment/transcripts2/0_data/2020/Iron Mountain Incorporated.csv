Before we get into our discussion of the Q4 results, I want to first welcome Barry as our new CFO to the Iron Mountain family. Barry brings a successful track record of navigating transformation and effective change at various organizations. Most recently, he led efforts at HanesBrands to increase operating cash flow, reduce leverage and produce strong international growth. His insights will be very valuable as we roll out Project Summit, our transformation program, to simplify our structure and create a more dynamic and agile organization. We look forward to his contributions as we enter 2020 and beyond. .
With that, let me start with a look-back at where we have been on our journey over the past 6 years, looking first at total organic revenue. In 2013, it was flat and adjusted EBITDA declined 1%. Today, we reported total organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and 2% if we hold paper prices constant. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, 2019 saw a growth of 3% or nearly 5% if we apply 2019 paper prices in 2018. 
More broadly, progress over the past 6 years is visible in nearly all metrics, not the least being the expansion of EBITDA margin by almost 500 basis points. This macro look-back is important as it is the basis that continues to provide momentum going forward. We feel this positive momentum in sales and profitability, coupled with Project Summit in a broader portfolio and service offerings to our core customers is the platform from which we expect this trend to continue. 
Of course, this progress just didn't happen. It is the result of the successful execution of our strategy of shifting our revenue mix to faster-growing businesses, including emerging markets, data center and adjacent businesses and successfully implementing our revenue management program. We also made important progress on Project Summit, our transformation program designed to accelerate this strategy, and create a more streamlined, simplified and agile organization better suited to solve our customers' challenges. 
Furthermore, I am pleased to share with you that we are very much on track with our execution on Project Summit. We moved quickly with the head count reduction we announced in order to ensure minimal disruption to the broader organization. If you recall, we announced plans to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%. As of the end of December, we had completed approximately 70% of the reductions. We all recognize that change is never easy, and over these last few months, our organization has shown great resilience and focus. This is a testament to our great people and the fact that a large number of mountaineers are already feeling energized by being able to more easily address and serve our customers. 
As it relates to the savings targets we communicated, the actions we took in the fourth quarter have resulted in $50 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefits that will begin to flow through in Q1. We have good line of sight to the incremental $30 million of in-year benefits we expect to generate in the second half of 2020 with a number of the process and systems improvements underway. We are excited about the new ways we are embracing technology to improve the way we work so we can all show up differently and drive change. Ultimately, we expect Project Summit to expand organic revenue beyond the current growth rates, all whilst boosting adjusted EBITDA by an additional $200 million over the next 2 years. This is all on top of the 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth we have been achieving the last few quarters. 
Turning to fourth quarter performance. Constant currency revenue increased almost 3% over the prior year. We delivered solid adjusted EBITDA growth of 8%, adjusted EPS growth of 24% and AFFO growth of 18% while simultaneously increasing investments to support future growth. Barry will provide more detail on the financial performance as well as our outlook for 2020. 
Turning to business performance. Organic global records management volume remained relatively steady with a 10 basis points decline over the trailing 12-month period. To put this into perspective, globally, volumes declined approximately 500,000 cubic feet on a base of nearly 700 million cubic feet driven mainly by fewer acquisitions of customer relationships. More specifically, in 2018, we acquired 3.5 million cubic feet of customer relationships which tend to be some of our highest returning investments as opposed to only 2.8 million cubic feet in 2019. We  expect the impact of fewer customer acquisitions in 2019 to continue its drag on volume through the first half of 2020. However, we are confident that this is a temporary deviation and that records management and volume, along with incremental storage opportunities in non box categories such as consumer and alternative storage and adjacent businesses, should result in flat to positive levels of organic volume growth for the full year 2020. 
Now coming back to current volume trends. Apart from the dynamic I just discussed, the single biggest headwind on volume today is the rate of change of incoming boxes from our existing customers. You will recall from previous calls the average life of a box in our inventory has remained rock steady at 15 years. Whilst the average age of a box when it is destroyed has remained steady over many years, the average age of our inventory will naturally skew during periods where the growth rate of incoming boxes is undergoing change. For example, if a vertical is experiencing a slowdown in the rate of incoming volume, then the average age of our inventory will increase. Whilst we can't predict when equilibrium will begin -- will again be achieved, we feel, in the meantime, it will remain a minor impact, given that our customers continue to add new boxes to storage annually just at a lower rate than historically. 
To help you better understand, let's take a look at what has become one of our slowest growing yet most stable verticals. The North American legal vertical began its digital transformation journey many years ago. This change in customer behavior has resulted in a deceleration in the rate at which existing legal customers send us new boxes every year until recently. The good news is that we have seen the growth rate stabilized to slightly positive net volume growth. We expect a similar trend across other verticals that are not as far along on their digital transformation journey. 
To provide further context, let's say, a legal customer stores 100 boxes with us. 10 years ago, they would send us 6 new boxes a year and destroy or remove 2 boxes, so they would be net positive 4 boxes or a 4% growth rate. Today, a similar customer would send us 2 to 3 new boxes and still destroy 1 or 2 boxes, making them flat to net positive 1% growth rate, which is the new normal for this customer vertical, remaining stable at this lower growth rate given the age profile of their inventory has stabilized. 
We should remind you that what I just discussed is only affecting volume from existing customers, in addition to that, we continue to focus on new customers, competitive wins, opportunities in the unvended and federal channels. And as we talked about earlier, other methods of customer acquisition. We expect all these various sales channels to continue to contribute to overall organic volume growth for global RIM over time. This is what gives us confidence in the durability of the recurring revenue stream and strong cash flow generation that comes from global RIM organization, and we do not anticipate a change in the foreseeable future. As I'd like to say, it's the financial beast that allows us to fund growth opportunities while returning cash to our shareholders. 
We've also made considerable progress in transforming our core room business to a more diversified model and are on track to achieve our targeted geographic mix which, as a reminder, is 20% of revenue from faster-growing markets by the end of 2020. We ended 2019 with these markets contributing 19% to total revenue, and for comparative purposes, faster-growing markets represented less than 10% of revenue in 2013. Moreover, over the same period of time, we have expanded the adjusted EBITDA margin for these relatively new and faster-growing markets from 20% to 30% in 2019, and we believe we can continue to expand margins as we scale our presence in these geographies and to select new markets that offer superior growth opportunities all whilst managing our cost structure efficiently. 
Related, our global digital solutions business had a record year, with revenue increasing 10% year-over-year. As we shared with you last quarter, our digital solutions offering, such as InSight, are increasingly enabling us to approach our customers with a differentiated solution, resulting in a pull-through of other products and services. 
Just one example of this was a recent win with a large, highly regulated financial institution. This customer previously managed its physical file room storage in-house with over 600 employees across 5 global locations. We will assume responsibility for the management of all file storage, processing of the files and begin providing value-added services. We plan to transform the operation by consolidating locations, reorganizing workflows, adding workflow software and applying digital solutions such as RFID and artificial intelligence and machine learning through our InSight platform. When completed, this effort will not only help our customers significantly reduce costs, but it will also be the foundation for future enhanced digital products. We were able to win the business based on our unique combination of document management and workflow expertise, combined with our digital solutions, which we expect will result in close to $30 million in annual revenue for the next 10 years, making this one of the largest deals we have signed. 
Turning now to our data center business. We had a good year executing 17 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including our first hyperscale deal. Whilst we are pleased with the steady commercial progress we have made leasing up our facilities ending Q4 with a stabilized utilization rate of 90%, we did see some deals in the pipeline shift from Q4 into 2020. The 17 megawatts leased in 2019 shows good progress on a base of approximately 100 megawatts at the beginning of 2019. We within our leasing for the year, we were successful in attracting over 100 new logos to our global data center platform, further diversifying our enterprise customer base and underscoring our brand strength in this dynamic industry. We continue to make good progress organically building our global platform, delivering almost 20 megawatts of capacity in key markets around the globe, including London, Amsterdam, Singapore, New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Phoenix. We are excited about our newest development in Frankfurt and currently have a strong pipeline of pre-leasing opportunities in various stages of discussion. 
Additionally, in Q4, we entered into an agreement for a second site in Slough, which will allow us to expand our presence in the important London market by adding an incremental of 25 megawatts of capacity. Under the terms of the agreement, the landowner will build a shell, after which, we will finish the build-out of the data center to our specifications. Our existing footprint in London which is adjacent to this new site is nearing stabilization, and this new agreement provides capacity for larger requirements in a very desirable market with low latency network connectivity. 
Looking into 2020, the first half pipeline looks strong with a number of larger opportunities on the horizon. That said, these larger deals tend to be lumpy, and timing is often harder to predict. Putting this all together, we would expect to be able to lease up another 15 to 20 megawatts of capacity in 2020. We feel very good about our commercial momentum and a building pipeline of demand, including hyperscale interest in a number of our markets such as Phoenix, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt. 
In summary, 2019 was not without its challenges in terms of consistently declining paper prices, but we ended the year in line with our expectations, having a number of strong commercial wins whilst making measurable progress on our strategic plan. We are focused on maximizing the benefits from Project Summit not only financially but in how we operate as a team and an organization. We have a unique opportunity to translate a streamlined and more agile organization into speed to unlock further revenue opportunities through how we connect with and build additional value for our customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry, who will walk you through Q4 performance and our outlook for 2020."

I am delighted to be here at such an important time in the company's evolution, and I'm energized by our strategy, the engagement and strength of our team and the opportunities we have in front of us. 
Turning now to results. In the fourth quarter, revenue, EBITDA and AFFO were in line with our guidance ranges. We continue to expand margins as adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over last year. Additionally, AFFO increased 18% to $228 million. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased $18 million or 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by total organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter, reflecting the volume trends Bill discussed and contributions from revenue management. 
Total organic service revenue declined 70 basis points in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This reflects the change in paper prices, which were at record highs in the back half of 2018 but ended 2019 at record lows. Adjusting for the $13 million impact of lower paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% for the fourth quarter to $386 million despite lower paper prices and FX headwinds, with margins expanding 190 basis points year-over-year to 35.8%. For the quarter, our tax rate was in line with guidance and adjusted earnings per share was $0.31. 
Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track, and in the fourth quarter, we recognized $49 million of restructuring charges to implement the first phase. For 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $130 million of additional restructuring charges, and we continue to expect Project Summit to deliver $80 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 and  $200 million over the next 2 years. We continue to expect total restructuring charges related to the program to be approximately $240 million. 
Now let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 90 basis points for the quarter. Organic Storage revenue increased 2.2%, reflecting volume growth in faster-growing markets and revenue management. Organic service revenue declined 1%, driven by the change in paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.3% represents an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue management and continuous improvement initiatives. 
Turning to the data center business. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 7.8%. We executed approximately 2 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for a total of 17 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily driven by enterprise and federal government customers, and churn at 1.5% remains consistent with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 51.7%, up significantly year-on-year. Profitability was boosted by 2 nonrecurring items: first, a $4 million contractual settlement; and second, a $2 million lease modification fee. Adjusting for those items, margin was 44.4% in the quarter, an increase of 290 basis points, reflecting the increased scale and progress on integration activity. 
Data center development CapEx was approximately $400 million for the full year, including $50 million for the Frankfurt land acquisition. In 2020, we expect development CapEx of approximately $200 million, reflecting the development projects currently underway. For the full year 2019, revenue of $4.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.44 billion grew 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.02. AFFO was $856 million, and dividend per share was $2.45, representing an 82% dividend payout ratio. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Lease adjusted leverage at the end of the year was 5.7x, which was slightly down versus the third quarter. We expect leverage to remain flat to slightly down in 2020, reflecting our strong focus on profit expansion partially offset by Project Summit onetime costs, lower year-over-year paper prices and foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to delevering over time, which will enable considerable strategic flexibility. 
As part of our ongoing capital recycling program, in the fourth quarter, we sold 2 portfolios, which generated net proceeds of $83 million, bringing us to approximately $170 million of proceeds for the full year. We expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. 
As investors know, part of our strategy is to increase scale in faster-growing international markets. We are pleased to report that in early January, we acquired the remaining 75% stake in OSG Records Management, the leading provider of document and data management solutions in Russia. As investors may recall, this has been a joint venture in which we previously owned 25%. We now have complete ownership of the business, which has annual revenues of more than $50 million, manages approximately 18 million cubic feet of inventory and is exhibiting strong growth. 
Turning to guidance, which is detailed in the supplemental for your review and highlighted on Slide 13 of our presentation. We are expecting 2020 revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.57 billion driven by organic EBITDA growth and Project Summit benefits. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.25 and AFFO to be in the range of $930 million to $960 million. This strong growth is despite continued low paper prices, additional foreign exchange headwinds and includes continued investments in digital solutions, IT infrastructure and our data center business. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, there are several items I would like to call out to consider when modeling the first quarter. First, we expect Project Summit actions taken in 2019 will be a significant addition to adjusted EBITDA throughout the year beginning in the first quarter. Naturally, we also anticipate organic EBITDA growth from our base business. I would also remind you that in the first quarter of 2019, we experienced elevated labor and other costs. Lastly, given where paper prices in the U.S. dollar are currently, we expect both will be notable headwinds in the first quarter. 
Our 2020 guidance implies total organic revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% as compared to prior year, including Organic Storage rental revenue growth of approximately 2%. Our guidance assumes paper prices and FX remain at current levels, which, combined, we expect to result in an adjusted EBITDA headwind of approximately $35 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Anticipated investments, which are detailed in our supplemental, will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings. We may also utilize third-party capital for data center development, as we have previously discussed. 
In closing, we expect to deliver organic growth while also realizing the benefits from Project Summit. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be commitment to our dividend, investing in growth areas through both organic investment and strategic acquisitions and reducing lease-adjusted leverage over time. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our first quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So let me answer the question on 2 levels. One, in terms of the technology aspect that you alluded to. And then the other in terms of the operating rhythm and what we're doing differently in managing and leading the company. So on the technology side is that one of the biggest areas of change is going to be upgrading and applying new technology in terms of the way we track, interact with our customers. So to give you specific examples, we have 4 instances of sales force, which is very hard to get a single view of a customer globally. The second thing is we have over 40 billing systems, which again, billing is an area where we need to make sure that we're consistently not just billing, but responding to queries around billing for our customers. So that's an area where we're applying technology to allow our mountaineers to have better visibility of our customers, which helps them on the selling side, but also in terms of serving those customers when they have inquiries. So that's one area in technology. The part that's -- we're already starting to see a big effect is in terms of how we're leading the company. So one of the things that we talked about but probably not is directly on the last call is some of it isn't just about taking cost out. It's actually redeploying cost, so we're actually adding cost or adding resources around our people that are interacting with our customers or -- especially in terms of strategic account management. So to give you an example of that -- and also in terms of the way we lead the company. So we now have an expanded enterprise leadership team, which we met in January. And first of all, the energy in the room was noticeably different because now we have the top 40 leaders and on a regular rhythm every quarter in a room to discuss where we're going and how to get there faster and better. But also part of that briefing was the strategic account team had the opportunity to put up a slide of one of our most mature customers that we serve globally. And the interesting thing is if you had surveyed people beforehand, they would have said that, that customer is probably 80% served if you look at a matrix of our product offering in the geographies they fit in, and they're completely a global company virtually in every country we're in, and then some more. And the interesting thing is it was just the opposite. We're serving about 20% to 30% of the potential of that client rather than 80%. So a combination of having strategic accounts, taking a global look at how we can serve that customer better and then the energy being able to have that discussion with the top leadership of the company globally on a quarterly basis, I think, is going to make a real change."

So just to come back to it, to put it in context. First of all, we're talking about 0.5 million cubic feet in a negative decline in the year, over 700 million cubic feet. And if you look at that, that's more than explained by just the slowdown in the number of customer acquisitions that we did during '19 as compared to 2018. And at that level, that's totally in our control. In other words, we normally do about 3 million cubic feet. We did less than that in 2019. We did more than that -- a little bit more than that in 2018. And the difference between those 2 more than accounts for the 0.5 million cubic feet down in 2019, so just put that into context. In addition to that is we continue -- we source volume in 3 different buckets besides volume coming in from existing accounts. We source it from customers that are completely unvended, not just the federal government, but they are even some of our most mature, or I mentioned one of our most mature customers, they're, believe it or not, some places where they still do records management in-house. And I actually talked about the file rooms that we're taking over for this customer, which is the largest single customer we ever signed, $30 million a year. We signed that contract because we're actually providing them a full wraparound solution, but we're taking over all their volume in their records rooms, which historically weren't in our facilities, right? And this is a customer that we've served for many, many years. So there's the unvended bucket. 
The second bucket -- and those are our most -- highest return. The second and third buckets are either competitive takeaways or these customer acquisitions I talked about, which has historically trended around 3 million cubic feet plus or minus on a given year. Those actually have similar returns. In one case, we're paying paramount fees and sales commissions. In the other case, we're paying someone that wants to get out of the business or is getting out of business completely, and we take over those customer contracts. So those -- if we look at those 3 vectors, we continue to see that there's a lot of growth. 
The last thing I would say just to emphasize is that I talked about the legal vertical. The thing that's driving the negative trend is not -- that all of a sudden, people aren't sending us anything. Virtually every customer is continuing to send us new boxes every year. The thing that is driving the slight drag on volume is a secondary effect of slowing down rates as they go through this transformation. So the legal vertical I gave you for a number of years when it was going through that deceleration was in negative net volume territory because each year, the rate of incoming boxes was changing. So the average age of their inventory was ticking up, and so you're getting more boxes destroyed during that period of time. As it's now stabilized at the new normal at this lower rate, it's actually stabilized to slightly net positive cube. So we see similar trends happening in some of the other verticals that may be a little bit further behind the legal vertical on digital transformation. But it is important to note that the legal vertical, which is virtually almost our slowest growing vertical in North America, is actually slightly net positive in terms of cube growth."

We are in the earlier innings on those markets and those are the faster-growing markets. So the growth that we're getting from other international when you see storage revenue growth is mainly from volume growth and only a little bit of revenue management. So far, we don't see any difference in trends in those markets than we did, say, in Western Europe, when we rolled it out or North America before that in terms of elasticity, but it does take longer for that effect to show up just because some of those contracts are on 3 years. Some of them are on 5-year contracts. Of course, some are annual. So what we find is we're, I guess, 18 to 24 months into the revenue rolling revenue management out globally, and you'll see that, just like it did in Western Europe, it will take, I would say, another 1 year, 1.5 years before you start seeing the full effects of that."

So the trends that you're kind of calling out is virtually 100% covered by the change in customer acquisitions, not even the second derivative. Now in terms of the overall change in terms of volumes in North America that we see, as I said, is that when legal was going through its downward march in growth rate as they were transforming or adding more digital processes to their workflows, is we did see similar trends that we see, for instance, in financial services today. I mean, financial services is still one of our higher growing -- our incoming boxes from financial services, but it's just at a lower rate than we did previously. So first of all, is that -- because we're talking about the thing that's impacting our net volume for some of these verticals, its rates have changed, just by its very kind of mathematical nature. These are muted effects of their secondary effects. And the thing I can't predict -- the thing I would predict is, I think we're going to be in this territory, but if you think about over a year, kind of 7 million to 8 million negative cube growth just on pure RIM and mainly focused in North America until we get through this transformation. And as I said, when we look at legal, we've gotten through that in legal is actually slightly positive in terms of net Q growth once it goes through it. The thing that's hard to predict is how fast people digitally transform and what growth rate they stabilize to."

So I would answer it in 2 different ways is, I think the contract you talked about, we had a very large blanket contract with one of the large departments, and it's still exactly -- we still have the frustration that you're alluding to. Actually, we've had more wins on the service side because it's been easier for them to give us business on the service side than it is on the storage and that's partly because of their relationships with the national archives. The one thing that we do know, both from the national archives and government leaders, is that we do expect over time for that to start coming free because national archives has publicly announced that there's only a window, it's over the next few months or years, where they're going to continue to accept volume from government agencies. So eventually, that will come loose. So that one has been slower. On the other side, we've -- we had a win. I think it was about 1.5 years ago, where we -- I think it will be 2 years. This summer, we had a one win with a large government agency, where they were exiting their own warehouse and we move that. I think we won in the summer, and we had it all -- we had 400,000 cubic feet roughly moved by November into our facility near joint base Andrews. So when they decide to move the -- we can onboard it quite quickly. But the contract that you're talking about that large government contract, we find that we're getting more success on the services, digital services side right now than the storage because of the stickiness with their relationship with NARA."

I think where we stand right now is that we like development. Development still had the highest returns. Now that being said, we do when we go into a market, for instance, I think I may have used -- referenced this before, when we looked at Frankfurt, we looked at either doing an acquisition or buying land. In this case, we bought a piece of land that was already permitted. And for us, the better opportunity was built buying the piece of land and building it out. But we do look -- when we go into these markets, what I would call brownfield, where we -- there may be a small player in that market that we want to be in but it has a significant amount of expansion capacity on their land or within their shell. So we do continue -- and that was what drove us to the EvoSwitch. Amsterdam was another market where we looked at buy a brownfield opportunity for a greenfield, and in that case, it was better to do a brownfield. So we'll continue to look at it that way, but we don't feel like we need to go out and buy something to bulk up for the sake of bulking up. We feel we're -- we've grown a lot and we're in a pretty good position in terms of being recognized. And I would say that we see most things that are up for grabs in the markets that we're present in."

Before we get into our discussion of the Q4 results, I want to first welcome Barry as our new CFO to the Iron Mountain family. Barry brings a successful track record of navigating transformation and effective change at various organizations. Most recently, he led efforts at HanesBrands to increase operating cash flow, reduce leverage and produce strong international growth. His insights will be very valuable as we roll out Project Summit, our transformation program, to simplify our structure and create a more dynamic and agile organization. We look forward to his contributions as we enter 2020 and beyond.
With that, let me start with a look-back at where we have been on our journey over the past 6 years, looking first at total organic revenue. In 2013, it was flat and adjusted EBITDA declined 1%. Today, we reported total organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and 2% if we hold paper prices constant. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, 2019 saw a growth of 3% or nearly 5% if we apply 2019 paper prices in 2018. 
More broadly, progress over the past 6 years is visible in nearly all metrics, not the least being the expansion of EBITDA margin by almost 500 basis points. This macro look-back is important as it is the basis that continues to provide momentum going forward. We feel this positive momentum in sales and profitability, coupled with Project Summit in a broader portfolio and service offerings to our core customers is the platform from which we expect this trend to continue. 
Of course, this progress just didn't happen. It is the result of the successful execution of our strategy of shifting our revenue mix to faster-growing businesses, including emerging markets, data center and adjacent businesses and successfully implementing our revenue management program. We also made important progress on Project Summit, our transformation program designed to accelerate this strategy, and create a more streamlined, simplified and agile organization better suited to solve our customers' challenges.  
Furthermore, I am pleased to share with you that we are very much on track with our execution on Project Summit. We moved quickly with the head count reduction we announced in order to ensure minimal disruption to the broader organization. If you recall, we announced plans to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%. As of the end of December, we had completed approximately 70% of the reductions. We all recognize that change is never easy, and over these last few months, our organization has shown great resilience and focus. This is a testament to our great people and the fact that a large number of mountaineers are already feeling energized by being able to more easily address and serve our customers. 
As it relates to the savings targets we communicated, the actions we took in the fourth quarter have resulted in $50 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefits that will begin to flow through in Q1. We have good line of sight to the incremental $30 million of in-year benefits we expect to generate in the second half of 2020, with a number of the process and systems improvements underway. We are excited about the new ways we are embracing technology to improve the way we work so we can all show up differently and drive change. Ultimately, we expect Project Summit to expand organic revenue beyond the current growth rates, all whilst boosting adjusted EBITDA by an additional $200 million over the next 2 years. This is all on top of the 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth we have been achieving the last few quarters. 
Turning to fourth quarter performance. Constant currency revenue increased almost 3% over the prior year. We delivered solid adjusted EBITDA growth of 8%, adjusted EPS growth of 24% and AFFO growth of 18% while simultaneously increasing investments to support future growth. Barry will provide more detail on the financial performance as well as our outlook for 2020. 
Turning to business performance. Organic global records management volume remained relatively steady with a 10 basis points decline over the trailing 12-month period. To put this into perspective, globally, volumes declined approximately 500,000 cubic feet on a base of nearly 700 million cubic feet, driven mainly by fewer acquisitions of customer relationships. More specifically, in 2018, we acquired 3.5 million cubic feet of customer relationships which tend to be some of our highest returning investments as opposed to only 2.8 million cubic feet in 2019. We expect the impact of fewer customer acquisitions in 2019 to continue its drag on volume through the first half of 2020. However, we are confident that this is a temporary deviation and that records management and volume, along with incremental storage opportunities in non box categories such as consumer and alternative storage and adjacent businesses, should result in flat to positive levels of organic volume growth for the full year 2020. 
Now coming back to current volume trends. Apart from the dynamic I just discussed, the single biggest headwind on volume today is the rate of change of incoming boxes from our existing customers. You will recall from previous calls, the average life of a box in our inventory has remained rock steady at 15 years. Whilst the average age of a box when it is destroyed has remained steady over many years, the average age of our inventory will naturally skew during periods where the growth rate of incoming boxes is undergoing change. For example, if a vertical is experiencing a slowdown in the rate of incoming volume, then the average age of our inventory will increase. Whilst we can't predict when equilibrium will begin -- will again be achieved, we feel, in the meantime, it will remain a minor impact, given that our customers continue to add new boxes to storage annually, just at a lower rate than historically. 
To help you better understand, let's take a look at what has become one of our slowest growing yet most stable verticals. The North American legal vertical began its digital transformation journey many years ago. This change in customer behavior has resulted in a deceleration in the rate at which existing legal customers send us new boxes every year until recently. The good news is that we have seen the growth rate stabilize to slightly positive net volume growth. We expect a similar trend across other verticals that are not as far along on their digital transformation journey. 
To provide further context, let's say, a legal customer stores 100 boxes with us. 10 years ago, they would send us 6 new boxes a year and destroy or remove 2 boxes, so they would be net positive 4 boxes or a 4% growth rate. Today, a similar customer would send us 2 to 3 new boxes and still destroy 1 or 2 boxes, making them flat to net positive 1% growth rate, which is the new normal for this customer vertical, remaining stable at this lower growth rate given the age profile of their inventory has stabilized. 
We should remind you that what I just discussed is only affecting volume from existing customers, in addition to that, we continue to focus on new customers, competitive wins, opportunities in the unvended and federal channels. And as we talked about earlier, other methods of customer acquisition. We expect all these various sales channels to continue to contribute to overall organic volume growth for global RIM over time. This is what gives us confidence in the durability of the recurring revenue stream and strong cash flow generation that comes from global RIM organization, and we do not anticipate a change in the foreseeable future. As I like to say, it's the financial beast that allows us to fund growth opportunities while returning cash to our shareholders. 
We've also made considerable progress in transforming our core RIM business to a more diversified model and are on track to achieve our targeted geographic mix which, as a reminder, is 20% of revenue from faster-growing markets by the end of 2020. We ended 2019 with these markets contributing 19% to total revenue, and for comparative purposes, faster-growing markets represented less than 10% of revenue in 2013. Moreover, over the same period of time, we have expanded the adjusted EBITDA margin for these relatively new and faster-growing markets from 20% to 30% in 2019, and we believe we can continue to expand margins as we scale our presence in these geographies and to select new markets that offer superior growth opportunities all whilst managing our cost structure efficiently. 
Related, our global digital solutions business had a record year, with revenue increasing 10% year-over-year. As we shared with you last quarter, our digital solutions offerings, such as InSight, are increasingly enabling us to approach our customers with a differentiated solution, resulting in a pull-through of other products and services. 
Just one example of this was a recent win with a large, highly regulated financial institution. This customer previously managed its physical file room storage in-house, with over 600 employees across 5 global locations. We will assume responsibility for the management of all file storage, processing of the files and begin providing value-added services. We plan to transform the operation by consolidating locations, reorganizing workflows, adding workflow software and applying digital solutions such as RFID and artificial intelligence and machine learning through our InSight platform. When completed, this effort will not only help our customers significantly reduce costs, but it will also be the foundation for future enhanced digital products. We're able to win the business based on our unique combination of document management and workflow expertise, combined with our digital solutions, which we expect will result in close to $30 million in annual revenue for the next 10 years, making this one of the largest deals we have signed. 
Turning now to our data center business. We had a good year executing 17 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including our first hyperscale deal. Whilst we are pleased with the steady commercial progress we have made leasing up our facilities ending Q4 with a stabilized utilization rate of 90%, we did see some deals in the pipeline shift from Q4 into 2020. The 17 megawatts leased in 2019 shows good progress on a base of approximately 100 megawatts at the beginning of 2019. Within our leasing for the year, we were successful in attracting over 100 new logos to our global data center platform, further diversifying our enterprise customer base and underscoring our brand strength in this dynamic industry. We continue to make good progress organically building our global platform, delivering almost 20 megawatts of capacity in key markets around the globe, including London, Amsterdam, Singapore, New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Phoenix. We are excited about our newest development in Frankfurt and currently have a strong pipeline of pre-leasing opportunities in various stages of discussion. 
Additionally, in Q4, we entered into an agreement for a second site in Slough, which will allow us to expand our present -- presence in the important London market by adding an incremental of 25 megawatts of capacity. Under the terms of the agreement, the landowner will build a shell, after which, we will finish the build-out of the data center to our specifications. Our existing footprint in London, which is adjacent to this new site, is nearing stabilization, and this new agreement provides capacity for larger requirements in a very desirable market with low latency network connectivity. 
Looking into 2020, the first half pipeline looks strong with a number of larger opportunities on the horizon. That said, these larger deals tend to be lumpy, and timing is often harder to predict. Putting this all together, we would expect to be able to lease up another 15 to 20 megawatts of capacity in 2020. We feel very good about our commercial momentum and a building pipeline of demand, including hyperscale interest in a number of our markets such as Phoenix, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt. 
In summary, 2019 was not without its challenges in terms of consistently declining paper prices, but we ended the year in line with our expectations, having a number of strong commercial wins whilst making measurable progress on our strategic plan. We are focused on maximizing the benefits from Project Summit not only financially but in how we operate as a team and an organization. We have a unique opportunity to translate a streamlined and more agile organization into speed to unlock further revenue opportunities through how we connect with and build additional value for our customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry, who will walk you through Q4 performance and our outlook for 2020."

I am delighted to be here at such an important time in the company's evolution, and I'm energized by our strategy, the engagement and strength of our team and the opportunities we have in front of us. 
Turning now to results. In the fourth quarter, revenue, EBITDA and AFFO were in line with our guidance ranges. We continue to expand margins as adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over last year. Additionally, AFFO increased 18% to $228 million. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased $18 million or 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by total organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter, reflecting the volume trends Bill discussed and contributions from revenue management. 
Total organic service revenue declined 70 basis points in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This reflects the change in paper prices, which were at record highs in the back half of 2018 but ended 2019 at record lows. Adjusting for the $13 million impact of lower paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% for the fourth quarter to $386 million despite lower paper prices and FX headwinds, with margins expanding 190 basis points year-over-year to 35.8%. For the quarter, our tax rate was in line with guidance and adjusted earnings per share was $0.31. 
Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track, and in the fourth quarter, we recognized $49 million of restructuring charges to implement the first phase. For 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $130 million of additional restructuring charges, and we continue to expect Project Summit to deliver $80 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 and $200 million over the next 2 years. We continue to expect total restructuring charges related to the program to be approximately $240 million. 
Now let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 90 basis points for the quarter. Organic Storage revenue increased 2.2%, reflecting volume growth in faster-growing markets and revenue management. Organic service revenue declined 1%, driven by the change in paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.3% represents an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue management and continuous improvement initiatives. 
Turning to the data center business. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 7.8%. We executed approximately 2 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for a total of 17 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily driven by enterprise and federal government customers, and churn at 1.5% remains consistent with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 51.7%, up significantly year-on-year. Profitability was boosted by 2 nonrecurring items: first, a $4 million contractual settlement; and second, a $2 million lease modification fee. Adjusting for those items, margin was 44.4% in the quarter, an increase of 290 basis points, reflecting the increased scale and progress on integration activity. 
Data center development CapEx was approximately $400 million for the full year, including $50 million for the Frankfurt land acquisition. In 2020, we expect development CapEx of approximately $200 million, reflecting the development projects currently underway. For the full year 2019, revenue of $4.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.44 billion grew 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.02. AFFO was $856 million, and dividend per share was $2.45, representing an 82% dividend payout ratio. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Lease adjusted leverage at the end of the year was 5.7x, which was slightly down versus the third quarter. We expect leverage to remain flat to slightly down in 2020, reflecting our strong focus on profit expansion partially offset by Project Summit onetime costs, lower year-over-year paper prices and foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to delevering over time, which will enable considerable strategic flexibility. 
As part of our ongoing capital recycling program, in the fourth quarter, we sold 2 portfolios, which generated net proceeds of $83 million, bringing us to approximately $170 million of proceeds for the full year. We expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. 
As investors know, part of our strategy is to increase scale in faster-growing international markets. We are pleased to report that in early January, we acquired the remaining 75% stake in OSG Records Management, the leading provider of document and data management solutions in Russia. As investors may recall, this had been a joint venture in which we previously owned 25%. We now have complete ownership of the business, which has annual revenues of more than $50 million, manages approximately 18 million cubic feet of inventory and is exhibiting strong growth. 
Turning to guidance, which is detailed in the supplemental for your review and highlighted on Slide 13 of our presentation. We are expecting 2020 revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.57 billion driven by organic EBITDA growth and Project Summit benefits. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.25 and AFFO to be in the range of $930 million to $960 million. This strong growth is despite continued low paper prices, additional foreign exchange headwinds and includes continued investments in digital solutions, IT infrastructure and our data center business. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, there are several items I would like to call out to consider when modeling the first quarter. First, we expect Project Summit actions taken in 2019 will be a significant addition to adjusted EBITDA throughout the year beginning in the first quarter. Naturally, we also anticipate organic EBITDA growth from our base business. I would also remind you that in the first quarter of 2019, we experienced elevated labor and other costs. Lastly, given where paper prices in the U.S. dollar are currently, we expect both will be notable headwinds in the first quarter. 
Our 2020 guidance implies total organic revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% as compared to prior year, including Organic Storage rental revenue growth of approximately 2%. Our guidance assumes paper prices and FX remain at current levels, which, combined, we expect to result in an adjusted EBITDA headwind of approximately $35 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Anticipated investments, which are detailed in our supplemental, will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings. We may also utilize third-party capital for data center development, as we have previously discussed. 
In closing, we expect to deliver organic growth while also realizing the benefits from Project Summit. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be commitment to our dividend, investing in growth areas through both organic investment and strategic acquisitions and reducing lease-adjusted leverage over time. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our first quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So let me answer the question on 2 levels. One, in terms of the technology aspect that you alluded to. And then the other, in terms of the operating rhythm and what we're doing differently in managing and leading the company. 
So on the technology side is that one of the biggest areas of change is going to be upgrading and applying new technology in terms of the way we track, interact with our customers. So to give you specific examples, we have 4 instances of sales force, which is very hard to get a single view of a customer globally. The second thing is, is we have over 40 billing systems, which again, billing is an area where we need to make sure that we're consistently not just billing, but responding to queries around billing for our customers. So that's an area where we're applying technology to allow our mountaineers to have better visibility of our customers, which helps them on the selling side, but also in terms of serving those customers when they have inquiries. 
So that's one area in technology. The part that's -- we're already starting to see a big effect as in terms of how we're leading the company. So one of the things that we talked about but probably not is directly, on the last call, is some of it isn't just about taking cost out. It's actually redeploying cost, so we're actually adding cost or adding resources around our people that are interacting with our customers or -- especially in terms of strategic account management. So to give you an example of that -- and also in terms of the way we lead the company. So we now have an expanded enterprise leadership team, which we met in January. And first of all, the energy in the room was noticeably different because now we have the top 40 leaders and on a regular rhythm every quarter in a room to discuss where we're going and how to get there faster and better. But also part of that briefing was the strategic account team had the opportunity to put up a slide of one of our most mature customers that we serve globally. And the interesting thing is if you had surveyed people beforehand, they would have said that, that customer is probably 80% served if you look at a matrix of our product offering in the geographies they fit in, and they're completely a global company virtually in every country we're in, and then some more. And the interesting thing is it was just the opposite. We're serving about 20% to 30% of the potential of that client rather than 80%. So a combination of having strategic accounts, taking a global look at how we can serve that customer better and then the energy being able to have that discussion with the top leadership of the company globally on a quarterly basis, I think, is going to make a real change."

So first of all, yes, we expect volumes to be flat to up for the year, including consumer and other alternatives to storage, such as art, for instance. But yes, you heard that correctly. You're right to also assume that it's in North America is where the negative volume is. The rest of the world -- Europe is basically flat, slightly positive. It changes from quarter-to-quarter, but think of Europe as flat. And then other international is kind of mid- single digit positive, right, because those are the faster-growing emerging markets. So just to come back to it, to put it in context. First of all, we're talking about 0.5 million cubic feet in a negative decline in the year, over 700 million cubic feet. And if you look at that, more than -- that's more than explained by just the slowdown in the number of customer acquisitions that we did during '19 as compared to 2018. And at that level, that's totally in our control. In other words, we normally do about 3 million cubic feet. We did less than that in 2019. We did more than that -- a little bit more than that in 2018. And the difference between those 2 more than accounts for the 0.5 million cubic feet down in 2019, so just put that into context. In addition to that is we continue -- we source volume in 3 different buckets besides volume coming in from existing accounts. We source it from customers that are completely unvended, not just the federal government, but they are even -- some of our most mature, or I mentioned one of our most mature customers, they're, believe it or not, some places where they still do records management in-house. And I actually talked about the file rooms that we're taking over for this customer, which is the largest single customer we ever signed, $30 million a year. We signed that contract because we're actually providing them a full wraparound solution, but we're taking over all their volume in their records rooms, which historically weren't in our facilities, right? And this is a customer that we've served for many, many years. So there's the unvended bucket. 
The second bucket -- and those are our most -- highest return. The second and third buckets are either competitive takeaways or these customer acquisitions I talked about, which has historically trended around 3 million cubic feet plus or minus on a given year. Those actually have similar returns. In one case is, we're paying paramount fees and sales commissions. In the other case, we're paying someone that wants to get out of the business or is getting out of business completely, and we take over those customer contracts. So those -- if we look at those 3 vectors, we continue to see that there's a lot of growth. 
The last thing I would say just to emphasize is that I talked about the legal vertical. The thing that's driving the negative trend is not that, all of a sudden, people aren't sending us anything. Virtually every customer is continuing to send us new boxes every year. The thing that is driving the slight drag on volume is the secondary effect of slowing down rates as they go through this transformation. So the legal vertical I gave you for a number of years when it was going through that deceleration was in negative net volume territory because each year, the rate of incoming boxes was changing. So the average age of their inventory was ticking up, and so you're getting more boxes destroyed during that period of time. As it's now stabilized at the new normal at this lower rate, it's actually stabilized to slightly net positive cube. So we see similar trends happening in some of the other verticals that may be a little bit further behind the legal vertical on digital transformation. But it is important to note that the legal vertical, which is virtually almost our slowest growing vertical in North America, is actually slightly net positive in terms of cube growth."

We are in the earlier innings on those markets and those are the faster-growing markets. So the growth that we're getting from other international when you see storage revenue growth is mainly from volume growth and only a little bit of revenue management. So far, we don't see any difference in trends in those markets than we did, say, in Western Europe, when we rolled it out or North America before that in terms of elasticity, but it does take longer for that effect to show up just because some of those contracts are on 3 years. Some of them are on 5-year contracts. Of course, some are annual. So what we find is we're, I guess, 18 to 24 months into the revenue rolling revenue management out globally, and you'll see that, just like it did in Western Europe, it will take, I would say, another 1 year, 1.5 years before you start seeing the full effects of that."

So let me first start with your observation on Q1. So the reason why I also said that we expect the trend that we saw in Q4 to continue in the first half of 2020 is, the Q1 was also a high quarter where we actually did customer acquisition. So the trends that you're kind of calling out is virtually 100% covered by the change in customer acquisitions, not even the second derivative. Now in terms of the overall change, in terms of volumes in North America that we see, as I said, is that when legal was going through its downward march in growth rate as they were transforming or adding more digital processes to their workflows, is we did see similar trends that we see, for instance, in financial services today. I mean, financial services is still one of our higher growing -- our incoming boxes from financial services, but it's just at a lower rate than we did previously. So first of all, is that -- because we're talking about the thing that's impacting our net volume for some of these verticals is rates of change, just by its very kind of mathematical nature. These are muted effects or their secondary effects. And the thing I can't predict -- the thing I would predict is, I think we're going to be in this territory, but if you think about over a year, kind of 7 million to 8 million negative cube growth just on pure RIM and mainly focused in North America until we get through this transformation. And as I said, when we look at legal, we've gotten through that and legal is actually slightly positive in terms of net Q growth once it goes through it.

So I would answer it in 2 different ways is, I think the contract you're talking about, we had a very large blanket contract with one of the large departments, and it's still exactly -- we still have the frustration that you're alluding to. Actually, we've had more wins on the service side because it's been easier for them to give us business on the service side than it is on the storage and that's partly because of their relationships with the national archives. The one thing that we do know, both from the national archives and government leaders, is that we do expect over time for that to start coming free because national archives has publicly announced that there's only a window, it's over the next few months or years, where they're going to continue to accept volume from government agencies. So eventually, that will come loose. But that one has been slower. On the other side, we've -- we had a win. I think it was about 1.5 years ago, where we -- I think it will be 2 years. This summer, we had a one win with a large government agency, where they were exiting their own warehouse and we move that. I think we won in the summer, and we had it all -- we had 400,000 cubic feet roughly moved by November into our facility near Joint Base Andrews. So when they decide to move the -- we can onboard it quite quickly. But the contract that you're talking about that large government contract, we find that we're getting more success on the services, digital services side right now than the storage because of the stickiness with their relationship with NARA."

If you think about the IO that was really building the platform, and Credit Suisse allowed us to start building out our international management team as well as the EvoSwitch in Europe. I think where we stand right now is that we like development. Development still had the highest returns. Now that being said, we do, when we go into a market, for instance, I think I may have used -- referenced this before, when we looked at Frankfurt, we looked at either doing an acquisition or buying land. In this case, we bought a piece of land that was already permitted. And for us, the better opportunity was built buying the piece of land and building it out. But we do look -- when we go into these markets, what I would call brownfield, where we -- there may be a small player in that market that we want to be in but it has a significant amount of expansion capacity on their land or within their shell. So we do continue -- and that was what drove us to the EvoSwitch. Amsterdam was another market where we looked at, buy a brownfield opportunity for a greenfield, and in that case, it was better to do a brownfield. 
So we'll continue to look at it that way, but we don't feel like we need to go out and buy something to bulk up for the sake of bulking up. We feel we're -- we've grown a lot and we're in a pretty good position in terms of being recognized. And I would say that we see most things that are up for grabs in the markets that we're present in."

Before we get into our discussion of the Q4 results, I want to first welcome Barry as our new CFO to the Iron Mountain family. Barry brings a successful track record of navigating transformation and effective change at various organizations. Most recently, he led efforts at HanesBrands to increase operating cash flow, reduce leverage and produce strong international growth. His insights will be very valuable as we roll out Project Summit, our transformation program, to simplify our structure and create a more dynamic and agile organization. We look forward to his contributions as we enter 2020 and beyond.
With that, let me start with a look-back at where we have been on our journey over the past 6 years, looking first at total organic revenue. In 2013, it was flat and adjusted EBITDA declined 1%. Today, we reported total organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and 2% if we hold paper prices constant. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, 2019 saw a growth of 3% or nearly 5% if we apply 2019 paper prices in 2018. 
More broadly, progress over the past 6 years is visible in nearly all metrics, not the least being the expansion of EBITDA margin by almost 500 basis points. This macro look-back is important as it is the basis that continues to provide momentum going forward. We feel this positive momentum in sales and profitability, coupled with Project Summit in a broader portfolio and service offerings to our core customers is the platform from which we expect this trend to continue. 
Of course, this progress just didn't happen. It is the result of the successful execution of our strategy of shifting our revenue mix to faster-growing businesses, including emerging markets, data center and adjacent businesses and successfully implementing our revenue management program. We also made important progress on Project Summit, our transformation program designed to accelerate this strategy, and create a more streamlined, simplified and agile organization better suited to solve our customers' challenges.  
Furthermore, I am pleased to share with you that we are very much on track with our execution on Project Summit. We moved quickly with the head count reduction we announced in order to ensure minimal disruption to the broader organization. If you recall, we announced plans to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%. As of the end of December, we had completed approximately 70% of the reductions. We all recognize that change is never easy, and over these last few months, our organization has shown great resilience and focus. This is a testament to our great people and the fact that a large number of mountaineers are already feeling energized by being able to more easily address and serve our customers. 
As it relates to the savings targets we communicated, the actions we took in the fourth quarter have resulted in $50 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefits that will begin to flow through in Q1. We have good line of sight to the incremental $30 million of in-year benefits we expect to generate in the second half of 2020, with a number of the process and systems improvements underway. We are excited about the new ways we are embracing technology to improve the way we work so we can all show up differently and drive change. Ultimately, we expect Project Summit to expand organic revenue beyond the current growth rates, all whilst boosting adjusted EBITDA by an additional $200 million over the next 2 years. This is all on top of the 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth we have been achieving the last few quarters. 
Turning to fourth quarter performance. Constant currency revenue increased almost 3% over the prior year. We delivered solid adjusted EBITDA growth of 8%, adjusted EPS growth of 24% and AFFO growth of 18% while simultaneously increasing investments to support future growth. Barry will provide more detail on the financial performance as well as our outlook for 2020. 
Turning to business performance. Organic global records management volume remained relatively steady with a 10 basis points decline over the trailing 12-month period. To put this into perspective, globally, volumes declined approximately 500,000 cubic feet on a base of nearly 700 million cubic feet, driven mainly by fewer acquisitions of customer relationships. More specifically, in 2018, we acquired 3.5 million cubic feet of customer relationships which tend to be some of our highest returning investments as opposed to only 2.8 million cubic feet in 2019. We expect the impact of fewer customer acquisitions in 2019 to continue its drag on volume through the first half of 2020. However, we are confident that this is a temporary deviation and that records management and volume, along with incremental storage opportunities in non box categories such as consumer and alternative storage and adjacent businesses, should result in flat to positive levels of organic volume growth for the full year 2020. 
Now coming back to current volume trends. Apart from the dynamic I just discussed, the single biggest headwind on volume today is the rate of change of incoming boxes from our existing customers. You will recall from previous calls, the average life of a box in our inventory has remained rock steady at 15 years. Whilst the average age of a box when it is destroyed has remained steady over many years, the average age of our inventory will naturally skew during periods where the growth rate of incoming boxes is undergoing change. For example, if a vertical is experiencing a slowdown in the rate of incoming volume, then the average age of our inventory will increase. Whilst we can't predict when equilibrium will begin -- will again be achieved, we feel, in the meantime, it will remain a minor impact, given that our customers continue to add new boxes to storage annually, just at a lower rate than historically. 
To help you better understand, let's take a look at what has become one of our slowest growing yet most stable verticals. The North American legal vertical began its digital transformation journey many years ago. This change in customer behavior has resulted in a deceleration in the rate at which existing legal customers send us new boxes every year until recently. The good news is that we have seen the growth rate stabilize to slightly positive net volume growth. We expect a similar trend across other verticals that are not as far along on their digital transformation journey. 
To provide further context, let's say, a legal customer stores 100 boxes with us. 10 years ago, they would send us 6 new boxes a year and destroy or remove 2 boxes, so they would be net positive 4 boxes or a 4% growth rate. Today, a similar customer would send us 2 to 3 new boxes and still destroy 1 or 2 boxes, making them flat to net positive 1% growth rate, which is the new normal for this customer vertical, remaining stable at this lower growth rate given the age profile of their inventory has stabilized. 
We should remind you that what I just discussed is only affecting volume from existing customers, in addition to that, we continue to focus on new customers, competitive wins, opportunities in the unvended and federal channels. And as we talked about earlier, other methods of customer acquisition. We expect all these various sales channels to continue to contribute to overall organic volume growth for global RIM over time. This is what gives us confidence in the durability of the recurring revenue stream and strong cash flow generation that comes from global RIM organization, and we do not anticipate a change in the foreseeable future. As I like to say, it's the financial beast that allows us to fund growth opportunities while returning cash to our shareholders. 
We've also made considerable progress in transforming our core RIM business to a more diversified model and are on track to achieve our targeted geographic mix which, as a reminder, is 20% of revenue from faster-growing markets by the end of 2020. We ended 2019 with these markets contributing 19% to total revenue, and for comparative purposes, faster-growing markets represented less than 10% of revenue in 2013. Moreover, over the same period of time, we have expanded the adjusted EBITDA margin for these relatively new and faster-growing markets from 20% to 30% in 2019, and we believe we can continue to expand margins as we scale our presence in these geographies and to select new markets that offer superior growth opportunities all whilst managing our cost structure efficiently. 
Related, our global digital solutions business had a record year, with revenue increasing 10% year-over-year. As we shared with you last quarter, our digital solutions offerings, such as InSight, are increasingly enabling us to approach our customers with a differentiated solution, resulting in a pull-through of other products and services. 
Just one example of this was a recent win with a large, highly regulated financial institution. This customer previously managed its physical file room storage in-house, with over 600 employees across 5 global locations. We will assume responsibility for the management of all file storage, processing of the files and begin providing value-added services. We plan to transform the operation by consolidating locations, reorganizing workflows, adding workflow software and applying digital solutions such as RFID and artificial intelligence and machine learning through our InSight platform. When completed, this effort will not only help our customers significantly reduce costs, but it will also be the foundation for future enhanced digital products. We're able to win the business based on our unique combination of document management and workflow expertise, combined with our digital solutions, which we expect will result in close to $30 million in annual revenue for the next 10 years, making this one of the largest single deals we have signed. 
Turning now to our data center business. We had a good year executing 17 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including our first hyperscale deal. Whilst we are pleased with the steady commercial progress we have made leasing up our facilities ending Q4 with a stabilized utilization rate of 90%, we did see some deals in the pipeline shift from Q4 into 2020. The 17 megawatts leased in 2019 shows good progress on a base of approximately 100 megawatts at the beginning of 2019. Within our leasing for the year, we were successful in attracting over 100 new logos to our global data center platform, further diversifying our enterprise customer base and underscoring our brand strength in this dynamic industry. We continue to make good progress organically building our global platform, delivering almost 20 megawatts of capacity in key markets around the globe, including London, Amsterdam, Singapore, New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Phoenix. We are excited about our newest development in Frankfurt and currently have a strong pipeline of pre-leasing opportunities in various stages of discussion. 
Additionally, in Q4, we entered into an agreement for a second site in Slough, which will allow us to expand our present -- presence in the important London market by adding an incremental of 25 megawatts of capacity. Under the terms of the agreement, the landowner will build a shell, after which, we will finish the build-out of the data center to our specifications. Our existing footprint in London, which is adjacent to this new site, is nearing stabilization, and this new agreement provides capacity for larger requirements in a very desirable market with low latency network connectivity. 
Looking into 2020, the first half pipeline looks strong with a number of larger opportunities on the horizon. That said, these larger deals tend to be lumpy, and timing is often harder to predict. Putting this all together, we would expect to be able to lease up another 15 to 20 megawatts of capacity in 2020. We feel very good about our commercial momentum and a building pipeline of demand, including hyperscale interest in a number of our markets such as Phoenix, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt. 
In summary, 2019 was not without its challenges in terms of consistently declining paper prices, but we ended the year in line with our expectations, having a number of strong commercial wins whilst making measurable progress on our strategic plan. We are focused on maximizing the benefits from Project Summit not only financially but in how we operate as a team and an organization. We have a unique opportunity to translate a streamlined and more agile organization into speed to unlock further revenue opportunities through how we connect with and build additional value for our customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry, who will walk you through Q4 performance and our outlook for 2020."

I am delighted to be here at such an important time in the company's evolution, and I'm energized by our strategy, the engagement and strength of our team and the opportunities we have in front of us. 
Turning now to results. In the fourth quarter, revenue, EBITDA and AFFO were in line with our guidance ranges. We continue to expand margins as adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over last year. Additionally, AFFO increased 18% to $228 million. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased $18 million or 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by total organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter, reflecting the volume trends Bill discussed and contributions from revenue management. 
Total organic service revenue declined 70 basis points in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This reflects the change in paper prices, which were at record highs in the back half of 2018 but ended 2019 at record lows. Adjusting for the $13 million impact of lower paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% for the fourth quarter to $386 million despite lower paper prices and FX headwinds, with margins expanding 190 basis points year-over-year to 35.8%. For the quarter, our tax rate was in line with guidance and adjusted earnings per share was $0.31. 
Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track, and in the fourth quarter, we recognized $49 million of restructuring charges to implement the first phase. For 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $130 million of additional restructuring charges, and we continue to expect Project Summit to deliver $80 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 and $200 million over the next 2 years. We continue to expect total restructuring charges related to the program to be approximately $240 million. 
Now let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 90 basis points for the quarter. Organic Storage revenue increased 2.2%, reflecting volume growth in faster-growing markets and revenue management. Organic service revenue declined 1%, driven by the change in paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.3% represents an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue management and continuous improvement initiatives. 
Turning to the data center business. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 7.8%. We executed approximately 2 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for a total of 17 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily driven by enterprise and federal government customers, and churn at 1.5% remains consistent with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 51.7%, up significantly year-on-year. Profitability was boosted by 2 nonrecurring items: first, a $4 million contractual settlement; and second, a $2 million lease modification fee. Adjusting for those items, margin was 44.4% in the quarter, an increase of 290 basis points, reflecting the increased scale and progress on integration activity. 
Data center development CapEx was approximately $400 million for the full year, including $50 million for the Frankfurt land acquisition. In 2020, we expect development CapEx of approximately $200 million, reflecting the development projects currently underway. For the full year 2019, revenue of $4.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.44 billion grew 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.02. AFFO was $856 million, and dividend per share was $2.45, representing an 82% dividend payout ratio. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Lease adjusted leverage at the end of the year was 5.7x, which was slightly down versus the third quarter. We expect leverage to remain flat to slightly down in 2020, reflecting our strong focus on profit expansion partially offset by Project Summit onetime costs, lower year-over-year paper prices and foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to delevering over time, which will enable considerable strategic flexibility. 
As part of our ongoing capital recycling program, in the fourth quarter, we sold 2 portfolios, which generated net proceeds of $83 million, bringing us to approximately $170 million of proceeds for the full year. We expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. 
As investors know, part of our strategy is to increase scale in faster-growing international markets. We are pleased to report that in early January, we acquired the remaining 75% stake in OSG Records Management, the leading provider of document and data management solutions in Russia. As investors may recall, this had been a joint venture in which we previously owned 25%. We now have complete ownership of the business, which has annual revenues of more than $50 million, manages approximately 18 million cubic feet of inventory and is exhibiting strong growth. 
Turning to guidance, which is detailed in the supplemental for your review and highlighted on Slide 13 of our presentation. We are expecting 2020 revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.57 billion driven by organic EBITDA growth and Project Summit benefits. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.25 and AFFO to be in the range of $930 million to $960 million. This strong growth is despite continued low paper prices, additional foreign exchange headwinds and includes continued investments in digital solutions, IT infrastructure and our data center business. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, there are several items I would like to call out to consider when modeling the first quarter. First, we expect Project Summit actions taken in 2019 will be a significant addition to adjusted EBITDA throughout the year beginning in the first quarter. Naturally, we also anticipate organic EBITDA growth from our base business. I would also remind you that in the first quarter of 2019, we experienced elevated labor and other costs. Lastly, given where paper prices in the U.S. dollar are currently, we expect both will be notable headwinds in the first quarter. 
Our 2020 guidance implies total organic revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% as compared to prior year, including Organic Storage rental revenue growth of approximately 2%. Our guidance assumes paper prices and FX remain at current levels, which, combined, we expect to result in an adjusted EBITDA headwind of approximately $35 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Anticipated investments, which are detailed in our supplemental, will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings. We may also utilize third-party capital for data center development, as we have previously discussed. 
In closing, we expect to deliver organic growth while also realizing the benefits from Project Summit. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be commitment to our dividend, investing in growth areas through both organic investment and strategic acquisitions and reducing lease-adjusted leverage over time. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our first quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So let me answer the question on 2 levels. One, in terms of the technology aspect that you alluded to. And then the other, in terms of the operating rhythm and what we're doing differently in managing and leading the company. 
So on the technology side is that one of the biggest areas of change is going to be upgrading and applying new technology in terms of the way we track and interact with our customers. So to give you specific examples, we have 4 instances of sales force, which is very hard to get a single view of a customer globally. The second thing is, is we have over 40 billing systems, which again, billing is an area where we need to make sure that we're consistently not just billing, but responding to queries around billing for our customers. So that's an area where we're applying technology to allow our mountaineers to have better visibility of our customers, which helps them on the selling side, but also in terms of serving those customers when they have inquiries. 
So that's one area in technology. The part that's -- we're already starting to see a big effect is in terms of how we're leading the company. So one of the things that we talked about but probably not is directly, on the last call, is some of it isn't just about taking cost out. It's actually redeploying cost, so we're actually adding cost or adding resources around our people that are interacting with our customers or -- especially in terms of strategic account management. So to give you an example of that -- and also in terms of the way we lead the company. So we now have an expanded enterprise leadership team, which we met in January. And first of all, the energy in the room was noticeably different because now we have the top 40 leaders and on a regular rhythm every quarter in a room to discuss where we're going and how to get there faster and better. But also part of that briefing was the strategic account team had the opportunity to put up a slide of one of our most mature customers that we serve globally. And the interesting thing is if you had surveyed people beforehand, they would have said that, that customer is probably 80% served if you look at a matrix of our product offering in the geographies they fit in, and they're completely a global company virtually in every country we're in, and then some more. And the interesting thing is it was just the opposite. We're serving about 20% to 30% of the potential of that client rather than 80%. So a combination of having strategic accounts taking a global look at how we can serve that customer better and then the energy being able to have that discussion with the top leadership of the company globally on a quarterly basis, I think, is going to make a real change."

Nate, so first of all, yes, we expect volumes to be flat to up for the year, including consumer and other alternatives to storage, such as art, for instance. But yes, you heard that correctly. You're right to also assume that it's in North America is where the negative volume is. The rest of the world -- Europe is basically flat, slightly positive. It changes from quarter-to-quarter, but think of Europe as flat. And then other international is kind of mid- single digit positive, right, because those are the faster-growing emerging markets. So just to come back to it, to put it in context. First of all, we're talking about 0.5 million cubic feet in a negative decline in the year, over 700 million cubic feet. And if you look at that, more than -- that's more than explained by just the slowdown in the number of customer acquisitions that we did during '19 as compared to 2018. And at that level, that's totally in our control. In other words, we normally do about 3 million cubic feet. We did less than that in 2019. We did more than that -- a little bit more than that in 2018. And the difference between those 2 more than accounts for the 0.5 million cubic feet down in 2019, so just put that into context. In addition to that is we continue -- we source volume in 3 different buckets besides volume coming in from existing accounts. We source it from customers that are completely unvended, not just the federal government, but they are even -- some of our most mature, or I mentioned one of our most mature customers, they're, believe it or not, some places where they still do records management in-house. And I actually talked about the file rooms that we're taking over for this customer, which is the largest single customer we ever signed, $30 million a year. We signed that contract because we're actually providing them a full wraparound solution, but we're taking over all their volume in their records rooms, which historically weren't in our facilities, right? And this is a customer that we've served for many, many years. So there's the unvended bucket. 
The second bucket -- and those are our most -- highest return. The second and third buckets are either competitive takeaways or these customer acquisitions I talked about, which has historically trended around 3 million cubic feet plus or minus on a given year. Those actually have similar returns. In one case is, we're paying paramount fees and sales commissions. In the other case, we're paying someone that wants to get out of the business or is getting out of business completely, and we take over those customer contracts. So those -- if we look at those 3 vectors, we continue to see that there's a lot of growth. 
The last thing I would say just to emphasize is that I talked about the legal vertical. The thing that's driving the negative trend is not that, all of a sudden, people aren't sending us anything. Virtually every customer is continuing to send us new boxes every year. The thing that is driving the slight drag on volume is the secondary effect of slowing down rates as they go through this transformation. So the legal vertical I gave you for a number of years when it was going through that deceleration was in negative net volume territory because each year, the rate of incoming boxes was changing. So the average age of their inventory was ticking up, and so you're getting more boxes destroyed during that period of time. As it's now stabilized at the new normal at this lower rate, it's actually stabilized to slightly net positive cube. So we see similar trends happening in some of the other verticals that may be a little bit further behind the legal vertical on digital transformation. But it is important to note that the legal vertical, which is virtually almost our slowest growing vertical in North America, is actually slightly net positive in terms of cube growth."

So far, we don't see any difference in trends in those markets than we did, say, in Western Europe, when we rolled it out or North America before that in terms of elasticity, but it does take longer for that effect to show up just because some of those contracts are on 3 years. Some of them are on 5-year contracts. Of course, some are annual. So what we find is we're, I guess, 18 to 24 months into the revenue rolling revenue management out globally, and you'll see that, just like it did in Western Europe, it will take, I would say, another 1 year, 1.5 years before you start seeing the full effects of that."

So let me first start with your observation on Q1. So the reason why I also said that we expect the trend that we saw in Q4 to continue in the first half of 2020 is, the Q1 was also a high quarter where we actually did customer acquisition. So the trends that you're kind of calling out is virtually 100% covered by the change in customer acquisitions, not even the second derivative. Now in terms of the overall change, in terms of volumes in North America that we see, as I said, is that when legal was going through its downward march in growth rate as they were transforming or adding more digital processes to their workflows, is we did see similar trends that we see, for instance, in financial services today. I mean, financial services is still one of our higher growing -- our incoming boxes from financial services, but it's just at a lower rate than we did previously. So first of all, is that -- because we're talking about the thing that's impacting our net volume for some of these verticals is rates of change, just by its very kind of mathematical nature. These are muted effects or their secondary effects. And the thing I can't predict -- the thing I would predict is, I think we're going to be in this territory, but if you think about over a year, kind of 7 million to 8 million negative cube growth just on pure RIM and mainly focused in North America until we get through this transformation. And as I said, when we look at legal, we've gotten through that and legal is actually slightly positive in terms of net Q growth once it goes through it. The thing that's hard to predict is how fast people digitally transform and what growth rate they stabilize to."

So I would answer it in 2 different ways is, I think the contract you're talking about, we had a very large blanket contract with one of the large departments, and it's still exactly -- we still have the frustration that you're alluding to. Actually, we've had more wins on the service side because it's been easier for them to give us business on the service side than it is on the storage and that's partly because of their relationships with the national archives. The one thing that we do know, both from the national archives and government leaders, is that we do expect over time for that to start coming free because national archives has publicly announced that there's only a window, it's over the next few months or years, where they're going to continue to accept volume from government agencies. So eventually, that will come loose. But that one has been slower. On the other side, we've -- we had a win. I think it was about 1.5 years ago, where we -- I think it will be 2 years. This summer, we had a one win with a large government agency, where they were exiting their own warehouse and we move that. I think we won in the summer, and we had it all -- we had 400,000 cubic feet roughly moved by November into our facility near Joint Base Andrews. So when they decide to move the -- we can onboard it quite quickly. But the contract that you're talking about that large government contract, we find that we're getting more success on the services, digital services side right now than the storage because of the stickiness with their relationship with NARA."

If you think about the IO that was really building the platform, and Credit Suisse allowed us to start building out our international management team as well as the EvoSwitch in Europe. I think where we stand right now is that we like development. Development still had the highest returns. Now that being said, we do, when we go into a market, for instance, I think I may have used -- referenced this before, when we looked at Frankfurt, we looked at either doing an acquisition or buying land. In this case, we bought a piece of land that was already permitted. And for us, the better opportunity was built buying the piece of land and building it out. But we do look when we go into these markets, what I would call brownfield, where we -- there may be a small player in that market that we want to be in but it has a significant amount of expansion capacity on their land or within their shell. So we do continue -- and that was what drove us to the EvoSwitch. Amsterdam was another market where we looked at, buy a brownfield opportunity for a greenfield, and in that case, it was better to do a brownfield. 
So we'll continue to look at it that way, but we don't feel like we need to go out and buy something to bulk up for the sake of bulking up. We feel we're -- we've grown a lot and we're in a pretty good position in terms of being recognized. And I would say that we see most things that are up for grabs in the markets that we're present in."

Before we get into our discussion of the Q4 results, I want to first welcome Barry as our new CFO to the Iron Mountain family. Barry brings a successful track record of navigating transformation and effective change at various organizations. Most recently, he led efforts at HanesBrands to increase operating cash flow, reduce leverage and produce strong international growth. His insights will be very valuable as we roll out Project Summit, our transformation program, to simplify our structure and create a more dynamic and agile organization. We look forward to his contributions as we enter 2020 and beyond.
With that, let me start with a look-back at where we have been on our journey over the past 6 years, looking first at total organic revenue. In 2013, it was flat and adjusted EBITDA declined 1%. Today, we reported total organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and 2% if we hold paper prices constant. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, 2019 saw a growth of 3% or nearly 5% if we apply 2019 paper prices in 2018. 
More broadly, progress over the past 6 years is visible in nearly all metrics, not the least being the expansion of EBITDA margin by almost 500 basis points. This macro look-back is important as it is the basis that continues to provide momentum going forward. We feel this positive momentum in sales and profitability, coupled with Project Summit in a broader portfolio and service offerings to our core customers is the platform from which we expect this trend to continue. 
Of course, this progress just didn't happen. It is the result of the successful execution of our strategy of shifting our revenue mix to faster-growing businesses, including emerging markets, data center and adjacent businesses and successfully implementing our revenue management program. We also made important progress on Project Summit, our transformation program designed to accelerate this strategy, and create a more streamlined, simplified and agile organization better suited to solve our customers' challenges.  
Furthermore, I am pleased to share with you that we are very much on track with our execution on Project Summit. We moved quickly with the head count reduction we announced in order to ensure minimal disruption to the broader organization. If you recall, we announced plans to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%. As of the end of December, we had completed approximately 70% of the reductions. We all recognize that change is never easy, and over these last few months, our organization has shown great resilience and focus. This is a testament to our great people and the fact that a large number of mountaineers are already feeling energized by being able to more easily address and serve our customers. 
As it relates to the savings targets we communicated, the actions we took in the fourth quarter have resulted in $50 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefits that will begin to flow through in Q1. We have good line of sight to the incremental $30 million of in-year benefits we expect to generate in the second half of 2020, with a number of the process and systems improvements underway. We are excited about the new ways we are embracing technology to improve the way we work so we can all show up differently and drive change. Ultimately, we expect Project Summit to expand organic revenue beyond the current growth rates, all whilst boosting adjusted EBITDA by an additional $200 million over the next 2 years. This is all on top of the 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth we have been achieving the last few quarters. 
Turning to fourth quarter performance. Constant currency revenue increased almost 3% over the prior year. We delivered solid adjusted EBITDA growth of 8%, adjusted EPS growth of 24% and AFFO growth of 18% while simultaneously increasing investments to support future growth. Barry will provide more detail on the financial performance as well as our outlook for 2020. 
Turning to business performance. Organic global records management volume remained relatively steady with a 10 basis points decline over the trailing 12-month period. To put this into perspective, globally, volumes declined approximately 500,000 cubic feet on a base of nearly 700 million cubic feet, driven mainly by fewer acquisitions of customer relationships. More specifically, in 2018, we acquired 3.5 million cubic feet of customer relationships which tend to be some of our highest returning investments as opposed to only 2.8 million cubic feet in 2019. We expect the impact of fewer customer acquisitions in 2019 to continue its drag on volume through the first half of 2020. However, we are confident that this is a temporary deviation and that records management and volume, along with incremental storage opportunities in non box categories such as consumer and alternative storage and adjacent businesses, should result in flat to positive levels of organic volume growth for the full year 2020. 
Now coming back to current volume trends. Apart from the dynamic I just discussed, the single biggest headwind on volume today is the rate of change of incoming boxes from our existing customers. You will recall from previous calls, the average life of a box in our inventory has remained rock steady at 15 years. Whilst the average age of a box when it is destroyed has remained steady over many years, the average age of our inventory will naturally skew during periods where the growth rate of incoming boxes is undergoing change. For example, if a vertical is experiencing a slowdown in the rate of incoming volume, then the average age of our inventory will increase. Whilst we can't predict when equilibrium will begin -- will again be achieved, we feel, in the meantime, it will remain a minor impact, given that our customers continue to add new boxes to storage annually, just at a lower rate than historically. 
To help you better understand, let's take a look at what has become one of our slowest growing yet most stable verticals. The North American legal vertical began its digital transformation journey many years ago. This change in customer behavior has resulted in a deceleration in the rate at which existing legal customers send us new boxes every year until recently. The good news is that we have seen the growth rate stabilize to slightly positive net volume growth. We expect a similar trend across other verticals that are not as far along on their digital transformation journey. 
To provide further context, let's say, a legal customer stores 100 boxes with us. 10 years ago, they would send us 6 new boxes a year and destroy or remove 2 boxes, so they would be net positive 4 boxes or a 4% growth rate. Today, a similar customer would send us 2 to 3 new boxes and still destroy 1 or 2 boxes, making them flat to net positive 1% growth rate, which is the new normal for this customer vertical, remaining stable at this lower growth rate given the age profile of their inventory has stabilized. 
We should remind you that what I just discussed is only affecting volume from existing customers, in addition to that, we continue to focus on new customers, competitive wins, opportunities in the unvended and federal channels. And as we talked about earlier, other methods of customer acquisition. We expect all these various sales channels to continue to contribute to overall organic volume growth for global RIM over time. This is what gives us confidence in the durability of the recurring revenue stream and strong cash flow generation that comes from global RIM organization, and we do not anticipate a change in the foreseeable future. As I like to say, it's the financial beast that allows us to fund growth opportunities while returning cash to our shareholders. 
We've also made considerable progress in transforming our core RIM business to a more diversified model and are on track to achieve our targeted geographic mix which, as a reminder, is 20% of revenue from faster-growing markets by the end of 2020. We ended 2019 with these markets contributing 19% to total revenue, and for comparative purposes, faster-growing markets represented less than 10% of revenue in 2013. Moreover, over the same period of time, we have expanded the adjusted EBITDA margin for these relatively new and faster-growing markets from 20% to 30% in 2019, and we believe we can continue to expand margins as we scale our presence in these geographies and to select new markets that offer superior growth opportunities all whilst managing our cost structure efficiently. 
Related, our global digital solutions business had a record year, with revenue increasing 10% year-over-year. As we shared with you last quarter, our digital solutions offerings, such as InSight, are increasingly enabling us to approach our customers with a differentiated solution, resulting in a pull-through of other products and services. 
Just one example of this was a recent win with a large, highly regulated financial institution. This customer previously managed its physical file room storage in-house, with over 600 employees across 5 global locations. We will assume responsibility for the management of all file storage, processing of the files and begin providing value-added services. We plan to transform the operation by consolidating locations, reorganizing workflows, adding workflow software and applying digital solutions such as RFID and artificial intelligence and machine learning through our InSight platform. When completed, this effort will not only help our customers significantly reduce costs, but it will also be the foundation for future enhanced digital products. We're able to win the business based on our unique combination of document management and workflow expertise, combined with our digital solutions, which we expect will result in close to $30 million in annual revenue for the next 10 years, making this one of the largest single deals we have signed. 
Turning now to our data center business. We had a good year executing 17 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including our first hyperscale deal. Whilst we are pleased with the steady commercial progress we have made leasing up our facilities ending Q4 with a stabilized utilization rate of 90%, we did see some deals in the pipeline shift from Q4 into 2020. The 17 megawatts leased in 2019 shows good progress on a base of approximately 100 megawatts at the beginning of 2019. Within our leasing for the year, we were successful in attracting over 100 new logos to our global data center platform, further diversifying our enterprise customer base and underscoring our brand strength in this dynamic industry. We continue to make good progress organically building our global platform, delivering almost 20 megawatts of capacity in key markets around the globe, including London, Amsterdam, Singapore, New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Phoenix. We are excited about our newest development in Frankfurt and currently have a strong pipeline of pre-leasing opportunities in various stages of discussion. 
Additionally, in Q4, we entered into an agreement for a second site in Slough, which will allow us to expand our present -- presence in the important London market by adding an incremental of 25 megawatts of capacity. Under the terms of the agreement, the landowner will build a shell, after which, we will finish the build-out of the data center to our specifications. Our existing footprint in London, which is adjacent to this new site, is nearing stabilization, and this new agreement provides capacity for larger requirements in a very desirable market with low latency network connectivity. 
Looking into 2020, the first half pipeline looks strong with a number of larger opportunities on the horizon. That said, these larger deals tend to be lumpy, and timing is often harder to predict. Putting this all together, we would expect to be able to lease up another 15 to 20 megawatts of capacity in 2020. We feel very good about our commercial momentum and a building pipeline of demand, including hyperscale interest in a number of our markets such as Phoenix, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt. 
In summary, 2019 was not without its challenges in terms of consistently declining paper prices, but we ended the year in line with our expectations, having a number of strong commercial wins whilst making measurable progress on our strategic plan. We are focused on maximizing the benefits from Project Summit not only financially but in how we operate as a team and an organization. We have a unique opportunity to translate a streamlined and more agile organization into speed to unlock further revenue opportunities through how we connect with and build additional value for our customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry, who will walk you through Q4 performance and our outlook for 2020."

I am delighted to be here at such an important time in the company's evolution, and I'm energized by our strategy, the engagement and strength of our team and the opportunities we have in front of us. Turning now to results. In the four",1197,"Thank you, Bill. I am delighted to be here at such an important time in the company's evolution, and I'm energized by our strategy, the engagement and strength of our team and the opportunities we have in front of us. 
Turning now to results. In the fourth quarter, revenue, EBITDA and AFFO were in line with our guidance ranges. We continue to expand margins as adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over last year. Additionally, AFFO increased 18% to $228 million. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased $18 million or 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by total organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter, reflecting the volume trends Bill discussed and contributions from revenue management. 
Total organic service revenue declined 70 basis points in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This reflects the change in paper prices, which were at record highs in the back half of 2018 but ended 2019 at record lows. Adjusting for the $13 million impact of lower paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% for the fourth quarter to $386 million despite lower paper prices and FX headwinds, with margins expanding 190 basis points year-over-year to 35.8%. For the quarter, our tax rate was in line with guidance and adjusted earnings per share was $0.31. 
Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track, and in the fourth quarter, we recognized $49 million of restructuring charges to implement the first phase. For 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $130 million of additional restructuring charges, and we continue to expect Project Summit to deliver $80 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 and $200 million over the next 2 years. We continue to expect total restructuring charges related to the program to be approximately $240 million. 
Now let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 90 basis points for the quarter. Organic Storage revenue increased 2.2%, reflecting volume growth in faster-growing markets and revenue management. Organic service revenue declined 1%, driven by the change in paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.3% represents an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue management and continuous improvement initiatives. 
Turning to the data center business. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 7.8%. We executed approximately 2 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for a total of 17 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily driven by enterprise and federal government customers, and churn at 1.5% remains consistent with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 51.7%, up significantly year-on-year. Profitability was boosted by 2 nonrecurring items: first, a $4 million contractual settlement; and second, a $2 million lease modification fee. Adjusting for those items, margin was 44.4% in the quarter, an increase of 290 basis points, reflecting the increased scale and progress on integration activity. 
Data center development CapEx was approximately $400 million for the full year, including $50 million for the Frankfurt land acquisition. In 2020, we expect development CapEx of approximately $200 million, reflecting the development projects currently underway. For the full year 2019, revenue of $4.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.44 billion grew 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.02. AFFO was $856 million, and dividend per share was $2.45, representing an 82% dividend payout ratio. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Lease adjusted leverage at the end of the year was 5.7x, which was slightly down versus the third quarter. We expect leverage to remain flat to slightly down in 2020, reflecting our strong focus on profit expansion partially offset by Project Summit onetime costs, lower year-over-year paper prices and foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to delevering over time, which will enable considerable strategic flexibility. 
As part of our ongoing capital recycling program, in the fourth quarter, we sold 2 portfolios, which generated net proceeds of $83 million, bringing us to approximately $170 million of proceeds for the full year. We expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. 
As investors know, part of our strategy is to increase scale in faster-growing international markets. We are pleased to report that in early January, we acquired the remaining 75% stake in OSG Records Management, the leading provider of document and data management solutions in Russia. As investors may recall, this had been a joint venture in which we previously owned 25%. We now have complete ownership of the business, which has annual revenues of more than $50 million, manages approximately 18 million cubic feet of inventory and is exhibiting strong growth. 
Turning to guidance, which is detailed in the supplemental for your review and highlighted on Slide 13 of our presentation. We are expecting 2020 revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.57 billion driven by organic EBITDA growth and Project Summit benefits. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.25 and AFFO to be in the range of $930 million to $960 million. This strong growth is despite continued low paper prices, additional foreign exchange headwinds and includes continued investments in digital solutions, IT infrastructure and our data center business. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, there are several items I would like to call out to consider when modeling the first quarter. First, we expect Project Summit actions taken in 2019 will be a significant addition to adjusted EBITDA throughout the year beginning in the first quarter. Naturally, we also anticipate organic EBITDA growth from our base business. I would also remind you that in the first quarter of 2019, we experienced elevated labor and other costs. Lastly, given where paper prices in the U.S. dollar are currently, we expect both will be notable headwinds in the first quarter. 
Our 2020 guidance implies total organic revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% as compared to prior year, including Organic Storage rental revenue growth of approximately 2%. Our guidance assumes paper prices and FX remain at current levels, which, combined, we expect to result in an adjusted EBITDA headwind of approximately $35 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Anticipated investments, which are detailed in our supplemental, will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings. We may also utilize third-party capital for data center development, as we have previously discussed. 
In closing, we expect to deliver organic growth while also realizing the benefits from Project Summit. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be commitment to our dividend, investing in growth areas through both organic investment and strategic acquisitions and reducing lease-adjusted leverage over time. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our first quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So let me answer the question on 2 levels. One, in terms of the technology aspect that you alluded to. And then the other, in terms of the operating rhythm and what we're doing differently in managing and leading the company. 
So on the technology side is that one of the biggest areas of change is going to be upgrading and applying new technology in terms of the way we track and interact with our customers. So to give you specific examples, we have 4 instances of sales force, which is very hard to get a single view of a customer globally. The second thing is, is we have over 40 billing systems, which again, billing is an area where we need to make sure that we're consistently not just billing, but responding to queries around billing for our customers. So that's an area where we're applying technology to allow our mountaineers to have better visibility of our customers, which helps them on the selling side, but also in terms of serving those customers when they have inquiries. 
So that's one area in technology. The part that's -- we're already starting to see a big effect is in terms of how we're leading the company. So one of the things that we talked about but probably not is directly, on the last call, is some of it isn't just about taking cost out. It's actually redeploying cost, so we're actually adding cost or adding resources around our people that are interacting with our customers or -- especially in terms of strategic account management. So to give you an example of that -- and also in terms of the way we lead the company. So we now have an expanded enterprise leadership team, which we met in January. And first of all, the energy in the room was noticeably different because now we have the top 40 leaders and on a regular rhythm every quarter in a room to discuss where we're going and how to get there faster and better. But also part of that briefing was the strategic account team had the opportunity to put up a slide of one of our most mature customers that we serve globally. And the interesting thing is if you had surveyed people beforehand, they would have said that, that customer is probably 80% served if you look at a matrix of our product offering in the geographies they fit in, and they're completely a global company virtually in every country we're in, and then some more. And the interesting thing is it was just the opposite. We're serving about 20% to 30% of the potential of that client rather than 80%. So a combination of having strategic accounts, taking a global look at how we can serve that customer better and then the energy being able to have that discussion with the top leadership of the company globally on a quarterly basis, I think, is going to make a real change."

You're right to also assume that it's in North America is",684,"Yes. Nate, so first of all, yes, we expect volumes to be flat to up for the year, including consumer and other alternatives to storage, such as art, for instance. But yes, you heard that correctly. You're right to also assume that it's in North America is where the negative volume is. The rest of the world -- Europe is basically flat, slightly positive. It changes from quarter-to-quarter, but think of Europe as flat. And then other international is kind of mid- single digit positive, right, because those are the faster-growing emerging markets. So just to come back to it, to put it in context. First of all, we're talking about 0.5 million cubic feet in a negative decline in the year, over 700 million cubic feet. And if you look at that, more than -- that's more than explained by just the slowdown in the number of customer acquisitions that we did during '19 as compared to 2018. And at that level, that's totally in our control. In other words, we normally do about 3 million cubic feet. We did less than that in 2019. We did more than that -- a little bit more than that in 2018. And the difference between those 2 more than accounts for the 0.5 million cubic feet down in 2019, so just put that into context. In addition to that is we continue -- we source volume in 3 different buckets besides volume coming in from existing accounts. We source it from customers that are completely unvended, not just the federal government, but they are even -- some of our most mature, or I mentioned one of our most mature customers, they're, believe it or not, some places where they still do records management in-house. And I actually talked about the file rooms that we're taking over for this customer, which is the largest single customer we ever signed, $30 million a year. We signed that contract because we're actually providing them a full wraparound solution, but we're taking over all their volume in their records rooms, which historically weren't in our facilities, right? And this is a customer that we've served for many, many years. So there's the unvended bucket. 
The second bucket -- and those are our most -- highest return. The second and third buckets are either competitive takeaways or these customer acquisitions I talked about, which has historically trended around 3 million cubic feet plus or minus on a given year. Those actually have similar returns. In one case is, we're paying paramount fees and sales commissions. In the other case, we're paying someone that wants to get out of the business or is getting out of business completely, and we take over those customer contracts. So those -- if we look at those 3 vectors, we continue to see that there's a lot of growth. 
The last thing I would say just to emphasize is that I talked about the legal vertical. The thing that's driving the negative trend is not that, all of a sudden, people aren't sending us anything. Virtually every customer is continuing to send us new boxes every year. The thing that is driving the slight drag on volume is the secondary effect of slowing down rates as they go through this transformation. So the legal vertical I gave you for a number of years when it was going through that deceleration was in negative net volume territory because each year, the rate of incoming boxes was changing. So the average age of their inventory was ticking up, and so you're getting more boxes destroyed during that period of time. As it's now stabilized at the new normal at this lower rate, it's actually stabilized to slightly net positive cube. So we see similar trends happening in some of the other verticals that may be a little bit further behind the legal vertical on digital transformation. But it is important to note that the legal vertical, which is virtually almost our slowest growing vertical in North America, is actually slightly net positive in terms of cube growth."

We are in the earlier innings on those markets and those are the faster-growing markets. So the growth that we're getting from other international when you see storage revenue growth is mainly from volume growth and only a little bit of revenue management. So far, we don't see any difference in trends in those markets than we did, say, in Western Europe, when we rolled it out or North America before that in terms of elasticity, but it does take longer for that effect to show up just because some of those contracts are on 3 years. Some of them are on 5-year contracts. Of course, some are annual. So what we find is we're, I guess, 18 to 24 months into the revenue rolling revenue management out globally, and you'll see that, just like it did in Western Europe, it will take, I would say, another 1 year, 1.5 years before you start seeing the full effects of that."

Now in terms of the overall change, in terms of volumes in North America that we see, as I said, is that when legal was going through its downward march in growth rate as they were transforming or adding more digital processes to their workflows, is we did see similar trends that we see, for instance, in financial services today. I mean, financial services is still one of our higher growing -- our incoming boxes from financial services, but it's just at a lower rate than we did previously. So first of all, is that -- because we're talking about the thing that's impacting our net volume for some of these verticals is rates of change, just by its very kind of mathematical nature. These are muted effects or their secondary effects. And the thing I can't predict -- the thing I would predict is, I think we're going to be in this territory, but if you think about over a year, kind of 7 million to 8 million negative cube growth just on pure RIM and mainly focused in North America until we get through this transformation. And as I said, when we look at legal, we've gotten through that and legal is actually slightly positive in terms of net Q growth once it goes through it.

So I would answer it in 2 different ways is, I think the contract you're talking about, we had a very large blanket contract with one of the large departments, and it's still exactly -- we still have the frustration that you're alluding to. Actually, we've had more wins on the service side because it's been easier for them to give us business on the service side than it is on the storage and that's partly because of their relationships with the national archives. The one thing that we do know, both from the national archives and government leaders, is that we do expect over time for that to start coming free because national archives has publicly announced that there's only a window, it's over the next few months or years, where they're going to continue to accept volume from government agencies. So eventually, that will come loose. But that one has been slower. On the other side, we've -- we had a win. I think it was about 1.5 years ago, where we -- I think it will be 2 years. This summer, we had a one win with a large government agency, where they were exiting their own warehouse and we move that. I think we won in the summer, and we had it all -- we had 400,000 cubic feet roughly moved by November into our facility near Joint Base Andrews. So when they decide to move the -- we can onboard it quite quickly. But the contract that you're talking about that large government contract, we find that we're getting more success on the services, digital services side right now than the storage because of the stickiness with their relationship with NARA."

If you think about the IO that was really building the platform, and Credit Suisse allowed us to start building out our international management team as well as the EvoSwitch in Europe. I think where we stand right now is that we like development. Development still had the highest returns. Now that being said, we do, when we go into a market, for instance, I think I may have used -- referenced this before, when we looked at Frankfurt, we looked at either doing an acquisition or buying land. In this case, we bought a piece of land that was already permitted. And for us, the better opportunity was built buying the piece of land and building it out. But we do look when we go into these markets, what I would call brownfield, where we -- there may be a small player in that market that we want to be in but it has a significant amount of expansion capacity on their land or within their shell. So we do continue -- and that was what drove us to the EvoSwitch. Amsterdam was another market where we looked at, buy a brownfield opportunity for a greenfield, and in that case, it was better to do a brownfield. 
So we'll continue to look at it that way, but we don't feel like we need to go out and buy something to bulk up for the sake of bulking up. We feel we're -- we've grown a lot and we're in a pretty good position in terms of being recognized. And I would say that we see most things that are up for grabs in the markets that we're present in."

Before we get into our discussion of the Q4 results, I want to first welcome Barry as our new CFO to the Iron Mountain family.

Before we get into our discussion of the Q4 results, I want to first welcome Barry as our new CFO to the Iron Mountain family. Barry brings a successful track record of navigating transformation and effective change at various organizations. Most recently, he led efforts at HanesBrands to increase operating cash flow, reduce leverage and produce strong international growth. His insights will be very valuable as we roll out Project Summit, our transformation program, to simplify our structure and create a more dynamic and agile organization. We look forward to his contributions as we enter 2020 and beyond.
With that, let me start with a look-back at where we have been on our journey over the past 6 years, looking first at total organic revenue. In 2013, it was flat and adjusted EBITDA declined 1%. Today, we reported total organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and 2% if we hold paper prices constant. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, 2019 saw a growth of 3% or nearly 5% if we apply 2019 paper prices in 2018. 
More broadly, progress over the past 6 years is visible in nearly all metrics, not the least being the expansion of EBITDA margin by almost 500 basis points. This macro look-back is important as it is the basis that continues to provide momentum going forward. We feel this positive momentum in sales and profitability, coupled with Project Summit in a broader portfolio and service offerings to our core customers is the platform from which we expect this trend to continue. 
Of course, this progress just didn't happen. It is the result of the successful execution of our strategy of shifting our revenue mix to faster-growing businesses, including emerging markets, data center and adjacent businesses and successfully implementing our revenue management program. We also made important progress on Project Summit, our transformation program designed to accelerate this strategy, and create a more streamlined, simplified and agile organization better suited to solve our customers' challenges.  
Furthermore, I am pleased to share with you that we are very much on track with our execution on Project Summit. We moved quickly with the head count reduction we announced in order to ensure minimal disruption to the broader organization. If you recall, we announced plans to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%. As of the end of December, we had completed approximately 70% of the reductions. We all recognize that change is never easy, and over these last few months, our organization has shown great resilience and focus. This is a testament to our great people and the fact that a large number of mountaineers are already feeling energized by being able to more easily address and serve our customers. 
As it relates to the savings targets we communicated, the actions we took in the fourth quarter have resulted in $50 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefits that will begin to flow through in Q1. We have good line of sight to the incremental $30 million of in-year benefits we expect to generate in the second half of 2020, with a number of the process and systems improvements underway. We are excited about the new ways we are embracing technology to improve the way we work so we can all show up differently and drive change. Ultimately, we expect Project Summit to expand organic revenue beyond the current growth rates, all whilst boosting adjusted EBITDA by an additional $200 million over the next 2 years. This is all on top of the 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth we have been achieving the last few quarters. 
Turning to fourth quarter performance. Constant currency revenue increased almost 3% over the prior year. We delivered solid adjusted EBITDA growth of 8%, adjusted EPS growth of 24% and AFFO growth of 18% while simultaneously increasing investments to support future growth. Barry will provide more detail on the financial performance as well as our outlook for 2020. 
Turning to business performance. Organic global records management volume remained relatively steady with a 10 basis points decline over the trailing 12-month period. To put this into perspective, globally, volumes declined approximately 500,000 cubic feet on a base of nearly 700 million cubic feet, driven mainly by fewer acquisitions of customer relationships. More specifically, in 2018, we acquired 3.5 million cubic feet of customer relationships which tend to be some of our highest returning investments as opposed to only 2.8 million cubic feet in 2019. We expect the impact of fewer customer acquisitions in 2019 to continue its drag on volume through the first half of 2020. However, we are confident that this is a temporary deviation and that records management and volume, along with incremental storage opportunities in non-box categories such as consumer and alternative storage and adjacent businesses, should result in flat to positive levels of organic volume growth for the full year 2020. 
Now coming back to current volume trends. Apart from the dynamic I just discussed, the single biggest headwind on volume today is the rate of change of incoming boxes from our existing customers. You will recall from previous calls, the average life of a box in our inventory has remained rock steady at 15 years. Whilst the average age of a box when it is destroyed has remained steady over many years, the average age of our inventory will naturally skew during periods where the growth rate of incoming boxes is undergoing change. For example, if a vertical is experiencing a slowdown in the rate of incoming volume, then the average age of our inventory will increase. Whilst we can't predict when equilibrium will begin -- will again be achieved, we feel, in the meantime, it will remain a minor impact, given that our customers continue to add new boxes to storage annually, just at a lower rate than historically. 
To help you better understand, let's take a look at what has become one of our slowest growing yet most stable verticals. The North American legal vertical began its digital transformation journey many years ago. This change in customer behavior has resulted in a deceleration in the rate at which existing legal customers send us new boxes every year until recently. The good news is that we have seen the growth rate stabilize to slightly positive net volume growth. We expect a similar trend across other verticals that are not as far along on their digital transformation journey. 
To provide further context, let's say, a legal customer stores 100 boxes with us. 10 years ago, they would send us 6 new boxes a year and destroy or remove 2 boxes, so they would be net positive 4 boxes or a 4% growth rate. Today, a similar customer would send us 2 to 3 new boxes and still destroy 1 or 2 boxes, making them flat to net positive 1% growth rate, which is the new normal for this customer vertical, remaining stable at this lower growth rate given the age profile of their inventory has stabilized. 
We should remind you that what I just discussed is only affecting volume from existing customers, in addition to that, we continue to focus on new customers, competitive wins, opportunities in the unvended and federal channels. And as we talked about earlier, other methods of customer acquisition. We expect all these various sales channels to continue to contribute to overall organic volume growth for global RIM over time. This is what gives us confidence in the durability of the recurring revenue stream and strong cash flow generation that comes from global RIM organization, and we do not anticipate a change in the foreseeable future. As I like to say, it's the financial beast that allows us to fund growth opportunities while returning cash to our shareholders. 
We've also made considerable progress in transforming our core RIM business to a more diversified model and are on track to achieve our targeted geographic mix which, as a reminder, is 20% of revenue from faster-growing markets by the end of 2020. We ended 2019 with these markets contributing 19% to total revenue, and for comparative purposes, faster-growing markets represented less than 10% of revenue in 2013. Moreover, over the same period of time, we have expanded the adjusted EBITDA margin for these relatively new and faster-growing markets from 20% to 30% in 2019, and we believe we can continue to expand margins as we scale our presence in these geographies and to select new markets that offer superior growth opportunities all whilst managing our cost structure efficiently. 
Related, our global digital solutions business had a record year, with revenue increasing 10% year-over-year. As we shared with you last quarter, our digital solutions offerings, such as InSight, are increasingly enabling us to approach our customers with a differentiated solution, resulting in a pull-through of other products and services. 
Just one example of this was a recent win with a large, highly regulated financial institution. This customer previously managed its physical file room storage in-house, with over 600 employees across 5 global locations. We will assume responsibility for the management of all file storage, processing of the files and begin providing value-added services. We plan to transform the operation by consolidating locations, reorganizing workflows, adding workflow software and applying digital solutions such as RFID and artificial intelligence and machine learning through our InSight platform. When completed, this effort will not only help our customers significantly reduce costs, but it will also be the foundation for future enhanced digital products. We're able to win the business based on our unique combination of document management and workflow expertise, combined with our digital solutions, which we expect will result in close to $30 million in annual revenue for the next 10 years, making this one of the largest single deals we have signed. 
Turning now to our data center business. We had a good year executing 17 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including our first hyperscale deal. Whilst we are pleased with the steady commercial progress we have made leasing up our facilities ending Q4 with a stabilized utilization rate of 90%, we did see some deals in the pipeline shift from Q4 into 2020. The 17 megawatts leased in 2019 shows good progress on a base of approximately 100 megawatts at the beginning of 2019. Within our leasing for the year, we were successful in attracting over 100 new logos to our global data center platform, further diversifying our enterprise customer base and underscoring our brand strength in this dynamic industry. We continue to make good progress organically building our global platform, delivering almost 20 megawatts of capacity in key markets around the globe, including London, Amsterdam, Singapore, New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Phoenix. We are excited about our newest development in Frankfurt and currently have a strong pipeline of pre-leasing opportunities in various stages of discussion. 
Additionally, in Q4, we entered into an agreement for a second site in Slough, which will allow us to expand our present -- presence in the important London market by adding an incremental of 25 megawatts of capacity. Under the terms of the agreement, the landowner will build a shell, after which, we will finish the build-out of the data center to our specifications. Our existing footprint in London, which is adjacent to this new site, is nearing stabilization, and this new agreement provides capacity for larger requirements in a very desirable market with low latency network connectivity. 
Looking into 2020, the first half pipeline looks strong with a number of larger opportunities on the horizon. That said, these larger deals tend to be lumpy, and timing is often harder to predict. Putting this all together, we would expect to be able to lease up another 15 to 20 megawatts of capacity in 2020. We feel very good about our commercial momentum and a building pipeline of demand, including hyperscale interest in a number of our markets such as Phoenix, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt. 
In summary, 2019 was not without its challenges in terms of consistently declining paper prices, but we ended the year in line with our expectations, having a number of strong commercial wins whilst making measurable progress on our strategic plan. We are focused on maximizing the benefits from Project Summit not only financially but in how we operate as a team and an organization. We have a unique opportunity to translate a streamlined and more agile organization into speed to unlock further revenue opportunities through how we connect with and build additional value for our customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry, who will walk you through Q4 performance and our outlook for 2020."

Turning now to results. In the fourth quarter, revenue, EBITDA and AFFO were in line with our guidance ranges. We continue to expand margins as adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over last year. Additionally, AFFO increased 18% to $228 million. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased $18 million or 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by total organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter, reflecting the volume trends Bill discussed and contributions from revenue management. 
Total organic service revenue declined 70 basis points in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This reflects the change in paper prices, which were at record highs in the back half of 2018 but ended 2019 at record lows. Adjusting for the $13 million impact of lower paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% for the fourth quarter to $386 million despite lower paper prices and FX headwinds, with margins expanding 190 basis points year-over-year to 35.8%. For the quarter, our tax rate was in line with guidance and adjusted earnings per share was $0.31. 
Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track, and in the fourth quarter, we recognized $49 million of restructuring charges to implement the first phase. For 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $130 million of additional restructuring charges, and we continue to expect Project Summit to deliver $80 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 and $200 million over the next 2 years. We continue to expect total restructuring charges related to the program to be approximately $240 million. 
Now let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 90 basis points for the quarter. Organic Storage revenue increased 2.2%, reflecting volume growth in faster-growing markets and revenue management. Organic service revenue declined 1%, driven by the change in paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.3% represents an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue management and continuous improvement initiatives. 
Turning to the data center business. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 7.8%. We executed approximately 2 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for a total of 17 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily driven by enterprise and federal government customers, and churn at 1.5% remains consistent with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 51.7%, up significantly year-on-year. Profitability was boosted by 2 nonrecurring items: first, a $4 million contractual settlement; and second, a $2 million lease modification fee. Adjusting for those items, margin was 44.4% in the quarter, an increase of 290 basis points, reflecting the increased scale and progress on integration activity. 
Data center development CapEx was approximately $400 million for the full year, including $50 million for the Frankfurt land acquisition. In 2020, we expect development CapEx of approximately $200 million, reflecting the development projects currently underway. For the full year 2019, revenue of $4.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.44 billion grew 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.02. AFFO was $856 million, and dividend per share was $2.45, representing an 82% dividend payout ratio. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Lease adjusted leverage at the end of the year was 5.7x, which was slightly down versus the third quarter. We expect leverage to remain flat to slightly down in 2020, reflecting our strong focus on profit expansion partially offset by Project Summit onetime costs, lower year-over-year paper prices and foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to delevering over time, which will enable considerable strategic flexibility. 
As part of our ongoing capital recycling program, in the fourth quarter, we sold 2 portfolios, which generated net proceeds of $83 million, bringing us to approximately $170 million of proceeds for the full year. We expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. 
As investors know, part of our strategy is to increase scale in faster-growing international markets. We are pleased to report that in early January, we acquired the remaining 75% stake in OSG Records Management, the leading provider of document and data management solutions in Russia. As investors may recall, this had been a joint venture in which we previously owned 25%. We now have complete ownership of the business, which has annual revenues of more than $50 million, manages approximately 18 million cubic feet of inventory and is exhibiting strong growth. 
Turning to guidance, which is detailed in the supplemental for your review and highlighted on Slide 13 of our presentation. We are expecting 2020 revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.57 billion driven by organic EBITDA growth and Project Summit benefits. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.25 and AFFO to be in the range of $930 million to $960 million. This strong growth is despite continued low paper prices, additional foreign exchange headwinds and includes continued investments in digital solutions, IT infrastructure and our data center business. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, there are several items I would like to call out to consider when modeling the first quarter. First, we expect Project Summit actions taken in 2019 will be a significant addition to adjusted EBITDA throughout the year beginning in the first quarter. Naturally, we also anticipate organic EBITDA growth from our base business. I would also remind you that in the first quarter of 2019, we experienced elevated labor and other costs. Lastly, given where paper prices in the U.S. dollar are currently, we expect both will be notable headwinds in the first quarter. 
Our 2020 guidance implies total organic revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% as compared to prior year, including Organic Storage rental revenue growth of approximately 2%. Our guidance assumes paper prices and FX remain at current levels, which, combined, we expect to result in an adjusted EBITDA headwind of approximately $35 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Anticipated investments, which are detailed in our supplemental, will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings. We may also utilize third-party capital for data center development, as we have previously discussed. 
In closing, we expect to deliver organic growth while also realizing the benefits from Project Summit. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be commitment to our dividend, investing in growth areas through both organic investment and strategic acquisitions and reducing lease-adjusted leverage over time. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our first quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So let me answer the question on 2 levels. One, in terms of the technology aspect that you alluded to. And then the other, in terms of the operating rhythm and what we're doing differently in managing and leading the company. 
So on the technology side is that one of the biggest areas of change is going to be upgrading and applying new technology in terms of the way we track and interact with our customers. So to give you specific examples, we have 4 instances of sales force, which is very hard to get a single view of a customer globally. The second thing is, is we have over 40 billing systems, which again, billing is an area where we need to make sure that we're consistently not just billing, but responding to queries around billing for our customers. So that's an area where we're applying technology to allow our mountaineers to have better visibility of our customers, which helps them on the selling side, but also in terms of serving those customers when they have inquiries. 
So that's one area in technology. The part that's -- we're already starting to see a big effect is in terms of how we're leading the company. So one of the things that we talked about but probably not is directly, on the last call, is some of it isn't just about taking cost out. It's actually redeploying cost, so we're actually adding cost or adding resources around our people that are interacting with our customers or -- especially in terms of strategic account management. So to give you an example of that -- and also in terms of the way we lead the company. So we now have an expanded enterprise leadership team, which we met in January. And first of all, the energy in the room was noticeably different because now we have the top 40 leaders and on a regular rhythm every quarter in a room to discuss where we're going and how to get there faster and better. But also part of that briefing was the strategic account team had the opportunity to put up a slide of one of our most mature customers that we serve globally. And the interesting thing is if you had surveyed people beforehand, they would have said that, that customer is probably 80% served if you look at a matrix of our product offering in the geographies they fit in, and they're completely a global company virtually in every country we're in, and then some more. And the interesting thing is it was just the opposite. We're serving about 20% to 30% of the potential of that client rather than 80%. So a combination of having strategic accounts taking a global look at how we can serve that customer better and then the energy being able to have that discussion with the top leadership of the company globally on a quarterly basis, I think, is going to make a real change."

You're right to also assume that it's in North America is",684,"Yes. Nate, so first of all, yes, we expect volumes to be flat to up for the year, including consumer and other alternatives to storage, such as art, for instance. But yes, you heard that correctly. You're right to also assume that it's in North America is where the negative volume is. The rest of the world -- Europe is basically flat, slightly positive. It changes from quarter-to-quarter, but think of Europe as flat. And then other international is kind of mid- single digit positive, right, because those are the faster-growing emerging markets. So just to come back to it, to put it in context. First of all, we're talking about 0.5 million cubic feet in a negative decline in the year, over 700 million cubic feet. And if you look at that, more than -- that's more than explained by just the slowdown in the number of customer acquisitions that we did during '19 as compared to 2018. And at that level, that's totally in our control. In other words, we normally do about 3 million cubic feet. We did less than that in 2019. We did more than that -- a little bit more than that in 2018. And the difference between those 2 more than accounts for the 0.5 million cubic feet down in 2019, so just put that into context. In addition to that is we continue -- we source volume in 3 different buckets besides volume coming in from existing accounts. We source it from customers that are completely unvended, not just the federal government, but they are even -- some of our most mature, or I mentioned one of our most mature customers, they're, believe it or not, some places where they still do records management in-house. And I actually talked about the file rooms that we're taking over for this customer, which is the largest single customer we ever signed, $30 million a year. We signed that contract because we're actually providing them a full wraparound solution, but we're taking over all their volume in their records rooms, which historically weren't in our facilities, right? And this is a customer that we've served for many, many years. So there's the unvended bucket. 
The second bucket -- and those are our most -- highest return. The second and third buckets are either competitive takeaways or these customer acquisitions I talked about, which has historically trended around 3 million cubic feet plus or minus on a given year. Those actually have similar returns. In one case is, we're paying paramount fees and sales commissions. In the other case, we're paying someone that wants to get out of the business or is getting out of business completely, and we take over those customer contracts. So those -- if we look at those 3 vectors, we continue to see that there's a lot of growth. 
The last thing I would say just to emphasize is that I talked about the legal vertical. The thing that's driving the negative trend is not that, all of a sudden, people aren't sending us anything. Virtually every customer is continuing to send us new boxes every year. The thing that is driving the slight drag on volume is the secondary effect of slowing down rates as they go through this transformation. So the legal vertical I gave you for a number of years when it was going through that deceleration was in negative net volume territory because each year, the rate of incoming boxes was changing. So the average age of their inventory was ticking up, and so you're getting more boxes destroyed during that period of time. As it's now stabilized at the new normal at this lower rate, it's actually stabilized to slightly net positive cube. So we see similar trends happening in some of the other verticals that may be a little bit further behind the legal vertical on digital transformation. But it is important to note that the legal vertical, which is virtually almost our slowest growing vertical in North America, is actually slightly net positive in terms of cube growth."

We are in the earlier innings on those markets and those are the faster-growing markets. So the growth that we're getting from other international when you see storage revenue growth is mainly from volume growth and only a little bit of revenue management. So far, we don't see any difference in trends in those markets than we did, say, in Western Europe, when we rolled it out or North America before that in terms of elasticity, but it does take longer for that effect to show up just because some of those contracts are on 3 years. Some of them are on 5-year contracts. Of course, some are annual. So what we find is we're, I guess, 18 to 24 months into the revenue rolling revenue management out globally, and you'll see that, just like it did in Western Europe, it will take, I would say, another 1 year, 1.5 years before you start seeing the full effects of that."

So the reason why I also said that we expect the trend that we saw in Q4 to continue in the first half of 2020 is, the Q1 was also a high quarter where we actually did customer acquisition. So the trends that you're kind of calling out is virtually 100% covered by the change in customer acquisitions, not even the second derivative. Now in terms of the overall change, in terms of volumes in North America that we see, as I said, is that when legal was going through its downward march in growth rate as they were transforming or adding more digital processes to their workflows, is we did see similar trends that we see, for instance, in financial services today. I mean, financial services is still one of our higher growing -- our incoming boxes from financial services, but it's just at a lower rate than we did previously. So first of all, is that -- because we're talking about the thing that's impacting our net volume for some of these verticals is rates of change, just by its very kind of mathematical nature. These are muted effects or their secondary effects. And the thing I can't predict -- the thing I would predict is, I think we're going to be in this territory, but if you think about over a year, kind of 7 million to 8 million negative cube growth just on pure RIM and mainly focused in North America until we get through this transformation. And as I said, when we look at legal, we've gotten through that and legal is actually slightly positive in terms of net Q growth once it goes through it.

So I would answer it in 2 different ways is, I think the contract you're talking about, we had a very large blanket contract with one of the large departments, and it's still exactly -- we still have the frustration that you're alluding to. Actually, we've had more wins on the service side because it's been easier for them to give us business on the service side than it is on the storage and that's partly because of their relationships with the national archives. The one thing that we do know, both from the national archives and government leaders, is that we do expect over time for that to start coming free because national archives has publicly announced that there's only a window, it's over the next few months or years, where they're going to continue to accept volume from government agencies. So eventually, that will come loose. But that one has been slower. On the other side, we've -- we had a win. I think it was about 1.5 years ago, where we -- I think it will be 2 years. This summer, we had a one win with a large government agency, where they were exiting their own warehouse and we move that. I think we won in the summer, and we had it all -- we had 400,000 cubic feet roughly moved by November into our facility near Joint Base Andrews. So when they decide to move the -- we can onboard it quite quickly. But the contract that you're talking about that large government contract, we find that we're getting more success on the services, digital services side right now than the storage because of the stickiness with their relationship with NARA."

If you think about the IO that was really building the platform, and Credit Suisse allowed us to start building out our international management team as well as the EvoSwitch in Europe. I think where we stand right now is that we like development. Development still had the highest returns. Now that being said, we do, when we go into a market, for instance, I think I may have used -- referenced this before, when we looked at Frankfurt, we looked at either doing an acquisition or buying land. In this case, we bought a piece of land that was already permitted. And for us, the better opportunity was built buying the piece of land and building it out. But we do look when we go into these markets, what I would call brownfield, where we -- there may be a small player in that market that we want to be in but it has a significant amount of expansion capacity on their land or within their shell. So we do continue -- and that was what drove us to the EvoSwitch. Amsterdam was another market where we looked at, buy a brownfield opportunity for a greenfield, and in that case, it was better to do a brownfield. 
So we'll continue to look at it that way, but we don't feel like we need to go out and buy something to bulk up for the sake of bulking up. We feel we're -- we've grown a lot and we're in a pretty good position in terms of being recognized. And I would say that we see most things that are up for grabs in the markets that we're present in."

Our mountaineers                 resilience in these challenging times. 
As we go through this morning's call, I will focus my remarks on a few key subjects. How we are responding and managing the business in light of COVID-19 pandemic, the new service and storage revenue opportunities we have seized as we respond in real-time to our customers' changing needs. And of our core storage and data center businesses, which provide valuable recurring revenue during times such as these. 
First, COVID-19 situation, which as you're aware continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Our top priority is to ensure the safety and security of our people, their families and our customers. The situation in implementing extensive precautionary measures since first learning about the virus in January. We have been constant first striving to minimize the spread of the virus and its impact on our people, the communities we operate in and our customers, which are considered essential businesses in new and innovative ways as they navigate this pandemic. 
Now let me address the current situation.                 we are doing to mitigate that impact. As an example, we are reserving storage base for critical assets and unanticipated inventory volume including supplies needed by health responders and food and drug retailers. We are also providing outflow storage -- outflow storage for businesses now stockpiling inventory due to                 In addition, we are                 our customers of our digital and AI-based services to facilitate remote working on a range of activities, including distribution of mail from corporate mailrooms to providing a digital solution, allowing the processing of unemployment benefits remotely. 
The first quarter introduced unprecedented challenges and required us to closely examine our priorities and focus on what we could do beyond our normal course of business to remain strong, resilient and well positioned to support to all of our stakeholders. Fortunately, Iron Mountain is considered an essential service in many locations and sectors where we operate. 
In our global records and information management business, we have been able to keep more than 96% of our facilities open at varying levels of operations, all with heightened safety and cleaning procedures in place. We are seeing a need for new and more creative solutions in our digital solutions and global data center businesses. 
To help our customers respond to COVID-19, we are providing storage and distribution of PPE and other critical health care supplies and are offering innovative solutions around document scanning and application of artificial intelligence through our InSight platform, which can help enable our customers' home-based workforces. 
Whilst there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recovery from an economic perspective, I am confident we will get through this and come out an even stronger company. We are already seeing customers seek out new services that have resulted in revenue. So whilst it's possible that customers may not use our services the same way they did historically, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate new revenue streams. 
Our customer-facing teams have been closely listening to customers, engaging differently in solving problems that didn't even exist a few short months ago. We are deepening relationships with our customers and further differentiating Iron Mountain from our peers, many of which do not have our level of financial strength, breadth of digital and physical offerings and flexibility. 
We believe this positions Iron Mountain better for the longer term. 
Liquidity remains the top priority from a financial perspective, and we are operating from a strong liquidity and cash position. Barry will provide more detail on the specific actions we are taking that at a high level, we are prioritizing cash generation, and we have taken action to reduce operating expenses in discretionary capital expenditures, including M&A. 
As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.2 billion in liquidity between cash on hand and availability on our revolving credit facility. This strong balance sheet should provide us with sufficient runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. As you would expect, in a crisis such as this, our service levels have experienced significant declines in numerous geographies as many customers have instituted mandatory work from home policies or band visits to their offices and facilities from external parties. The timing and magnitude of decline in service activity has varied by market and by product line. Whilst we are a global company with operations in over 50 markets, our exposure to countries that saw a peak in Q1 such as China is limited. So we did not see a significant service activity decline until mid-March for the majority of our business. 
In our records management and secure shred businesses, which account for approximately 75% of our service revenue, service activity has declined by 40% to 50% during the times when the respective markets have had restrictions in place as compared to the prior year. 
As restrictions are lifted, we expect the service activity to gradually pick back up. For instance, in our Chinese markets, we are seeing current service activity at 60% to 70% of normal levels, which has improved from only approximately 20% at the peak of the virus spread in China. While service generally contributes only about 20% of our profit, given the size of the decline as well as some of the fixed costs in the business, the impact is significant. As we have encountered this slowdown, we have made tough decisions that impact our fellow Iron Mountain colleagues. In an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity, we have either furloughed, reduced hours or utilized other temporary reduction measures for approximately 1/3 of our global workforce. We have also managed costs by putting on hold our -- on recruiting activity in terminating most of our temporary and contract workers in our global records and information management business. 
Decisions that impact our employees are never taken lightly, and we have set up numerous resources to support impacted employees during this unprecedented time. This includes, but is not limited to, continue to provide benefits in sponsoring the employee portion of health care for impacted employees, helping our employees utilize their respective government programs available to those individuals unemployed or furloughed, assisting our colleagues with outplacement support and actively assisting employees through our employee funded relief fund. 
At the same time, our core storage business remains durable, and we continue to benefit from our deep and long-lasting customer relationships. Whilst we have seen a slowdown in the new boxes that we have been able to inbound, the majority of our storage revenue is from existing boxes that were inbounded in prior months and years, and we continue to earn revenue on that inventory. However, the impact the crisis will have on our future organic storage rental revenue growth and volume remains unknown and is dependent on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In Q1, total organic storage revenue grew 3%, supported by strong benefits from revenue management. Global organic volume in Q1 was flat compared to Q4, driven primarily by growth in adjacent businesses in consumer of 8% and 5%, respectively, on a sequential basis. Organic global records management volume declined approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the fourth quarter. Due to the impact of COVID-19, we expect our volume of incoming boxes for the remaining of the year to be lower than we initially expected entering the year, but we'll continue to look for ways to mitigate the slowdown. 
As I mentioned before, we also remain in active dialogue with our customers about leveraging existing and customized Iron Mountain solutions to help them navigate this difficult situation. I want to briefly mention a few key examples. One of our digital services that has benefited our customers during this crisis is image-on-demand. This service provides safe, contactless digital delivery, which enhances the chain of custody security and provides a quick 24-hour turnaround online delivery. This solution enables customers to be more effective by sharing information with those who need it, whilst ensuring the information security and privacy are maintained, which is even more necessary in today's remote environment. Another example is one where we are helping 1 of our customers, a national health care provider, which was struggling with a surge in the need for medical supplies and supply chain challenges. This particular customer needed to distribute critical PPE to 32,000 employees at 750 sites in 36 U.S. states and required a secure location to prep PPE kits without taking up valuable space that was being used to care for patients. In order to meet those critical needs, we provided nonrecords business storage and logistics support. We inbounded in stored pallets from multiple suppliers, prepared PPE kits made up of 12 to 15 items and distributed kits to health care sites. This is only one example of how we have helped many of our health care and medical customers during these trying times. A third relevant example is a government labor department that needed to maintain critical processes whilst enabling home-based workers to process high volumes of unemployment claim records as quickly as possible. The government agency leveraged our InSight Essentials platform, which enabled the government department to receive the scan claims via our InSight application to more than 800 unemployment examiners. We will continue to store the hard copy records for them until they need to be securely destroyed. We are currently speaking to multiple U.S. states about similar solutions to address both elevated volume and unemployment and Medicare claims during this crisis as well as the need for remote working of the teams approving the claims. 
As you would expect, our global data center business has also been resilient as an unprecedented number of organizations are adjusting to remote working practices, which has driven a substantial increase in traffic and the need for additional bandwidth. Moreover, the current pandemic further underscores the vital and expanding role of multi-tenant data center play in an increasingly digital economy. 
COVID-19 is causing companies to evaluate and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, especially as it relates to outsourcing their IT infrastructure and fortifying their remote capabilities. In fact, industry experts believe that COVID-19 is serving to fast track trends that were already evident in the data center industry, which bodes well for this portion of our business moving forward. 
Looking at recent performance, our global data center business had a strong Q1 with organic revenue growth of almost 10%. We signed 6.4 megawatts of new and expansion leases, and our pipeline remains robust. This leasing consisted of a 3-megawatt booking with a new logo, a leading hyperscale enterprise software provider, which also includes a contractually committed reservation for an additional 2 megawatts in our expanded campus in Phoenix. We also continued to maintain good momentum with our enterprise customers. 
Commercially, despite an unprecedented macro backdrop, our data center team continues to receive significant engagement in RFPs for both hyperscale, corporate and government requirements. The team has quickly adjusted to the new normal of remote working and has been innovative and continue to meet our current and prospective customer needs, including hosting virtual data center tours to support demand and the increased need for capacity. 
We are committed to ensuring uptime and resiliency for our data center customers and we are ready with capacity and our staff to handle support, upgrades and new installations if additional bandwidth is needed whilst remote workforces are supported. 
One area that we continue to monitor closely is the impact on the pace of construction for our data centers currently under development. While it's not significant, we do see modest delays across many of our projects, which is also happening across the industry. Given our relatively high capacity utilization of almost 90%, should delays extend or increase in length, this could create a tight supply situation. As I said, we are keeping a close eye on this and are in regular contact with all of our vendors and construction partners, and at this moment, we do not foresee it will materially impact our anticipated bookings and delivery for this year. 
As we look ahead, these are truly unprecedented times, and the path to recovery is clouded by uncertainty and will likely be choppy. It is very difficult to predict how long this current environment will go on, and what the new normal will look like on the other side. It will undoubtedly be lasting changes to how we work and how our customers will conduct business. 
Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe a conservative approach is warranted. As you can see from our Q1 results, Project Summit is off to a strong start. Now that our project teams are up and running and given the speed with which we implemented wave 1, we have identified additional opportunities to accelerate strategies to streamline our business and operations. We have pulled forward a number of initiatives that were planned for waves 2 and 3 of Project Summit and expect to see those benefits materialize at a faster pace in 2020. In addition to finding new ways to work differently with our customers as we roll out Project Summit, COVID-19 has uncovered ways for us to support our customers as they adjust to a remote working environment. Our customers' increased need for digital delivery has allowed us to reassess our service delivery model. 
Our R&D and growth initiatives have well positioned us with services like image-on-demand to address customers' changing needs as they adapt to new ways of working. Leveraging these new technology capabilities enables us to adjust our service delivery model and more efficiently utilize our fleet, labor and real estate. The most impactful changes to our service delivery model revolve around new service level agreements, or SLAs. These new agreements will allow us to better align our external customer SLAs with our internal record center SLAs as well as leverage more effective use of digital delivery to serve our customers. 
In addition, we will also utilize third-party logistics providers more extensively than we have historically for our pickups and delivery. We have proactively communicated with our customers in some of our largest markets regarding these changes and have begun implementing the SLA changes, which has resulted in some additional reduction in force across the business. This broadened scope of Project Summit should result in even higher levels of adjusted EBITDA benefit and associated charges than we initially expected. Project Summit is now expected to generate $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting 2021. This represents a meaningful increase from the prior expectation of $200 million. The total program is expected to cost approximately $450 million, up from our prior expectation of $240 million. 
In closing, this additional benefit from Project Summit should only further propel the underlying strength of our business once we emerge from the COVID-19 situation. Our strong performance in Q1, together with the additional promise from an expanded Project Summit, makes us confident that we will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as an even stronger company than envisioned before. We continue to demonstrate resilience and determination and show all of our customers and on their time of need and that Iron Mountain really is iron. I want to thank all my fellow mountaineers and their families, again, for their perseverance in these difficult times, and I pray for their safety. I hope all of you and your loved ones are remaining safe and well. 
With that, I turn the call over to you, Barry."

I hope you are all safe and healthy. I would like to say thank you to our Iron Mountain team. I've been truly impressed by the team's commitment, hard work and perseverance during these challenging times. 
As Bill noted, we are confident that we will emerge from this period a stronger company, driven by our durable business model and the strength of our balance sheet. I will briefly touch on our first quarter performance before discussing our approach to addressing the pandemic. 
In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations. And through the first 9 weeks of the quarter, we were               ]. Though by mid-March, our service activity began to experience declines compared to plan as more customers instituted mandatory work from home policies and restricted visits to their facilities. Despite this, we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 1.4% on a reported basis and 3.2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year and in the first quarter. This was primarily                 revenue growth of 3%, which reflected our successful execution of revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.9% to   $3 million   despite the negative impact                 exchange rates. 
On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA grew                 almost 14%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points year-over-year to 34%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27, up significantly from $0.17                  
AFFO grew                 20% year-over-year to $231 million, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth. This represents a new quarterly high for Iron Mountain, reflecting our team's focus on driving cash generation and increasing levels of                . 
Turning to segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 60 basis points for the quarter, reflecting                 and revenue management, partially offset by lower year-over-year paper prices. 
Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% represents an increase of 230 basis points, driven by revenue management, benefits from Project Summit, and continuous improvement initiatives. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.9%, driven by strong leasing                 Data centers EBITDA margin of 45.9% represents an increase of 360 basis points, consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion. As a reminder, as we move through the balance of the year, on a reported basis, the 2019 data center results have some onetime benefits that we called out last year, which make the year-over-year comparisons less meaningful. 
Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track and have accelerated and expanded initiatives in certain areas                 
In the first quarter, we recognized                 to implement the remainder of the first wave plus components of wave 2, which contributed to the first quarter benefit. 
With the increased size and scope of the program, we now expect to realize the full                 summit, exiting 2021, with all actions complete and the associated $450 million of charges incurred by the end of 2021. We now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit activities of $150 million compared with our prior expectation of the $80 million in                . 
Now I would like to provide an update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business and what actions we are taking to ensure we are well positioned. 
Given the macro uncertainty, we want to be as                 to understand what we are seeing.                 To that end, I'm going to provide                . First, I want to put into perspective how much of our storage revenue is generated by what is already on the shelf at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, our core storage business accounts for nearly 2/3 of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability. In a typical year, new volume accounts for less than 3% of our annual               ]. Nearly all of our annual storage revenue comes from boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. As the ability to service customer facilities is limited, we have naturally seen a decline in the number of boxes that we are able to pick up. Partially as a result of this, we currently expect a net decline in cube volume in 2020, but                 of the pandemic. This has on storage revenue is much more muted than the impact it has on our service activity levels. 
Turning to our service business, which was about 35% of our 2019 revenue. Activity declined approximately 40% overall on the service business. As investors would expect, the impact has not been uniform across our service lines, so let's take a look at how this has trended across our business. 
I will use North America as an example, as it is both our largest market and fairly representative of the activity levels we have seen in other markets with similar                 Records management in North America for the month of April had a 58% year-over-year reduction in new boxes inbounded and a 49% year-over-year reduction in                 and refiles. Data management activity in April declined less, approximately 30%. Digital solutions has seen a slowdown in activity compared to the first quarter, though April activity levels were flat year-over-year. 
In our shred business, activity declined approximately 27% in April, which has led to a corresponding decline in our paper tonnage. While we have seen an encouraging rebound in the market for paper prices recently, our average realized price in the first quarter was 44% lower than the prior year, which was a $10 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with the broader industry trends, we saw a sequential improvement in paper price of about 2.5% in the first quarter, and the trend has continued to improve. As investors will recall, in the past, we have mentioned that a $10 per tonne change in paper price represents an approximate $6 million EBITDA impact. Of course, this is clearly influenced by volume, so the EBITDA impact of paper price movement will change proportionately with the change in paper volume. 
Now let me make a couple of comments on 2 of our smaller businesses. The Fine Arts industry has experienced a significant slowdown during the pandemic. And given the nonessential nature of the business, we have temporarily closed all of our Fine Arts facilities. With a prudent view as to the intermediate term impact, we recorded a $23 million noncash impairment charge on the goodwill associated with that reporting unit. The consumer storage business through our partnership with MakeSpace has seen an increase in demand. This led to over 5% growth in storage volume in the first quarter, and we have continued to see strong demand in April. 
Given the nature of the service level decline I just discussed, we have taken actions, which we expect to be temporary and are in addition to the actions we had underway with Project Summit. These actions include furloughs, reduced work hours, a pause in hiring, reductions in certain expenses like travel and lower variable compensation. With these adjustments, we anticipate we will have removed in excess of $350 million on an annualized basis as compared to our prior plans. You will see these reductions materialize in cost of sales within our service business as well as in our SG&A expenses. These actions are designed to help align our costs and revenues as we navigate the uncertain environment. Therefore, we expect these costs to come back as revenue recovers. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the first quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement of 8 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables days and days sales outstanding. I view the team's performance is particularly strong given the COVID-19 backdrop. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term. We ended the quarter with $153 million of cash, and together with the availability under our revolving credit facility, we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. At this point in early May, our liquidity remains unchanged at that level, which we believe provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. 
For context, this liquidity represents over 3x the 2019 full year adjusted EBITDA of our service business. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share earlier this week to be paid in early July. As the economy recovers in 2022 and 2023 and with a sustainable dividend at this level, we would expect our payout ratio to glide toward the   mid-60s to low-70s   as a percent of AFFO. 
As we noted in our press release, we are no longer providing guidance for 2020 in light of the unknown severity and duration of the impact of the crisis on our markets and customers. However, we do want to help you understand how we are currently planning for the remainder of 2020. 
Let me start with the impact of the much stronger U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we currently expect a full year impact on our revenue of about $100 million versus last year. At the time of our last call, FX rates implied an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $5 million. Though with a stronger dollar, current FX rates translate into a full year adjusted EBITDA headwind of $35 million versus last year. 
Turning to activity levels. We are expecting April to be representative of the trends we experienced for the remainder of the second quarter, which we expect to be the weakest quarter in 2020 for comparative revenue and adjusted EBITDA change. Although recent trends suggest this may prove to be conservative as more and more of our customers around the world are gradually opening back up, and we are seeing other positive indicators. I will note, we are maintaining flexibility to rebound quickly if business conditions improve faster than expected. And on the other hand, if conditions worsen, we have already identified additional options that can be executed quickly as needed. At this point, we anticipate delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin flat to slightly up compared to last year, reflecting our solid first quarter performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions. This will be partially offset by our conservative posture as to service revenues and fixed cost deleverage. 
Given the current environment, we have also quickly taken actions to preserve capital. We reduced capital investments, both for capital expenditures and M&A by a net total of $110 million relative to our original guidance for 2020. This is made up of approximately $110 million of reduced CapEx and $75 million of reduced investment in M&A and acquisitions                 of customer relationships. This net total also reflects an increased investment of $75 million to support the construction of our Frankfurt data center. Additional detail can be seen in the supplemental and is highlighted on Slide 14 of our presentation. We continue to expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. As we look at the market for industrial assets, we continue to see attractive valuations, and our pipeline has actually increased over the last couple of months. As investors would expect, we have run multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for revenue, margins, the duration of the crisis and the speed of recovery. Included in these scenarios are some extreme stress test models, which we develop to understand the possible impact if conditions worsened materially and persisted for an extended period of time. One of the stress test we ran was based on service activity being down about 65% year-on-year and persisting at that level through 2021. Even in that scenario, we do not foresee an issue with liquidity or leverage through 2021. And I'll also note the severity and duration of our stress tests are much more extreme than both what we have seen thus far and what current trends and macro forecasts indicate we will likely experience. Even still, we would have significant cushion in terms of both liquidity and leverage. 
In closing, we are confident in the durability of our storage business and believe the magnitude of impact on our service business, combined with the actions we have taken, leave us in a strong financial position. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our second quarter earnings call. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy.

So what we've done is we've actually, in the major markets, we've already implemented this. So this is United States, Canada, Ireland, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand. As we said, we're taking that to 5 business days. So once a week, we will pick up or deliver physical boxes. If they need something quicker, then we will actually digitize it, and we'll send it to them in a digital secure link through our InSight platform in image-on-demand.

But certainly, if you thought about that $175 million incremental in sort of perpetuity, and that's the way you should because it's an ongoing benefit. And put that against either our prior guidance or last year's results, for example, it is a very significant increase in the relative level of profitability and will certainly dramatically assist us in our goal of of increasing margin and moving that into the very   high 30s  , if not potentially beyond going forward.

As a global business, we have been assessing the situation and implementing expensive precautionary measures since, first, learning about the virus in January. We have been constant. First, in Asia, and now globally in striving to minimize the spread of the virus and its impacts on our people, the communities we operate in and our customers. 
We have been serving our customers, many of which are considered essential businesses in new and innovative ways as they navigate this pandemic. Now let me address the current situation, the impact on our business and what we are doing to mitigate that impact. 
As an example, we are reserving storage base for critical assets and anticipated inventory volumes, including supplies needed by health responders in food and drug retailers. We are also providing outflow storage -- [ outperms flow ] storage for businesses now stockpiling inventory due to service or supply chain disruptions. 
In addition, we are availing our customers of our digital and AI-based services to facilitate remote working on a range of activities, including distribution of Mail from corporate mailrooms to providing a digital solution, allowing the processing of unemployment benefits remotely. 
The first quarter introduced unprecedented challenges and required us to closely examine our priorities and focus on what we could do beyond our normal course of business to remain strong, resilient and well positioned to support all of our stakeholders. 
Fortunately, Iron Mountain is considered an essential service in many locations and sectors where we operate. In our global records and information management business, we have been able to keep more than 96% of our facilities open at varying levels of operations, all with heightened safety and cleaning procedures in place. 
We are seeing a need for new and more creative solutions in our digital solutions and global data center businesses. To help our customers respond to COVID-19, we are providing storage and distribution of PPE and other critical health care supplies and are offering innovative solutions around document scanning and application of artificial intelligence through our Insight platform, which can help enable our customers' home-based workforces. 
Whilst there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recovery from an economic perspective, I am confident we will get through this and come out an even stronger company. We are already seeing customers seek out new services that have resulted in revenue. So whilst it's possible that customers may not use our services the same way they did historically, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate new revenue streams. 
Our customer-facing teams have been closely listening to customers, engaging differently in solving problems that didn't even exist a few short months ago. We are deepening relationships with our customers and further differentiating Iron Mountain from our peers, many of which do not have our level of financial strength, breadth of digital and physical offerings and flexibility. We believe this positions Iron Mountain better for the longer term. 
Liquidity remains the top priority from a financial perspective, and we are operating from a strong liquidity and cash position. Barry will provide more detail on the specific actions we are taking that at a high level, we are prioritizing cash generation, and we have taken action to reduce operating expenses in discretionary capital expenditures, including M&A. 
As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.2 billion in liquidity between cash on hand and availability on our revolving credit facility. This strong balance sheet should provide us with sufficient runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. 
As you would expect, in a crisis such as this, our service levels have experienced significant declines in numerous geographies as many customers have instituted mandatory work from home policies or ban visits to their offices and facilities from external parties. The timing and magnitude of decline in service activity has varied by market and by product line. Whilst we are a global company with operations in over 50 markets, our exposure to countries that saw a peak in Q1, such as China, is limited, so we did not see a significant service activity decline until mid-March for the majority of our business. 
In our records management and secure shred businesses, which account for approximately 75% of our service revenue. Service activity has declined by 40% to 50% during the times when the respective markets have had restrictions in place as compared to the prior year. As restrictions are lifted, we expect this service activity to gradually pick back up. For instance, in our Chinese markets, we are seeing current service activity at 60% to 70% of normal levels, which has improved from only approximately 20% at the peak of the virus spread in China. While service generally contributes only about 20% of our profit, given the size of the decline as well as some of the fixed costs in the business, the impact is significant. 
As we have encountered this slowdown, we have made tough decisions that impact our fellow Iron Mountain colleagues. In an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity, we have either furloughed, reduced hours or utilized other temporary reduction measures for approximately 1/3 of our global workforce. 
We have also managed costs by putting on hold our -- on recruiting activity in terminating most of our temporary and contract workers in our global records and information management business. Decisions that impact our employees are never taken lightly, and we have set up numerous resources to support impacted employees during this unprecedented time. 
This includes, but is not limited to, continue to provide benefits in sponsoring the employee portion of health care for impacted employees, helping our employees utilize their respective government programs available to those individuals unemployed or furloughed, assisting our colleagues with outplacement support and actively assisting employees through our employee funded relief fund. At the same time, our core storage business remains durable, and we continue to benefit from our deep and long-lasting customer relationships. Whilst we have seen a slowdown in the new boxes that we have been able to inbound, the majority of our storage revenue is from existing boxes that were inbounded in prior months and years, and we continue to earn revenue on that inventory. 
However, the impact of the -- the impact the crisis will have on our future organic storage rental revenue growth and volume remains unknown and is dependent on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, total organic storage revenue grew 3%, supported by strong benefits from revenue management. Global organic volume in Q1 was flat compared to Q4, driven primarily by growth in adjacent businesses and consumer of 8% and 5%, respectively, on a sequential basis. 
Organic global records management volume declined approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the fourth quarter. Due to the impact of COVID '19, we expect our volume of incoming boxes for the remaining of the year to be lower than we initially expected entering the year, but we'll continue to look for ways to mitigate the slowdown. As I mentioned before, we also remain in active dialogue with our customers about leveraging existing and customized Iron Mountain solutions to help them navigate this difficult situation. I want to briefly mention a few key examples. One of our digital services that has benefited our customers during this crisis is Image on Demand. This service provides safe, contact list, digital delivery, which enhances the chain of custody security and provides a quick 24-hour turnaround online delivery. 
This solution enables customers to be more effective by sharing information with those who need it, whilst ensuring the information security and privacy are maintained, which is even more necessary in today's remote environment. Another example is one where we are helping one of our customers, a national health care provider, which was struggling with a surge in the need for medical supplies and supply chain challenges. 
This particular customer needed to distribute critical PPE to 32,000 employees at 750 sites in 36 U.S. states and required a secure location to prep PPE kits without taking up valuable space that was being used to care for patients. 
In order to meet those critical needs, we provided nonrecords business storage and logistics support. We inbounded in stored pallets from multiple suppliers, prepared PPE kits made up of 12 to 15 items and distributed the kits to health care sites. 
This is only one example of how we have helped many of our health care and medical customers during these trying times. A third relevant example is a government labor department that needed to maintain critical processes, whilst enabling home-based workers to process high volumes of unemployment claim records as quickly as possible. 
The government agency leveraged our InSight Essentials platform, which enabled the government department to receive the scan claims via our InSight application to more than 800 unemployment examiners. We will continue to store the hard copy records for them until they need to be securely destroyed. We are currently speaking to multiple U.S. states about similar solutions to address both elevated volume and unemployment and Medicare claims during this crisis as well as the need for remote working of the teams approving the claims.  
As you would expect, our global data center business has also been resilient as an unprecedented number of organizations are adjusting to remote working practices, which has driven a substantial increase in traffic and the need for additional bandwidth. Moreover, the current pandemic further underscores the vital and expanding role of multi-tenant data center play in an increasingly digital economy.  
COVID-19 is causing companies to evaluate and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, especially as it relates to outsourcing their IT infrastructure and fortifying their remote capabilities. In fact, industry experts believe that COVID-19 is serving to fast track trends that were already evident in the data center industry, which bodes well for this portion of our business moving forward.  
Looking at recent performance, our global data center business had a strong Q1 with organic revenue growth of almost 10%. We signed 6.4 megawatts of new and expansion leases, and our pipeline remains robust. This leasing consisted of a 3-megawatt booking with a new logo, a leading hyperscale enterprise software provider, which also includes a contractually committed reservation for an additional 2 megawatts and our expanded campus in Phoenix. We also continued to maintain good momentum with our enterprise customers.  
Commercially, despite an unprecedented macro backdrop, our data center team continues to receive significant engagement in RFPs for both hyperscale, corporate and government requirements. The team has quickly adjusted to the new normal of remote working and has been innovative and continue to meet our current and prospective customer needs, including hosting virtual data center tours to support demand and the increased need for capacity.  
We are committed to ensuring uptime and resiliency for our data center customers and we are ready with capacity and our staff to handle support, upgrades and new installations, if additional bandwidth is needed, whilst remote workforces are supported.  
One area that we continue to monitor closely is the impact on the pace of construction of our -- for our data centers currently under development. While it's not significant, we do see modest delays across many of our projects, which is also happening across the industry. Given our relatively high capacity utilization of almost 90%, should delays extend or increase in length, this could create a tight supply situation. 
As I said, we are keeping a close eye on this, and are in regular contact with all of our vendors and construction partners. And at this moment, we do not foresee it will materially impact our anticipated bookings and delivery for this year.  
As we look ahead, these are truly unprecedented times, and the path to recovery is clouded by uncertainty and will likely be choppy. It is very difficult to predict how long this current environment will go on. And what the new normal will look like on the other side. It will undoubtedly be lasting changes to how we work and how our customers will conduct business.  
Given the combined effects of the pandemic and the   associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe a conservative approach is warranted. As you can see from our Q1 results, Project Summit is off to a strong start. 
Now that our project teams are up and running and given the speed, with which we implemented Wave 1, we have identified additional opportunities to accelerate strategies to streamline our business and operations. We have pulled forward a number of initiatives that were planned for waves 2 and 3 of Project Summit and expect to see those benefits materialize at a faster pace in 2020. In addition to finding new ways to work differently with our customers as we roll out Project Summit, COVID-19 has uncovered ways for us to support our customers as they adjust to remote work -- to a remote working environment. Our customers' increased need for digital delivery has allowed us to reassess our service delivery model.  
Our R&D and growth initiatives have well positioned us with services like Image on Demand to address customers' changing needs as they adapt to new ways of working. Leveraging these new technology capabilities enables us to adjust our service delivery model and more efficiently utilize our fleet, labor and real estate. 
The most impactful changes to our service delivery model revolve around new service level agreements, or SLAs. These new agreements will allow us to better align our external customer SLAs with our internal record center SLAs as well as leverage more effective use of digital delivery to serve our customers.  
In addition, we will also utilize third-party logistics providers more extensively than we have historically for our pickups and delivery. We have proactively communicated with our customers in some of our largest markets, regarding these changes and have begun implementing the SLA changes, which has resulted in some additional reduction in force across the business. 
This broadened scope of Project Summit should result in even higher levels of adjusted EBITDA benefit and associated charges than we initially expected. Project Summit is now expected to generate $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting 2021. This represents a meaningful increase from the prior expectation of $200 million. The total program is expected to cost approximately $450 million, up from our prior expectation of $240 million.  
In closing, this additional benefit from Project Summit should only further propel the underlying strength of our business once we emerge from COVID -- from the COVID-19 situation. Our strong performance in Q1, together with the additional promise from an expanded Project Summit, makes us confident that we will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as an even stronger company than envisioned before. 
We continue to demonstrate resilience and determination and show all of our customers and communities that they can count on us in their time of need and that Iron Mountain really is iron. 
I want to thank all of my fellow mountaineers and their families, again, for their perseverance in these difficult times, and I pray for their safety. I hope all of you and your loved ones are remaining safe and well.  
With that, I turn the call over to you, Barry."

I hope you are all safe and healthy. I would like to say thank you to our Iron Mountain team. I've been truly impressed by the team's commitment, hard work and perseverance during these challenging times.  
As Bill noted, we are confident that we will emerge from this period a stronger company, driven by our durable business model and the strength of our balance sheet. I will briefly touch on our first quarter performance before discussing our approach to addressing the pandemic.  
In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations. And through the first 9 weeks of the quarter, we were on track to exceed our targets even more substantially. Though, by mid-March, our service activity began to experience declines compared to planned as more customers instituted mandatory work from home policies and restricted visits to their facilities. Despite this, we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. 
Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 1.4% on a reported basis, and 3.2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1% in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by organic storage rental revenue growth of 3%, which reflected our successful execution of revenue management. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.9% for the first quarter to to $363 million, despite the negative impact from lower paper prices in foreign exchange rates.  
On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA grew  almost 14%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points year-over-year to 34%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27, up significantly from $0.17 in the first quarter 2019. 
AFFO grew 20% year-over-year to $231 million, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth. This represents a new quarterly high for Iron Mountain, reflecting our team's focus on driving cash generation and increasing levels of AFFO overtime. 
Turning to segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 60 basis points for the quarter, reflecting volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management, partially offset by lower year-over-year paper prices.  
Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% represents an increase of 230 basis points, driven by revenue management, benefits from Project Summit, and continuous improvement initiatives. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.9%, driven by strong leasing and low churn of 50 basis points. Data centers EBITDA margin of 45.9% represents an increase of 360 basis points, consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion. 
As a reminder, as we move through the balance of the year, on a reported basis, the 2019 data center results have some onetime benefits that we called out last year, which make the year-over-year comparisons less meaningful.  
Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track and have accelerated and expanded initiatives in certain areas in response to COVID-19. In the first quarter, we recognized $41 million of restructuring charges to implement the remainder of the first wave plus components of wave 2, which contributed to the first quarter benefit of $25 million. 
With the increased size and scope of the program, we now expect to realize the full $374 million of benefit related to Project Summit, exiting 2021, with all actions complete and the associated $450 million of charges incurred by the end of 2021. In 2020, we now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit activities of $150 million compared with our prior expectation of the $80 million in restructuring charges of $240 million, up from $130 million, previously. 
Now I would like to provide an update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business and what actions we are taking to ensure we are well positioned.  
Given the macro uncertainty, we want to be as transparent as possible to help inverters understand what we are seeing. To that end, I'm going to provide Insights that are more granular than we typically provide. But first, I want to put into perspective how much of our storage revenue is generated by what is already on the shelf at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, our core storage business accounts for nearly 2/3 of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability. In a typical year, new volume accounts for less than 3% of our annual storage revenue. In other words nearly all of our annual storage revenue comes from boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. As Bill mentioned, in markets where our ability to service customer facilities is limited, we have naturally seen a decline in the number of boxes that we are able to pick up. Partially as a result of this, we currently expect a net decline in cube volume in 2020, but of course, that is subject to change based on the duration of the pandemic. As you would expect, the impact this has on storage revenue is much more muted than the impact it has on our service activity levels.  
Turning to our service business, which was about 35% of our 2019 revenue. In April, we saw activity declined approximately 40% overall on the service business. As investors would expect, the impact has not been uniform across our service lines, so let's take a look at how this has trended across our business.  
I will use North America as an example, as it is both our largest market and fairly representative of the activity levels we have seen in other markets with similar closures and restrictions. Records management in North America for the month of April had a 58% year-over-year reduction in new boxes inbounded and a 49% year-over-year reduction in retrievals and refiles. Data management activity in April declined less, approximately 30%. Digital solutions has seen a slowdown in activity compared to the first quarter, though April activity levels were flat year-over-year.  
In our shred business, activity declined approximately 27% in April, which has led to a corresponding decline in our paper tonnage. While we have seen an encouraging rebound in the market for paper prices recently, our average realized price in the first quarter was 44% lower than the prior year, which was a $10 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA. 
Consistent with the broader industry trends, we saw a sequential improvement in paper price of about 2.5% in the first quarter, and the trend has continued to improve. As investors will recall, in the past, we have mentioned that a $10 per tonne change in paper price represents an approximate $6 million EBITDA impact. Of course, this is clearly influenced by volume, so the EBITDA impact of paper price movement will change proportionately with the change in paper volume.  
Now let me make a couple of comments on 2 of our smaller businesses. The Fine Arts industry has experienced a significant slowdown during the pandemic. And given the nonessential nature of the business, we have temporarily closed all of our Fine Arts facilities. With a prudent view as to the intermediate term impact, we recorded a $23 million noncash impairment charge on the goodwill associated with that reporting unit. The consumer storage business through our partnership with MakeSpace has seen an increase in demand. This led to over 5% growth in storage volume in the first quarter, and we have continued to see strong demand in April.  
Given the nature of the service level decline I just discussed, we have taken actions, which we expect to be temporary and are in addition to the actions we had underway with Project Summit. These actions include furloughs, reduced work hours, a pause in hiring, reductions in certain expenses like travel and lower variable compensation. With these adjustments, we anticipate we will have removed in excess of $350 million on an annualized basis as compared to our prior plans. You will see these reductions materialize in cost of sales within our service business as well as in our SG&A expenses. These actions are designed to help align our costs and revenues as we navigate the uncertain environment. Therefore, we expect these costs to come back as revenue recovers.  
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the first quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement, up 8 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables days and days sales outstanding. I view the team's performance is particularly strong, given the COVID-19 backdrop. 
We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term. We ended the quarter with $153 million of cash, and together with the availability under our revolving credit facility, we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. At this point in early May, our liquidity remains unchanged at that level, which we believe provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment.  
For context, this liquidity represents over 3x the 2019 full year adjusted EBITDA of our service business. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share earlier this week to be paid in early July. As the economy recovers in 2022 and 2023 and with a sustainable dividend at this level, we would expect our payout ratio to glide toward the mid-60s to low 70s as a percent of AFFO.  
As we noted in our press release, we are no longer providing guidance for 2020 in light of the unknown severity and duration of the impact of the crisis on our markets and customers. However, we don't want to help you understand how we are currently planning for the remainder of 2020.  
Let me start with the impact of the much stronger U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we currently expect a full year impact on our revenue of about $100 million versus last year. At the time of our last call, FX rates implied an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $5 million. Though with a stronger dollar, current FX rates translate into a full year adjusted EBITDA headwind of $35 million versus last year.  
Turning to activity levels. We are expecting April to be representative of the trends we experienced for the remainder of the second quarter, which we expect to be the weakest quarter in 2020 for comparative revenue and adjusted EBITDA change. Although recent trends suggest this may prove to be conservative as more and more of our customers around the world are gradually opening back up, and we are seeing other positive indicators. 
I will note, we are maintaining flexibility to rebound quickly if business conditions improve faster than expected. And on the other hand, if conditions worsen, we have already identified additional options that can be executed quickly as needed. At this point, we anticipate delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin flat to slightly up compared to last year, reflecting our solid first quarter performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions. This will be partially offset by our conservative posture as to service revenues and fixed cost deleverage.  
Given the current environment, we have also quickly taken actions to preserve capital. We reduced capital investments, both for capital expenditures and M&A by a net total of $110 million relative to our original guidance for 2020. This is made up of approximately $110 million of reduced CapEx and $75 million of reduced investment in M&A and acquisitions of customer relationships. This net total also reflects an increased investment of $75 million to support the construction of our Frankfurt data center. Additional detail can be seen in the supplemental and is highlighted on Slide 14 of our presentation. We continue to expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. 
As we look at the market for industrial assets, we continue to see attractive valuations, and our pipeline has actually increased over the last couple of months. As investors would expect, we have run multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for revenue, margins, the duration of the crisis and the speed of recovery. Included in these scenarios are some extreme stress test models, which we develop to understand the possible impact if conditions worsened materially and persisted for an extended period of time. One of the stress test we ran was based on service activity being down about 65% year-on-year and persisting at that level through 2021. Even in that scenario, we do not foresee an issue with liquidity or leverage through 2021. I'll also note the severity and duration of our stress tests are much more extreme than both what we have seen thus far and what current trends and macro forecasts indicate we will likely experience. Even still, we would have significant cushion in terms of both liquidity and leverage.  
In closing, we are confident in the durability of our storage business and believe the magnitude of impact on our service business, combined with the actions we have taken, leave us in a strong financial position. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our second quarter earnings call. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy.  
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

Because if you look at our cost of service, which is a combination of labor, fleet in terms of the trucks that we put on the road and our facilities. It is -- we are one -- it is actually the largest cost as a company. And when you then say, okay, we're going to a 5-day or once a week service cycle, which allows us to marshal or consolidate volumes much more. And then for more rapid turnaround to give people digital ways of getting that back, it's a major change in terms of cost of sales. We always, as part of Project Summit. we're going to optimize the cost of sales across those 3 labor, trucking and facilities. But actually changing that from a 24-hour rhythm to a once a week rhythm is super impactful."

But certainly, if you thought about that $175 million incremental in sort of perpetuity, and that's the way you should because it's a ongoing benefit. And put that against either our prior guidance or last year's results, for example, it is a very significant increase in the relative level of profitability and will certainly dramatically assist us in our goal of of increasing margin and moving that into the very high 30s, if not potentially beyond going forward.

First and foremost, let me start by saying, I hope you are all healthy and well, and our thoughts go out to all those who have been impacted by COVID-19. I also would like to say thank you to our employees, in particular, our front line mountaineers, who are on the road and in our facilities every day. As many of our services are considered essential, many of our colleagues have been ensuring our customers' needs are met as seamlessly as possible. 
Our mountaineers have shown selfless dedication and resilience in these challenging times. As we go through this morning's call, I will focus my remarks on a few key subjects. How we are responding and managing the business in light of COVID-19 pandemic. 
The new service and storage revenue opportunities we have seized as we respond in real-time to our customers' changing needs and the durability and strength of our core storage and data center businesses, which provide valuable recurring revenue during times such as these. 
First, we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation, which, as you are aware, continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Our top priority is to ensure the safety and security of our people, their families and our customers. As a global business, we have been assessing the situation and implementing extensive precautionary measures since first learning about the virus in January. We have been constant. First, in Asia, and now globally in striving to minimize the spread of the virus and its impacts on our people, the communities we operate in and our customers. 
We have been serving our customers, many of which are considered essential businesses in new and innovative ways as they navigate this pandemic. Now let me address the current situation, the impact on our business and what we are doing to mitigate that impact. 
As an example, we are reserving storage base for critical assets and anticipated inventory volumes, including supplies needed by health responders and food and drug retailers. We are also providing outflow storage -- overflow storage for businesses now stockpiling inventory due to service or supply chain disruptions. 
In addition, we are availing our customers of our digital and AI-based services to facilitate remote working on a range of activities, including distribution of mail from corporate mailrooms to providing a digital solution, allowing the processing of unemployment benefits remotely. 
The first quarter introduced unprecedented challenges and required us to closely examine our priorities and focus on what we could do beyond our normal course of business to remain strong, resilient and well positioned to support all of our stakeholders. 
Fortunately, Iron Mountain is considered an essential service in many locations and sectors where we operate. In our global records and information management business, we have been able to keep more than 96% of our facilities open at varying levels of operations, all with heightened safety and cleaning procedures in place. 
We are seeing a need for new and more creative solutions in our digital solutions and global data center businesses. To help our customers respond to COVID-19, we are providing storage and distribution of PPE and other critical health care supplies and are offering innovative solutions around document scanning and application of artificial intelligence through our InSight platform, which can help enable our customers' home-based workforces. 
Whilst there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recovery from an economic perspective, I am confident we will get through this and come out an even stronger company. We are already seeing customers seek out new services that have resulted in revenue. So whilst it's possible that customers may not use our services the same way they did historically, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate new revenue streams. 
Our customer-facing teams have been closely listening to customers, engaging differently in solving problems that didn't even exist a few short months ago. We are deepening relationships with our customers and further differentiating Iron Mountain from our peers, many of which do not have our level of financial strength, breadth of digital and physical offerings and flexibility. We believe this positions Iron Mountain better for the longer term. 
Liquidity remains the top priority from a financial perspective, and we are operating from a strong liquidity and cash position. Barry will provide more detail on the specific actions we are taking that at a high level, we are prioritizing cash generation, and we have taken action to reduce operating expenses in discretionary capital expenditures, including M&A. 
As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.2 billion in liquidity between cash on hand and availability on our revolving credit facility. This strong balance sheet should provide us with sufficient runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. 
As you would expect, in a crisis such as this, our service levels have experienced significant declines in numerous geographies as many customers have instituted mandatory work from home policies or ban visits to their offices and facilities from external parties. The timing and magnitude of decline in service activity has varied by market and by product line. Whilst we are a global company with operations in over 50 markets, our exposure to countries that saw a peak in Q1, such as China, is limited, so we did not see a significant service activity decline until mid-March for the majority of our business. 
In our records management and secure shred businesses, which account for approximately 75% of our service revenue. Service activity has declined by 40% to 50% during the times when the respective markets have had restrictions in place as compared to the prior year. As restrictions are lifted, we expect this service activity to gradually pick back up. For instance, in our Chinese markets, we are seeing current service activity at 60% to 70% of normal levels, which has improved from only approximately 20% at the peak of the virus spread in China. While service generally contributes only about 20% of our profit, given the size of the decline as well as some of the fixed costs in the business, the impact is significant. 
As we have encountered this slowdown, we have made tough decisions that impact our fellow Iron Mountain colleagues. In an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity, we have either furloughed, reduced hours or utilized other temporary reduction measures for approximately 1/3 of our global workforce. 
We have also managed costs by putting on hold our -- on recruiting activity and terminating most of our temporary and contract workers in our global records and information management business. Decisions that impact our employees are never taken lightly, and we have set up numerous resources to support impacted employees during this unprecedented time. 
This includes, but is not limited to, continue to provide benefits in sponsoring the employee portion of health care for impacted employees, helping our employees utilize their respective government programs available to those individuals unemployed or furloughed, assisting our colleagues with outplacement support and actively assisting employees through our employee funded relief fund. At the same time, our core storage business remains durable, and we continue to benefit from our deep and long-lasting customer relationships. Whilst we have seen a slowdown in the new boxes that we have been able to inbound, the majority of our storage revenue is from existing boxes that were inbounded in prior months and years, and we continue to earn revenue on that inventory. 
However, the impact of the -- the impact the crisis will have on our future organic storage rental revenue growth and volume remains unknown and is dependent on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, total organic storage revenue grew 3%, supported by strong benefits from revenue management. Global organic volume in Q1 was flat compared to Q4, driven primarily by growth in adjacent businesses and consumer of 8% and 5%, respectively, on a sequential basis. 
Organic global records management volume declined approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the fourth quarter. Due to the impact of COVID '19, we expect our volume of incoming boxes for the remaining of the year to be lower than we initially expected entering the year, but we'll continue to look for ways to mitigate the slowdown. As I mentioned before, we also remain in active dialogue with our customers about leveraging existing and customized Iron Mountain solutions to help them navigate this difficult situation. I want to briefly mention a few key examples. One of our digital services that has benefited our customers during this crisis is Image on Demand. This service provides safe, contactless, digital delivery, which enhances the chain of custody security and provides a quick 24-hour turnaround online delivery. 
This solution enables customers to be more effective by sharing information with those who need it, whilst ensuring the information security and privacy are maintained, which is even more necessary in today's remote environment. Another example is one where we are helping one of our customers, a national health care provider, which was struggling with a surge in the need for medical supplies and supply chain challenges. This particular customer needed to distribute critical PPE to 32,000 employees at 750 sites in 36 U.S. states and required a secure location to prep PPE kits without taking up valuable space that was being used to care for patients. In order to meet those critical needs, we provided nonrecords business storage and logistics support. We inbounded in stored pallets from multiple suppliers, prepared PPE kits made up of 12 to 15 items and distributed the kits to health care sites. 
This is only one example of how we have helped many of our health care and medical customers during these trying times. A third relevant example is a government labor department that needed to maintain critical processes, whilst enabling home-based workers to process high volumes of unemployment claim records as quickly as possible. 
The government agency leveraged our InSight Essentials platform, which enabled the government department to receive the scanned claims via our InSight application to more than 800 unemployment examiners. We will continue to store the hard copy records for them until they need to be securely destroyed. We are currently speaking to multiple U.S. states about similar solutions to address both elevated volume and unemployment and Medicare claims during this crisis as well as the need for remote working of the teams approving the claims.  
As you would expect, our global data center business has also been resilient as an unprecedented number of organizations are adjusting to remote working practices, which has driven a substantial increase in traffic and the need for additional bandwidth. Moreover, the current pandemic further underscores the vital and expanding role of multi-tenant data center play in an increasingly digital economy.  
COVID-19 is causing companies to evaluate and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, especially as it relates to outsourcing their IT infrastructure and fortifying their remote capabilities. In fact, industry experts believe that COVID-19 is serving to fast track trends that were already evident in the data center industry, which bodes well for this portion of our business moving forward.  
Looking at recent performance, our global data center business had a strong Q1 with organic revenue growth of almost 10%. We signed 6.4 megawatts of new and expansion leases, and our pipeline remains robust. This leasing consisted of a 3-megawatt booking with a new logo, a leading hyperscale enterprise software provider, which also includes a contractually committed reservation for an additional 2 megawatts and our expanded campus in Phoenix. We also continued to maintain good momentum with our enterprise customers.  
Commercially, despite an unprecedented macro backdrop, our data center team continues to receive significant engagement and RFPs for both hyperscale, corporate and government requirements. The team has quickly adjusted to the new normal of remote working and has been innovative and continue to meet our current and prospective customer needs, including hosting virtual data center tours to support demand and the increased need for capacity.  
We are committed to ensuring uptime and resiliency for our data center customers and we are ready with capacity and our staff to handle support, upgrades and new installations, if additional bandwidth is needed, whilst remote workforces are supported.  
One area that we continue to monitor closely is the impact on the pace of construction of our -- for our data centers currently under development. While it's not significant, we do see modest delays across many of our projects, which is also happening across the industry. Given our relatively high capacity utilization of almost 90%, should delays extend or increase in length, this could create a tight supply situation. 
As I said, we are keeping a close eye on this, and are in regular contact with all of our vendors and construction partners. And at this moment, we do not foresee it will materially impact our anticipated bookings and delivery for this year.  
As we look ahead, these are truly unprecedented times, and the path to recovery is clouded by uncertainty and will likely be choppy. It is very difficult to predict how long this current environment will go on. And what the new normal will look like on the other side. It will undoubtedly be lasting changes to how we work and how our customers will conduct business.  
Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe a conservative approach is warranted. 
As you can see from our Q1 results, Project Summit is off to a strong start. Now that our project teams are up and running and given the speed, with which we implemented wave 1, we have identified additional opportunities to accelerate strategies to streamline our business and operations. We have pulled forward a number of initiatives that were planned for waves 2 and 3 of Project Summit and expect to see those benefits materialize at a faster pace in 2020. In addition to finding new ways to work differently with our customers as we roll out Project Summit, COVID-19 has uncovered ways for us to support our customers as they adjust to remote work -- to a remote working environment. Our customers' increased need for digital delivery has allowed us to reassess our service delivery model.  
Our R&D and growth initiatives have well positioned us with services like Image on Demand to address customers' changing needs as they adapt to new ways of working. Leveraging these new technology capabilities enables us to adjust our service delivery model and more efficiently utilize our fleet, labor and real estate. 
The most impactful changes to our service delivery model revolve around new service level agreements, or SLAs. These new agreements will allow us to better align our external customer SLAs with our internal record center SLAs as well as leverage more effective use of digital delivery to serve our customers.  
In addition, we will also utilize third-party logistics providers more extensively than we have historically for our pickups and delivery. We have proactively communicated with our customers in some of our largest markets regarding these changes and have begun implementing the SLA changes, which has resulted in some additional reduction in force across the business. 
This broadened scope of Project Summit should result in even higher levels of adjusted EBITDA benefit and associated charges than we initially expected. Project Summit is now expected to generate $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting 2021. This represents a meaningful increase from the prior expectation of $200 million. The total program is expected to cost approximately $450 million, up from our prior expectation of $240 million.  
In closing, this additional benefit from Project Summit should only further propel the underlying strength of our business once we emerge from COVID -- from the COVID-19 situation. Our strong performance in Q1, together with the additional promise from an expanded Project Summit, makes us confident that we will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as an even stronger company than envisioned before. 
We continue to demonstrate resilience and determination and show all of our customers and communities that they can count on us in their time of need and that Iron Mountain really is iron. 
I want to thank all of my fellow mountaineers and their families, again, for their perseverance in these difficult times, and I pray for their safety. I hope all of you and your loved ones are remaining safe and well.  
With that, I turn the call over to you, Barry."

I've been truly impressed by the team's commitment, hard work and perseverance during these challenging times.  
As Bill noted, we are confident that we will emerge from this period a stronger company, driven by our durable business model and the strength of our balance sheet. I will briefly touch on our first quarter performance before discussing our approach to addressing the pandemic.  
In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations. And through the first 9 weeks of the quarter, we were on track to exceed our targets even more substantially. Though, by mid-March, our service activity began to experience declines compared to plan as more customers instituted mandatory work from home policies and restricted visits to their facilities. Despite this, we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. 
Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 1.4% on a reported basis, and 3.2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1% in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by organic storage rental revenue growth of 3%, which reflected our successful execution of revenue management. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.9% for the first quarter to $363 million, despite the negative impact from lower paper prices and foreign exchange rates.  
On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA grew almost 14%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points year-over-year to 34%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27, up significantly from $0.17 in the first quarter 2019. 
AFFO grew 20% year-over-year to $231 million, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth. This represents a new quarterly high for Iron Mountain, reflecting our team's focus on driving cash generation and increasing levels of AFFO over time. 
Turning to segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 60 basis points for the quarter, reflecting volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management, partially offset by lower year-over-year paper prices.  
Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% represents an increase of 230 basis points, driven by revenue management, benefits from Project Summit, and continuous improvement initiatives. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.9%, driven by strong leasing and low churn of 50 basis points. Data centers EBITDA margin of 45.9% represents an increase of 360 basis points, consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion. 
As a reminder, as we move through the balance of the year, on a reported basis, the 2019 data center results have some onetime benefits that we called out last year, which make the year-over-year comparisons less meaningful.  
Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track and have accelerated and expanded initiatives in certain areas in response to COVID-19. In the first quarter, we recognized $41 million of restructuring charges to implement the remainder of the first wave plus components of wave 2, which contributed to the first quarter benefit of $25 million. 
With the increased size and scope of the program, we now expect to realize the full $375 million of benefit related to Project Summit, exiting 2021, with all actions complete in the associated $450 million of charges incurred by the end of 2021. In 2020, we now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit activities of $150 million compared with our prior expectation of the $80 million in restructuring charges of $240 million, up from $130 million, previously. 
Now I would like to provide an update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business and what actions we are taking to ensure we are well positioned.  
Given the macro uncertainty, we want to be as transparent as possible to help investors understand what we are seeing. To that end, I'm going to provide insights that are more granular than we typically provide. But first, I want to put into perspective how much of our storage revenue is generated by what is already on the shelf at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, our core storage business accounts for nearly 2/3 of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability. In a typical year, new volume accounts for less than 3% of our annual storage revenue. In other words, nearly all of our annual storage revenue comes from boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. As Bill mentioned, in markets where our ability to service customer facilities is limited, we have naturally seen a decline in the number of boxes that we are able to pick up. Partially as a result of this, we currently expect a net decline in cube volume in 2020, but of course, that is subject to change based on the duration of the pandemic. As you would expect, the impact this has on storage revenue is much more muted than the impact it has on our service activity levels.  
Turning to our service business, which was about 35% of our 2019 revenue. In April, we saw activity declined approximately 40% overall on the service business. As investors would expect, the impact has not been uniform across our service lines, so let's take a look at how this has trended across our business.  
I will use North America as an example, as it is both our largest market and fairly representative of the activity levels we have seen in other markets with similar closures and restrictions. Records management in North America for the month of April had a 58% year-over-year reduction in new boxes inbounded and a 49% year-over-year reduction in retrievals and refiles. Data management activity in April declined less, approximately 30%. Digital solutions has seen a slowdown in activity compared to the first quarter, though April activity levels were flat year-over-year.  
In our shred business, activity declined approximately 27% in April, which has led to a corresponding decline in our paper tonnage. While we have seen an encouraging rebound in the market for paper prices recently, our average realized price in the first quarter was 44% lower than the prior year, which was a $10 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA. 
Consistent with the broader industry trends, we saw a sequential improvement in paper price of about 2.5% in the first quarter, and the trend has continued to improve. As investors will recall, in the past, we have mentioned that a $10 per tonne change in paper price represents an approximate $6 million EBITDA impact. Of course, this is clearly influenced by volume, so the EBITDA impact of paper price movement will change proportionately with the change in paper volume.  
Now let me make a couple of comments on 2 of our smaller businesses. The Fine Arts industry has experienced a significant slowdown during the pandemic. And given the nonessential nature of the business, we have temporarily closed all of our Fine Arts facilities. With a prudent view as to the intermediate term impact, we recorded a $23 million noncash impairment charge on the goodwill associated with that reporting unit. The consumer storage business through our partnership with MakeSpace has seen an increase in demand. This led to over 5% growth in storage volume in the first quarter, and we have continued to see strong demand in April.  
Given the nature of the service level decline I just discussed, we have taken actions which we expect to be temporary and are in addition to the actions we had underway with Project Summit. These actions include furloughs, reduced work hours, a pause in hiring, reductions in certain expenses like travel and lower variable compensation. With these adjustments, we anticipate we will have removed in excess of $350 million on an annualized basis as compared to our prior plans. You will see these reductions materialize in cost of sales within our service business as well as in our SG&A expenses. These actions are designed to help align our costs and revenues as we navigate the uncertain environment. Therefore, we expect these costs to come back as revenue recovers.  
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the first quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement, up 8 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables days and days sales outstanding. I view the team's performance as particularly strong, given the COVID-19 backdrop. 
We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term. We ended the quarter with $153 million of cash, and together with the availability under our revolving credit facility, we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. At this point in early May, our liquidity remains unchanged at that level, which we believe provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment.  
For context, this liquidity represents over 3x the 2019 full year adjusted EBITDA of our service business. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share earlier this week to be paid in early July. As the economy recovers in 2022 and 2023 and with a sustainable dividend at this level, we would expect our payout ratio to glide toward the mid-60s to low 70s as a percent of AFFO.  
As we noted in our press release, we are no longer providing guidance for 2020 in light of the unknown severity and duration of the impact of the crisis on our markets and customers. However, we do want to help you understand how we are currently planning for the remainder of 2020.  
Let me start with the impact of the much stronger U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we currently expect a full year impact on our revenue of about $100 million versus last year. At the time of our last call, FX rates implied an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $5 million. Though with a stronger dollar, current FX rates translate into a full year adjusted EBITDA headwind of $35 million versus last year.  
Turning to activity levels. We are expecting April to be representative of the trends we experienced for the remainder of the second quarter, which we expect to be the weakest quarter in 2020 for comparative revenue and adjusted EBITDA change. Although recent trends suggest this may prove to be conservative as more and more of our customers around the world are gradually opening back up, and we are seeing other positive indicators. 
I will note, we are maintaining flexibility to rebound quickly if business conditions improve faster than expected. And on the other hand, if conditions worsen, we have already identified additional options that can be executed quickly as needed. At this point, we anticipate delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin flat to slightly up compared to last year, reflecting our solid first quarter performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions. This will be partially offset by our conservative posture as to service revenues and fixed cost deleverage.  
Given the current environment, we have also quickly taken actions to preserve capital. We reduced capital investments, both for capital expenditures and M&A by a net total of $110 million relative to our original guidance for 2020. This is made up of approximately $110 million of reduced CapEx and $75 million of reduced investment in M&A and acquisitions of customer relationships. This net total also reflects an increased investment of $75 million to support the construction of our Frankfurt data center. Additional detail can be seen in the supplemental and is highlighted on Slide 14 of our presentation. We continue to expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. 
As we look at the market for industrial assets, we continue to see attractive valuations, and our pipeline has actually increased over the last couple of months. As investors would expect, we have run multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for revenue, margins, the duration of the crisis and the speed of recovery. Included in these scenarios are some extreme stress test models, which we develop to understand the possible impact if conditions worsened materially and persisted for an extended period of time. One of the stress test we ran was based on service activity being down about 65% year-on-year and persisting at that level through 2021. Even in that scenario, we do not foresee an issue with liquidity or leverage through 2021. I'll also note the severity and duration of our stress tests are much more extreme than both what we have seen thus far and what current trends and macro forecasts indicate we will likely experience. Even still, we would have significant cushion in terms of both liquidity and leverage.  
In closing, we are confident in the durability of our storage business and believe the magnitude of impact on our service business, combined with the actions we have taken, leave us in a strong financial position. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our second quarter earnings call. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy.  
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So this is United States, Canada, Ireland, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand is we said, we're taking that to 5 business days. So once a week, we will pick up or deliver physical boxes.

First and foremost, let me start by saying, I hope you are all healthy and well, and our thoughts go out to all those who have been impacted by COVID-19. I also would like to say thank you to our employees, in particular, our front line mountaineers, who are on the road and in our facilities every day. As many of our services are considered essential, many of our colleagues have been ensuring our customers' needs are met as seamlessly as possible. 
Our mountaineers have shown selfless dedication and resilience in these challenging times. As we go through this morning's call, I will focus my remarks on a few key subjects. How we are responding and managing the business in light of COVID-19 pandemic. 
The new service and storage revenue opportunities we have seized as we respond in real-time to our customers' changing needs and the durability and strength of our core storage and data center businesses, which provide valuable recurring revenue during times such as these. 
First, we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation, which, as you are aware, continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Our top priority is to ensure the safety and security of our people, their families and our customers. As a global business, we have been assessing the situation and implementing extensive precautionary measures since first learning about the virus in January. We have been constant. First, in Asia, and now globally in striving to minimize the spread of the virus and its impacts on our people, the communities we operate in and our customers. 
We have been serving our customers, many of which are considered essential businesses in new and innovative ways as they navigate this pandemic. Now let me address the current situation, the impact on our business and what we are doing to mitigate that impact. 
As an example, we are reserving storage base for critical assets and anticipated inventory volumes, including supplies needed by health responders and food and drug retailers. We are also providing outflow storage -- overflow storage for businesses now stockpiling inventory due to service or supply chain disruptions. 
In addition, we are availing our customers of our digital and AI-based services to facilitate remote working on a range of activities, including distribution of mail from corporate mailrooms to providing a digital solution, allowing the processing of unemployment benefits remotely. 
The first quarter introduced unprecedented challenges and required us to closely examine our priorities and focus on what we could do beyond our normal course of business to remain strong, resilient and well positioned to support all of our stakeholders. 
Fortunately, Iron Mountain is considered an essential service in many locations and sectors where we operate. In our global records and information management business, we have been able to keep more than 96% of our facilities open at varying levels of operations, all with heightened safety and cleaning procedures in place. 
We are seeing a need for new and more creative solutions in our digital solutions and global data center businesses. To help our customers respond to COVID-19, we are providing storage and distribution of PPE and other critical health care supplies and are offering innovative solutions around document scanning and application of artificial intelligence through our InSight platform, which can help enable our customers' home-based workforces. 
Whilst there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recovery from an economic perspective, I am confident we will get through this and come out an even stronger company. We are already seeing customers seek out new services that have resulted in revenue. So whilst it's possible that customers may not use our services the same way they did historically, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate new revenue streams. 
Our customer-facing teams have been closely listening to customers, engaging differently in solving problems that didn't even exist a few short months ago. We are deepening relationships with our customers and further differentiating Iron Mountain from our peers, many of which do not have our level of financial strength, breadth of digital and physical offerings and flexibility. We believe this positions Iron Mountain better for the longer term. 
Liquidity remains the top priority from a financial perspective, and we are operating from a strong liquidity and cash position. Barry will provide more detail on the specific actions we are taking that at a high level, we are prioritizing cash generation, and we have taken action to reduce operating expenses in discretionary capital expenditures, including M&A. 
As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.2 billion in liquidity between cash on hand and availability on our revolving credit facility. This strong balance sheet should provide us with sufficient runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. 
As you would expect, in a crisis such as this, our service levels have experienced significant declines in numerous geographies as many customers have instituted mandatory work from home policies or ban visits to their offices and facilities from external parties. The timing and magnitude of decline in service activity has varied by market and by product line. Whilst we are a global company with operations in over 50 markets, our exposure to countries that saw a peak in Q1, such as China, is limited, so we did not see a significant service activity decline until mid-March for the majority of our business. 
In our records management and secure shred businesses, which account for approximately 75% of our service revenue. Service activity has declined by 40% to 50% during the times when the respective markets have had restrictions in place as compared to the prior year. As restrictions are lifted, we expect this service activity to gradually pick back up. For instance, in our Chinese markets, we are seeing current service activity at 60% to 70% of normal levels, which has improved from only approximately 20% at the peak of the virus spread in China. While service generally contributes only about 20% of our profit, given the size of the decline as well as some of the fixed costs in the business, the impact is significant. 
As we have encountered this slowdown, we have made tough decisions that impact our fellow Iron Mountain colleagues. In an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity, we have either furloughed, reduced hours or utilized other temporary reduction measures for approximately 1/3 of our global workforce. 
We have also managed costs by putting on hold our -- on recruiting activity and terminating most of our temporary and contract workers in our global records and information management business. Decisions that impact our employees are never taken lightly, and we have set up numerous resources to support impacted employees during this unprecedented time. 
This includes, but is not limited to, continue to provide benefits in sponsoring the employee portion of health care for impacted employees, helping our employees utilize their respective government programs available to those individuals unemployed or furloughed, assisting our colleagues with outplacement support and actively assisting employees through our employee funded relief fund. At the same time, our core storage business remains durable, and we continue to benefit from our deep and long-lasting customer relationships. Whilst we have seen a slowdown in the new boxes that we have been able to inbound, the majority of our storage revenue is from existing boxes that were inbounded in prior months and years, and we continue to earn revenue on that inventory. 
However, the impact of the -- the impact the crisis will have on our future organic storage rental revenue growth and volume remains unknown and is dependent on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, total organic storage revenue grew 3%, supported by strong benefits from revenue management. Global organic volume in Q1 was flat compared to Q4, driven primarily by growth in adjacent businesses and consumer of 8% and 5%, respectively, on a sequential basis. 
Organic global records management volume declined approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the fourth quarter. Due to the impact of COVID '19, we expect our volume of incoming boxes for the remaining of the year to be lower than we initially expected entering the year, but we'll continue to look for ways to mitigate the slowdown. As I mentioned before, we also remain in active dialogue with our customers about leveraging existing and customized Iron Mountain solutions to help them navigate this difficult situation. I want to briefly mention a few key examples. One of our digital services that has benefited our customers during this crisis is Image on Demand. This service provides safe, contactless, digital delivery, which enhances the chain of custody security and provides a quick 24-hour turnaround online delivery. 
This solution enables customers to be more effective by sharing information with those who need it, whilst ensuring the information security and privacy are maintained, which is even more necessary in today's remote environment. Another example is one where we are helping one of our customers, a national health care provider, which was struggling with a surge in the need for medical supplies and supply chain challenges. This particular customer needed to distribute critical PPE to 32,000 employees at 750 sites in 36 U.S. states and required a secure location to prep PPE kits without taking up valuable space that was being used to care for patients. In order to meet those critical needs, we provided nonrecords business storage and logistics support. We inbounded in stored pallets from multiple suppliers, prepared PPE kits made up of 12 to 15 items and distributed the kits to health care sites. 
This is only one example of how we have helped many of our health care and medical customers during these trying times. A third relevant example is a government labor department that needed to maintain critical processes, whilst enabling home-based workers to process high volumes of unemployment claim records as quickly as possible. 
The government agency leveraged our InSight Essentials platform, which enabled the government department to receive the scanned claims via our InSight application to more than 800 unemployment examiners. We will continue to store the hard copy records for them until they need to be securely destroyed. We are currently speaking to multiple U.S. states about similar solutions to address both elevated volume and unemployment and Medicare claims during this crisis as well as the need for remote working of the teams approving the claims.  
As you would expect, our global data center business has also been resilient as an unprecedented number of organizations are adjusting to remote working practices, which has driven a substantial increase in traffic and the need for additional bandwidth. Moreover, the current pandemic further underscores the vital and expanding role of multi-tenant data center play in an increasingly digital economy.  
COVID-19 is causing companies to evaluate and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, especially as it relates to outsourcing their IT infrastructure and fortifying their remote capabilities. In fact, industry experts believe that COVID-19 is serving to fast track trends that were already evident in the data center industry, which bodes well for this portion of our business moving forward.  
Looking at recent performance, our global data center business had a strong Q1 with organic revenue growth of almost 10%. We signed 6.4 megawatts of new and expansion leases, and our pipeline remains robust. This leasing consisted of a 3-megawatt booking with a new logo, a leading hyperscale enterprise software provider, which also includes a contractually committed reservation for an additional 2 megawatts and our expanded campus in Phoenix. We also continued to maintain good momentum with our enterprise customers.  
Commercially, despite an unprecedented macro backdrop, our data center team continues to receive significant engagement and RFPs for both hyperscale, corporate and government requirements. The team has quickly adjusted to the new normal of remote working and has been innovative and continue to meet our current and prospective customer needs, including hosting virtual data center tours to support demand and the increased need for capacity.  
We are committed to ensuring uptime and resiliency for our data center customers and we are ready with capacity and our staff to handle support, upgrades and new installations, if additional bandwidth is needed, whilst remote workforces are supported.  
One area that we continue to monitor closely is the impact on the pace of construction of our -- for our data centers currently under development. While it's not significant, we do see modest delays across many of our projects, which is also happening across the industry. Given our relatively high capacity utilization of almost 90%, should delays extend or increase in length, this could create a tight supply situation. 
As I said, we are keeping a close eye on this, and are in regular contact with all of our vendors and construction partners. And at this moment, we do not foresee it will materially impact our anticipated bookings and delivery for this year.  
As we look ahead, these are truly unprecedented times, and the path to recovery is clouded by uncertainty and will likely be choppy. It is very difficult to predict how long this current environment will go on. And what the new normal will look like on the other side. It will undoubtedly be lasting changes to how we work and how our customers will conduct business.  
Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe a conservative approach is warranted. 
As you can see from our Q1 results, Project Summit is off to a strong start. Now that our project teams are up and running and given the speed, with which we implemented wave 1, we have identified additional opportunities to accelerate strategies to streamline our business and operations. We have pulled forward a number of initiatives that were planned for waves 2 and 3 of Project Summit and expect to see those benefits materialize at a faster pace in 2020. In addition to finding new ways to work differently with our customers as we roll out Project Summit, COVID-19 has uncovered ways for us to support our customers as they adjust to remote work -- to a remote working environment. Our customers' increased need for digital delivery has allowed us to reassess our service delivery model.  
Our R&D and growth initiatives have well positioned us with services like Image on Demand to address customers' changing needs as they adapt to new ways of working. Leveraging these new technology capabilities enables us to adjust our service delivery model and more efficiently utilize our fleet, labor and real estate. 
The most impactful changes to our service delivery model revolve around new service level agreements, or SLAs. These new agreements will allow us to better align our external customer SLAs with our internal record center SLAs as well as leverage more effective use of digital delivery to serve our customers.  
In addition, we will also utilize third-party logistics providers more extensively than we have historically for our pickups and delivery. We have proactively communicated with our customers in some of our largest markets regarding these changes and have begun implementing the SLA changes, which has resulted in some additional reduction in force across the business. 
This broadened scope of Project Summit should result in even higher levels of adjusted EBITDA benefit and associated charges than we initially expected. Project Summit is now expected to generate $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting 2021. This represents a meaningful increase from the prior expectation of $200 million. The total program is expected to cost approximately $450 million, up from our prior expectation of $240 million.  
In closing, this additional benefit from Project Summit should only further propel the underlying strength of our business once we emerge from COVID -- from the COVID-19 situation. Our strong performance in Q1, together with the additional promise from an expanded Project Summit, makes us confident that we will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as an even stronger company than envisioned before. 
We continue to demonstrate resilience and determination and show all of our customers and communities that they can count on us in their time of need and that Iron Mountain really is iron. 
I want to thank all of my fellow mountaineers and their families, again, for their perseverance in these difficult times, and I pray for their safety. I hope all of you and your loved ones are remaining safe and well.  
With that, I turn the call over to you, Barry."

I hope you are all safe and healthy. I would like to say thank you to our Iron Mountain team. I've been truly impressed by the team's commitment, hard work and perseverance during these challenging times.  
As Bill noted, we are confident that we will emerge from this period a stronger company, driven by our durable business model and the strength of our balance sheet. I will briefly touch on our first quarter performance before discussing our approach to addressing the pandemic.  
In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations. And through the first 9 weeks of the quarter, we were on track to exceed our targets even more substantially. Though, by mid-March, our service activity began to experience declines compared to plan as more customers instituted mandatory work from home policies and restricted visits to their facilities. Despite this, we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. 
Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 1.4% on a reported basis, and 3.2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1% in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by organic storage rental revenue growth of 3%, which reflected our successful execution of revenue management. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.9% for the first quarter to $363 million, despite the negative impact from lower paper prices and foreign exchange rates.  
On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA grew almost 14%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points year-over-year to 34%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27, up significantly from $0.17 in the first quarter 2019. 
AFFO grew 20% year-over-year to $231 million, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth. This represents a new quarterly high for Iron Mountain, reflecting our team's focus on driving cash generation and increasing levels of AFFO over time. 
Turning to segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 60 basis points for the quarter, reflecting volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management, partially offset by lower year-over-year paper prices.  
Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% represents an increase of 230 basis points, driven by revenue management, benefits from Project Summit, and continuous improvement initiatives. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.9%, driven by strong leasing and low churn of 50 basis points. Data centers EBITDA margin of 45.9% represents an increase of 360 basis points, consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion. 
As a reminder, as we move through the balance of the year, on a reported basis, the 2019 data center results have some onetime benefits that we called out last year, which make the year-over-year comparisons less meaningful.  
Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track and have accelerated and expanded initiatives in certain areas in response to COVID-19. In the first quarter, we recognized $41 million of restructuring charges to implement the remainder of the first wave plus components of wave 2, which contributed to the first quarter benefit of $25 million. 
With the increased size and scope of the program, we now expect to realize the full $375 million of benefit related to Project Summit, exiting 2021, with all actions complete in the associated $450 million of charges incurred by the end of 2021. In 2020, we now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit activities of $150 million compared with our prior expectation of the $80 million in restructuring charges of $240 million, up from $130 million, previously. 
Now I would like to provide an update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business and what actions we are taking to ensure we are well positioned.  
Given the macro uncertainty, we want to be as transparent as possible to help investors understand what we are seeing. To that end, I'm going to provide insights that are more granular than we typically provide. But first, I want to put into perspective how much of our storage revenue is generated by what is already on the shelf at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, our core storage business accounts for nearly 2/3 of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability. In a typical year, new volume accounts for less than 3% of our annual storage revenue. In other words, nearly all of our annual storage revenue comes from boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. As Bill mentioned, in markets where our ability to service customer facilities is limited, we have naturally seen a decline in the number of boxes that we are able to pick up. Partially as a result of this, we currently expect a net decline in cube volume in 2020, but of course, that is subject to change based on the duration of the pandemic. As you would expect, the impact this has on storage revenue is much more muted than the impact it has on our service activity levels.  
Turning to our service business, which was about 35% of our 2019 revenue. In April, we saw activity declined approximately 40% overall on the service business. As investors would expect, the impact has not been uniform across our service lines, so let's take a look at how this has trended across our business.  
I will use North America as an example, as it is both our largest market and fairly representative of the activity levels we have seen in other markets with similar closures and restrictions. Records management in North America for the month of April had a 58% year-over-year reduction in new boxes inbounded and a 49% year-over-year reduction in retrievals and refiles. Data management activity in April declined less, approximately 30%. Digital solutions has seen a slowdown in activity compared to the first quarter, though April activity levels were flat year-over-year.  
In our shred business, activity declined approximately 27% in April, which has led to a corresponding decline in our paper tonnage. While we have seen an encouraging rebound in the market for paper prices recently, our average realized price in the first quarter was 44% lower than the prior year, which was a $10 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA. 
Consistent with the broader industry trends, we saw a sequential improvement in paper price of about 2.5% in the first quarter, and the trend has continued to improve. As investors will recall, in the past, we have mentioned that a $10 per tonne change in paper price represents an approximate $6 million EBITDA impact. Of course, this is clearly influenced by volume, so the EBITDA impact of paper price movement will change proportionately with the change in paper volume.  
Now let me make a couple of comments on 2 of our smaller businesses. The Fine Arts industry has experienced a significant slowdown during the pandemic. And given the nonessential nature of the business, we have temporarily closed all of our Fine Arts facilities. With a prudent view as to the intermediate term impact, we recorded a $23 million noncash impairment charge on the goodwill associated with that reporting unit. The consumer storage business through our partnership with MakeSpace has seen an increase in demand. This led to over 5% growth in storage volume in the first quarter, and we have continued to see strong demand in April.  
Given the nature of the service level decline I just discussed, we have taken actions which we expect to be temporary and are in addition to the actions we had underway with Project Summit. These actions include furloughs, reduced work hours, a pause in hiring, reductions in certain expenses like travel and lower variable compensation. With these adjustments, we anticipate we will have removed in excess of $350 million on an annualized basis as compared to our prior plans. You will see these reductions materialize in cost of sales within our service business as well as in our SG&A expenses. These actions are designed to help align our costs and revenues as we navigate the uncertain environment. Therefore, we expect these costs to come back as revenue recovers.  
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the first quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement, up 8 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables days and days sales outstanding. I view the team's performance as particularly strong, given the COVID-19 backdrop. 
We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term. We ended the quarter with $153 million of cash, and together with the availability under our revolving credit facility, we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. At this point in early May, our liquidity remains unchanged at that level, which we believe provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment.  
For context, this liquidity represents over 3x the 2019 full year adjusted EBITDA of our service business. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share earlier this week to be paid in early July. As the economy recovers in 2022 and 2023 and with a sustainable dividend at this level, we would expect our payout ratio to glide toward the mid-60s to low 70s as a percent of AFFO.  
As we noted in our press release, we are no longer providing guidance for 2020 in light of the unknown severity and duration of the impact of the crisis on our markets and customers. However, we do want to help you understand how we are currently planning for the remainder of 2020.  
Let me start with the impact of the much stronger U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we currently expect a full year impact on our revenue of about $100 million versus last year. At the time of our last call, FX rates implied an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $5 million. Though with a stronger dollar, current FX rates translate into a full year adjusted EBITDA headwind of $35 million versus last year.  
Turning to activity levels. We are expecting April to be representative of the trends we experienced for the remainder of the second quarter, which we expect to be the weakest quarter in 2020 for comparative revenue and adjusted EBITDA change. Although recent trends suggest this may prove to be conservative as more and more of our customers around the world are gradually opening back up, and we are seeing other positive indicators. 
I will note, we are maintaining flexibility to rebound quickly if business conditions improve faster than expected. And on the other hand, if conditions worsen, we have already identified additional options that can be executed quickly as needed. At this point, we anticipate delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin flat to slightly up compared to last year, reflecting our solid first quarter performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions. This will be partially offset by our conservative posture as to service revenues and fixed cost deleverage.  
Given the current environment, we have also quickly taken actions to preserve capital. We reduced capital investments, both for capital expenditures and M&A by a net total of $110 million relative to our original guidance for 2020. This is made up of approximately $110 million of reduced CapEx and $75 million of reduced investment in M&A and acquisitions of customer relationships. This net total also reflects an increased investment of $75 million to support the construction of our Frankfurt data center. Additional detail can be seen in the supplemental and is highlighted on Slide 14 of our presentation. We continue to expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. 
As we look at the market for industrial assets, we continue to see attractive valuations, and our pipeline has actually increased over the last couple of months. As investors would expect, we have run multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for revenue, margins, the duration of the crisis and the speed of recovery. Included in these scenarios are some extreme stress test models, which we develop to understand the possible impact if conditions worsened materially and persisted for an extended period of time. One of the stress test we ran was based on service activity being down about 65% year-on-year and persisting at that level through 2021. Even in that scenario, we do not foresee an issue with liquidity or leverage through 2021. I'll also note the severity and duration of our stress tests are much more extreme than both what we have seen thus far and what current trends and macro forecasts indicate we will likely experience. Even still, we would have significant cushion in terms of both liquidity and leverage.  
In closing, we are confident in the durability of our storage business and believe the magnitude of impact on our service business, combined with the actions we have taken, leave us in a strong financial position. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our second quarter earnings call. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy.

Let me start by saying, I hope you're all continued to stay safe and healthy in these trying times. Before we get into a discussion of our second quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to touch on 2 topics that are top of mind for many of us in the current environment. 
First, the killings of George Floyd and [ countless ] others have left me and my colleagues upset, angered and heartbroken. I want to reiterate that racism, discrimination and hate have no place at Iron Mountain. Our commitment and stated as one of our core 5 values for many years to equality, inclusivity and diversity is part of our belief that our people are our greatest assets. Given this fact, we must continually attract, listen to and develop a broad talent pool reflecting our global demographics in order to deliver to our customers and protect our future. These tragic events have sparked difficult but important self reflection and conversations within our organization about how well we are living up to our stated value and to commit ourselves to do much better. It is up to us to work together, educate ourselves and encourage open dialogue to promote proactive measures to help eliminate incorrect biases and spread awareness, not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because we will only be successful in serving our customers if we attract and retain the best talent. 
Having the best talent can only happen if we are recruiting and developing people from diverse backgrounds across the broader demographics we operate in. We remain strongly committed toward taking decisive and strategic action to create a truly inclusive Iron Mountain. We're committed to listening, learning and taking the necessary actions to support long-term positive change for the black community specifically and people from all backgrounds in general. Whilst we cannot change the past, we had an opportunity as an organization and has individuals to positively impact the future and help fix the racial inequality prevalent in our society. 
Now I'd like to update you on the impact we are seeing with respect to COVID-19. As you all know, the virus is unfortunately still spreading across the globe. My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been affected by the virus, including those who have fallen ill as well as their loved ones and their caregivers. As always, our top priority remains the healthy and safety of our mountaineers, their families and our customers. I want to acknowledge and thank the many mountaineers around the world who, despite extraordinary challenges, have kept their focus on ensuring that Iron Mountain continues to move forward during these uncertain times and doing so with a view towards safety. 
This has all brought home to me again last week during a visit I made to Northern New Jersey, so I could thank our frontline teams personally. One of our couriers relayed how he has been serving a large metro New York health system every day through the crisis and how thankful the customer is for our continued service. This particular customer went so far to send one of their doctors to our facility to assist in the protocols and training to protect our staff. For me, this is what it means to be in a true partnership with our customers. 
Whilst we continue to serve many customers during this crisis, as you would expect, our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to office closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. Fortunately, 100% of our records management facilities are now open and operating across the globe. However, many of our global customers continued to operate at significantly lower capacities due to existing restrictions depending on geography. As a result, global demand for many of our core service offerings declined during the quarter. 
Looking back, no one could have anticipated the magnitude of the impact from this pandemic on the global economy and our own business. However, our team moved quickly to assess the risks, understand the consequences and take decisive action to ensure the safety of our employees, customers and communities. As I mentioned, these various decisions have not been made lightly. And we are aware of their consequences, especially for our mountaineers that have been impacted by furloughs and other temporary and in some cases, permanent actions. 
We told you in May that approximately 1/3 of our global workforce has been impacted by these actions in an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity. Fortunately, we have been able to bring a number of our mountaineers back to work. So at this time, this number has decreased to approximately 20% of our global workforce. Furthermore, the mix has shifted over the past few months, so fewer of the impacted employees are on full furlough and a higher percentage are working reduced hours or using vacation or sick times. 
At this time, we have also reopened all our corporate offices with the exception of London, which we plan to open at the beginning of September. We are practicing strict protocols around social distancing and as such, the majority of our salaried workforce is continuing to work remotely. We should note, we have been strong -- we have seen strong productivity rates from -- with working from home. That being said, given some of the increased stresses of working remotely, we continue to monitor and care for our mountaineers' mental health and resiliency as part of our overall focus on wellness. 
Turning to our financial performance. Our continued navigation of this challenging and uncertain environment has delivered a second quarter performance that further demonstrates, improves the durability and resilience of our people and ultimately, our business model. I'll touch on a few highlights here. Q2 constant currency revenue declined $58 million or 5.6% year-over-year, driven entirely by a 21% decline in our service revenue. This was partly offset by strong Storage revenue growth, which increased 3.7%. The early benefits of Project Summit are evident, as we deliver constant currency adjusted EBITDA line -- in line with the year ago level despite the revenue decline, leading to a 200 basis point margin expansion. Barry will review the rest of the Q2 financials in more detail. 
Looking at our service business, we have seen improvements in activity levels across the various product lines since the end of April, as global economies are starting to reopen and customers are increasingly utilizing our core service offerings in many geographies. However, the pace of our recovery still remains uncertain. Whilst the revenue decline wasn't as steep as we expected when we last spoke in early May, we continue to see some risk around the second half depending upon what happens with the progression of the virus and possible additional restrictions on a country-by-country and state-by-state basis as they continue to fight specific localized outbreaks of the virus. 
Turning now to our core storage business. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, supported by strong revenue management contribution. Moreover, we saw cash collections improve, both in absolute terms year-on-year as well as by 2 days outstanding. This level of organic revenue growth underscores the durability and essential nature of our storage business and our ability to continue to generate substantial cash flow. 
Total organic volume declined 1.8 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this decrease was in records management volume, partly offset by a 2 million cubic foot increase in consumer and others. 
Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 3.9 million cubic feet compared to the first quarter. This [ should ] [indiscernible] based on the decline of incoming boxes in April and a decline of 45% for the quarter. 
We have been asked by many investors as to what we see happening to physical volume post-COVID. So let me take a step back and provide some further context on organic records management volume. We estimate that the impact from COVID in Q2 was somewhere between 4 million and 4.5 million cubic feet, net of a slowdown in permanent withdrawals. If we continue to normalize Q2 for similar levels of volume in Q1, combined with our expectation for a pickup in permanent withdrawals, volume would be flat to slightly up on a normalized basis. To get to a total physical volume impact, I will now factor in consumer performance. 
In the second quarter, we added 2 million cubic feet, analyzing this would imply we would be net positive 8 million cubic feet or approximately 1% volume growth on a base of total physical volume of more than 720 million cubic feet. However, Q2 is a seasonally highest point for consumer business, so this would be overly optimistic to assume for a full year. When we net all this out in a post-COVID world, we would expect physical storage volume growth to be roughly 0.5%, with volume from records management flat to slightly up with a small net positive growth coming from consumer. It should be noted that this is all before the contribution from our normal price increases, which generally add approximately 2% to 3% to the volume growth, yielding approximately 3% organic storage revenue growth from the physical side of the business. However, when we will see this reversion to post-COVID normalized business environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly not before the end -- before the second half of 2021. Despite the stress constraints from dealing with COVID's impact, we have not let up on our investments in innovation. Specifically in the quarter, we had many instances where we were able to serve our customers with a focus on delivering innovative solutions in order to help them navigate their challenges that have a room from COVID-19. 
For example, regarding the commercial impact, in April, pipeline of more traditional offerings was down 40% versus the same period last year due to COVID in the resulting lower economic activity. However, we recovered 1/3 of this loss through new solutions we recently launched that help address our customers' needs during this time. This is just one demonstration of the resiliency and dedication of our mountaineers as we expect many of these solutions to be additive to our top and bottom lines even after our base activities revolve. 
Turning now to our Global Data Center segment. This business continues to perform exceptionally well, delivering strong results in the second quarter. In June, we announced a 27-megawatt data center lease with a U.S.-based Fortune 100 customer in Frankfurt, Germany. This customer will occupy the entire Frankfurt facility, which should result in stabilization significantly sooner than we originally anticipated when we purchased the land last year. 
In addition, we signed a 3-megawatt data center lease with a Fortune Global 200 company in Singapore, another signal of strong momentum in that market. These bigger deals have been won alongside a series of smaller but significant agreements, including a number of new logos. We welcomed an online gaming platform, a state government and a global logistics supplier provider to the IMDC ecosystem in Q2. All of this has contributed to a strong performance in the first half of the year with nearly 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases signed against our initial guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts for the full year. Given this great success in the first half of the year, we now expect to be able to sign leases for a total of 45 to 50 megawatts this year or an additional 10-plus megawatts of leasing in the back half. I would like to congratulate the entire data center team for an exceptional first half performance. Thank you. 
Based on the strength of our pipeline, we will continue to prioritize investment in data center growth. We are actively building our capacity across our global footprint with new development projects started in Amsterdam, Singapore and Phoenix. In early July, we completed the first phase of 4 megawatts and our new building on our Northern Virginia Campus, and customers are already deploying. 
As I mentioned earlier, Project Summit is already paying dividends. No one could have predicted the depth or breadth of this pandemic when we first announced Project Summit in October 2019. Thankfully, the decisive actions we took early in the program allowed us to reconfigure our cost structure as well as realign our organization to be more nimble and customer centric. These changes enabled us to be more responsive in delivering new solutions to our customers' specific needs during the crisis as well as matching our costs to a changing demand environment. In addition to the cost reduction, Project Summit has achieved, as demonstrated by our increased margin, we have also made progress on the next phase in improving our customer intelligence as well as simplifying our IT systems. One such example being our master data management initiative. Through this initiative, we're improving the platforms and processes that handle all of our data. This intelligence will allow us to better understand and serve our customers, making data an asset for our business. 
Finally, I'm also very pleased with the initial success we have seen from the recent changes to our service delivery model. The rollout of the SLA changes or service level agreement changes we discussed last quarter have gone smoothly. We have already seen the early benefits of denser routes and less frequent pickups and deliveries. Our image on-demand service has seen an increase in activity as more customers look for solutions, which include the use of digital solutions as it helps them integrate more contactless process to reduce infection risk at their businesses. 
A recent survey indicated that more of our customers are interested in converting to digital versus physical delivery. In particular, our customers tell us they value speed of delivery, ease of use and security as the most important considerations when evaluating the use of Image on Demand. 
To summarize, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge provided confirmation that the changes we have made to our organization and the investments we have made in the recent past were the right ones. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends, and we have demonstrated that we can provide the necessary solutions to help our customers adapt to their new unexpected work environment. Despite the unprecedented volatility of COVID-19, we remain focused on long-term growth in doing what's right for the health of our employees, our customers and our business. 
Importantly, we have also recommitted ourselves in our fight against racial injustice prevalent in our societies around the globe and in creating an inclusive and diverse workforce. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a durable business model, which are helping us successfully navigate this challenging period whilst providing us with the flexibility to continue investing in our long-term growth plans, which go beyond Project Summit. As Barry shared with you last quarter, we are proactively managing expenses and have additional levers to further adjust our cost structure if necessary and appropriate. 
In closing, whilst the high degree of uncertainty remains as we look to the back half of the year, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our customers today, and we will continue to provide innovative products and services that address their evolving business needs. Our confidence is further shared by our bondholders as evidenced by our $2.4 billion issuance to refinance some of our notes. Strong investor confidence and demand allowed us to upsize our transaction as well as extend our maturity profile. 
On behalf of the leadership team, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our frontline mountaineers who have kept our operations running seamlessly to serve our customers. Stay safe and well. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment,",1926,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy. 
We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. Before I go into the detail of our results, let me touch on the impact COVID-19 has had on our service trends. 
As we noted on our last conference call, for the second quarter, we were planning for service declines consistent with what we experienced in April. This proved to be slightly conservative. While May was consistent with April, we saw an improving trend across most of our service lines in June. 
To provide investors with as much visibility as possible, I want to share more information than we typically do, including the monthly progression of service activity. As compared to last year, our global service activities declined 37% in April, 38% in May and 21% in June. This resulted in an average decline for the second quarter of 32%. While trends have naturally varied some by market, these are generally representative of what we've experienced around the globe. A notable call out is Latin America, where, consistent with macro headlines, the business has generally lag the recovery elsewhere. To put that in context, this region represents approximately 5% of our revenue. 
In North America, we saw a year-on-year decline of 36% in April, 37% in May and 22% in June. Our core Storage business, which accounts for nearly 2/3 of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability, has demonstrated its durability as we continue to grow organic storage rental revenue during the pandemic. As a reminder, the stability of this business is built on the fact that over 97% of our annual storage revenue is generated by boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. 
And now turning to enterprise results for the second quarter. Revenue of $982 million decreased 7.9% on a reported basis year-on-year, reflecting service declines as well as the stronger dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 5.6%. Total organic revenue declined 7.2%. Organic service revenue declined 23.1%, reflecting the COVID impact. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, supported by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.3% to $343 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA was in line with last year despite a $58 million revenue decline. During the second quarter, we incurred $9 million cost as a result of COVID-19 for items such as PPE and specialized cleaning of our facilities, which have been excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 34.9%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.22 compared to $0.23 in the second quarter of 2019. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our commentary last quarter. AFFO was $249 million, up 19% year-over-year. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the increase in AFFO was primarily driven by tax refund. 
Turning to segment performance, starting with the global RIM organization. In the second quarter, records management experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 45% for new boxes inbounded and 43% for retrievals and refiles. Permanent withdrawals declined 34% and destructions were down 1%. Data management saw less of an impact with activity down 10%. 
Our Global Digital Solutions business has continued to perform well, with revenue consistent year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Given the diverse mix of products and services in this business, we use revenue as the best indicator of activity. 
In our shred business, activity declined approximately 24%, which has also resulted in lower paper tonnage. The industry saw an increase in the price for recycled paper in April and May, which we believe was partially the result of elevated consumer purchases of paper products. For the second quarter, our average realized price was 15% higher than the prior year, which was a $2 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Prices continued to be volatile, with sequential declines in June and July, has seen an increase in demand and performed ahead of our expectations. These service activity levels contributed to a total organic revenue decline of 7.5% in the global RIM business. The decline was partially offset by storage volume growth in faster-growing markets and revenue management. 
In the second quarter, we took aggressive actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, which helped bring costs more in line with activity levels. Naturally, we also experienced a level of fixed cost deleverage. As these cost actions are temporary in nature and distinct from Project Summit, we continue to expect them to come back as revenue recovers. 
Our global RIM business delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 240 basis points to 43.8%. This improvement was driven by Project Summit, revenue management and favorable mix. 
Turning to Global Data Center. The business delivered organic revenue growth of 7.6%, driven by strong leasing in prior periods and low churn of 80 basis points. This [indiscernible] in Phoenix resulting from an early contract renewal of a large legacy [ IO ] customer. Global Data Center's adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% represents an increase of 140 basis points, consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion as our platform scales. As Bill noted, the data center team delivered very strong bookings in the first half of the year, signing almost 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including pre-leasing 100% of our Frankfurt facility currently under development. As we have said before, we are reviewing potential third-party capital options, particularly related to stabilized assets, and we will keep you updated in the second half. 
Turning to our adjacent businesses. The fine arts industry has continued to experience the impact of COVID, and we have seen activity down approximately 85%. On the other hand, our entertainment services business has shown resilience as activity has remained in line with pre-COVID levels. 
As to Project Summit, in the second quarter, we recognized $39 million of restructuring charges and an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $40 million. Through the first half, we have delivered $65 million of benefit. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit of $150 million and restructuring charges of $240 million in 2020. This keeps us on pace to deliver $375 million of expected total program benefits exiting 2021. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the second quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement of nearly 4 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables days and days sales outstandings. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term. 
With the COVID backdrop, I think the team's performance, particularly on cash collections, was very strong. Despite a decline in revenue, our cash collections were up year-on-year in June. I will note that given the pandemic's impact on the macro economy, we took a prudent view regarding receivables and increased our bad debt expense in the quarter. I'd like to briefly expand on the recent bond offering that Bill mentioned. 
We appreciate the investment community's strong support, which resulted in our ability to upsize the transaction in June [indiscernible] neutral offering increased our weighted average maturity by almost 2 years, while only modestly increasing our cost of debt. 
In the second quarter, we recognized debt extinguishment charges of approximately $17 million deferred financing costs and call mediums. Due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes, at quarter end, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet. We paid off that note on July 2, and as a result [indiscernible] million of debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter. Pro forma for this payoff, we had $1.2 billion of liquidity, which provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. We have been able to maintain liquidity at this level since April, even while continuing to fund innovation and growth initiatives as well as supporting our sustainable dividend. 
We ended the quarter [indiscernible], which takes into account certain adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.6x, which would represent a slight decline year-on-year as we make progress toward our long-term leverage range. 
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. 
Now let me provide an update as to our expectations for the remainder of the year. With the impact of COVID, we are planning for reported revenue to be down less than 5% for the full year compared to 2019. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates of approximately $75 million for revenue and almost $25 million for adjusted EBITDA as compared to last year. 
Turning to our expectations for our Storage and Service businesses. For the full year, we currently expect a decline in net organic storage volume of 1% to 1.5%. We expect reported storage rental revenue in the second half to grow on year-on-year at a rate that approaches what we delivered in the second quarter. As to Service, our July activity levels were down 24% globally. We are currently planning for third quarter activity to be consistent with what we experienced in July. This implies a service revenue decline in the high teens year-on-year in the third quarter. With an expectation for a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter, we are planning for full year service revenue declines in the mid-teens. We are approaching adjusted EBITDA margins with a level of conservatism and plan for both the third and fourth quarters to be flat to slightly up year-on-year. This would result in us delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion slightly above 100 basis points relative to last year, which reflects an improvement as compared to our comments on our last call. This reflects our solid first half performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions as well as a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to capital expenditures. We have increased our full year expectation to approximately $525 million or an increase of $50 million from the midpoint of our previous outlook. You should expect this increase to be evenly split between recurring CapEx and data center growth investment, given the better-than-expected performance in the core business as well as our growing data center pipeline. 
As to AFFO, the team is focused on delivering at a level approaching last year's result, including the benefit of our second quarter tax refund. As it relates to capital recycling, our outlook has not changed. We continue to expect to generate proceeds of approximately $100 million this year. As we look at the back half, we have a strong pipeline of transactions and historically low cap rates in the industrial real estate market. 
While the second quarter was a challenging one for our service business, we are continuing durability of our Storage business. I am proud of how the team has provided strong results they have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our third quarter earnings call. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

I'll let Barry answer the last one in more detail. I think the -- but the answer to -- the short answer to your question is, yes, we continue to like the idea of third-party capital for stabilized assets, but I'll let Barry give you a full answer on that. 
On the first one in terms -- so thanks for the question, Eric, on innovation and the importance of that, not just in a post-COVID world, but absolutely in the current environment. We continue to see traction on some of the things I highlighted last time in terms of what I'll call remote collaboration and collaborating remotely. Like I gave the example last time, I think, on unemployment benefits were we're actually facilitating folks to be able to be working a way from a home and both receive the applications for unemployment and approve it. And then also some of the areas around mailroom, which again, I think I highlighted last time. 
One area I would add in addition to that. So we continue to see more and more traction for those kinds of solutions. One area, too, that we've seen a good, what we call our clean start program. And the clean start program is something that we launched a year ago, which is really helping people to reimagine their needs for their office space and get information [indiscernible] and then also to get things off-site for things that they don't need around the office and allows them to work in a much more flexible way. 
And when we came into to COVID, that actually got -- for the clean start was we would go into offices and do surveys and working with their real estate people to help and rebuild their work processes. And some of that, the [indiscernible] that process obviously is storage, but also some of the other services that we provide as Iron Mountain. 
When we got into the crisis, our real estate team, product management, sales and marketing team collaborated, and they created a clean start kit in a box, if you will. So what we've done is we've been able to put that together in a kit that allows us to deliver the same type of assessment and survey virtually without actually going into their offices. And we just recently, for instance, had a very large win with a global insurance company that was selling part of its insurance portfolio to a life insurance company, where we not only did facilitated moving sensitive records, many containing PII or personal identifiable information across to that new owner of those policies and that information, but transfer a number of their employees across and at the same time, help them repurpose their -- the real estate footprint that they were left with. So it was kind of real estate optimization, helping them transfer a business to another person, transfer people and then take a step back and say, how can we actually improve information flow in what they have left. So that just gives you another flavor of the types of things that we're finding out there."

Adam, thanks for the question. A couple of points there. I would say look, our service business performed better throughout the -- as you know, on the last call, we noted that we thought we'd use April as a proxy going forward for the entire second quarter. 
April and May, generally speaking, really across the world and across our various service activity lines were very consistent. Fred was down kind of high 20s in April, about [ 30 ] in May. It also recover just like directionally, the rest of the business was down in the vicinity of 10% on activity basis in June and [ by ]. I would say that, that trajectory of improvement in June, as I noted, was really pervasive across all of our activities. 
As it relates to paper price, in particular, the way I would think about this, Adam, is on our last call, we were -- well, in the first quarter, we had a $10 million hit to EBITDA from paper prices, as you recall. And on our last call, we thought that we would have kind of low to mid-single-digit dollar decline as a result of paper price for each of the next couple of positive to EBITDA, as I mentioned on the call. Now I will say that paper prices have been very volatile. And have been declining quite significantly over the last couple of months. You've probably seen that in the industry data. I know you follow that. And so our view for the back half is that it will be basically neutral year-on-year as it relates to EBITDA."

In other words, we -- most of the hyperscalers we were serving in some aspects, but not necessarily in large hyperscale deployment. 
I think overall, though, if you look at our pipeline, I would say that whilst it's right to say on -- in terms of volume that we sell that 1 hyperscaler, you can kind of skew what that looks like, is we're still seeing a good mix. So I think last quarter, we were approaching back up to about 50% from kind of existing Iron Mountain or existing data center customers. This quarter, it was a little bit lower, especially if you use the filter I'm saying, breaking the hyperscalers into 2 buckets. But overall, I think we still continue to see the pipeline. I think that some of the new logos that I highlighted that we brought in this time were because of existing Iron Mountain relationships and, say, our data management business and the type of cross-selling that you would see. 
But if you look at specifically this quarter, what we're most excited about this quarter is that we think we're [ big ] in the deal flow, if you will, for hyperscale scale deployment. In other words, hyperscalers know that we're out there, and we see -- we're seeing the RFIs, just like everybody else's. So we're pretty excited.

So look, I think, first of all, you know the market extreme -- both of those markets extremely well. So first, on Singapore, we're continuing to keep an eye on it because, as you probably realize, we're tracking on too soon. So you're right that the government has put a pause on it. We have heard the

based in Singapore. So he stays pretty close to the government. We are seeing that the government seems to be making noises to relax that a little bit sooner than they initially guided, say, a year ago. So we're optimistic. And obviously, we're starting to -- or have been for a number of months now looking at how we could actually expand our footprint in Singapore. As I said, the -- we're well on track to fill out the old Credit Suisse data center fairly soon. 
On Amsterdam, interesting, we have actually quite a bit of land permitted. So we've been less engaged with the government trying to relax that. On the other side, it's exactly, as you said, is we've seen even a number of people who have their own data centers in the Amsterdam market, for instance, coming in and starting to look to add capacity in our facilities because of the permitting issue that you've described. And obviously, Amsterdam is a highly connected market in our facility is a high level of connectivity within it. So it's actually playing through our -- both because we have the capacity in -- but the rest of the market is constrained."

I think the team is very aligned and they're very focused on delivering. I think the total company is energized by the fact that this is really an opportunity to transform the company and support our customers that much better. 
In terms of how it's stacking up, the second quarter of $40 million benefit year-on-year was right in line, if not a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. So we're at $65 million year-to-date. And obviously, those are elevated levels as compared to what we were expecting earlier as we increased the benefit this year, last quarter. So we're well on track to deliver $150 million of benefit this year. My guess is that next year, we will have another $150 million to $200 million of incremental benefit, and we'll exit next year at a run rate that has all of the benefit of the entire $375 million by 2022, so a little small amount of incremental benefit there in 2022 to plan for your models. 
In terms of where it's coming from, it's generally been thus far, probably in the vicinity of 70%, 75% from SG&A and the balance in cost of sales. You'll note as you're looking at our performance this quarter, our cost of sales, obviously down a lot more, and that reflects the fact that we made those temporary cost cuts that we talked about in the form of furloughs and et cetera. Going forward, I think you'll see even more of Summit coming from a more balanced approach across the income statement as initially, as Bill has commented before, the first rounds of Summit were really in the SG&A area. There'll be more going forward, but I think as a relative basis, sort of last quarter, we talked some about the SLA changes, which, by the way, are going very, very well. Those will continue to stack incremental benefits going forward, and some of that, obviously, will be in the cost of sales line. 
As it relates to the tax refund, I think that was the last question. We did have about $27 million of cash refunds in the quarter as compared to prior year, last year, we actually paid more on a cash basis. So if you're looking at AFFO, it's almost a $35 million swing year-on-year. That's onetime, and we -- those were for prior year refunds that we were -- we received during the quarter. So thanks for those questions, Sheila."

So look, the customer churn is actually, we think, a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that's when I made the comment in my introductory remarks that will kind of normalize in a post-COVID world. On one side,",762,"On the records business. Yes. So look, the customer churn is actually, we think, a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that's when I made the comment in my introductory remarks that will kind of normalize in a post-COVID world. On one side, we would expect the pause. In other words, we don't expect the same drag on incoming volume. But on permanent withdrawals is that we saw a downtick in this quarter because people are not in the office or making active decisions to actually withdraw. So we expect it to kind of revert back to normal levels. But if you kind of look at overall volume, I think the question behind your question is what do we think's going to happen to volume when we get out of COVID. So on one side, we would expect permanent withdrawals to go up, back to normalized levels. But on the other side is we would expect incoming volume from our customers to come back up. 
And so to give you kind of a bit of science around that, if it's helpful, is let's, first of all, kind of anchor on what we see with our customers right now in this environment in terms of activity. So last week, I was in New York and New Jersey, and had a catch-up with 1 evening with the President and Chief Operating Officer of a large global bank that's based in New York. And we were comparing notes on how many people come back to the office, et cetera. And what he shared with me is that at the depth of the crisis, say, in April, they had less than 3% of their workforce coming into the office. And where they were standing -- when I was meeting with them last week, in July, they had invited 20% of the people to come back and only 6% came back. And you're probably seeing similar things in [ BAML ]. 
So then let's kind of say what -- how has that translated in the activity we see in terms of incoming boxes? When I say that where are we going to end when we have COVID in the rearview mirror? So if we look at incoming boxes in April. So if you remember, like, in their case, only 3% of their people, less than 3% of the people are coming into the office, we were down 58% in North America. But I'm just taking North America as an example, as a proxy. We're down 58% on incoming box volume. If we look at the quarter, as Barry mentioned, we're down about 47% overall in North America in terms of incoming box. 
Now if you look at July, we're down about 38%. So basically, July is about a 20% improvement from what we saw on average in Q2. So if we were down, say, 4 million, 4.5 million cubic feet due to -- in Q2 from our records management business or net, we said minus 3.8 million cubic feet, we're 4.5 million cubic feet worse than normal. But let's say we were down negative 3.8 million cubic feet, then we would say that based on a 20% -- the 20% improvement that we've seen in July is worst-case scenario. You project that forward is we're down about 3 million cubic feet a quarter, right? So that's 12 million cubic feet on an annualized basis. 
Now we don't expect it to plateau at these levels, obviously, because we're still only running it in financial services, less than 6% of the people that are coming to work. But with 6% -- even if we plateau at the current levels we're seeing, is you'd be a 12 million annual drag, a negative 12 million annual drag on our records management business in terms of physical storage, and that's before adding consumer back in. So when you net it all out is that worst case, especially with the offset that we get from consumer is that we think that adding our normal price of 2% to 3%, it's manageable. What a most likely scenario is we'll continue to see improvement. People will start -- I don't think we're going to stay at 6% of the workforce coming to the office. It will go back up. And that's why when I said in my remarks, as we expect in a post-COVID world is we'll be kind of flattish to slightly up in the records management with additional growth on top of that. I don't know if that's helpful."

Let me start by saying, I hope you've all continued to stay safe and healthy in these trying times. Before we get into a discussion of our second quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to touch on 2 topics that are top of mind for many of us in the current environment. 
First, the killings of George Floyd and countless others have left me and my colleagues upset, angered and heartbroken. I want to reiterate that racism, discrimination and hate have no place at Iron Mountain. Our commitment and stated as one of our core 5 values for many years to equality, inclusivity and diversity is part of our belief that our people are our greatest assets. Given this fact, we must continually attract, listen to and develop a broad talent pool reflecting our global demographics in order to deliver to our customers and protect our future. These tragic events have sparked difficult but important self-reflection and conversations within our organization about how well we are living up to our stated value and to commit ourselves to do much better. It is up to us to work together, educate ourselves and encourage open dialogue to promote proactive measures to help eliminate incorrect biases and spread awareness, not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because we will only be successful in serving our customers if we attract and retain the best talent. 
Having the best talent can only happen if we are recruiting and developing people from diverse backgrounds across the broader demographics we operate in. We remain strongly committed toward taking decisive and strategic action to create a truly inclusive Iron Mountain. We're committed to listening, learning and taking the necessary actions to support long-term positive change for the black community specifically and people from all backgrounds in general. Whilst we cannot change the past, we had an opportunity as an organization and as individuals to positively impact the future and help fix the racial inequality prevalent in our society. 
Now I'd like to update you on the impact we are seeing with respect to COVID-19. As you all know, the virus is unfortunately still spreading across the globe. My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been affected by the virus, including those who have fallen ill as well as their loved ones and their caregivers. As always, our top priority remains the healthy and safety of our Mountaineers, their families and our customers. I want to acknowledge and thank the many Mountaineers around the world who, despite extraordinary challenges, have kept their focus on ensuring that Iron Mountain continues to move forward during these uncertain times and doing so with a view towards safety. 
This was all brought home to me again last week during a visit I made to Northern New Jersey, so I could thank our frontline teams personally. One of our couriers relayed how he has been serving a large metro New York health system every day through the crisis and how thankful the customer is for our continued service. This particular customer went so far to send one of their doctors to our facility to assist in the protocols and training to protect our staff. For me, this is what it means to be in a true partnership with our customers.  
Whilst we continue to serve many customers during this crisis, as you would expect, our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to office closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. Fortunately, 100% of our records management facilities are now open and operating across the globe. However, many of our global customers continue to operate at significantly lower capacities due to existing restrictions depending on geography. As a result, global demand for many of our core service offerings declined during the quarter. 
Looking back, no one could have anticipated the magnitude of the impact from this pandemic on the global economy and our own business. However, our team moved quickly to assess the risks, understand the consequences and take decisive action to ensure the safety of our employees, customers and communities. As I mentioned, these various decisions have not been made lightly. And we are aware of their consequences, especially for our Mountaineers that have been impacted by furloughs and other temporary and, in some cases, permanent actions. 
We told you in May that approximately 1/3 of our global workforce has been impacted by these actions in an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity. Fortunately, we have been able to bring a number of our Mountaineers back to work. So at this time, this number has decreased to approximately 20% of our global workforce. Furthermore, the mix has shifted over the past few months, so fewer of the impacted employees are on full furlough and a higher percentage are working reduced hours or using vacation or sick times. 
At this time, we have also reopened all our corporate offices with the exception of London, which we plan to open at the beginning of September. We are practicing strict protocols around social distancing and as such, the majority of our salaried workforce is continuing to work remotely. We should note, we have been strong -- we have seen strong productivity rates from work -- with working from home. That being said, given some of the increased stresses of working remotely, we continue to monitor and care for our Mountaineers' mental health and resiliency as part of our overall focus on wellness. 
Turning to our financial performance. Our continued navigation of this challenging and uncertain environment has delivered a second quarter performance that further demonstrates, improves the durability and resilience of our people and ultimately, our business model. I'll touch on a few highlights here. Q2 constant currency revenue declined $58 million or 5.6% year-over-year, driven entirely by a 21% decline in our service revenue. This was partly offset by strong storage revenue growth, which increased 3.7%. The early benefits of Project Summit are evident, as we delivered constant currency adjusted EBITDA line in line with the year ago level despite the revenue decline, leading to a 200 basis point margin expansion. Barry will review the rest of the Q2 financials in more detail.  
Looking at our service business, we have seen improvements in activity levels across the various product lines since the end of April, as global economies are starting to reopen and customers are increasingly utilizing our core service offerings in many geographies. However, the pace of our recovery still remains uncertain. Whilst the revenue decline wasn't as steep as we expected when we last spoke in early May, we continue to see some risk around the second half depending upon what happens with the progression of the virus and possible additional restrictions on a country-by-country and state-by-state basis as they continue to fight specific localized outbreaks of the virus.  
Turning now to our core storage business. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, supported by strong revenue management contribution. Moreover, we saw cash collections improve, both in absolute terms year-on-year as well as by 2 days outstanding. This level of organic revenue growth underscores the durability and essential nature of our storage business and our ability to continue to generate substantial cash flow.  
Total organic volume declined 1.8 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this decrease was in records management volume, partly offset by a 2 million cubic foot increase in consumer and others.  
Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 3.9 million cubic feet compared to the first quarter. This shouldn't be surprising based on the decline of incoming boxes in April and a decline of 45% for the quarter.  
We have been asked by many investors as to what we see happening to physical volume post-COVID. So let me take a step back and provide some further context on organic records management volume. We estimate that the impact from COVID in Q2 was somewhere between 4 million and 4.5 million cubic feet, net of a slowdown in permanent withdrawals. If we continue to normalize Q2 for similar levels of volume in Q1, combined with our expectation for a pickup in permanent withdrawals, volume would be flat to slightly up on a normalized basis. To get to a total physical volume impact, I will now factor in consumer performance.  
In the second quarter, we added 2 million cubic feet. Analyzing this would imply we would be net positive 8 million cubic feet or approximately 1% volume growth on a base of total physical volume of more than 720 million cubic feet. However, Q2 is a seasonally highest point for consumer business, so this would be overly optimistic to assume for a full year. When we net all this out in a post-COVID world, we would expect physical storage volume growth to be roughly 0.5%, with volume from records management flat to slightly up with a small net positive growth coming from consumer. It should be noted that this is all before the contribution from our normal price increases, which generally add approximately 2% to 3% to the volume growth, yielding approximately 3% organic storage revenue growth from the physical side of the business. However, when we will see this reversion to post-COVID normalized business environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly not before the end -- before the second half of 2021. 
Despite the stress and strains from dealing with COVID's impact, we have not let up on our investments in innovation. Specifically in the quarter, we had many instances where we were able to serve our customers with a focus on delivering innovative solutions in order to help them navigate their challenges that have arisen from COVID-19. For example, regarding the commercial impact, in April, pipeline of more traditional offerings was down 40% versus the same period last year due to COVID and the resulting lower economic activity. However, we recovered 1/3 of this loss through new solutions we recently launched that help address our customers' needs during this time. This is just one demonstration of the resiliency and dedication of our Mountaineers as we expect many of these solutions to be additive to our top and bottom lines even after our base activities rebound.  
Turning now to our global data center segment. This business continues to perform exceptionally well, delivering strong results in the second quarter. In June, we announced a 27-megawatt data center lease with a U.S.-based Fortune 100 customer in Frankfurt, Germany. This customer will occupy the entire Frankfurt facility, which should result in stabilization significantly sooner than we originally anticipated when we purchased the land last year.  
In addition, we signed a 3-megawatt data center lease with a Fortune Global 200 company in Singapore, another signal of strong momentum in that market. These bigger deals have been won alongside a series of smaller but significant agreements, including a number of new logos. We welcomed an online gaming platform, a state government and a global logistics supplier -- provider to the IMDC ecosystem in Q2. All of this has contributed to a strong performance in the first half of the year with nearly 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases signed against our initial guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts for the full year. Given this great success in the first half of the year, we now expect to be able to sign leases for a total of 45 to 50 megawatts this year or an additional 10-plus megawatts of leasing in the back half. I would like to congratulate the entire data center team for an exceptional first half performance. Thank you.  
Based on the strength of our pipeline, we will continue to prioritize investment in data center growth. We are actively building our capacity across our global footprint with new development projects started in Amsterdam, Singapore and Phoenix. In early July, we completed the first phase of 4 megawatts at our new building on our Northern Virginia Campus, and customers are already deploying.  
As I mentioned earlier, Project Summit is already paying dividends. No one could have predicted the depth or breadth of this pandemic when we first announced Project Summit in October 2019. Thankfully, the decisive actions we took early in the program allowed us to reconfigure our cost structure as well as realign our organization to be more nimble and customer centric. These changes enabled us to be more responsive in delivering new solutions to our customers' specific needs during the crisis as well as matching our costs to a changing demand environment. In addition to the cost reduction Project Summit has achieved, as demonstrated by our increased margin, we have also made progress on the next phase in improving our customer intelligence as well as simplifying our IT systems. One such example being our master data management initiative. Through this initiative, we're improving the platforms and processes that handle all of our data. This intelligence will allow us to better understand and serve our customers, making data an asset for our business.  
Finally, I'm also very pleased with the initial success we have seen from the recent changes to our service delivery model. The rollout of the SLA changes or service level agreement changes we discussed last quarter have gone smoothly. We have already seen the early benefits of denser routes and less frequent pickups and deliveries. Our Image on Demand service has seen an increase in activity as more customers look for solutions, which include the use of digital solutions as it helps them integrate more contactless process to reduce infection risk at their businesses.  
A recent survey indicated that more of our customers are interested in converting to digital versus physical delivery. In particular, our customers tell us they value speed of delivery, ease of use and security as the most important considerations when evaluating the use of Image on Demand.  
To summarize, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge provided confirmation that the changes we have made to our organization and the investments we have made in the recent past were the right ones. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends, and we have demonstrated that we can provide the necessary solutions to help our customers adapt to their new unexpected work environment. Despite the unprecedented volatility of COVID-19, we remain focused on long-term growth in doing what's right for the health of our employees, our customers and our business.  
Importantly, we have also recommitted ourselves in our fight against racial injustice prevalent in our societies around the globe and in creating an inclusive and diverse workforce. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a durable business model, which are helping us successfully navigate this challenging period whilst providing us with the flexibility to continue investing in our long-term growth plans, which go beyond Project Summit. As Barry shared with you last quarter, we are proactively managing expenses and have additional levers to further adjust our cost structure if necessary and appropriate.  
In closing, whilst the high degree of uncertainty remains as we look to the back half of the year, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our customers today, and we will continue to provide innovative products and services that address their evolving business needs. Our confidence is further shared by our bondholders as evidenced by our $2.4 billion issuance to refinance some of our notes. Strong investor confidence and demand allowed us to upsize our transaction as well as extend our maturity profile.  
On behalf of the leadership team, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our frontline Mountaineers who have kept our operations running seamlessly to serve our customers. Stay safe and well.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy.  We are pleased with our results for the second quarter.

I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy.  
We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. Before I go into the detail of our results, let me touch on the impact COVID-19 has had on our service trends.  
As we noted on our last conference call, for the second quarter, we were planning for service declines consistent with what we experienced in April. This proved to be slightly conservative. While May was consistent with April, we saw an improving trend across most of our service lines in June.  
To provide investors with as much visibility as possible, I want to share more information than we typically do, including the monthly progression of service activity. As compared to last year, our global service activities declined 37% in April, 38% in May and 21% in June. This resulted in an average decline for the second quarter of 32%. While trends have naturally varied some by market, these are generally representative of what we've experienced around the globe. A notable call out is Latin America, where, consistent with macro headlines, the business has generally lagged the recovery elsewhere. To put that in context, this region represents approximately 5% of our revenue.  
In North America, we saw a year-on-year decline of 36% in April, 37% in May and 22% in June. Our core storage business, which accounts for nearly 2/3 of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability, has demonstrated its durability as we continue to grow organic storage rental revenue during the pandemic. As a reminder, the stability of this business is built on the fact that over 97% of our annual storage revenue is generated by boxes that entered our facilities in prior years.  
And now turning to enterprise results for the second quarter. Revenue of $982 million decreased 7.9% on a reported basis year-on-year, reflecting service declines as well as the stronger dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 5.6%. Total organic revenue declined 7.2%. Organic service revenue declined 23.1%, reflecting the COVID impact. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, supported by revenue management. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.3% to $343 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA was in line with last year despite a $58 million revenue decline. During the second quarter, we incurred $9 million of cost as a result of COVID-19 for items such as PPE and specialized cleaning of our facilities, which have been excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 34.9%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.22 compared to $0.23 in the second quarter of 2019. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our commentary last quarter. AFFO was $249 million, up 19% year-over-year. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the increase in AFFO was primarily driven by tax refund.  
Turning to segment performance, starting with the global RIM organization. In the second quarter, records management experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 45% for new boxes inbounded and 43% for retrievals and refiles. Permanent withdrawals declined 34% and destructions were down 1%. Data management saw less of an impact with activity down 10%.  
Our global digital solutions business has continued to perform well, with revenue consistent year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Given the diverse mix of products and services in this business, we use revenue as the best indicator of activity.  
In our shred business, activity declined approximately 24%, which has also resulted in lower paper tonnage. The industry saw an increase in the price for recycled paper in April and May, which we believe was partially the result of elevated consumer purchases of paper products. For the second quarter, our average realized price was 15% higher than the prior year, which was a $2 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Prices continued to be volatile, with sequential declines in June and July. The consumer storage business has seen an increase in demand and performed ahead of our expectations. These service activity levels contributed to a total organic revenue decline of 7.5% in the global RIM business. The decline was partially offset by storage volume growth in faster-growing markets and revenue management.  
In the second quarter, we took aggressive actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, which helped bring costs more in line with activity levels. Naturally, we also experienced a level of fixed cost deleverage. As these cost actions are temporary in nature and distinct from Project Summit, we continue to expect them to come back as revenue recovers.  
Our global RIM business delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 240 basis points to 43.8%. This improvement was driven by Project Summit, revenue management and favorable mix.  
Turning to global data center. The business delivered organic revenue growth of 7.6%, driven by strong leasing in prior periods and low churn of 80 basis points. This was partially offset by a mark-to-market decline in Phoenix resulting from an early contract renewal of a large legacy IO customer. Global data center's adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% represents an increase of 140 basis points, consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion as our platform scales. As Bill noted, the data center team delivered very strong bookings in the first half of the year, signing almost 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including pre-leasing 100% of our Frankfurt facility currently under development. As we have said before, we are reviewing potential third-party capital options, particularly related to stabilized assets, and we will keep you updated in the second half.  
Turning to our adjacent businesses. The fine arts industry has continued to experience the impact of COVID, and we have seen activity down approximately 85%. On the other hand, our entertainment services business has shown resilience as activity has remained in line with pre-COVID levels.  
As to Project Summit, in the second quarter, we recognized $39 million of restructuring charges and an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $40 million. Through the first half, we have delivered $65 million of benefit. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit of $150 million and restructuring charges of $240 million in 2020. This keeps us on pace to deliver $375 million of expected total program benefits exiting 2021.  
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the second quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement of nearly 4 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables days and day sales outstandings. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term.  
With the COVID backdrop, I think the team's performance, particularly on cash collections, was very strong. Despite a decline in revenue, our cash collections were up year-on-year in June. I will note that given the pandemic's impact on the macro economy, we took a prudent view regarding receivables and increased our bad debt expense in the quarter. I'd like to briefly expand on the recent bond offering that Bill mentioned. We appreciate the investment community's strong support, which resulted in our ability to upsize the transaction in June to $2.4 billion. This leverage-neutral offering increased our weighted average maturity by almost 2 years, while only modestly increasing our cost of debt.  
In the second quarter, we recognized debt extinguishment charges of approximately $17 million related to a write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call premiums. Due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes, at quarter end, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet. We paid off that note on July 2, and as a result we anticipate recording an additional $15 million of debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter. Pro forma for this payoff, we had $1.2 billion of liquidity, which provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. We have been able to maintain liquidity at this level since April, even while continuing to fund innovation and growth initiatives as well as supporting our sustainable dividend.  
We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4x, which takes into account certain adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.6x, which would represent a slight decline year-on-year as we make progress toward our long-term leverage range.  
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October.  
Now let me provide an update as to our expectations for the remainder of the year. With the impact of COVID, we are planning for reported revenue to be down less than 5% for the full year compared to 2019. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates of approximately $75 million for revenue and almost $25 million for adjusted EBITDA as compared to last year.  
Turning to our expectations for our storage and service businesses. For the full year, we currently expect a decline in net organic storage volume of 1% to 1.5%. We expect reported storage rental revenue in the second half to grow on year-on-year at a rate that approaches what we delivered in the second quarter. As to service, our July activity levels were down 24% globally. We are currently planning for third quarter activity to be consistent with what we experienced in July. This implies a service revenue decline in the high teens year-on-year in the third quarter. With an expectation for a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter, we are planning for full year service revenue declines in the mid-teens. We are approaching adjusted EBITDA margins with a level of conservatism and plan for both the third and fourth quarters to be flat to slightly up year-on-year. This would result in us delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion slightly above 100 basis points relative to last year, which reflects an improvement as compared to our comments on our last call. This reflects our solid first half performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions as well as a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to capital expenditures. We have increased our full year expectation to approximately $525 million or an increase of $50 million from the midpoint of our previous outlook. You should expect this increase to be evenly split between recurring CapEx and data center growth investment, given the better-than-expected performance in the core business as well as our growing data center pipeline. 
As to AFFO, the team is focused on delivering at a level approaching last year's result, including the benefit of our second quarter tax refund. As it relates to capital recycling, our outlook has not changed. We continue to expect to generate proceeds of approximately $100 million this year. As we look at the back half, we have a strong pipeline of transactions and continue to see attractive valuations with historically low cap rates in the industrial real estate market. 
While the second quarter was a challenging one for our service business, we are confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results they have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our third quarter earnings call.

I'll let Barry answer the last one in more detail. I think the -- but the answer to -- the short answer to your question is, yes, we continue to like the idea of third-party capital for stabilized assets, but I'll let Barry give you a full answer on that. 
On the first one in terms of -- thanks for the question, Eric, on innovation and the importance of that, not just in a post-COVID world, but absolutely in the current environment. We continue to see traction on some of the things I highlighted last time in terms of what I'd call remote collaboration and collaborating remotely. Like I gave the example last time, I think, on unemployment benefits where we're actually facilitating folks to be able to be working away from home and both receive the applications for unemployment and approve it. And then also some of the areas around mailroom which, again, I think I highlighted the last time. 
One area I would add in addition to that. So we've continued to see more and more traction for those kinds of solutions. One area, too, that we've seen a good uptick in the recent past is what we call our Clean Start program. And the Clean Start program is something that we launched a year ago, which is really helping people to reimagine their needs for their office space and get information flows to be more seamless when they are at work and then also to get things off-site for things that they don't need around the office and allows them to work in a much more flexible way. 
And when we came into COVID, that actually got -- the brakes got put on that because part of the Clean Start was we would go into offices and do surveys and working with their real estate people to help them reimagine and rebuild their work processes. And some of that, the exhaust to that process obviously is storage, but also some of the other services that we provide as Iron Mountain. 
When we got into the crisis, our real estate team, product management, sales and marketing team collaborated, and they created a Clean Start kit in a box, if you will. So what we've done is we've been able to put that together in a kit that allows us to deliver the same type of assessment and survey virtually without actually going into their offices. And we just recently, for instance, had a very large win with a global insurance company that was selling part of its insurance portfolio to a life insurance company, where we not only did -- facilitated moving sensitive records, many containing PII or personal identifiable information across to that new owner of those policies and that information, but transfer a number of their employees across and at the same time, help them repurpose their -- the real estate footprint that they were left with. So it was kind of real estate optimization, helping them transfer a business to another person, transfer people and then take a step back and say, how can we actually improve the information flow in what they have left. So that just gives you another flavor of the types of things that we're finding out there."

I would say look, our service business performed better throughout the -- in the quarter than we had anticipated. As you know, on the last call, we noted that we thought we'd use April as a proxy going forward for the entire second quarter. 
April and May, generally speaking, really across the world and across our various service activity lines were very consistent. Shred was down kind of high 20s in April, about 30% in May. It also recovered just like, directionally, the rest of the business, was down in the vicinity of 10% on activity basis in June and kind of stayed at that level in July. I would say that, that trajectory of improvement in June, as I noted, was really pervasive across all of our activities. 
As it relates to paper price, in particular, the way I would think about this, Adam, is on our last call, we were -- well, in the first quarter, we had a $10 million hit to EBITDA from paper prices, as you recall. And on our last call, we thought that we would have kind of low to mid-single-digit dollar decline as a result of paper price for each of the next couple of quarters. We actually had a $2 million positive to EBITDA, as I mentioned on the call. Now I will say that paper prices have been very volatile and have been declining quite significantly over the last couple of months. You've probably seen that in the industry data. I know you follow that. And so our view for the back half is that it will be basically neutral year-on-year as it relates to EBITDA."

In other words, we -- most of the hyperscalers we were serving in some aspects, but not necessarily in large hyperscale deployment. 
I think overall, though, if you look at our pipeline, I would say that whilst it's right to say on -- in terms of volume that we sell these to one hyperscaler who can kind of skew what that looks like, is we're still seeing a good mix. So I think last quarter, we were approaching back up to about 50% from kind of existing Iron Mountain or existing data center customers. This quarter, it was a little bit lower, especially if you use the filter I'm saying, breaking the hyperscalers into 2 buckets. But overall, I think we still continue to see the pipeline. I think that some of the new logos that I highlighted that we brought in this time were because of existing Iron Mountain relationships in, say, our data management business and the type of cross-selling that you would see. 
But if you look at specifically this quarter, what we're most excited about this quarter is that we think we're beginning to be established in the deal flow, if you will, for hyperscale deployment. In other words, hyperscalers know that we're out there, and we see -- we're seeing the RFIs, just like everybody else's. So we're pretty excited.

So first, on Singapore, we're continuing to keep an eye on it because, as you probably realize, we're tracking on a track that we're going to be sold out in Singapore pretty soon. So you're right that the government has put a pause on it. We have heard the -- it just so happens that our Head of Asia data centers is a Singaporean based in Singapore. So he stays pretty close to the government. We are seeing that the government seems to be making noises to relax that a little bit sooner than they initially guided, say, a year ago. So we're optimistic. And obviously, we're starting to -- or have been for a number of months now looking at how we could actually expand our footprint in Singapore. As I said, the -- we're well on track to fill out the old Credit Suisse data center fairly soon. 
On Amsterdam, interesting, we have actually quite a bit of land permitted. So we've been less engaged with the government trying to relax that. On the other side, it's exactly, as you said, is we've seen even a number of people who have their own data centers in the Amsterdam market, for instance, coming in and starting to look to add capacity in our facilities because of the permitting issue that you've described. And obviously, Amsterdam is a highly connected market and our facility has a high level of connectivity within it.

In terms of how it's stacking up, the second quarter of $40 million benefit year-on-year was right in line, if not a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. So we're at $65 million year-to-date. And obviously, those are elevated levels as compared to what we were expecting earlier as we increased the benefit this year, last quarter. So we're well on track to deliver $150 million of benefit this year. My guess is that next year, we will have another $150 million to $200 million of incremental benefit, and we'll exit next year at a run rate that has all of the benefit, the entire $375 million by 2022, so a little small amount of incremental benefit there in 2022 to plan for your models. 
In terms of where it's coming from, it's generally been thus far probably in the vicinity of 70%, 75% from SG&A and the balance in cost of sales. You'll note, as you're looking at our performance this quarter, our cost of sales, obviously down a lot more, and that reflects the fact that we made those temporary cost cuts that we talked about in the form of furloughs and et cetera. Going forward, I think you'll see even more of Summit coming from a more balanced approach across the income statement as initially, as Bill has commented before, the first rounds of Summit were really in the SG&A area. There'll be more going forward, but I think as a relative basis, sort of last quarter, we talked some about the SLA changes, which, by the way, are going very, very well. Those will continue to stack incremental benefits going forward, and some of that, obviously, will be in the cost of sales line. 
As it relates to the tax refund, I think that was the last question. We did have about $27 million of cash refunds in the quarter as compared to prior year. Last year, we actually paid more on a cash basis. So if you're looking at AFFO, it's almost a $35 million swing year-on-year. That's onetime, and we -- those were for prior year refunds that we were -- we've received during the quarter. So thanks for those questions, Sheila."

So look, the customer churn is actually, we think, a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that's when -- I made the comment in my introductory remarks that when we kind of normalize in a post-COVID world, on one",771,"On the records business. Yes. So look, the customer churn is actually, we think, a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that's when -- I made the comment in my introductory remarks that when we kind of normalize in a post-COVID world, on one side, we would expect the pause. In other words, we don't expect the same drag on incoming volume. But on permanent withdrawals is that we saw a downtick in this quarter because people are not in the office or making active decisions to actually withdraw. So we expect it to kind of go -- revert back to normal levels. But if you kind of look at overall volume, I think the question behind your question is what do we think is going to happen to volume when we get out of COVID. So on one side, we would expect permanent withdrawals to go up, back to normalized levels. But on the other side is we would expect incoming volume from our customers to come back up. 
And so to give you kind of a bit of science around that, if it's helpful, is let's, first of all, kind of anchor on what we see with our customers right now in this environment in terms of activity. So last week, I was in New York and New Jersey, and had a catch-up with -- on one evening with the President and Chief Operating Officer of a large global bank that's based in New York. And we were comparing notes on how many people come back to the office, et cetera. And what he shared with me is that at the depth of the crisis, say, in April, they had less than 3% of their workforce coming into the office. And where they were standing -- when I was meeting with them last week, in July, they had invited 20% of the people to come back and only 6% came back, and you're probably seeing similar things in BAML.
So then let's kind of say what -- how has that translated in the activity we see in terms of incoming boxes? When I say that, where are we going to end when we have COVID in the rearview mirror? So if we look at incoming boxes in April, so if you remember, like, in their case, only 3% of their people, less than 3% of the people are coming into the office, we were down 58% in North America. I'm just taking North America as an example, as a proxy. We're down 58% on incoming box volume. If we look at the quarter, as Barry mentioned, we're down about 47% overall in North America in terms of incoming box. 
Now if you look at July, we're down about 38%. So basically, July is about a 20% improvement from what we saw on average in Q2. So if we were down, say, 4 million, 4.5 million cubic feet due to -- in Q2 from our records management business or net we said minus 3.8 million cubic feet, we're 4.5 million cubic feet worse than normal. But let's say we were down negative 3.8 million cubic feet, then we would say that based on a 20% -- the 20% improvement that we've seen in July is worst-case scenario, you project that forward, is we're down about 3 million cubic feet a quarter, right? So that's 12 million cubic feet on an annualized basis. 
Now we don't expect it to plateau at these levels, obviously, because we're still only running at, in financial services, less than 6% of the people that are coming to work. But with 6% -- even if we plateau at the current levels we're seeing, is you'd be a 12 million annual drag, a negative 12 million annual drag on our records management business in terms of physical storage. And that's before adding consumer back in. So when you net it all out is that, worst case, especially with the offset that we get from consumer is that we think that adding our normal price of 2% to 3%, it's manageable. What a most likely scenario is we'll continue to see improvement. People will start -- I don't think we're going to stay at 6% of the workforce coming to the office. It will go back up. And that's why when I said in our remarks, is we expect in a post-COVID world is we'll be kind of flattish to slightly up in the records management business and then consumer will drive additional growth on top of that. I don't know if that's helpful."

Let me start by saying, I hope you've all continued to stay safe and healthy in these trying times. Before we get into a discussion of our second quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to touch on 2 topics that are top of mind for many of us in the current environment. 
First, the killings of George Floyd and countless others have left me and my colleagues upset, angered and heartbroken. I want to reiterate that racism, discrimination and hate have no place at Iron Mountain. Our commitment and stated as one of our core 5 values for many years to equality, inclusivity and diversity is part of our belief that our people are our greatest assets. Given this fact, we must continually attract, listen to and develop a broad talent pool reflecting our global demographics in order to deliver to our customers and protect our future. These tragic events have sparked difficult but important self-reflection and conversations within our organization about how well we are living up to our stated value and to commit ourselves to do much better. It is up to us to work together, educate ourselves and encourage open dialogue to promote proactive measures to help eliminate incorrect biases and spread awareness, not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because we will only be successful in serving our customers if we attract and retain the best talent. 
Having the best talent can only happen if we are recruiting and developing people from diverse backgrounds across the broader demographics we operate in. We remain strongly committed toward taking decisive and strategic action to create a truly inclusive Iron Mountain. We're committed to listening, learning and taking the necessary actions to support long-term positive change for the black community specifically and people from all backgrounds in general. Whilst we cannot change the past, we had an opportunity as an organization and as individuals to positively impact the future and help fix the racial inequality prevalent in our society. 
Now I'd like to update you on the impact we are seeing with respect to COVID-19. As you all know, the virus is unfortunately still spreading across the globe. My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been affected by the virus, including those who have fallen ill as well as their loved ones and their caregivers. As always, our top priority remains the healthy and safety of our Mountaineers, their families and our customers. I want to acknowledge and thank the many Mountaineers around the world who, despite extraordinary challenges, have kept their focus on ensuring that Iron Mountain continues to move forward during these uncertain times and doing so with a view towards safety. 
This was all brought home to me again last week during a visit I made to Northern New Jersey, so I could thank our frontline teams personally. One of our couriers relayed how he has been serving a large metro New York health system every day through the crisis and how thankful the customer is for our continued service. This particular customer went so far to send one of their doctors to our facility to assist in the protocols and training to protect our staff. For me, this is what it means to be in a true partnership with our customers.  
Whilst we continue to serve many customers during this crisis, as you would expect, our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to office closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. Fortunately, 100% of our records management facilities are now open and operating across the globe. However, many of our global customers continue to operate at significantly lower capacities due to existing restrictions depending on geography. As a result, global demand for many of our core service offerings declined during the quarter. 
Looking back, no one could have anticipated the magnitude of the impact from this pandemic on the global economy and our own business. However, our team moved quickly to assess the risks, understand the consequences and take decisive action to ensure the safety of our employees, customers and communities. As I mentioned, these various decisions have not been made lightly. And we are aware of their consequences, especially for our Mountaineers that have been impacted by furloughs and other temporary and, in some cases, permanent actions. 
We told you in May that approximately 1/3 of our global workforce has been impacted by these actions in an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity. Fortunately, we have been able to bring a number of our Mountaineers back to work. So at this time, this number has decreased to approximately 20% of our global workforce. Furthermore, the mix has shifted over the past few months, so fewer of the impacted employees are on full furlough and a higher percentage are working reduced hours or using vacation or sick times. 
At this time, we have also reopened all our corporate offices with the exception of London, which we plan to open at the beginning of September. We are practicing strict protocols around social distancing and as such, the majority of our salaried workforce is continuing to work remotely. We should note, we have been strong -- we have seen strong productivity rates from work -- with working from home. That being said, given some of the increased stresses of working remotely, we continue to monitor and care for our Mountaineers' mental health and resiliency as part of our overall focus on wellness. 
Turning to our financial performance. Our continued navigation of this challenging and uncertain environment has delivered a second quarter performance that further demonstrates, improves the durability and resilience of our people and ultimately, our business model. I'll touch on a few highlights here. Q2 constant currency revenue declined $58 million or 5.6% year-over-year, driven entirely by a 21% decline in our service revenue. This was partly offset by strong storage revenue growth, which increased 3.7%. The early benefits of Project Summit are evident, as we delivered constant currency adjusted EBITDA line in line with the year ago level despite the revenue decline, leading to a 200 basis point margin expansion. Barry will review the rest of the Q2 financials in more detail.  
Looking at our service business, we have seen improvements in activity levels across the various product lines since the end of April, as global economies are starting to reopen and customers are increasingly utilizing our core service offerings in many geographies. However, the pace of our recovery still remains uncertain. Whilst the revenue decline wasn't as steep as we expected when we last spoke in early May, we continue to see some risk around the second half depending upon what happens with the progression of the virus and possible additional restrictions on a country-by-country and state-by-state basis as they continue to fight specific localized outbreaks of the virus.  
Turning now to our core storage business. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, supported by strong revenue management contribution. Moreover, we saw cash collections improve, both in absolute terms year-on-year as well as by 2 days outstanding. This level of organic revenue growth underscores the durability and essential nature of our storage business and our ability to continue to generate substantial cash flow.  
Total organic volume declined 1.8 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this decrease was in records management volume, partly offset by a 2 million cubic foot increase in consumer and others.  
Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 3.9 million cubic feet compared to the first quarter. This shouldn't be surprising based on the decline of incoming boxes in April and a decline of 45% for the quarter.  
We have been asked by many investors as to what we see happening to physical volume post-COVID. So let me take a step back and provide some further context on organic records management volume. We estimate that the impact from COVID in Q2 was somewhere between 4 million and 4.5 million cubic feet, net of a slowdown in permanent withdrawals. If we continue to normalize Q2 for similar levels of volume in Q1, combined with our expectation for a pickup in permanent withdrawals, volume would be flat to slightly up on a normalized basis. To get to a total physical volume impact, I will now factor in consumer performance.  
In the second quarter, we added 2 million cubic feet. Analyzing this would imply we would be net positive 8 million cubic feet or approximately 1% volume growth on a base of total physical volume of more than 720 million cubic feet. However, Q2 is a seasonally highest point for consumer business, so this would be overly optimistic to assume for a full year. When we net all this out in a post-COVID world, we would expect physical storage volume growth to be roughly 0.5%, with volume from records management flat to slightly up with a small net positive growth coming from consumer. It should be noted that this is all before the contribution from our normal price increases, which generally add approximately 2% to 3% to the volume growth, yielding approximately 3% organic storage revenue growth from the physical side of the business. However, when we will see this reversion to post-COVID normalized business environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly not before the end -- before the second half of 2021. 
Despite the stress and strains from dealing with COVID's impact, we have not let up on our investments in innovation. Specifically in the quarter, we had many instances where we were able to serve our customers with a focus on delivering innovative solutions in order to help them navigate their challenges that have arisen from COVID-19. For example, regarding the commercial impact, in April, pipeline of more traditional offerings was down 40% versus the same period last year due to COVID and the resulting lower economic activity. However, we recovered 1/3 of this loss through new solutions we recently launched that help address our customers' needs during this time. This is just one demonstration of the resiliency and dedication of our Mountaineers as we expect many of these solutions to be additive to our top and bottom lines even after our base activities rebound.  
Turning now to our global data center segment. This business continues to perform exceptionally well, delivering strong results in the second quarter. In June, we announced a 27-megawatt data center lease with a U.S.-based Fortune 100 customer in Frankfurt, Germany. This customer will occupy the entire Frankfurt facility, which should result in stabilization significantly sooner than we originally anticipated when we purchased the land last year.  
In addition, we signed a 3-megawatt data center lease with a Fortune Global 200 company in Singapore, another signal of strong momentum in that market. These bigger deals have been won alongside a series of smaller but significant agreements, including a number of new logos. We welcomed an online gaming platform, a state government and a global logistics supplier -- provider to the IMDC ecosystem in Q2. All of this has contributed to a strong performance in the first half of the year with nearly 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases signed against our initial guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts for the full year. Given this great success in the first half of the year, we now expect to be able to sign leases for a total of 45 to 50 megawatts this year or an additional 10-plus megawatts of leasing in the back half. I would like to congratulate the entire data center team for an exceptional first half performance. Thank you.  
Based on the strength of our pipeline, we will continue to prioritize investment in data center growth. We are actively building our capacity across our global footprint with new development projects started in Amsterdam, Singapore and Phoenix. In early July, we completed the first phase of 4 megawatts at our new building on our Northern Virginia Campus, and customers are already deploying.  
As I mentioned earlier, Project Summit is already paying dividends. No one could have predicted the depth or breadth of this pandemic when we first announced Project Summit in October 2019. Thankfully, the decisive actions we took early in the program allowed us to reconfigure our cost structure as well as realign our organization to be more nimble and customer centric. These changes enabled us to be more responsive in delivering new solutions to our customers' specific needs during the crisis as well as matching our costs to a changing demand environment. In addition to the cost reduction Project Summit has achieved, as demonstrated by our increased margin, we have also made progress on the next phase in improving our customer intelligence as well as simplifying our IT systems. One such example being our master data management initiative. Through this initiative, we're improving the platforms and processes that handle all of our data. This intelligence will allow us to better understand and serve our customers, making data an asset for our business.  
Finally, I'm also very pleased with the initial success we have seen from the recent changes to our service delivery model. The rollout of the SLA changes or service level agreement changes we discussed last quarter have gone smoothly. We have already seen the early benefits of denser routes and less frequent pickups and deliveries. Our Image on Demand service has seen an increase in activity as more customers look for solutions, which include the use of digital solutions as it helps them integrate more contactless process to reduce infection risk at their businesses.  
A recent survey indicated that more of our customers are interested in converting to digital versus physical delivery. In particular, our customers tell us they value speed of delivery, ease of use and security as the most important considerations when evaluating the use of Image on Demand.  
To summarize, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge provided confirmation that the changes we have made to our organization and the investments we have made in the recent past were the right ones. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends, and we have demonstrated that we can provide the necessary solutions to help our customers adapt to their new unexpected work environment. Despite the unprecedented volatility of COVID-19, we remain focused on long-term growth in doing what's right for the health of our employees, our customers and our business.  
Importantly, we have also recommitted ourselves in our fight against racial injustice prevalent in our societies around the globe and in creating an inclusive and diverse workforce. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a durable business model, which are helping us successfully navigate this challenging period whilst providing us with the flexibility to continue investing in our long-term growth plans, which go beyond Project Summit. As Barry shared with you last quarter, we are proactively managing expenses and have additional levers to further adjust our cost structure if necessary and appropriate.  
In closing, whilst the high degree of uncertainty remains as we look to the back half of the year, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our customers today, and we will continue to provide innovative products and services that address their evolving business needs. Our confidence is further shared by our bondholders as evidenced by our $2.4 billion issuance to refinance some of our notes. Strong investor confidence and demand allowed us to upsize our transaction as well as extend our maturity profile.  
On behalf of the leadership team, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our frontline Mountaineers who have kept our operations running seamlessly to serve our customers. Stay safe and well.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy.  We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment",1972,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy.  
We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. Before I go into the detail of our results, let me touch on the impact COVID-19 has had on our service trends.  
As we noted on our last conference call, for the second quarter, we were planning for service declines consistent with what we experienced in April. This proved to be slightly conservative. While May was consistent with April, we saw an improving trend across most of our service lines in June.  
To provide investors with as much visibility as possible, I want to share more information than we typically do, including the monthly progression of service activity. As compared to last year, our global service activities declined 37% in April, 38% in May and 21% in June. This resulted in an average decline for the second quarter of 32%. While trends have naturally varied some by market, these are generally representative of what we've experienced around the globe. A notable call out is Latin America, where, consistent with macro headlines, the business has generally lagged the recovery elsewhere. To put that in context, this region represents approximately 5% of our revenue.  
In North America, we saw a year-on-year decline of 36% in April, 37% in May and 22% in June. Our core storage business, which accounts for nearly 2/3 of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability, has demonstrated its durability as we continue to grow organic storage rental revenue during the pandemic. As a reminder, the stability of this business is built on the fact that over 97% of our annual storage revenue is generated by boxes that entered our facilities in prior years.  
And now turning to enterprise results for the second quarter. Revenue of $982 million decreased 7.9% on a reported basis year-on-year, reflecting service declines as well as the stronger dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 5.6%. Total organic revenue declined 7.2%. Organic service revenue declined 23.1%, reflecting the COVID impact. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, supported by revenue management. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.3% to $343 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA was in line with last year despite a $58 million revenue decline. During the second quarter, we incurred $9 million of cost as a result of COVID-19 for items such as PPE and specialized cleaning of our facilities, which have been excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 34.9%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.22 compared to $0.23 in the second quarter of 2019. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our commentary last quarter. AFFO was $249 million, up 19% year-over-year. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the increase in AFFO was primarily driven by tax refund.  
Turning to segment performance, starting with the global RIM organization. In the second quarter, records management experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 45% for new boxes inbounded and 43% for retrievals and refiles. Permanent withdrawals declined 34% and destructions were down 1%. Data management saw less of an impact with activity down 10%.  
Our global digital solutions business has continued to perform well, with revenue consistent year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Given the diverse mix of products and services in this business, we use revenue as the best indicator of activity.  
In our shred business, activity declined approximately 24%, which has also resulted in lower paper tonnage. The industry saw an increase in the price for recycled paper in April and May, which we believe was partially the result of elevated consumer purchases of paper products. For the second quarter, our average realized price was 15% higher than the prior year, which was a $2 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Prices continued to be volatile, with sequential declines in June and July. The consumer storage business has seen an increase in demand and performed ahead of our expectations. These service activity levels contributed to a total organic revenue decline of 7.5% in the global RIM business. The decline was partially offset by storage volume growth in faster-growing markets and revenue management.  
In the second quarter, we took aggressive actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, which helped bring costs more in line with activity levels. Naturally, we also experienced a level of fixed cost deleverage. As these cost actions are temporary in nature and distinct from Project Summit, we continue to expect them to come back as revenue recovers.  
Our global RIM business delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 240 basis points to 43.8%. This improvement was driven by Project Summit, revenue management and favorable mix.  
Turning to global data center. The business delivered organic revenue growth of 7.6%, driven by strong leasing in prior periods and low churn of 80 basis points. This was partially offset by a mark-to-market decline in Phoenix resulting from an early contract renewal of a large legacy IO customer. Global data center's adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% represents an increase of 140 basis points, consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion as our platform scales. As Bill noted, the data center team delivered very strong bookings in the first half of the year, signing almost 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including pre-leasing 100% of our Frankfurt facility currently under development. As we have said before, we are reviewing potential third-party capital options, particularly related to stabilized assets, and we will keep you updated in the second half.  
Turning to our adjacent businesses. The fine arts industry has continued to experience the impact of COVID, and we have seen activity down approximately 85%. On the other hand, our entertainment services business has shown resilience as activity has remained in line with pre-COVID levels.  
As to Project Summit, in the second quarter, we recognized $39 million of restructuring charges and an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $40 million. Through the first half, we have delivered $65 million of benefit. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit of $150 million and restructuring charges of $240 million in 2020. This keeps us on pace to deliver $375 million of expected total program benefits exiting 2021.  
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the second quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement of nearly 4 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables days and day sales outstandings. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term.  
With the COVID backdrop, I think the team's performance, particularly on cash collections, was very strong. Despite a decline in revenue, our cash collections were up year-on-year in June. I will note that given the pandemic's impact on the macro economy, we took a prudent view regarding receivables and increased our bad debt expense in the quarter. I'd like to briefly expand on the recent bond offering that Bill mentioned. We appreciate the investment community's strong support, which resulted in our ability to upsize the transaction in June to $2.4 billion. This leverage-neutral offering increased our weighted average maturity by almost 2 years, while only modestly increasing our cost of debt.  
In the second quarter, we recognized debt extinguishment charges of approximately $17 million related to a write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call premiums. Due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes, at quarter end, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet. We paid off that note on July 2, and as a result we anticipate recording an additional $15 million of debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter. Pro forma for this payoff, we had $1.2 billion of liquidity, which provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. We have been able to maintain liquidity at this level since April, even while continuing to fund innovation and growth initiatives as well as supporting our sustainable dividend.  
We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4x, which takes into account certain adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.6x, which would represent a slight decline year-on-year as we make progress toward our long-term leverage range.  
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October.  
Now let me provide an update as to our expectations for the remainder of the year. With the impact of COVID, we are planning for reported revenue to be down less than 5% for the full year compared to 2019. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates of approximately $75 million for revenue and almost $25 million for adjusted EBITDA as compared to last year.  
Turning to our expectations for our storage and service businesses. For the full year, we currently expect a decline in net organic storage volume of 1% to 1.5%. We expect reported storage rental revenue in the second half to grow on year-on-year at a rate that approaches what we delivered in the second quarter. As to service, our July activity levels were down 24% globally. We are currently planning for third quarter activity to be consistent with what we experienced in July. This implies a service revenue decline in the high teens year-on-year in the third quarter. With an expectation for a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter, we are planning for full year service revenue declines in the mid-teens. We are approaching adjusted EBITDA margins with a level of conservatism and plan for both the third and fourth quarters to be flat to slightly up year-on-year. This would result in us delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion slightly above 100 basis points relative to last year, which reflects an improvement as compared to our comments on our last call. This reflects our solid first half performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions as well as a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to capital expenditures. We have increased our full year expectation to approximately $525 million or an increase of $50 million from the midpoint of our previous outlook. You should expect this increase to be evenly split between recurring CapEx and data center growth investment, given the better-than-expected performance in the core business as well as our growing data center pipeline. 
As to AFFO, the team is focused on delivering at a level approaching last year's result, including the benefit of our second quarter tax refund. As it relates to capital recycling, our outlook has not changed. We continue to expect to generate proceeds of approximately $100 million this year. As we look at the back half, we have a strong pipeline of transactions and continue to see attractive valuations with historically low cap rates in the industrial real estate market. 
While the second quarter was a challenging one for our service business, we are confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results they have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our third quarter earnings call. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

I'll let Barry answer the last one in more detail. I think the -- but the answer to -- the short answer to your question is, yes, we continue to like the idea of third-party capital for stabilized assets, but I'll let Barry give you a full answer on that. 
On the first one in terms of -- thanks for the question, Eric, on innovation and the importance of that, not just in a post-COVID world, but absolutely in the current environment. We continue to see traction on some of the things I highlighted last time in terms of what I'd call remote collaboration and collaborating remotely. Like I gave the example last time, I think, on unemployment benefits where we're actually facilitating folks to be able to be working away from home and both receive the applications for unemployment and approve it. And then also some of the areas around mailroom which, again, I think I highlighted the last time. 
One area I would add in addition to that. So we've continued to see more and more traction for those kinds of solutions. One area, too, that we've seen a good uptick in the recent past is what we call our Clean Start program. And the Clean Start program is something that we launched a year ago, which is really helping people to reimagine their needs for their office space and get information flows to be more seamless when they are at work and then also to get things off-site for things that they don't need around the office and allows them to work in a much more flexible way. 
And when we came into COVID, that actually got -- the brakes got put on that because part of the Clean Start was we would go into offices and do surveys and working with their real estate people to help them reimagine and rebuild their work processes. And some of that, the exhaust to that process obviously is storage, but also some of the other services that we provide as Iron Mountain. 
When we got into the crisis, our real estate team, product management, sales and marketing team collaborated, and they created a Clean Start kit in a box, if you will. So what we've done is we've been able to put that together in a kit that allows us to deliver the same type of assessment and survey virtually without actually going into their offices. And we just recently, for instance, had a very large win with a global insurance company that was selling part of its insurance portfolio to a life insurance company, where we not only did -- facilitated moving sensitive records, many containing PII or personal identifiable information across to that new owner of those policies and that information, but transfer a number of their employees across and at the same time, help them repurpose their -- the real estate footprint that they were left with. So it was kind of real estate optimization, helping them transfer a business to another person, transfer people and then take a step back and say, how can we actually improve the information flow in what they have left. So that just gives you another flavor of the types of things that we're finding out there."

We think it's an attractive way to improve returns for the company, and we see a lot of opportunity there.

I would say look, our service business performed better throughout the -- in the quarter than we had anticipated. As you know, on the last call, we noted that we thought we'd use April as a proxy going forward for the entire second quarter. 
April and May, generally speaking, really across the world and across our various service activity lines were very consistent. Shred was down kind of high 20s in April, about 30% in May. It also recovered just like, directionally, the rest of the business, was down in the vicinity of 10% on activity basis in June and kind of stayed at that level in July. I would say that, that trajectory of improvement in June, as I noted, was really pervasive across all of our activities. 
As it relates to paper price, in particular, the way I would think about this, Adam, is on our last call, we were -- well, in the first quarter, we had a $10 million hit to EBITDA from paper prices, as you recall. And on our last call, we thought that we would have kind of low to mid-single-digit dollar decline as a result of paper price for each of the next couple of quarters. We actually had a $2 million positive to EBITDA, as I mentioned on the call. Now I will say that paper prices have been very volatile and have been declining quite significantly over the last couple of months. You've probably seen that in the industry data. I know you follow that. And so our view for the back half is that it will be basically neutral year-on-year as it relates to EBITDA."

In other words, we -- most of the hyperscalers we were serving in some aspects, but not necessarily in large hyperscale deployment. 
I think overall, though, if you look at our pipeline, I would say that whilst it's right to say on -- in terms of volume that we sell these to one hyperscaler who can kind of skew what that looks like, is we're still seeing a good mix. So I think last quarter, we were approaching back up to about 50% from kind of existing Iron Mountain or existing data center customers. This quarter, it was a little bit lower, especially if you use the filter I'm saying, breaking the hyperscalers into 2 buckets. But overall, I think we still continue to see the pipeline. I think that some of the new logos that I highlighted that we brought in this time were because of existing Iron Mountain relationships in, say, our data management business and the type of cross-selling that you would see. 
But if you look at specifically this quarter, what we're most excited about this quarter is that we think we're beginning to be established in the deal flow, if you will, for hyperscale deployment. In other words, hyperscalers know that we're out there, and we see -- we're seeing the RFIs, just like everybody else's. So we're pretty excited. So this quarter was kind of skewed, I would say, to kind of newish customers. But overall, the pipeline is still kind of in that 50% level."

So first, on Singapore, we're continuing to keep an eye on it because, as you probably realize, we're tracking on a track that we're going to be sold out in Singapore pretty soon. So you're right that the government has put a pause on it. We have heard the -- it just so happens that our Head of Asia data centers is a Singaporean based in Singapore. So he stays pretty close to the government. We are seeing that the government seems to be making noises to relax that a little bit sooner than they initially guided, say, a year ago. So we're optimistic. And obviously, we're starting to -- or have been for a number of months now looking at how we could actually expand our footprint in Singapore. As I said, the -- we're well on track to fill out the old Credit Suisse data center fairly soon. 
On Amsterdam, interesting, we have actually quite a bit of land permitted. So we've been less engaged with the government trying to relax that. On the other side, it's exactly, as you said, is we've seen even a number of people who have their own data centers in the Amsterdam market, for instance, coming in and starting to look to add capacity in our facilities because of the permitting issue that you've described. And obviously, Amsterdam is a highly connected market and our facility has a high level of connectivity within it.

I think the team is very aligned and they're very focused on delivering. I think the total company is energized by the fact that this is really an opportunity to transform the company and support our customers that much better. 
In terms of how it's stacking up, the second quarter of $40 million benefit year-on-year was right in line, if not a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. So we're at $65 million year-to-date. And obviously, those are elevated levels as compared to what we were expecting earlier as we increased the benefit this year, last quarter. So we're well on track to deliver $150 million of benefit this year. My guess is that next year, we will have another $150 million to $200 million of incremental benefit, and we'll exit next year at a run rate that has all of the benefit, the entire $375 million by 2022, so a little small amount of incremental benefit there in 2022 to plan for your models. 
In terms of where it's coming from, it's generally been thus far probably in the vicinity of 70%, 75% from SG&A and the balance in cost of sales. You'll note, as you're looking at our performance this quarter, our cost of sales, obviously down a lot more, and that reflects the fact that we made those temporary cost cuts that we talked about in the form of furloughs and et cetera. Going forward, I think you'll see even more of Summit coming from a more balanced approach across the income statement as initially, as Bill has commented before, the first rounds of Summit were really in the SG&A area. There'll be more going forward, but I think as a relative basis, sort of last quarter, we talked some about the SLA changes, which, by the way, are going very, very well. Those will continue to stack incremental benefits going forward, and some of that, obviously, will be in the cost of sales line. 
As it relates to the tax refund, I think that was the last question. We did have about $27 million of cash refunds in the quarter as compared to prior year. Last year, we actually paid more on a cash basis. So if you're looking at AFFO, it's almost a $35 million swing year-on-year. That's onetime, and we -- those were for prior year refunds that we were -- we've received during the quarter. So thanks for those questions, Sheila."

So look, the customer churn is actually, we think, a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that's when -- I made the comment in my introductory remarks that when we kind of normalize in a post-COVID world, on one",771,"On the records business. Yes. So look, the customer churn is actually, we think, a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that's when -- I made the comment in my introductory remarks that when we kind of normalize in a post-COVID world, on one side, we would expect the pause. In other words, we don't expect the same drag on incoming volume. But on permanent withdrawals is that we saw a downtick in this quarter because people are not in the office or making active decisions to actually withdraw. So we expect it to kind of go -- revert back to normal levels. But if you kind of look at overall volume, I think the question behind your question is what do we think is going to happen to volume when we get out of COVID. So on one side, we would expect permanent withdrawals to go up, back to normalized levels. But on the other side is we would expect incoming volume from our customers to come back up. 
And so to give you kind of a bit of science around that, if it's helpful, is let's, first of all, kind of anchor on what we see with our customers right now in this environment in terms of activity. So last week, I was in New York and New Jersey, and had a catch-up with -- on one evening with the President and Chief Operating Officer of a large global bank that's based in New York. And we were comparing notes on how many people come back to the office, et cetera. And what he shared with me is that at the depth of the crisis, say, in April, they had less than 3% of their workforce coming into the office. And where they were standing -- when I was meeting with them last week, in July, they had invited 20% of the people to come back and only 6% came back, and you're probably seeing similar things in BAML.
So then let's kind of say what -- how has that translated in the activity we see in terms of incoming boxes? When I say that, where are we going to end when we have COVID in the rearview mirror? So if we look at incoming boxes in April, so if you remember, like, in their case, only 3% of their people, less than 3% of the people are coming into the office, we were down 58% in North America. I'm just taking North America as an example, as a proxy. We're down 58% on incoming box volume. If we look at the quarter, as Barry mentioned, we're down about 47% overall in North America in terms of incoming box. 
Now if you look at July, we're down about 38%. So basically, July is about a 20% improvement from what we saw on average in Q2. So if we were down, say, 4 million, 4.5 million cubic feet due to -- in Q2 from our records management business or net we said minus 3.8 million cubic feet, we're 4.5 million cubic feet worse than normal. But let's say we were down negative 3.8 million cubic feet, then we would say that based on a 20% -- the 20% improvement that we've seen in July is worst-case scenario, you project that forward, is we're down about 3 million cubic feet a quarter, right? So that's 12 million cubic feet on an annualized basis. 
Now we don't expect it to plateau at these levels, obviously, because we're still only running at, in financial services, less than 6% of the people that are coming to work. But with 6% -- even if we plateau at the current levels we're seeing, is you'd be a 12 million annual drag, a negative 12 million annual drag on our records management business in terms of physical storage. And that's before adding consumer back in. So when you net it all out is that, worst case, especially with the offset that we get from consumer is that we think that adding our normal price of 2% to 3%, it's manageable. What a most likely scenario is we'll continue to see improvement. People will start -- I don't think we're going to stay at 6% of the workforce coming to the office. It will go back up. And that's why when I said in our remarks, is we expect in a post-COVID world is we'll be kind of flattish to slightly up in the records management business and then consumer will drive additional growth on top of that. I don't know if that's helpful."

Let me start by saying, I hope you've all continued to stay safe and healthy in these trying times. Before we get into a discussion of our second quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to touch on 2 topics that are top of mind for many of us in the current environment. 
First, the killings of George Floyd and countless others have left me and my colleagues upset, angered and heartbroken. I want to reiterate that racism, discrimination and hate have no place at Iron Mountain. Our commitment and stated as one of our core 5 values for many years to equality, inclusivity and diversity is part of our belief that our people are our greatest assets. Given this fact, we must continually attract, listen to and develop a broad talent pool reflecting our global demographics in order to deliver to our customers and protect our future. These tragic events have sparked difficult but important self-reflection and conversations within our organization about how well we are living up to our stated value and to commit ourselves to do much better. It is up to us to work together, educate ourselves and encourage open dialogue to promote proactive measures to help eliminate incorrect biases and spread awareness, not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because we will only be successful in serving our customers if we attract and retain the best talent. 
Having the best talent can only happen if we are recruiting and developing people from diverse backgrounds across the broader demographics we operate in. We remain strongly committed toward taking decisive and strategic action to create a truly inclusive Iron Mountain. We're committed to listening, learning and taking the necessary actions to support long-term positive change for the black community specifically and people from all backgrounds in general. Whilst we cannot change the past, we had an opportunity as an organization and as individuals to positively impact the future and help fix the racial inequality prevalent in our society. 
Now I'd like to update you on the impact we are seeing with respect to COVID-19. As you all know, the virus is unfortunately still spreading across the globe. My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been affected by the virus, including those who have fallen ill as well as their loved ones and their caregivers. As always, our top priority remains the healthy and safety of our Mountaineers, their families and our customers. I want to acknowledge and thank the many Mountaineers around the world who, despite extraordinary challenges, have kept their focus on ensuring that Iron Mountain continues to move forward during these uncertain times and doing so with a view towards safety. 
This was all brought home to me again last week during a visit I made to Northern New Jersey, so I could thank our frontline teams personally. One of our couriers relayed how he has been serving a large metro New York health system every day through the crisis and how thankful the customer is for our continued service. This particular customer went so far to send one of their doctors to our facility to assist in the protocols and training to protect our staff. For me, this is what it means to be in a true partnership with our customers.  
Whilst we continue to serve many customers during this crisis, as you would expect, our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to office closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. Fortunately, 100% of our records management facilities are now open and operating across the globe. However, many of our global customers continue to operate at significantly lower capacities due to existing restrictions depending on geography. As a result, global demand for many of our core service offerings declined during the quarter. 
Looking back, no one could have anticipated the magnitude of the impact from this pandemic on the global economy and our own business. However, our team moved quickly to assess the risks, understand the consequences and take decisive action to ensure the safety of our employees, customers and communities. As I mentioned, these various decisions have not been made lightly. And we are aware of their consequences, especially for our Mountaineers that have been impacted by furloughs and other temporary and, in some cases, permanent actions. 
We told you in May that approximately 1/3 of our global workforce has been impacted by these actions in an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity. Fortunately, we have been able to bring a number of our Mountaineers back to work. So at this time, this number has decreased to approximately 20% of our global workforce. Furthermore, the mix has shifted over the past few months, so fewer of the impacted employees are on full furlough and a higher percentage are working reduced hours or using vacation or sick times. 
At this time, we have also reopened all our corporate offices with the exception of London, which we plan to open at the beginning of September. We are practicing strict protocols around social distancing and as such, the majority of our salaried workforce is continuing to work remotely. We should note, we have been strong -- we have seen strong productivity rates from work -- with working from home. That being said, given some of the increased stresses of working remotely, we continue to monitor and care for our Mountaineers' mental health and resiliency as part of our overall focus on wellness. 
Turning to our financial performance. Our continued navigation of this challenging and uncertain environment has delivered a second quarter performance that further demonstrates, improves the durability and resilience of our people and ultimately, our business model. I'll touch on a few highlights here. Q2 constant currency revenue declined $58 million or 5.6% year-over-year, driven entirely by a 21% decline in our service revenue. This was partly offset by strong storage revenue growth, which increased 3.7%. The early benefits of Project Summit are evident, as we delivered constant currency adjusted EBITDA line in line with the year ago level despite the revenue decline, leading to a 200 basis point margin expansion. Barry will review the rest of the Q2 financials in more detail.  
Looking at our service business, we have seen improvements in activity levels across the various product lines since the end of April, as global economies are starting to reopen and customers are increasingly utilizing our core service offerings in many geographies. However, the pace of our recovery still remains uncertain. Whilst the revenue decline wasn't as steep as we expected when we last spoke in early May, we continue to see some risk around the second half depending upon what happens with the progression of the virus and possible additional restrictions on a country-by-country and state-by-state basis as they continue to fight specific localized outbreaks of the virus.  
Turning now to our core storage business. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, supported by strong revenue management contribution. Moreover, we saw cash collections improve, both in absolute terms year-on-year as well as by 2 days outstanding. This level of organic revenue growth underscores the durability and essential nature of our storage business and our ability to continue to generate substantial cash flow.  
Total organic volume declined 1.8 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this decrease was in records management volume, partly offset by a 2 million cubic foot increase in consumer and others.  
Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 3.9 million cubic feet compared to the first quarter. This shouldn't be surprising based on the decline of incoming boxes in April and a decline of 45% for the quarter.  
We have been asked by many investors as to what we see happening to physical volume post-COVID. So let me take a step back and provide some further context on organic records management volume. We estimate that the impact from COVID in Q2 was somewhere between 4 million and 4.5 million cubic feet, net of a slowdown in permanent withdrawals. If we continue to normalize Q2 for similar levels of volume in Q1, combined with our expectation for a pickup in permanent withdrawals, volume would be flat to slightly up on a normalized basis. To get to a total physical volume impact, I will now factor in consumer performance.  
In the second quarter, we added 2 million cubic feet. Analyzing this would imply we would be net positive 8 million cubic feet or approximately 1% volume growth on a base of total physical volume of more than 720 million cubic feet. However, Q2 is a seasonally highest point for consumer business, so this would be overly optimistic to assume for a full year. When we net all this out in a post-COVID world, we would expect physical storage volume growth to be roughly 0.5%, with volume from records management flat to slightly up with a small net positive growth coming from consumer. It should be noted that this is all before the contribution from our normal price increases, which generally add approximately 2% to 3% to the volume growth, yielding approximately 3% organic storage revenue growth from the physical side of the business. However, when we will see this reversion to post-COVID normalized business environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly not before the end -- before the second half of 2021. 
Despite the stress and strains from dealing with COVID's impact, we have not let up on our investments in innovation. Specifically in the quarter, we had many instances where we were able to serve our customers with a focus on delivering innovative solutions in order to help them navigate their challenges that have arisen from COVID-19. For example, regarding the commercial impact, in April, pipeline of more traditional offerings was down 40% versus the same period last year due to COVID and the resulting lower economic activity. However, we recovered 1/3 of this loss through new solutions we recently launched that help address our customers' needs during this time. This is just one demonstration of the resiliency and dedication of our Mountaineers as we expect many of these solutions to be additive to our top and bottom lines even after our base activities rebound.  
Turning now to our global data center segment. This business continues to perform exceptionally well, delivering strong results in the second quarter. In June, we announced a 27-megawatt data center lease with a U.S.-based Fortune 100 customer in Frankfurt, Germany. This customer will occupy the entire Frankfurt facility, which should result in stabilization significantly sooner than we originally anticipated when we purchased the land last year.  
In addition, we signed a 3-megawatt data center lease with a Fortune Global 200 company in Singapore, another signal of strong momentum in that market. These bigger deals have been won alongside a series of smaller but significant agreements, including a number of new logos. We welcomed an online gaming platform, a state government and a global logistics supplier -- provider to the IMDC ecosystem in Q2. All of this has contributed to a strong performance in the first half of the year with nearly 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases signed against our initial guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts for the full year. Given this great success in the first half of the year, we now expect to be able to sign leases for a total of 45 to 50 megawatts this year or an additional 10-plus megawatts of leasing in the back half. I would like to congratulate the entire data center team for an exceptional first half performance. Thank you.  
Based on the strength of our pipeline, we will continue to prioritize investment in data center growth. We are actively building our capacity across our global footprint with new development projects started in Amsterdam, Singapore and Phoenix. In early July, we completed the first phase of 4 megawatts at our new building on our Northern Virginia Campus, and customers are already deploying.  
As I mentioned earlier, Project Summit is already paying dividends. No one could have predicted the depth or breadth of this pandemic when we first announced Project Summit in October 2019. Thankfully, the decisive actions we took early in the program allowed us to reconfigure our cost structure as well as realign our organization to be more nimble and customer centric. These changes enabled us to be more responsive in delivering new solutions to our customers' specific needs during the crisis as well as matching our costs to a changing demand environment. In addition to the cost reduction Project Summit has achieved, as demonstrated by our increased margin, we have also made progress on the next phase in improving our customer intelligence as well as simplifying our IT systems. One such example being our master data management initiative. Through this initiative, we're improving the platforms and processes that handle all of our data. This intelligence will allow us to better understand and serve our customers, making data an asset for our business.  
Finally, I'm also very pleased with the initial success we have seen from the recent changes to our service delivery model. The rollout of the SLA changes or service level agreement changes we discussed last quarter have gone smoothly. We have already seen the early benefits of denser routes and less frequent pickups and deliveries. Our Image on Demand service has seen an increase in activity as more customers look for solutions, which include the use of digital solutions as it helps them integrate more contactless process to reduce infection risk at their businesses.  
A recent survey indicated that more of our customers are interested in converting to digital versus physical delivery. In particular, our customers tell us they value speed of delivery, ease of use and security as the most important considerations when evaluating the use of Image on Demand.  
To summarize, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge provided confirmation that the changes we have made to our organization and the investments we have made in the recent past were the right ones. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends, and we have demonstrated that we can provide the necessary solutions to help our customers adapt to their new unexpected work environment. Despite the unprecedented volatility of COVID-19, we remain focused on long-term growth in doing what's right for the health of our employees, our customers and our business.  
Importantly, we have also recommitted ourselves in our fight against racial injustice prevalent in our societies around the globe and in creating an inclusive and diverse workforce. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a durable business model, which are helping us successfully navigate this challenging period whilst providing us with the flexibility to continue investing in our long-term growth plans, which go beyond Project Summit. As Barry shared with you last quarter, we are proactively managing expenses and have additional levers to further adjust our cost structure if necessary and appropriate.  
In closing, whilst the high degree of uncertainty remains as we look to the back half of the year, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our customers today, and we will continue to provide innovative products and services that address their evolving business needs. Our confidence is further shared by our bondholders as evidenced by our $2.4 billion issuance to refinance some of our notes. Strong investor confidence and demand allowed us to upsize our transaction as well as extend our maturity profile.  
On behalf of the leadership team, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our frontline Mountaineers who have kept our operations running seamlessly to serve our customers. Stay safe and well.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy.  We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment",1972,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy.  
We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. Before I go into the detail of our results, let me touch on the impact COVID-19 has had on our service trends.  
As we noted on our last conference call, for the second quarter, we were planning for service declines consistent with what we experienced in April. This proved to be slightly conservative. While May was consistent with April, we saw an improving trend across most of our service lines in June.  
To provide investors with as much visibility as possible, I want to share more information than we typically do, including the monthly progression of service activity. As compared to last year, our global service activities declined 37% in April, 38% in May and 21% in June. This resulted in an average decline for the second quarter of 32%. While trends have naturally varied some by market, these are generally representative of what we've experienced around the globe. A notable call out is Latin America, where, consistent with macro headlines, the business has generally lagged the recovery elsewhere. To put that in context, this region represents approximately 5% of our revenue.  
In North America, we saw a year-on-year decline of 36% in April, 37% in May and 22% in June. Our core storage business, which accounts for nearly 2/3 of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability, has demonstrated its durability as we continue to grow organic storage rental revenue during the pandemic. As a reminder, the stability of this business is built on the fact that over 97% of our annual storage revenue is generated by boxes that entered our facilities in prior years.  
And now turning to enterprise results for the second quarter. Revenue of $982 million decreased 7.9% on a reported basis year-on-year, reflecting service declines as well as the stronger dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 5.6%. Total organic revenue declined 7.2%. Organic service revenue declined 23.1%, reflecting the COVID impact. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, supported by revenue management. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.3% to $343 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA was in line with last year despite a $58 million revenue decline. During the second quarter, we incurred $9 million of cost as a result of COVID-19 for items such as PPE and specialized cleaning of our facilities, which have been excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 34.9%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.22 compared to $0.23 in the second quarter of 2019. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our commentary last quarter. AFFO was $249 million, up 19% year-over-year. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the increase in AFFO was primarily driven by tax refund.  
Turning to segment performance, starting with the global RIM organization. In the second quarter, records management experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 45% for new boxes inbounded and 43% for retrievals and refiles. Permanent withdrawals declined 34% and destructions were down 1%. Data management saw less of an impact with activity down 10%.  
Our global digital solutions business has continued to perform well, with revenue consistent year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Given the diverse mix of products and services in this business, we use revenue as the best indicator of activity.  
In our shred business, activity declined approximately 24%, which has also resulted in lower paper tonnage. The industry saw an increase in the price for recycled paper in April and May, which we believe was partially the result of elevated consumer purchases of paper products. For the second quarter, our average realized price was 15% higher than the prior year, which was a $2 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Prices continued to be volatile, with sequential declines in June and July. The consumer storage business has seen an increase in demand and performed ahead of our expectations. These service activity levels contributed to a total organic revenue decline of 7.5% in the global RIM business. The decline was partially offset by storage volume growth in faster-growing markets and revenue management.  
In the second quarter, we took aggressive actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, which helped bring costs more in line with activity levels. Naturally, we also experienced a level of fixed cost deleverage. As these cost actions are temporary in nature and distinct from Project Summit, we continue to expect them to come back as revenue recovers.  
Our global RIM business delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 240 basis points to 43.8%. This improvement was driven by Project Summit, revenue management and favorable mix.  
Turning to global data center. The business delivered organic revenue growth of 7.6%, driven by strong leasing in prior periods and low churn of 80 basis points. This was partially offset by a mark-to-market decline in Phoenix resulting from an early contract renewal of a large legacy IO customer. Global data center's adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% represents an increase of 140 basis points, consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion as our platform scales. As Bill noted, the data center team delivered very strong bookings in the first half of the year, signing almost 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including pre-leasing 100% of our Frankfurt facility currently under development. As we have said before, we are reviewing potential third-party capital options, particularly related to stabilized assets, and we will keep you updated in the second half.  
Turning to our adjacent businesses. The fine arts industry has continued to experience the impact of COVID, and we have seen activity down approximately 85%. On the other hand, our entertainment services business has shown resilience as activity has remained in line with pre-COVID levels.  
As to Project Summit, in the second quarter, we recognized $39 million of restructuring charges and an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $40 million. Through the first half, we have delivered $65 million of benefit. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit of $150 million and restructuring charges of $240 million in 2020. This keeps us on pace to deliver $375 million of expected total program benefits exiting 2021.  
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the second quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement of nearly 4 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables days and day sales outstandings. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term.  
With the COVID backdrop, I think the team's performance, particularly on cash collections, was very strong. Despite a decline in revenue, our cash collections were up year-on-year in June. I will note that given the pandemic's impact on the macro economy, we took a prudent view regarding receivables and increased our bad debt expense in the quarter. I'd like to briefly expand on the recent bond offering that Bill mentioned. We appreciate the investment community's strong support, which resulted in our ability to upsize the transaction in June to $2.4 billion. This leverage-neutral offering increased our weighted average maturity by almost 2 years, while only modestly increasing our cost of debt.  
In the second quarter, we recognized debt extinguishment charges of approximately $17 million related to a write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call premiums. Due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes, at quarter end, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet. We paid off that note on July 2, and as a result we anticipate recording an additional $15 million of debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter. Pro forma for this payoff, we had $1.2 billion of liquidity, which provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. We have been able to maintain liquidity at this level since April, even while continuing to fund innovation and growth initiatives as well as supporting our sustainable dividend.  
We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4x, which takes into account certain adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.6x, which would represent a slight decline year-on-year as we make progress toward our long-term leverage range.  
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October.  
Now let me provide an update as to our expectations for the remainder of the year. With the impact of COVID, we are planning for reported revenue to be down less than 5% for the full year compared to 2019. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates of approximately $75 million for revenue and almost $25 million for adjusted EBITDA as compared to last year.  
Turning to our expectations for our storage and service businesses. For the full year, we currently expect a decline in net organic storage volume of 1% to 1.5%. We expect reported storage rental revenue in the second half to grow on year-on-year at a rate that approaches what we delivered in the second quarter. As to service, our July activity levels were down 24% globally. We are currently planning for third quarter activity to be consistent with what we experienced in July. This implies a service revenue decline in the high teens year-on-year in the third quarter. With an expectation for a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter, we are planning for full year service revenue declines in the mid-teens. We are approaching adjusted EBITDA margins with a level of conservatism and plan for both the third and fourth quarters to be flat to slightly up year-on-year. This would result in us delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion slightly above 100 basis points relative to last year, which reflects an improvement as compared to our comments on our last call. This reflects our solid first half performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions as well as a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to capital expenditures. We have increased our full year expectation to approximately $525 million or an increase of $50 million from the midpoint of our previous outlook. You should expect this increase to be evenly split between recurring CapEx and data center growth investment, given the better-than-expected performance in the core business as well as our growing data center pipeline. 
As to AFFO, the team is focused on delivering at a level approaching last year's result, including the benefit of our second quarter tax refund. As it relates to capital recycling, our outlook has not changed. We continue to expect to generate proceeds of approximately $100 million this year. As we look at the back half, we have a strong pipeline of transactions and continue to see attractive valuations with historically low cap rates in the industrial real estate market. 
While the second quarter was a challenging one for our service business, we are confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results they have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our third quarter earnings call. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

I'll let Barry answer the last one in more detail. I think the -- but the answer to -- the short answer to your question is, yes, we continue to like the idea of third-party capital for stabilized assets, but I'll let Barry give you a full answer on that. 
On the first one in terms of -- thanks for the question, Eric, on innovation and the importance of that, not just in a post-COVID world, but absolutely in the current environment. We continue to see traction on some of the things I highlighted last time in terms of what I'd call remote collaboration and collaborating remotely. Like I gave the example last time, I think, on unemployment benefits where we're actually facilitating folks to be able to be working away from home and both receive the applications for unemployment and approve it. And then also some of the areas around mailroom which, again, I think I highlighted the last time. 
One area I would add in addition to that. So we've continued to see more and more traction for those kinds of solutions. One area, too, that we've seen a good uptick in the recent past is what we call our Clean Start program. And the Clean Start program is something that we launched a year ago, which is really helping people to reimagine their needs for their office space and get information flows to be more seamless when they are at work and then also to get things off-site for things that they don't need around the office and allows them to work in a much more flexible way. 
And when we came into COVID, that actually got -- the brakes got put on that because part of the Clean Start was we would go into offices and do surveys and working with their real estate people to help them reimagine and rebuild their work processes. And some of that, the exhaust to that process obviously is storage, but also some of the other services that we provide as Iron Mountain. 
When we got into the crisis, our real estate team, product management, sales and marketing team collaborated, and they created a Clean Start kit in a box, if you will. So what we've done is we've been able to put that together in a kit that allows us to deliver the same type of assessment and survey virtually without actually going into their offices. And we just recently, for instance, had a very large win with a global insurance company that was selling part of its insurance portfolio to a life insurance company, where we not only did -- facilitated moving sensitive records, many containing PII or personal identifiable information across to that new owner of those policies and that information, but transfer a number of their employees across and at the same time, help them repurpose their -- the real estate footprint that they were left with. So it was kind of real estate optimization, helping them transfer a business to another person, transfer people and then take a step back and say, how can we actually improve the information flow in what they have left. So that just gives you another flavor of the types of things that we're finding out there."

We think it's an attractive way to improve returns for the company, and we see a lot of opportunity there.

I would say look, our service business performed better throughout the -- in the quarter than we had anticipated. As you know, on the last call, we noted that we thought we'd use April as a proxy going forward for the entire second quarter. 
April and May, generally speaking, really across the world and across our various service activity lines were very consistent. Shred was down kind of high 20s in April, about 30% in May. It also recovered just like, directionally, the rest of the business, was down in the vicinity of 10% on activity basis in June and kind of stayed at that level in July. I would say that, that trajectory of improvement in June, as I noted, was really pervasive across all of our activities. 
As it relates to paper price, in particular, the way I would think about this, Adam, is on our last call, we were -- well, in the first quarter, we had a $10 million hit to EBITDA from paper prices, as you recall. And on our last call, we thought that we would have kind of low to mid-single-digit dollar decline as a result of paper price for each of the next couple of quarters. We actually had a $2 million positive to EBITDA, as I mentioned on the call. Now I will say that paper prices have been very volatile and have been declining quite significantly over the last couple of months. You've probably seen that in the industry data. I know you follow that. And so our view for the back half is that it will be basically neutral year-on-year as it relates to EBITDA."

In other words, we -- most of the hyperscalers we were serving in some aspects, but not necessarily in large hyperscale deployment. 
I think overall, though, if you look at our pipeline, I would say that whilst it's right to say on -- in terms of volume that we sell these to one hyperscaler who can kind of skew what that looks like, is we're still seeing a good mix. So I think last quarter, we were approaching back up to about 50% from kind of existing Iron Mountain or existing data center customers. This quarter, it was a little bit lower, especially if you use the filter I'm saying, breaking the hyperscalers into 2 buckets. But overall, I think we still continue to see the pipeline. I think that some of the new logos that I highlighted that we brought in this time were because of existing Iron Mountain relationships in, say, our data management business and the type of cross-selling that you would see. 
But if you look at specifically this quarter, what we're most excited about this quarter is that we think we're beginning to be established in the deal flow, if you will, for hyperscale deployment. In other words, hyperscalers know that we're out there, and we see -- we're seeing the RFIs, just like everybody else's. So we're pretty excited. So this quarter was kind of skewed, I would say, to kind of newish customers. But overall, the pipeline is still kind of in that 50% level."

I think Barry highlighted in his introductory remarks that in the month of June, not only did DSOs go down year-on-year, but in the month of June with lower sales, we collected more cash than we did June last year. So in other words, people really do see that our services are essential to keep their businesses open and running.

So first, on Singapore, we're continuing to keep an eye on it because, as you probably realize, we're tracking on a track that we're going to be sold out in Singapore pretty soon. So you're right that the government has put a pause on it. We have heard the -- it just so happens that our Head of Asia data centers is a Singaporean based in Singapore. So he stays pretty close to the government. We are seeing that the government seems to be making noises to relax that a little bit sooner than they initially guided, say, a year ago. So we're optimistic. And obviously, we're starting to -- or have been for a number of months now looking at how we could actually expand our footprint in Singapore. As I said, the -- we're well on track to fill out the old Credit Suisse data center fairly soon. 
On Amsterdam, interesting, we have actually quite a bit of land permitted. So we've been less engaged with the government trying to relax that. On the other side, it's exactly, as you said, is we've seen even a number of people who have their own data centers in the Amsterdam market, for instance, coming in and starting to look to add capacity in our facilities because of the permitting issue that you've described. And obviously, Amsterdam is a highly connected market and our facility has a high level of connectivity within it. So it's actually playing to our strength, both because we have the capacity in, but the rest of the market is constrained."

I think the team is very aligned and they're very focused on delivering. I think the total company is energized by the fact that this is really an opportunity to transform the company and support our customers that much better. 
In terms of how it's stacking up, the second quarter of $40 million benefit year-on-year was right in line, if not a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. So we're at $65 million year-to-date. And obviously, those are elevated levels as compared to what we were expecting earlier as we increased the benefit this year, last quarter. So we're well on track to deliver $150 million of benefit this year. My guess is that next year, we will have another $150 million to $200 million of incremental benefit, and we'll exit next year at a run rate that has all of the benefit, the entire $375 million by 2022, so a little small amount of incremental benefit there in 2022 to plan for your models. 
In terms of where it's coming from, it's generally been thus far probably in the vicinity of 70%, 75% from SG&A and the balance in cost of sales. You'll note, as you're looking at our performance this quarter, our cost of sales, obviously down a lot more, and that reflects the fact that we made those temporary cost cuts that we talked about in the form of furloughs and et cetera. Going forward, I think you'll see even more of Summit coming from a more balanced approach across the income statement as initially, as Bill has commented before, the first rounds of Summit were really in the SG&A area. There'll be more going forward, but I think as a relative basis, sort of last quarter, we talked some about the SLA changes, which, by the way, are going very, very well. Those will continue to stack incremental benefits going forward, and some of that, obviously, will be in the cost of sales line. 
As it relates to the tax refund, I think that was the last question. We did have about $27 million of cash refunds in the quarter as compared to prior year. Last year, we actually paid more on a cash basis. So if you're looking at AFFO, it's almost a $35 million swing year-on-year. That's onetime, and we -- those were for prior year refunds that we were -- we've received during the quarter. So thanks for those questions, Sheila."

So look, the customer churn is actually, we think, a little bit lower than normal than we would see.

So look, the customer churn is actually, we think, a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that's when -- I made the comment in my introductory remarks that when we kind of normalize in a post-COVID world, on one side, we would expect the pause. In other words, we don't expect the same drag on incoming volume. But on permanent withdrawals is that we saw a downtick in this quarter because people are not in the office or making active decisions to actually withdraw. So we expect it to kind of go -- revert back to normal levels. But if you kind of look at overall volume, I think the question behind your question is what do we think is going to happen to volume when we get out of COVID. So on one side, we would expect permanent withdrawals to go up, back to normalized levels. But on the other side is we would expect incoming volume from our customers to come back up. 
And so to give you kind of a bit of science around that, if it's helpful, is let's, first of all, kind of anchor on what we see with our customers right now in this environment in terms of activity. So last week, I was in New York and New Jersey, and had a catch-up with -- on one evening with the President and Chief Operating Officer of a large global bank that's based in New York. And we were comparing notes on how many people come back to the office, et cetera. And what he shared with me is that at the depth of the crisis, say, in April, they had less than 3% of their workforce coming into the office. And where they were standing -- when I was meeting with them last week, in July, they had invited 20% of the people to come back and only 6% came back, and you're probably seeing similar things in BAML.
So then let's kind of say what -- how has that translated in the activity we see in terms of incoming boxes? When I say that, where are we going to end when we have COVID in the rearview mirror? So if we look at incoming boxes in April, so if you remember, like, in their case, only 3% of their people, less than 3% of the people are coming into the office, we were down 58% in North America. I'm just taking North America as an example, as a proxy. We're down 58% on incoming box volume. If we look at the quarter, as Barry mentioned, we're down about 47% overall in North America in terms of incoming box. 
Now if you look at July, we're down about 38%. So basically, July is about a 20% improvement from what we saw on average in Q2. So if we were down, say, 4 million, 4.5 million cubic feet due to -- in Q2 from our records management business or net we said minus 3.8 million cubic feet, we're 4.5 million cubic feet worse than normal. But let's say we were down negative 3.8 million cubic feet, then we would say that based on a 20% -- the 20% improvement that we've seen in July is worst-case scenario, you project that forward, is we're down about 3 million cubic feet a quarter, right? So that's 12 million cubic feet on an annualized basis. 
Now we don't expect it to plateau at these levels, obviously, because we're still only running at, in financial services, less than 6% of the people that are coming to work. But with 6% -- even if we plateau at the current levels we're seeing, is you'd be a 12 million annual drag, a negative 12 million annual drag on our records management business in terms of physical storage. And that's before adding consumer back in. So when you net it all out is that, worst case, especially with the offset that we get from consumer is that we think that adding our normal price of 2% to 3%, it's manageable. What a most likely scenario is we'll continue to see improvement. People will start -- I don't think we're going to stay at 6% of the workforce coming to the office. It will go back up. And that's why when I said in our remarks, is we expect in a post-COVID world is we'll be kind of flattish to slightly up in the records management business and then consumer will drive additional growth on top of that. I don't know if that's helpful."

Let me start by saying, I hope you and your families are safe and well. The third quarter provided us with a great opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months in response to the pandemic and set a market --  set a marker for outperformance through top line resilience in our physical storage and growing data center businesses, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record. All wells have been continuing our investment in innovation and new product development. 
I would like to thank all of our mountaineers for this remarkable performance into their steadfast focus on safety and execution. Despite lingering uncertainty related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen improvements, albeit gradual in key U.S. and international markets as it relates to our service activity levels while showing continued strong performance in both our physical storage business and our global data center business. I continue to be inspired by the tireless efforts of our teams as they support and care for our customers, each other in our communities, whilst accelerating progress on our strategic priorities. From the start, we set out our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and take care of the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our customers. In April, we had up to 1/3 of our workforce out on furlough or other temporary leave. I'm happy to report that we have brought a significant number of these mountaineers back to work to serve our customers, and we now have over 90% of our employees working regularly. While this has been a very difficult time, we have proven to be very resilient. We are financially healthy with strong and reliable cash flow, driven in part by our brand and customer loyalty. This is evident in how we've managed the heightened uncertainty of the past 8 months. 
We quickly aligned on the right mix of priorities to maintain strong near-term momentum whilst continuing our investments in innovation and new products as we execute our plan for long-term value creation. This, combined with the benefits from Project Summit has allowed us to continue to invest in transforming and modernizing our company. As demonstrated by our year-on-year constant currency year-to-date adjusted EBITDA and storage revenue growth, we can already see the evidence supporting our belief that we will emerge from this pandemic as a stronger company on all dimensions. Clearly, there are still many uncertainties around COVID in terms of the development of the pandemic and how the government's worldwide will continue to respond with varying degrees of restrictions as infections rise. However, in the third quarter, we saw signs of improvement in customer trends, and as a result, the decline of our service revenue moderated. In addition, there is clear evidence that has and when the restrictions lift with customers do come back to us. With needs from both a physical and digital document storage perspective. And while some elements of our business may have changed forever, our positioning with the communities we serve remain strong. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to adapt and transform our business model and solutions to changing customer needs due to challenges created by COVID-19, our customers are evaluating their real real estate needs, business processes and ways to increase digitization in a remote workplace setting. We have been focused on helping them navigate these challenges and have tasked ourselves with accelerating our response to our customers' needs. One thing is certain, the pandemic has created opportunities for us to help our customers in new and innovative ways. The fact is we're a different company than the one most people know. The strategic journey we have been on has driven this change. And to remind folks, our focus remains on 3 pillars: first, continued growth in physical storage revenue through pricing as well as new volume growth achieved from records growth in emerging markets and/or in consumer storage in developed markets; second, utilizing our global scale as well as 70 years of customer trust to deliver a differentiated data center offering; and third, new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management in a more complex regulatory environment and one in which hybrid physical and digital solutions are the norm. Further expanding on the product and services pillar, most know us for protecting highly regulated records. But over the years, our relationships have evolved to help customers manage a broader set of assets and to help them solve a broader range of problems. As customers' needs evolve, their expectations of us evolved. For this reason is important, we continue to invest in creating solutions that unlock value for our customers. A great example of this is a solution we just provided for a U.S. credit union who needed a faster, more efficient method for processing their members mortgage loans after closing. Their old process was too manual and it could no longer support the volume of work, much less scale to meet the credit Union's 30% year-over-year growth projection. And it didn't satisfy increased regulations, the organization must now meet when selling their loans. We rebuilt the customer's workflow to better integrate their mix of paper and digital loan materials. This included mailroom services, document scanning, a private vault with bio resistant safeguards in defensible, secure disposition. We also applied machine learning to automate how the credit union access data, verified its accuracy and resolve missing or incorrect items. With these changes, the credit union can now process post close mortgage loans much faster, more than doubling their capacity whilst reducing their costs by 25%. This example speaks to what we see as our differentiation and why customers ultimately call us when they need help. For some time, we have talked about our opportunity to enable our customers' digital transformation journeys. Initially, much of this work was going on behind the scenes, especially as Project Summit got underway, putting in place the systems and structures to support this transformation. The benefits of this work are now becoming more evident with notable improvements to our customer experience at a time when demand for our solutions has never been greater. This materialized in the third quarter and high single-digit growth in our digital solutions business. 
If you look at our physical storage business, this remains a key foundation for Iron Mountain. Customers have long trusted us to secure their information and their assets that matter most to them. They needed us to service their lock, if you will. But over time, while their needs expanded beyond security and compliance, their jobs grew more complex as they now had to store use and extract value from growing amounts of information that was in both physical and digital form. The hybrid nature of their data was preventing them from achieving speed, compliance, efficiency and ultimately growth. A lot was no longer enough. They now needed a key to solve for this hybrid environment. 
Uniquely, Iron Mountain offers both the lock and the key that organizations need in order to realize competitive advantage from their paper and digital information. Plenty of companies offer a secure home for valued assets, when they offer technology services so customers can better use those assets, but this over specialization falls short of the needs of most customers. We hear from our customers that they want partners who can help them build singular solutions capable of solving for multiple demands of speed, cost savings, revenue opportunities and security. This is Iron Mountain's distinctive position. We serve as the lock and the key. 
Now let's take a closer look at business trends during the third quarter. At a high level, we are pleased with the stabilization and early recovery we're beginning to see across our service business. Service activity levels have shown a gradual improvement from the second quarter. However, similar to what we discussed last quarter, the shape of the recovery will be dependent on macro factors. The recent increases in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world as focused states and countries to implement new restrictions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Whilst these factors will make the recovery uneven, our experienced management team is prepared to confidently manage the volatility. 
Turning now to our physical storage business. Total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated modestly from last quarter, up 2.5%. This once again was driven by strong revenue management results as well as growth in our emerging markets in consumer. We continue to be very encouraged with the levels of organic storage revenue growth, underscoring the durability of the physical storage business and supporting strong cash generation. Total global organic volume increased 2 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this was 3 million cubic foot increase in consumer and other and fine art storage, partly offset by a decrease in records management volume. 
Looking more specifically at records management organic volume. This was down 1.1 million cubic feet compared to the second quarter. While still a decline, this is a significant improvement from the 3.9 million cubic foot decline last quarter, again, reflecting the early signs of recovery. We continue to expect the full year organic volume to be down 1% to 1.5% and up 2.5% in terms of organic revenue based on current visibility. 
Turning now to our global data center segment. We are very encouraged by another strong quarter of bookings. In Q3, we leased 12.3 megawatts, bringing the year-to-date total to just over 51 megawatts. The strong leasing this year, particularly among smaller deployments, has resulted in increase in our utilization by more than 7 points to nearly 92%. Given the need for additional capacity, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately 50 megawatts, consisting of both greenfield development and further build-out of existing facilities. Moreover, in excess of 50% of our development is pre-leased, resulting in a strong backlog. 
Let me now provide a brief update on Project Summit. Our transformation program is progressing well, and we are on track to realize our permanent structural cost savings of $375 million per year exiting next year. As you saw in our press release this morning, we now expect to be able to generate greater adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 as we have accelerated some initiatives. Most notably, these ongoing initiatives should not only significantly reduce our cost base, but also make it easier for our mountaineers to get work done, enabling them to focus on a more customer centric approach. Some examples include: driving global standardization in it, replacing cumbersome manual processes with reliable automation and improving the user experience whilst reducing process cycle time. We are as excited about the systems and process improvements that our project Summit as we are about the bottom line improvement and believe the end result will be an enhanced value proposition for our customers and communities. As we shared with you last quarter, we are strongly committed to all of our stakeholders. We are focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to continue on our path and accelerate improving our diversity and inclusion. In order to be a sustainable and successful company, we need to attract the best talent to drive maximum creativity through diverse and innovative thinking. I am proud to say we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2020 Corporate Equality Index. This recognition reinforces the important work we are doing and supports our goal of building and promoting an inclusive culture that encourages our employees to bring their whole authentic cells into the workplace. As we look at our business going forward, we see opportunities as well as risks and we are making every effort to ensure we are well placed to maximize the opportunities. We are cautious about our expectation of the pace of market recovery as we progress through 2021. In our own business, as we've shared with you in previous calls, we expect a gradual recovery in our service business to continue as economic activity recovers, leading 2021 to look similar to 2020, just in reverse in terms of quarterly progression. The work we are doing and have done to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, gives us confidence that we will come out of this position to consistently deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
In summary, we are leveraging the opportunity in this rapidly changing environment to reaffirm our commitment to our strategy of growth through increased product offerings in the physical storage area as well as continued rapid growth in our data center and digitization areas. At the same time, we continue to exercise prudent cost control and drive further efficiency across the organization through our transformation activities. We are proud of the progress we have made towards our transformative shift during this crisis. We are now even more enthusiastic about the speed of our future transformation given the lessons we have learned during the pandemic. I hope you all remain well. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial",2102,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. Revenue of $1.04 billion declined 2.4% on a reported basis year-on-year, which includes a 30 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 13.5%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. While the pace of recovery continues to be dependent on many factors, overall, we continue to see service declines moderate, reflecting an improving trajectory since the April, May time frame. For the full quarter, service trends were generally consistent with the July levels we discussed on our last call. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5%, driven by 3 points of revenue management and data center growth partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in global organic volume on a trailing 12-month basis. This is 30 basis point improvement as compared to the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points year-on-year to 35.7%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix while partially offset by fixed cost deleverage on lower service revenue and higher bonus compensation accrual. In addition, in the third quarter, we incurred incremental cost to keep our teams safe, for example, specialized cleaning of our facilities as well as purchases of personal protective equipment. We included these expenses in our adjusted EBITDA. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.31, down $0.01 from last year. AFFO declined 5.4% to $213 million. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the decline in AFFO was primarily driven by timing of cash taxes consistent with our outlook. 
Turning to segment performance and starting with the global RIM organization. In the third quarter, our global RIM business experienced declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year. This was partially offset by storage volume growth in our faster-growing markets and revenue management, which led to a total organic revenue decline of 3.9%. Back, together with better than planned project Summit benefits resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points. In the service business, we experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 31% for new boxes inbounded and 39% for retrievals and refiles. We also continue to see a slowdown on the outgoing side as permanent withdrawals declined to 28% and destructions were down 22%. In our thread business, activity declined approximately 17%. For the third quarter, our average realized paper price was 20% higher than the prior year, which was more than offset by a decline in paper tonnage, leading to a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. As we projected on our last call, after the temporary spike in recycled paper prices in April and May, prices have taken a step down. And by October, paper prices have now returned to the low levels experienced at the end of 2019. Our consumer storage business has maintained momentum and continues to be a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. In the third quarter, we continued cost reduction actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, albeit at much lower levels than earlier in the year. As service revenue expectations improve, we want to ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level so we can fully support our customers. As we have discussed before, this does tend to cause incremental cost deleverage as we bring back employees ahead of demand. We think this is the right investment to service our customers. 
Turning to global data center. The business delivered organic revenue growth of 12.1%, driven by prior period leasing and strong service revenue growth. This was partially offset by a moderate churn of 160 basis points, in line with our target of 1% to 2% per quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting slightly elevated levels of churn compared to our normal target range. In the quarter, we booked a nonrecurring revenue adjustment of $1.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% was consistent with our first half trend. As Bill noted, our data center team continued to deliver strong bookings momentum, signing over 12 megawatts of new and expansion leases, bringing year-to-date bookings of 51 megawatts. 
This commercial success resulted in us exceeding our previous full year target through the first 9 months. For the full year, we expect to deliver more than 55 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, representing bookings growth of 45%. Of course, that includes the significant hyperscale lease in Frankfurt. And excluding that, we would expect bookings growth of about 23%. This compares to our original guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts or mid-teens bookings growth. We believe we are growing considerably faster than the broader market. Going into next year, we feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation business supporting rich ecosystems across our platform. We believe we can lease in excess of 20 megawatts next year, which would result in mid-teens annual bookings growth. 
In October, we announced the formation of our joint venture with AGC Equity partners, a greater than EUR 300 million partnership for our fully preleased data center in Frankfurt. This venture represents an important strategic step towards our goal of identifying alternative sources of capital to fund accelerating growth as we expect proceeds will be redeployed into higher return development opportunities. As we have previously disclosed, the venture will be reflected as an unconsolidated joint venture and therefore, will not flow through to revenue and EBITDA. 
Turning to Project Summit. In the third quarter, we recognized $48 million of restructuring charges as well as an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $48 million. Through the first 9 months, we have delivered $113 million of benefit. This is ahead of our prior expectations as we accelerated certain initiatives in 2020 with a particular focus on the highest return activities in response to COVID 19. As Bill referred to, we now expect the program to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, approximately $150 million more in 2021 with the full program generating $375 million exiting 2021. In terms of costs related to Project Summit, we now expect to spend closer to $200 million in 2020. We continue to expect the cost to implement the full program to be approximately $450 million. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are operating from a position of significant balance sheet strength. In the third quarter, our team did a nice job delivering further cash cycle improvement, with solid performance in both payables days and days sales outstanding. On a sequential basis, cash cycle improved by a full day as a result of continued DSO improvement. In August, the team executed another successful bond refinancing, issuing $1.1 billion to redeem our most restrictive outstanding debt and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. The continued strong support received from the fixed income community provided us the opportunity to upsize our transaction while printing the lowest coupon for 10-year notes in the company's history. Taken together with our bond offerings in CIN, we issued $3.5 billion of new debt on a leverage-neutral basis, increased our weighted average maturity by over 2 years to nearly 8 years, while only modestly increasing our weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, these new bonds are more in line with our REIT peers as they include a fixed charge coverage ratio as opposed to a debt-to-EBITDA covenant. Also, I think it is worth noting that we have eliminated all of our 6.5x leverage covenant bonds, meaning our most restricted bond covenant is now 7x debt to EBITDA. 
At quarter end, we had $1.7 billion of liquidity. As a reminder, at the end of the second quarter, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes from the June bond offering. We paid off the notes in early July, leaving us with a cash balance at September 30 $152 million. We ended the quarter with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3x, which takes into account adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.3x, which would represent an improvement year-on-year as we made progress toward our long-term leverage range  
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January  
Turning to capital expenditures Our full year expectation is now approximately $450 million or a decrease of $75 million, reflecting development capital for our FIFO data center that will now be a part of our venture with AGC. Now let me share a few thoughts as to our capital allocation strategy. First, we are committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. And over time, we expect to glide into our targeted AFFO payout ratio of mid-60s percent. Second, we are committed to our target long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x on a net lease-adjusted basis. This year, the team has made good progress toward our target. As investors know, we have been allocating significant capital to our data center business for several years. [indiscernible] pipeline continues to build with high-return investment opportunities, our strategic intent is to increase the amount of capital we dedicate to the business. With that, we have considered options to generate incremental funds for investment. We view capital recycling as a good means to monetize certain assets, particularly industrial real estate to increasingly invest in our development pipeline. Industrial cap rates are at historically low levels, and we have the opportunity to structure long-term leases on favorable terms that effectively allow us to have control of the facilities, whether we lease or own. 
With that, in the third quarter, our team accessed the market and monetized 2 facilities for proceeds of approximately $110 million. This brings our year-to-date proceeds to nearly $120 million, ahead of our full year target of $100 million. With the highly favorable market backdrop, together with our development pipeline, we are planning to recycle relatively more going forward, albeit what will amount to a small portion of our total industrial assets. Similarly, we view selling stabilized data center assets into a joint venture as analogous to monetizing industrial real estate assets. It represents another source of capital to redeploy into development projects. Of the joint venture we just announced in Frankfurt is a good example of this strategy. The JV provides us with an opportunity to boost returns on stabilized assets and provides incremental capital to allocate to projects in the development phase. 
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we are not issuing official guidance today, I would like to provide an update as to our expectations, excluding any material and unforeseen changes. With the continued impact of COVID, we are planning for the fourth quarter to be generally in line with the third quarter for revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a dollar basis. Therefore, for the full year 2020, this would lead to a low single-digit revenue decline and flat to slightly positive adjusted EBITDA growth as compared to last year. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates approaching $60 million for revenue and $20 million for adjusted EBITDA. This outlook reflects our solid year-to-date performance, benefits from revenue management, accelerated project Summit savings and incorporates a cautious view for the fourth quarter. Given our favorable results, we now expect AFFO growth to be up low single digits for the full year. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our prior commentary. When we look ahead to 2021, as you expect, until we get COVID-19 behind us, naturally, it is difficult to provide guidance. But we are committed to providing the investment community with additional commentary on our trajectory and underlying business trends, just as what we've been doing throughout this year. While the challenges for our service business persist, we remain confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I'm proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results we've delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

Over time, we'll cash out nearly all of that impact all of it. And nearly all of that at the close, we retained over 20% retained equity interest in the venture. We will earn fees for things like property management, development and construction. And we'll take those proceeds and redevelop --  redeploy it into development pipeline, which has nice higher return opportunity. So essentially, we see it as the opportunity to monetize essentially what is a stabilized asset boost that return and then redeploy.

And in fact, they have a similar structure with a different customer in the United States. So -- and we ran a process. So I would expect that they would be interested in any further processes that we run down in the past. So I wouldn't be surprised at all for us to see us do other things with AGC. But it will depend on the location and the opportunity. I think in terms of your question on storage revenue growth, is that it was about 1.7% if you just look at the physical storage and took out the data center, so it goes from 2.5% to 1.7%, but still strong positive growth based on some of the success that we've been having on the back of consumer. So really pleased, both in terms of records management is better this quarter. And also consumer is really starting to show that it's starting to hit approve. That being said, we do expect the quarters are going to kind of go backwards and forwards a little bit because consumer is a seasonal business, but we think the trajectory is moving in the right direction for both businesses. On the pricing side, you can see actually that we are continuing to get roughly the 3 points of price that Barry highlighted on it. We don't see any slowdown in that at all. And we have more to get in the emerging markets, which are relatively new to the game in terms of our revenue management processes. So good response from the customers, we're still considered very much an essential business or essential service to our customers. So it's a great position to be in."

So if you think a couple of examples or either at use and/or further downstream processing. So the example I gave on the call about the mortgage processing is really about downstream processing. But we also have -- and we talked about that, I think, a little bit on previous calls when we changed our service level agreements and really made a push on image on demand we've seen one customer, for instance, in the U.K. that has fully embraced that. So they only take dairy trebles now through image on demand. So we -- any time they need a retrieval is we image it, and we load it up onto the system and they access it that way, which we --  which for us is longer term, a higher-margin business for us than having advance on the road and obviously, environmentally is better. So so really kind of 2 bits. One is we're getting into more processes, quite frankly, where we weren't exposed before us. We're helping them with the downstream processes. And in the other cases, is people are taking advantage of our image on demand, which, for us, is a more efficient way to get them the information back."

And this year, but this year, it may be a little bit more noticeable. This is because the gestation period in terms of that marketing takes a while. And our relationship as we went into data centers, for sure, it was stronger in the enterprise side or during -- setting up private cloud for large enterprise customers than it was on the hyperscale. So this year, we're actually really pleased with the progress we've made in terms of building our reputation and exposure with the hyperscalers. So if you look at year-to-date, we're about 50-50. So about 50%, of that 51 megawatts that we've signed up year-to-date is hyperscale, including obviously the Frankfurt site, and about 50% is retail. So we're really happy with the mix. But you're for sure, you're right is that the cash and cash returns on hyperscale deployments are lower, but they're longer-term contracts. And it allows you to build out the facilities or the campus is faster. So it still is the right mix, we think, in terms of maximizing returns."

Let me start by saying, I hope you and your families are safe and well. The third quarter provided us with a great opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months in response to the pandemic and set a market --  set a marker for outperformance through top line resilience in our physical storage and growing data center businesses, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record. All wells have been continuing our investment in innovation and new product development. 
I would like to thank all of our mountaineers for this remarkable performance into their steadfast focus on safety and execution. Despite lingering uncertainty related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen improvements, albeit gradual in key U.S. and international markets as it relates to our service activity levels while showing continued strong performance in both our physical storage business and our global data center business. I continue to be inspired by the tireless efforts of our teams as they support and care for our customers, each other in our communities, whilst accelerating progress on our strategic priorities. From the start, we set out our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and take care of the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our customers. In April, we had up to 1/3 of our workforce out on furlough or other temporary leave. I'm happy to report that we have brought a significant number of these mountaineers back to work to serve our customers, and we now have over 90% of our employees working regularly. While this has been a very difficult time, we have proven to be very resilient. We are financially healthy with strong and reliable cash flow, driven in part by our brand and customer loyalty. This is evident in how we've managed the heightened uncertainty of the past 8 months. 
We quickly aligned on the right mix of priorities to maintain strong near-term momentum whilst continuing our investments in innovation and new products as we execute our plan for long-term value creation. This, combined with the benefits from Project Summit has allowed us to continue to invest in transforming and modernizing our company. As demonstrated by our year-on-year constant currency year-to-date adjusted EBITDA and storage revenue growth, we can already see the evidence supporting our belief that we will emerge from this pandemic as a stronger company on all dimensions. Clearly, there are still many uncertainties around COVID in terms of the development of the pandemic and how the government's worldwide will continue to respond with varying degrees of restrictions as infections rise. However, in the third quarter, we saw signs of improvement in customer trends, and as a result, the decline of our service revenue moderated. In addition, there is clear evidence that has and when the restrictions lift with customers do come back to us. With needs from both a physical and digital document storage perspective. And while some elements of our business may have changed forever, our positioning with the communities we serve remain strong. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to adapt and transform our business model and solutions to changing customer needs due to challenges created by COVID-19, our customers are evaluating their real real estate needs, business processes and ways to increase digitization in a remote workplace setting. We have been focused on helping them navigate these challenges and have tasked ourselves with accelerating our response to our customers' needs. One thing is certain, the pandemic has created opportunities for us to help our customers in new and innovative ways. The fact is we're a different company than the one most people know. The strategic journey we have been on has driven this change. And to remind folks, our focus remains on 3 pillars: first, continued growth in physical storage revenue through pricing as well as new volume growth achieved from records growth in emerging markets and/or in consumer storage in developed markets; second, utilizing our global scale as well as 70 years of customer trust to deliver a differentiated data center offering; and third, new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management in a more complex regulatory environment and one in which hybrid physical and digital solutions are the norm. Further expanding on the product and services pillar, most know us for protecting highly regulated records. But over the years, our relationships have evolved to help customers manage a broader set of assets and to help them solve a broader range of problems. As customers' needs evolve, their expectations of us evolved. For this reason is important, we continue to invest in creating solutions that unlock value for our customers. A great example of this is a solution we just provided for a U.S. credit union who needed a faster, more efficient method for processing their members mortgage loans after closing. Their old process was too manual and it could no longer support the volume of work, much less scale to meet the credit Union's 30% year-over-year growth projection. And it didn't satisfy increased regulations, the organization must now meet when selling their loans. We rebuilt the customer's workflow to better integrate their mix of paper and digital loan materials. This included mailroom services, document scanning, a private vault with bio resistant safeguards in defensible, secure disposition. We also applied machine learning to automate how the credit union access data, verified its accuracy and resolve missing or incorrect items. With these changes, the credit union can now process post close mortgage loans much faster, more than doubling their capacity whilst reducing their costs by 25%. This example speaks to what we see as our differentiation and why customers ultimately call us when they need help. For some time, we have talked about our opportunity to enable our customers' digital transformation journeys. Initially, much of this work was going on behind the scenes, especially as Project Summit got underway, putting in place the systems and structures to support this transformation. The benefits of this work are now becoming more evident with notable improvements to our customer experience at a time when demand for our solutions has never been greater. This materialized in the third quarter and high single-digit growth in our digital solutions business. 
If you look at our physical storage business, this remains a key foundation for Iron Mountain. Customers have long trusted us to secure their information and their assets that matter most to them. They needed us to service their lock, if you will. But over time, while their needs expanded beyond security and compliance, their jobs grew more complex as they now had to store use and extract value from growing amounts of information that was in both physical and digital form. The hybrid nature of their data was preventing them from achieving speed, compliance, efficiency and ultimately growth. A lot was no longer enough. They now needed a key to solve for this hybrid environment. 
Uniquely, Iron Mountain offers both the lock and the key that organizations need in order to realize competitive advantage from their paper and digital information. Plenty of companies offer a secure home for valued assets, when they offer technology services so customers can better use those assets, but this over specialization falls short of the needs of most customers. We hear from our customers that they want partners who can help them build singular solutions capable of solving for multiple demands of speed, cost savings, revenue opportunities and security. This is Iron Mountain's distinctive position. We serve as the lock and the key. 
Now let's take a closer look at business trends during the third quarter. At a high level, we are pleased with the stabilization and early recovery we're beginning to see across our service business. Service activity levels have shown a gradual improvement from the second quarter. However, similar to what we discussed last quarter, the shape of the recovery will be dependent on macro factors. The recent increases in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world as focused states and countries to implement new restrictions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Whilst these factors will make the recovery uneven, our experienced management team is prepared to confidently manage the volatility. 
Turning now to our physical storage business. Total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated modestly from last quarter, up 2.5%. This once again was driven by strong revenue management results as well as growth in our emerging markets in consumer. We continue to be very encouraged with the levels of organic storage revenue growth, underscoring the durability of the physical storage business and supporting strong cash generation. Total global organic volume increased 2 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this was 3 million cubic foot increase in consumer and other and fine art storage, partly offset by a decrease in records management volume. 
Looking more specifically at records management organic volume. This was down 1.1 million cubic feet compared to the second quarter. While still a decline, this is a significant improvement from the 3.9 million cubic foot decline last quarter, again, reflecting the early signs of recovery. We continue to expect the full year organic volume to be down 1% to 1.5% and up 2.5% in terms of organic revenue based on current visibility. 
Turning now to our global data center segment. We are very encouraged by another strong quarter of bookings. In Q3, we leased 12.3 megawatts, bringing the year-to-date total to just over 51 megawatts. The strong leasing this year, particularly among smaller deployments, has resulted in increase in our utilization by more than 7 points to nearly 92%. Given the need for additional capacity, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately 50 megawatts, consisting of both greenfield development and further build-out of existing facilities. Moreover, in excess of 50% of our development is pre-leased, resulting in a strong backlog. 
Let me now provide a brief update on Project Summit. Our transformation program is progressing well, and we are on track to realize our permanent structural cost savings of $375 million per year exiting next year. As you saw in our press release this morning, we now expect to be able to generate greater adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 as we have accelerated some initiatives. Most notably, these ongoing initiatives should not only significantly reduce our cost base, but also make it easier for our mountaineers to get work done, enabling them to focus on a more customer centric approach. Some examples include: driving global standardization in it, replacing cumbersome manual processes with reliable automation and improving the user experience whilst reducing process cycle time. We are as excited about the systems and process improvements that our project Summit as we are about the bottom line improvement and believe the end result will be an enhanced value proposition for our customers and communities. As we shared with you last quarter, we are strongly committed to all of our stakeholders. We are focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to continue on our path and accelerate improving our diversity and inclusion. In order to be a sustainable and successful company, we need to attract the best talent to drive maximum creativity through diverse and innovative thinking. I am proud to say we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2020 Corporate Equality Index. This recognition reinforces the important work we are doing and supports our goal of building and promoting an inclusive culture that encourages our employees to bring their whole authentic cells into the workplace. As we look at our business going forward, we see opportunities as well as risks and we are making every effort to ensure we are well placed to maximize the opportunities. We are cautious about our expectation of the pace of market recovery as we progress through 2021. In our own business, as we've shared with you in previous calls, we expect a gradual recovery in our service business to continue as economic activity recovers, leading 2021 to look similar to 2020, just in reverse in terms of quarterly progression. The work we are doing and have done to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, gives us confidence that we will come out of this position to consistently deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
In summary, we are leveraging the opportunity in this rapidly changing environment to reaffirm our commitment to our strategy of growth through increased product offerings in the physical storage area as well as continued rapid growth in our data center and digitization areas. At the same time, we continue to exercise prudent cost control and drive further efficiency across the organization through our transformation activities. We are proud of the progress we have made towards our transformative shift during this crisis. We are now even more enthusiastic about the speed of our future transformation given the lessons we have learned during the pandemic. I hope you all remain well. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial",2102,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. Revenue of $1.04 billion declined 2.4% on a reported basis year-on-year, which includes a 30 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 13.5%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. While the pace of recovery continues to be dependent on many factors, overall, we continue to see service declines moderate, reflecting an improving trajectory since the April, May time frame. For the full quarter, service trends were generally consistent with the July levels we discussed on our last call. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5%, driven by 3 points of revenue management and data center growth partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in global organic volume on a trailing 12-month basis. This is 30 basis point improvement as compared to the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points year-on-year to 35.7%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix while partially offset by fixed cost deleverage on lower service revenue and higher bonus compensation accrual. In addition, in the third quarter, we incurred incremental cost to keep our teams safe, for example, specialized cleaning of our facilities as well as purchases of personal protective equipment. We included these expenses in our adjusted EBITDA. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.31, down $0.01 from last year. AFFO declined 5.4% to $213 million. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the decline in AFFO was primarily driven by timing of cash taxes consistent with our outlook. 
Turning to segment performance and starting with the global RIM organization. In the third quarter, our global RIM business experienced declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year. This was partially offset by storage volume growth in our faster-growing markets and revenue management, which led to a total organic revenue decline of 3.9%. Back, together with better than planned project Summit benefits resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points. In the service business, we experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 31% for new boxes inbounded and 39% for retrievals and refiles. We also continue to see a slowdown on the outgoing side as permanent withdrawals declined to 28% and destructions were down 22%. In our thread business, activity declined approximately 17%. For the third quarter, our average realized paper price was 20% higher than the prior year, which was more than offset by a decline in paper tonnage, leading to a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. As we projected on our last call, after the temporary spike in recycled paper prices in April and May, prices have taken a step down. And by October, paper prices have now returned to the low levels experienced at the end of 2019. Our consumer storage business has maintained momentum and continues to be a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. In the third quarter, we continued cost reduction actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, albeit at much lower levels than earlier in the year. As service revenue expectations improve, we want to ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level so we can fully support our customers. As we have discussed before, this does tend to cause incremental cost deleverage as we bring back employees ahead of demand. We think this is the right investment to service our customers. 
Turning to global data center. The business delivered organic revenue growth of 12.1%, driven by prior period leasing and strong service revenue growth. This was partially offset by a moderate churn of 160 basis points, in line with our target of 1% to 2% per quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting slightly elevated levels of churn compared to our normal target range. In the quarter, we booked a nonrecurring revenue adjustment of $1.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% was consistent with our first half trend. As Bill noted, our data center team continued to deliver strong bookings momentum, signing over 12 megawatts of new and expansion leases, bringing year-to-date bookings of 51 megawatts. 
This commercial success resulted in us exceeding our previous full year target through the first 9 months. For the full year, we expect to deliver more than 55 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, representing bookings growth of 45%. Of course, that includes the significant hyperscale lease in Frankfurt. And excluding that, we would expect bookings growth of about 23%. This compares to our original guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts or mid-teens bookings growth. We believe we are growing considerably faster than the broader market. Going into next year, we feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation business supporting rich ecosystems across our platform. We believe we can lease in excess of 20 megawatts next year, which would result in mid-teens annual bookings growth. 
In October, we announced the formation of our joint venture with AGC Equity partners, a greater than EUR 300 million partnership for our fully preleased data center in Frankfurt. This venture represents an important strategic step towards our goal of identifying alternative sources of capital to fund accelerating growth as we expect proceeds will be redeployed into higher return development opportunities. As we have previously disclosed, the venture will be reflected as an unconsolidated joint venture and therefore, will not flow through to revenue and EBITDA. 
Turning to Project Summit. In the third quarter, we recognized $48 million of restructuring charges as well as an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $48 million. Through the first 9 months, we have delivered $113 million of benefit. This is ahead of our prior expectations as we accelerated certain initiatives in 2020 with a particular focus on the highest return activities in response to COVID 19. As Bill referred to, we now expect the program to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, approximately $150 million more in 2021 with the full program generating $375 million exiting 2021. In terms of costs related to Project Summit, we now expect to spend closer to $200 million in 2020. We continue to expect the cost to implement the full program to be approximately $450 million. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are operating from a position of significant balance sheet strength. In the third quarter, our team did a nice job delivering further cash cycle improvement, with solid performance in both payables days and days sales outstanding. On a sequential basis, cash cycle improved by a full day as a result of continued DSO improvement. In August, the team executed another successful bond refinancing, issuing $1.1 billion to redeem our most restrictive outstanding debt and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. The continued strong support received from the fixed income community provided us the opportunity to upsize our transaction while printing the lowest coupon for 10-year notes in the company's history. Taken together with our bond offerings in CIN, we issued $3.5 billion of new debt on a leverage-neutral basis, increased our weighted average maturity by over 2 years to nearly 8 years, while only modestly increasing our weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, these new bonds are more in line with our REIT peers as they include a fixed charge coverage ratio as opposed to a debt-to-EBITDA covenant. Also, I think it is worth noting that we have eliminated all of our 6.5x leverage covenant bonds, meaning our most restricted bond covenant is now 7x debt to EBITDA. 
At quarter end, we had $1.7 billion of liquidity. As a reminder, at the end of the second quarter, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes from the June bond offering. We paid off the notes in early July, leaving us with a cash balance at September 30 $152 million. We ended the quarter with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3x, which takes into account adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.3x, which would represent an improvement year-on-year as we made progress toward our long-term leverage range  
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January  
Turning to capital expenditures Our full year expectation is now approximately $450 million or a decrease of $75 million, reflecting development capital for our FIFO data center that will now be a part of our venture with AGC. Now let me share a few thoughts as to our capital allocation strategy. First, we are committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. And over time, we expect to glide into our targeted AFFO payout ratio of mid-60s percent. Second, we are committed to our target long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x on a net lease-adjusted basis. This year, the team has made good progress toward our target. As investors know, we have been allocating significant capital to our data center business for several years. [indiscernible] pipeline continues to build with high-return investment opportunities, our strategic intent is to increase the amount of capital we dedicate to the business. With that, we have considered options to generate incremental funds for investment. We view capital recycling as a good means to monetize certain assets, particularly industrial real estate to increasingly invest in our development pipeline. Industrial cap rates are at historically low levels, and we have the opportunity to structure long-term leases on favorable terms that effectively allow us to have control of the facilities, whether we lease or own. 
With that, in the third quarter, our team accessed the market and monetized 2 facilities for proceeds of approximately $110 million. This brings our year-to-date proceeds to nearly $120 million, ahead of our full year target of $100 million. With the highly favorable market backdrop, together with our development pipeline, we are planning to recycle relatively more going forward, albeit what will amount to a small portion of our total industrial assets. Similarly, we view selling stabilized data center assets into a joint venture as analogous to monetizing industrial real estate assets. It represents another source of capital to redeploy into development projects. Of the joint venture we just announced in Frankfurt is a good example of this strategy. The JV provides us with an opportunity to boost returns on stabilized assets and provides incremental capital to allocate to projects in the development phase. 
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we are not issuing official guidance today, I would like to provide an update as to our expectations, excluding any material and unforeseen changes. With the continued impact of COVID, we are planning for the fourth quarter to be generally in line with the third quarter for revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a dollar basis. Therefore, for the full year 2020, this would lead to a low single-digit revenue decline and flat to slightly positive adjusted EBITDA growth as compared to last year. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates approaching $60 million for revenue and $20 million for adjusted EBITDA. This outlook reflects our solid year-to-date performance, benefits from revenue management, accelerated project Summit savings and incorporates a cautious view for the fourth quarter. Given our favorable results, we now expect AFFO growth to be up low single digits for the full year. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our prior commentary. When we look ahead to 2021, as you expect, until we get COVID-19 behind us, naturally, it is difficult to provide guidance. But we are committed to providing the investment community with additional commentary on our trajectory and underlying business trends, just as what we've been doing throughout this year. While the challenges for our service business persist, we remain confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I'm proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results we've delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

We really feel very good about the Frankfurt joint venture and what the team has done there with that fully leased up facility. We invested about $100 million at closing essentially with the deal. Over time, we'll cash out nearly all of that impact all of it. And nearly all of that at the close, we retained over 20% retained equity interest in the venture. We will earn fees for things like property management, development and construction. And we'll take those proceeds and redevelop --  redeploy it into development pipeline, which has nice higher return opportunity. So essentially, we see it as the opportunity to monetize essentially what is a stabilized asset boost that return and then redeploy. You asked about debt, yes, of course, the entity would, as you're expecting, have debt on it. That debt will approximate the incremental development costs so that might be, over time, that could be as much as a couple of hundred million euro. We have a very attractive rate on that debt, I might add. And we feel very good about the way the development is proceeding. Bill, anything you'd like to add?"

And in fact, they have a similar structure with a different customer in the United States. So -- and we ran a process. So I would expect that they would be interested in any further processes that we run down in the past. So I wouldn't be surprised at all for us to see us do other things with AGC. But it will depend on the location and the opportunity. I think in terms of your question on storage revenue growth, is that it was about 1.7% if you just look at the physical storage and took out the data center, so it goes from 2.5% to 1.7%, but still strong positive growth based on some of the success that we've been having on the back of consumer. So really pleased, both in terms of records management is better this quarter. And also consumer is really starting to show that it's starting to hit approve. That being said, we do expect the quarters are going to kind of go backwards and forwards a little bit because consumer is a seasonal business, but we think the trajectory is moving in the right direction for both businesses. On the pricing side, you can see actually that we are continuing to get roughly the 3 points of price that Barry highlighted on it. We don't see any slowdown in that at all. And we have more to get in the emerging markets, which are relatively new to the game in terms of our revenue management processes. So good response from the customers, we're still considered very much an essential business or essential service to our customers. So it's a great position to be in."

So if you think a couple of examples or either at use and/or further downstream processing. So the example I gave on the call about the mortgage processing is really about downstream processing. But we also have -- and we talked about that, I think, a little bit on previous calls when we changed our service level agreements and really made a push on image on demand we've seen one customer, for instance, in the U.K. that has fully embraced that. So they only take dairy trebles now through image on demand. So we -- any time they need a retrieval is we image it, and we load it up onto the system and they access it that way, which we --  which for us is longer term, a higher-margin business for us than having advance on the road and obviously, environmentally is better. So so really kind of 2 bits. One is we're getting into more processes, quite frankly, where we weren't exposed before us. We're helping them with the downstream processes. And in the other cases, is people are taking advantage of our image on demand, which, for us, is a more efficient way to get them the information back."

I think we've always said for large campuses, we'd have -- we'd expect somewhere between 40% and 60% of the campus to be hyperscale and the rest would be colo or retail. And this year, but this year, it may be a little bit more noticeable. This is because the gestation period in terms of that marketing takes a while. And our relationship as we went into data centers, for sure, it was stronger in the enterprise side or during -- setting up private cloud for large enterprise customers than it was on the hyperscale. So this year, we're actually really pleased with the progress we've made in terms of building our reputation and exposure with the hyperscalers. So if you look at year-to-date, we're about 50-50. So about 50%, of that 51 megawatts that we've signed up year-to-date is hyperscale, including obviously the Frankfurt site, and about 50% is retail. So we're really happy with the mix. But you're for sure, you're right is that the cash and cash returns on hyperscale deployments are lower, but they're longer-term contracts. And it allows you to build out the facilities or the campus is faster. So it still is the right mix, we think, in terms of maximizing returns."

Let me start by saying, I hope you and your families are safe and well.

Let me start by saying, I hope you and your families are safe and well. The third quarter provided us with a great opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months in response to the pandemic and set a marker for outperformance through top line resilience in our physical storage and growing data center businesses, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record all whilst continuing our investment in innovation and new product development. I would like to thank all of our mountaineers for this remarkable performance into their steadfast focus on safety and execution. 
Despite lingering uncertainty related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen improvements, albeit gradual in key U.S. and international markets as it relates to our service activity levels, while showing continued strong performance in both our physical storage business and our global data center business. I continue to be inspired by the tireless efforts of our teams as they support and care for our customers, each other in our communities, whilst accelerating progress on our strategic priorities. 
From the start, we set out our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and take care of the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our customers. In April, we had up to 1/3 of our workforce out on furlough or other temporary leaves. I'm happy to report that we have brought a significant number of these mountaineers back to work to serve our customers, and we now have over 90% of our employees working regularly. 
Whilst this has been a very difficult time, we have proven to be very resilient. We are financially healthy with strong and reliable cash flow, driven in part by our brand and customer loyalty. This is evident in how we've managed the heightened uncertainty of the past 8 months. We quickly aligned on the right mix of priorities to maintain strong near-term momentum whilst continuing our investments in innovation and new products as we execute our plan for long-term value creation. This, combined with the benefits from Project Summit has allowed us to continue to invest in transforming and modernizing our company. 
As demonstrated by our year-on-year constant currency year-to-date adjusted EBITDA and storage revenue growth, we can already see the evidence supporting our belief that we will emerge from this pandemic as a stronger company on all dimensions. Clearly, there are still many uncertainties around COVID in terms of the development of the pandemic and how the government's worldwide will continue to respond with varying degrees of restrictions as infections rise. However, in the third quarter, we saw signs of improvement in customer trends, and as a result, the decline of our service revenue moderated. In addition, there is clear evidence that as and when the restrictions lift customers do come back to us with needs from both a physical and digital document storage perspective. And while some elements of our business may have changed forever, our positioning with the communities we serve remain strong. 
Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to adapt and transform our business model and solutions to changing customer needs due to challenges created by COVID-19. Our customers are evaluating their real estate needs, business processes and ways to increase digitization in a remote workplace setting. We have been focused on helping them navigate these challenges and have tasked ourselves with accelerating our response to our customers' needs. One thing is certain, the pandemic has created opportunities for us to help our customers in new and innovative ways. 
The fact is we're a different company than the one most people know. The strategic journey we have been on has driven this change. And to remind folks, our focus remains on 3 pillars: first, continued growth in physical storage revenue through pricing as well as new volume growth achieved from record growth in emerging markets and are in consumer storage in developed markets; second, utilizing our global scale as well as 70 years of customer trust to deliver a differentiated data center offering; and third, new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management in a more complex regulatory environment and one in which hybrid, physical and digital solutions are the norm. 
Further expanding on the product and services pillar, most know us for protecting highly regulated records. But over the years, our relationships have evolved to help customers manage a broader set of assets and to help them solve a broader range of problems. As customers' needs evolve, their expectations of us evolve. For this reason it is important we continue to invest in creating solutions that unlock value for our customers. 
A great example of this is a solution we just provided for a U.S. credit union who needed a faster, more efficient method for processing new members' mortgage loans after closing. Their old process was too manual and it could no longer support the volume of work, much less scale to meet the credit Union's 30% year-over-year growth projection. And it didn't satisfy increased regulations, the organization must now meet when selling their loans. 
We rebuilt the customer's workflow to better integrate their mix of paper and digital loan materials. This included mailroom services, document scanning and private vault with bio-resistant safeguards in defensible, secure disposition. 
We also applied machine learning to automate how the credit union access data, verified its accuracy and resolve missing or incorrect items. With these changes, the credit union can now process post-close mortgage loans much faster, more than doubling their capacity whilst reducing their costs by 25%. This example speaks to what we see as our differentiation and why customers ultimately call us when they need help. For some time, we have talked about our opportunity to enable our customers' digital transformation journeys. Initially, much of this work was going on behind the scenes, especially as Project Summit got underway, putting in place the systems and structures to support this transformation. The benefits of this work are now becoming more evident with notable improvements to our customer experience at a time when demand for our solutions has never been greater. This materialized in the third quarter and high single-digit growth in our digital solutions business. 
If you look at our physical storage business, this remains a key foundation for Iron Mountain. Customers have long trusted us to secure their information and their assets that matter most to them. They needed us to service their lock, if you will. But over time, whilst their needs expanded beyond security and compliance, their jobs grew more complex as they now had to store, use and extract value from growing amounts of information that was in both physical and digital form. The hybrid nature of their data was preventing them from achieving speed, compliance, efficiency and ultimately growth. A lock was no longer enough. They now needed a key to solve for this hybrid environment. 
Uniquely, Iron Mountain offers both the lock and the key that organizations need in order to realize competitive advantage from their paper and digital information. Plenty of companies offer a secure home for valued assets, when they offer technology services so customers can better use those assets, but this over specialization falls short of the needs of most customers. We hear from our customers that they want partners who can help them build singular solutions capable of solving for multiple demands of speed, cost savings, revenue opportunities and security. This is Iron Mountain's distinctive position. We serve as the lock and the key. 
Now let's take a closer look at business trends during the third quarter. At a high level, we are pleased with the stabilization and early recovery we're beginning to see across our service business. Service activity levels have shown a gradual improvement from the second quarter. However, similar to what we discussed last quarter, the shape of the recovery will be dependent on macro factors. The recent increases in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world has focused states and countries to implement new restrictions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Whilst these factors will make the recovery uneven, our experienced management team is prepared to confidently manage the volatility. 
Turning now to our physical storage business. Total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated modestly from last quarter, up 2.5%. This once again was driven by strong revenue management results as well as growth in our emerging markets in consumer. We continue to be very encouraged with the levels of organic storage revenue growth, underscoring the durability of the physical storage business and supporting strong cash generation. Total global organic volume increased 2 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this was 3 million cubic foot increase in consumer and other and fine art storage, partly offset by a decrease in records management volume. 
Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 1.1 million cubic feet compared to the second quarter. While still a decline, this is a significant improvement from the 3.9 million cubic foot decline last quarter, again, reflecting the early signs of recovery. We continue to expect the full year organic volume to be down 1% to 1.5% and up 2.5% in terms of organic revenue based on current visibility. 
Turning now to our global data center segment. We are very encouraged by another strong quarter of bookings. In Q3, we leased 12.3 megawatts, bringing the year-to-date total to just over 51 megawatts. The strong leasing this year, particularly among smaller deployments, has resulted in increase in our utilization by more than 7 points to nearly 92%. Given the need for additional capacity, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately 50 megawatts, consisting of both greenfield development and further build-out of existing facilities. Moreover, in excess of 50% of our development is pre-leased, resulting in a strong backlog. 
Let me now provide a brief update on Project Summit. Our transformation program is progressing well, and we are on track to realize our permanent structural cost savings of $375 million per year exiting next year. As you saw in our press release this morning, we now expect to be able to generate greater adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 as we have accelerated some initiatives. Most notably, these ongoing initiatives should not only significantly reduce our cost base, but also make it easier for our mountaineers to get work done, enabling them to focus on a more customer centric approach. Some examples include: driving global standardization in IT, replacing cumbersome manual processes with reliable automation and improving the user experience whilst reducing process cycle time. We are as excited about the systems and process improvements that our Project Summit as we are about the bottom line improvement and believe the end result will be an enhanced value proposition for our customers and communities. As we shared with you last quarter, we are strongly committed to all of our stakeholders. We are focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to continue on our path and accelerate improving our diversity and inclusion. 
In order to be a sustainable and successful company, we need to attract the best talent to drive maximum creativity through diverse and innovative thinking. I am proud to say we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2020 Corporate Equality Index. This recognition reinforces the important work we are doing and supports our goal of building and promoting an inclusive culture that encourages our employees to bring their whole authentic cells into the workplace. 
As we look at our business going forward, we see opportunities as well as risks and we are making every effort to ensure we are well placed to maximize the opportunities. We are cautious about our expectation of the pace of market recovery as we progress through 2021. In our own business, as we've shared with you in previous calls, we expect a gradual recovery in our service business to continue as economic activity recovers, leading 2021 to look similar to 2020, just in reverse in terms of quarterly progression. The work we are doing and have done to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, gives us confidence that we will come out of this position to consistently deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
In summary, we are leveraging the opportunity in this rapidly changing environment to reaffirm our commitment to our strategy of growth through increased product offerings in the physical storage area as well as continued rapid growth in our data center and digitization areas. At the same time, we continue to exercise prudent cost control and drive further efficiency across the organization through our transformation activities. We are proud of the progress we have made towards our transformative shift during this crisis. We are now even more enthusiastic about the speed of our future transformation given the lessons we have learned during the pandemic. I hope you all remain well. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial",2102,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. Revenue of $1.04 billion declined 2.4% on a reported basis year-on-year, which includes a 30 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 13.5%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. 
While the pace of recovery continues to be dependent on many factors, overall, we continue to see service declines moderate, reflecting an improving trajectory since the April, May time frame. 
For the full quarter, service trends were generally consistent with the July levels we discussed on our last call. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5%, driven by 3 points of revenue management and data center growth partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in global organic volume on a trailing 12-month basis. This is 30 basis point improvement as compared to the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points year-on-year to 35.7%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix while partially offset by fixed cost deleverage on lower service revenue and higher bonus compensation accrual. In addition, in the third quarter, we incurred incremental cost to keep our teams safe, for example, specialized cleaning of our facilities as well as purchases of personal protective equipment. We included these expenses in our adjusted EBITDA. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.31, down $0.01 from last year. AFFO declined 5.4% to $213 million. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the decline in AFFO was primarily driven by timing of cash taxes consistent with our outlook. 
Turning to segment performance and starting with the global RIM organization. In the third quarter, our global RIM business experienced declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year. This was partially offset by storage volume growth in our faster-growing markets and revenue management, which led to a total organic revenue decline of 3.9%. Back, together with better than planned project Summit benefits resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points. 
In the service business, we experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 31% for new boxes inbounded and 39% for retrievals and refiles. We also continue to see a slowdown on the outgoing side as permanent withdrawals declined to 28% and destructions were down 22%. In our thread business, activity declined approximately 17%. For the third quarter, our average realized paper price was 20% higher than the prior year, which was more than offset by a decline in paper tonnage, leading to a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. As we projected on our last call, after the temporary spike in recycled paper prices in April and May, prices have taken a step down. And by October, paper prices have now returned to the low levels experienced at the end of 2019. 
Our consumer storage business has maintained momentum and continues to be a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. In the third quarter, we continued cost reduction actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, albeit at much lower levels than earlier in the year. As service revenue expectations improve, we want to ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level so we can fully support our customers. As we have discussed before, this does tend to cause incremental cost deleverage as we bring back employees ahead of demand. We think this is the right investment to service our customers. 
Turning to global data center. The business delivered organic revenue growth of 12.1%, driven by prior period leasing and strong service revenue growth. This was partially offset by a moderate churn of 160 basis points, in line with our target of 1% to 2% per quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting slightly elevated levels of churn compared to our normal target range. In the quarter, we booked a nonrecurring revenue adjustment of $1.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% was consistent with our first half trend. As Bill noted, our data center team continued to deliver strong bookings momentum, signing over 12 megawatts of new and expansion leases, bringing year-to-date bookings of 51 megawatts. 
This commercial success resulted in us exceeding our previous full year target through the first 9 months. For the full year, we expect to deliver more than 55 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, representing bookings growth of 45%. Of course, that includes the significant hyperscale lease in Frankfurt. And excluding that, we would expect bookings growth of about 23%. This compares to our original guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts or mid-teens bookings growth. We believe we are growing considerably faster than the broader market. Going into next year, we feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation business supporting rich ecosystems across our platform. We believe we can lease in excess of 20 megawatts next year, which would result in mid-teens annual bookings growth. 
In October, we announced the formation of our joint venture with AGC Equity partners, a greater than EUR 300 million partnership for our fully preleased data center in Frankfurt. This venture represents an important strategic step towards our goal of identifying alternative sources of capital to fund accelerating growth as we expect proceeds will be redeployed into higher return development opportunities. As we have previously disclosed, the venture will be reflected as an unconsolidated joint venture and therefore, will not flow through to revenue and EBITDA. 
Turning to Project Summit. In the third quarter, we recognized $48 million of restructuring charges as well as an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $48 million. Through the first 9 months, we have delivered $113 million of benefit. This is ahead of our prior expectations as we accelerated certain initiatives in 2020 with a particular focus on the highest return activities in response to COVID 19. As Bill referred to, we now expect the program to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, approximately $150 million more in 2021 with the full program generating $375 million exiting 2021. In terms of costs related to Project Summit, we now expect to spend closer to $200 million in 2020. We continue to expect the cost to implement the full program to be approximately $450 million. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We are operating from a position of significant balance sheet strength. In the third quarter, our team did a nice job delivering further cash cycle improvement, with solid performance in both payables days and days sales outstanding. On a sequential basis, cash cycle improved by a full day as a result of continued DSO improvement. 
In August, the team executed another successful bond refinancing, issuing $1.1 billion to redeem our most restrictive outstanding debt and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. The continued strong support received from the fixed income community provided us the opportunity to upsize our transaction while printing the lowest coupon for 10-year notes in the company's history. 
Taken together with our bond offerings in CIN, we issued $3.5 billion of new debt on a leverage-neutral basis, increased our weighted average maturity by over 2 years to nearly 8 years, while only modestly increasing our weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, these new bonds are more in line with our REIT peers as they include a fixed charge coverage ratio as opposed to a debt-to-EBITDA covenant. Also, I think it is worth noting that we have eliminated all of our 6.5x leverage covenant bonds, meaning our most restricted bond covenant is now 7x debt to EBITDA. 
At quarter end, we had $1.7 billion of liquidity. As a reminder, at the end of the second quarter, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes from the June bond offering. We paid off the notes in early July, leaving us with a cash balance at September 30 $152 million. We ended the quarter with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3x, which takes into account adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.3x, which would represent an improvement year-on-year as we made progress toward our long-term leverage range  
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January  
Turning to capital expenditures Our full year expectation is now approximately $450 million or a decrease of $75 million, reflecting development capital for our FIFO data center that will now be a part of our venture with AGC. 
Now let me share a few thoughts as to our capital allocation strategy. First, we are committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. And over time, we expect to glide into our targeted AFFO payout ratio of mid-60s percent. Second, we are committed to our target long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x on a net lease-adjusted basis. This year, the team has made good progress toward our target. As investors know, we have been allocating significant capital to our data center business for several years. [indiscernible] pipeline continues to build with high-return investment opportunities, our strategic intent is to increase the amount of capital we dedicate to the business. With that, we have considered options to generate incremental funds for investment. We view capital recycling as a good means to monetize certain assets, particularly industrial real estate to increasingly invest in our development pipeline. Industrial cap rates are at historically low levels, and we have the opportunity to structure long-term leases on favorable terms that effectively allow us to have control of the facilities, whether we lease or own. 
With that, in the third quarter, our team accessed the market and monetized 2 facilities for proceeds of approximately $110 million. This brings our year-to-date proceeds to nearly $120 million, ahead of our full year target of $100 million. With the highly favorable market backdrop, together with our development pipeline, we are planning to recycle relatively more going forward, albeit what will amount to a small portion of our total industrial assets. Similarly, we view selling stabilized data center assets into a joint venture as analogous to monetizing industrial real estate assets. It represents another source of capital to redeploy into development projects. Of the joint venture we just announced in Frankfurt is a good example of this strategy. The JV provides us with an opportunity to boost returns on stabilized assets and provides incremental capital to allocate to projects in the development phase. 
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we are not issuing official guidance today, I would like to provide an update as to our expectations, excluding any material and unforeseen changes. With the continued impact of COVID, we are planning for the fourth quarter to be generally in line with the third quarter for revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a dollar basis. Therefore, for the full year 2020, this would lead to a low single-digit revenue decline and flat to slightly positive adjusted EBITDA growth as compared to last year. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates approaching $60 million for revenue and $20 million for adjusted EBITDA. This outlook reflects our solid year-to-date performance, benefits from revenue management, accelerated project Summit savings and incorporates a cautious view for the fourth quarter. Given our favorable results, we now expect AFFO growth to be up low single digits for the full year. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our prior commentary. When we look ahead to 2021, as you expect, until we get COVID-19 behind us, naturally, it is difficult to provide guidance. But we are committed to providing the investment community with additional commentary on our trajectory and underlying business trends, just as what we've been doing throughout this year. While the challenges for our service business persist, we remain confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I'm proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results we've delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

We really feel very good about the Frankfurt joint venture and what the team has done there with that fully leased up facility. We invested about $100 million at closing essentially with the deal. Over time, we'll cash out nearly all of that impact all of it. And nearly all of that at the close, we retained over 20% retained equity interest in the venture. We will earn fees for things like property management, development and construction. And we'll take those proceeds and redevelop --  redeploy it into development pipeline, which has nice higher return opportunity. 
So essentially, we see it as the opportunity to monetize essentially what is a stabilized asset boost that return and then redeploy. You asked about debt, yes, of course, the entity would, as you're expecting, have debt on it. That debt will approximate the incremental development costs so that might be, over time, that could be as much as a couple of hundred million euro. We have a very attractive rate on that debt, I might add. And we feel very good about the way the development is proceeding. Bill, anything you'd like to add?"

And we were able to find that both on the debt and the equity side. So it just makes sense to take that money and then plow it back into higher return projects."

And in fact, they have a similar structure with a different customer in the United States. So -- and we ran a process. So I would expect that they would be interested in any further processes that we run down in the past. 
So I wouldn't be surprised at all for us to see us do other things with AGC. But it will depend on the location and the opportunity. I think in terms of your question on storage revenue growth, is that it was about 1.7% if you just look at the physical storage and took out the data center, so it goes from 2.5% to 1.7%, but still strong positive growth based on some of the success that we've been having on the back of consumer. 
So really pleased, both in terms of records management is better this quarter. And also consumer is really starting to show that it's starting to hit approve. That being said, we do expect the quarters are going to kind of go backwards and forwards a little bit because consumer is a seasonal business, but we think the trajectory is moving in the right direction for both businesses. 
On the pricing side, you can see actually that we are continuing to get roughly the 3 points of price that Barry highlighted on it. We don't see any slowdown in that at all. And we have more to get in the emerging markets, which are relatively new to the game in terms of our revenue management processes. So good response from the customers, we're still considered very much an essential business or essential service to our customers. So it's a great position to be in."

So we feel good about that monetization strategy. And then in terms of priorities, it really is into higher return IRR projects that are in the development pipeline.

So if you think a couple of examples or either at use and/or further downstream processing. So the example I gave on the call about the mortgage processing is really about downstream processing. But we also have -- and we talked about that, I think, a little bit on previous calls when we changed our service level agreements and really made a push on image on demand we've seen one customer, for instance, in the U.K. that has fully embraced that. So they only take dairy trebles now through image on demand. So we -- any time they need a retrieval is we image it, and we load it up onto the system and they access it that way, which we --  which for us is longer term, a higher-margin business for us than having advance on the road and obviously, environmentally is better. So really kind of 2 bits. One is we're getting into more processes, quite frankly, where we weren't exposed before us. We're helping them with the downstream processes. And in the other cases, is people are taking advantage of our image on demand, which, for us, is a more efficient way to get them the information back."

And this year, but this year, it may be a little bit more noticeable. This is because the gestation period in terms of that marketing takes a while. 
And our relationship as we went into data centers, for sure, it was stronger in the enterprise side or during -- setting up private cloud for large enterprise customers than it was on the hyperscale. So this year, we're actually really pleased with the progress we've made in terms of building our reputation and exposure with the hyperscalers. So if you look at year-to-date, we're about 50-50. So about 50%, of that 51 megawatts that we've signed up year-to-date is hyperscale, including obviously the Frankfurt site, and about 50% is retail. So we're really happy with the mix. But you're for sure, you're right is that the cash and cash returns on hyperscale deployments are lower, but they're longer-term contracts.
