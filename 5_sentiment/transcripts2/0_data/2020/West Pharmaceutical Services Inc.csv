Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we're entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our market-led strategy. Overall, o",996,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we're entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our market-led strategy. 
Overall, our 2019 performance demonstrated the favorable market conditions and durability of our business. The commitment and focus of our One West team is delivering superior value to customers. Through our high-quality products and solutions is what differentiates West as the global leader for containment and delivery of injectable medicines. 
We ended the year with 13% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. We expand growth and operating profit margins largely through strong high-value product sales growth and great results from our global operations initiatives. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, and we generated strong year-over-year growth in operating cash flow. 
As we enter 2020, we're building on the positive momentum we generated in 2019. We are introducing full year 2020 financial guidance that assumes organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, which is at the upper end of our usual 6% to 8% range. We are also forecasting double-digit earnings growth, adjusted for tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
Bernard will go into greater detail on our 2020 guidance shortly. Slide 4 shows a detailed summary of the sales performance in 2019. Proprietary product sales grew organically by 14.7% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 60% of proprietary product sales grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout the year. Let's take a look at the performance of the market units for the quarter. 
Starting with biologics. This market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. Our biologic customers from emerging biotech to large biopharma continue to come to West and our partner, Daikyo, as the preferred choice for high-value product offerings. This is reinforced by the very high participation rate we continue to experience with all new biologic and biosimilar approvals in 2019. 
The generics market unit finished the year on a solid note with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by sales of Westar components and products from our self-injection delivery platforms. As we have discussed in past calls, our self-injection delivery platforms are being adopted by not only biologic customers but also by small molecule generic customers looking to differentiate their drugs with our devices. 
Our pharma market unit saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, strong high-value product sales growth was a driver combined with a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the impact from the previously reported voluntary recall over bio to bank product. And Contract Manufacturing ended the year with high single-digit organic sales growth for the fourth quarter, led once again by sales of health care-related injection and diagnostic devices. 
On Slide 5, we had several exciting product launches that positions the company for continued growth, such as NovaPure 3 mL cartridge components that satisfy an unmet market need with the increase in sensitive biologic products being developed in dosages larger than 1 mL. 
We expanded our self-injection platform with Smartdose Gen 2 injector with a patient experience in mind, enabling subcu delivery of high-viscosity drugs at dosages up to 10 mLs. We also introduced an advanced elastomer formulation, which enhances performance and reliability featuring Westar Select quality and low particulate levels, while mitigating risk for our customers. And we launched AccelTRA Select, a line of products that provides generic customers with high quality, ready-to-use components with market-leading delivery times. 
Turning to Slide 6. We outlined our One West global operations strategy and management system. Operating with the excellence and efficiency that is inherent in our One West system has enabled our success and growth in 2018, and we'll do so for the foreseeable future. Our global operations team had another excellent year. The team is focused on continuous improvements related to service, quality and safety, while at the same time, driving efficiency gains. 
Over the past year, we completed the restructuring program that was announced in early 2018 and reduced our global manufacturing footprint to 25 sites. We are improving productivity, making more informed choices in capital investments and have set the stage for the next phase of improvements through automation and advanced manufacturing systems. 
The efficiencies we have gained by employing this new global operating system has meant we have additional cash available to reinvest in the business. 
Highlighted on Slide 7, our investments we completed in 2019 that will drive growth going forward. The acquisition of our Korean distributor creates a direct presence for West and a market seeing strong growth, especially in biologic drug manufacturing. We also increased a minority stake to 49% in Daikyo [indiscernible] Japan. After more than 40 years of partnership, we know that our 2 companies share a unique, committed to science, quality and technical expertise that continues to prove valuable to the customers and patients we serve together. 
In addition, in 2019, we enhanced our global digital capabilities with the opening of our digital technology center in India. The DTC serves as a center of excellence for our global digital and transformation team, supporting many areas of our business, including digital marketing, data analytics and supporting the future of digital manufacturing and automation capabilities. 
Driving sustainable business practices has been a long-standing imperative at West, as shown on Slide 8. In 2018, we received several accolades for our efforts across the 6 pillars of our corporate responsibility program. At West, we are committed to nurturing a culture of diversity and inclusion along with supporting the communities in which our team members live and work through both philanthropy and sustainable business practices. We made great strides in both areas in 2019. 
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance, 2020 guidance and our long-term outlook.

Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all 4 market units.

We'll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all 4 market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some year-end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First of Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in slides 15 to 20. We recorded net sales of $470.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. We also saw double-digit organic sales growth in our 3 proprietary product market units and high single-digit organic sales growth in contract manufacturing. 
For the full year, we recorded net sales of $1.84 billion, representing organic sales growth of 10% and 10 basis points of inorganic growth. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $153.2 million in gross profit, $20 million or 15% above Q4 of last year, and our gross profit margin of 32.5% was 100 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the full year of 32.9% was a 110 basis point expansion from the previous year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit [ of which $73.1 million  ] recorded this quarter compared to $67.1 million in the same period last year for a 9% increase. 
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 15.5% was a 40 basis point reduction from the same period last year. As mentioned on our Q3 call, SG&A expenses for Q4 2018 were low due to the release of bonuses, primarily as a result of the Vial2Bag recall. Adjusting for this, we would have seen adjusted operating profit margin expand by approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.1% for the year was 160 basis points increase from 2018. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% for the quarter and approximately 15% for the year. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 13% for the quarter and 18% for the full year. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? 
On Slide 10, we show the contribution to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.7 million or 12.2 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $3.3 million or 0.8 percentage points of growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $6.9 million or a reduction of 1.6 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.5% for Q4 2019, up from 31.5% in Q4 2018. Proprietary products fourth quarter gross profit margin of 38% was 100 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018. Proprietary products full year gross profit of 38.6% was 150 basis points above the margin achieved in 2018. The key drivers for the continued improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin for the fourth quarter were favorable mix of products sold, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Our high-value products represented 63% of Q4 proprietary product sales and generated double-digit organic sales growth. Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 16.4% was flat compared to the prior year quarter. However, we saw Contract Manufacturing margins show sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow of $367.2 million for the full year 2019, an increase of $78.6 million compared to the full year 2018 and a 27% increase. Our 2019 capital spending was $126.4 million, $21.7 million higher than a year ago but in line with guidance. Working capital of $717.1 million at December 31, 2019, was $106.4 million higher than at December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Our cash balance at December 31 of $439.1 million was $101.7 million more than our December 2018 balance, primarily due to improved operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. We expect our full year 2020 net sales guidance to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion. Including an estimated headwind of $15 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, and capital expenditures will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our EPS guidance. Estimated FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.04 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, and it also it also includes -- it also excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
To summarize the key takeaways for the year. Strong top line growth in both proprietary and contract manufacturing. Gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in full year 2019 operating and free cash flow. 
Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of continued organic sales growth and operating margin and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

I've had the chance to travel to a number of our sites, as you know, across the globe and have continuously impressed on the momentum, the focus, the energy and the capabilities of launched this One West Lean improvement system. So I'd say we are in early stages, but we're seeing some excellent traction as we go forward. And I expect that this is not just a onetime impact, but this is an annual benefit that we'll see going forward and just puts us in a much better position as we think about future investments for West. 
In regards to capacity expansions, what we're looking at and what we're investing towards is more expansion of capacity on current existing platforms. To give you an example, we're investing in additional growth capacity in Crystal Zenith over what amount insert needle, pre-filled strings out of Scottsdale. We're also investing in further expansions in the self-injection devices of SelfDose and SmartDose based on current demand that we have committed by customers. 
So the type of investments will continue to go into our high-value products like Kinston, Waterford in other locations around the globe. But the -- it's less than land and buildings is more about technology, automation and more modular cell manufacturing."

Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we're entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our Market-Led strategy. Overall, o",994,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we're entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our Market-Led strategy. 
Overall, our 2019 performance demonstrated the favorable market conditions and durability of our business. The commitment and focus of our One West team is delivering superior value to customers. Through our high-quality products and solutions is what differentiates West as the global leader for containment and delivery of injectable medicines. 
We ended the year with 13% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. We expand growth and operating profit margins largely through strong high-value product sales growth and great results from our global operations initiatives. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, and we generated strong year-over-year growth in operating cash flow. 
As we enter 2020, we're building on the positive momentum we generated in 2019. We are introducing full year 2020 financial guidance that assumes organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, which is at the upper end of our usual 6% to 8% range. We're also forecasting double-digit earnings growth, adjusted for tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
Bernard will go into greater detail on our 2020 guidance shortly. Slide 4 shows a detailed summary of the sales performance in 2019. Proprietary Product sales grew organically by 14.7% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 60% of Proprietary Product sales grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout the year. Let's take a look at the performance of the market units for the quarter. 
Starting with biologics. This market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. Our biologic customers from emerging biotech to large biopharma continue to come to West and our partner, Daikyo, as the preferred choice for high-value product offerings. This is reinforced by the very high participation rate we continue to experience with all new biologic and biosimilar approvals in 2019. 
The generics market unit finished the year on a solid note with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by sales of Westar components and products from our self-injection delivery platforms. As we have discussed in past calls, our self-injection delivery platforms are being adopted by not only biologic customers but also by small molecule generic customers looking to differentiate their drugs with our devices. 
Our pharma market unit saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, strong high-value product sales growth was a driver combined with a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the impact from the previously reported voluntary recall of our Vial2Bag product.
And Contract Manufacturing ended the year with high single-digit organic sales growth for the fourth quarter, led once again by sales of health care-related injection and diagnostic devices. 
On Slide 5, we have several exciting product launches that positions the company for continued growth, such as NovaPure 3 ml cartridge components that satisfy an unmet market need with the increase in sensitive biologic products being developed in dosages larger than 1 ml. 
We expanded our self-injection platform with SmartDose Gen. II injector with a patient experience in mind, enabling subcu delivery of high-viscosity drugs at dosages up to 10 mls. We also introduced an advanced elastomer formulation, which enhances performance and reliability featuring Westar Select quality and low particulate levels, while mitigating risk for our customers. And we launched AccelTRA Select, a line of products that provides generic customers with high quality, ready-to-use components with market-leading delivery times. 
Turning to Slide 6. We outlined our One West global operations strategy and management system. Operating with the excellence and efficiency that is inherent in our One West system has enabled our success and growth in 2018, and will do so for the foreseeable future. Our global operations team had another excellent year. The team is focused on continuous improvements related to service, quality and safety, while at the same time, driving efficiency gains. 
Over the past year, we completed the restructuring program that was announced in early 2018 and reduced our global manufacturing footprint to 25 sites. We are improving productivity, making more informed choices in capital investments and have set the stage for the next phase of improvements through automation and advanced manufacturing systems. 
The efficiencies we have gained by employing this new global operating system has meant we have additional cash available to reinvest in the business. 
Highlighted on Slide 7 are investments we completed in 2019 that will drive growth going forward. The acquisition of our Korean distributor creates a direct presence for West and a market seeing strong growth, especially in biologic drug manufacturing. We also increased a minority stake to 49% in Daikyo Seiko, Japan. After more than 40 years of partnership, we know that our 2 companies share a unique, committed to science, quality and technical expertise that continues to prove valuable to the customers and patients we serve together. 
In addition, in 2019, we enhanced our global digital capabilities with the opening of our Digital Technology Center in India. The DTC serves as a center of excellence for our global digital and transformation team, supporting many areas of our business, including digital marketing, data analytics and supporting the future of digital manufacturing and automation capabilities. 
Driving sustainable business practices has been a long-standing imperative at West, as shown on Slide 8. In 2018, we received several accolades for our efforts across the 6 pillars of our corporate responsibility program. At West, we are committed to nurturing a culture of diversity and inclusion along with supporting the communities in which our team members live and work through both philanthropy and sustainable business practices. We made great strides in both areas in 2019. 
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance, 2020 guidance and our long-term outlook.

We'll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all 4 market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some year-end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First up, Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 to 20. We recorded net sales of $470.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. We also saw double-digit organic sales growth in our 3 Proprietary Product market units and high single-digit organic sales growth in contract manufacturing. 
For the full year, we recorded net sales of $1.84 billion, representing organic sales growth of 10% and 10 basis points of inorganic growth. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $153.2 million in gross profit, $20 million or 15% above Q4 of last year, and our gross profit margin of 32.5% was 100 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the full year of 32.9% was a 110 basis point expansion from the previous year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $73.1 million recorded this quarter compared to $67.1 million in the same period last year for a 9% increase. 
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 15.5% was a 40 basis point reduction from the same period last year. As mentioned on our Q3 call, SG&A expenses for Q4 2018 were low due to the release of bonuses, primarily as a result of the Vial2Bag recall. Adjusting for this, we would have seen adjusted operating profit margin expand by approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.1% for the year was 160 basis points increase from 2018. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% for the quarter and approximately 15% for the year. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 13% for the quarter and 18% for the full year. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? 
On Slide 10, we show the contribution to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.7 million or 12.2 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $3.3 million or 0.8 percentage points of growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $6.9 million or a reduction of 1.6 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.5% for Q4 2019, up from 31.5% in Q4 2018. Proprietary Products' fourth quarter gross profit margin of 38% was 100 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018. Proprietary Products' full year gross profit of 38.6% was 150 basis points above the margin achieved in 2018. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products' gross profit margin for the fourth quarter were a favorable mix of products sold, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Our high-value products represented 63% of Q4 Proprietary Product sales and generated double-digit organic sales growth. Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 16.4% was flat compared to the prior year quarter, however, we saw Contract Manufacturing margins show sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow of $367.2 million for the full year 2019, an increase of $78.6 million compared to the full year 2018 and a 27% increase. Our 2019 capital spending was $126.4 million, $21.7 million higher than a year ago but in line with guidance. Working capital of $717.1 million at December 31, 2019, was $106.4 million higher than at December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Our cash balance at December 31 of $439.1 million was $101.7 million more than our December 2018 balance, primarily due to improved operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. We expect our full year 2020 net sales guidance to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion, including an estimated headwind of $15 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 7% to 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, and capital expenditures will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our EPS guidance. Estimated FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.04 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, and it also includes -- it also excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
To summarize the key takeaways for the year, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing; gross profit margin improvement; growth in operating profit margin; growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in full year 2019 operating and free cash flow. 
Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of continued organic sales growth and operating margin and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

I've had the chance to travel to a number of our sites, as you know, across the globe and have continuously impressed on the momentum, the focus, the energy and the capabilities have launched this One West Lean improvement system. So I'd say we are in early stages, but we're seeing some excellent traction as we go forward. And I expect that this is not just a onetime impact, but this is an annual benefit that we'll see going forward and just puts us in a much better position as we think about future investments for West. 
In regards to capacity expansions, what we're looking at and what we're investing towards is more expansion of capacity on current existing platforms. 
To give you an example, we're investing in additional growth capacity in Crystal Zenith over what amount insert needle, pre-filled strings out of Scottsdale. We're also investing in further expansions in the self-injection devices of SelfDose and SmartDose based on current demand that we have committed by customers. 
So these type of investments will continue to go into our high-value products like Kinston, Waterford, in other locations around the globe. But these -- it's less than land and buildings. It's more about technology, automation and more modular cell manufacturing."

You've talked really from the time Bernard joined, the CapEx budget has come down pretty dramatically, hit maybe a lower point than we expected in 2018, up a little bit in 2019.

So it's driven by customer land and customer interest. So we typically spend between $40 million to $50 million on maintenance CapEx. And on IT, we're looking at about $10 million to $15 million. So the balance is really on all growth opportunities. And again, it's an on expanding capacity, primarily through introducing you spend on equipment."

I think when we look at the high-value product portfolio and where the penetration is, you're absolutely correct. If you look at majority of the revenues are more of the products we introduced several years ago. And you think about NovaPure, which has been launched, but the uptake is significant. In fact, that's the other area of capacity expansion we have going on, both in U.S. and Europe to keep up with demand. So while the percentage is, let's say it's smaller, like, i.e., less than 10% of the high-value product portfolio, it's going to be much more meaningful over the next few years to come. So we're really confident of the runway we have ahead of us and the penetration of when we go from Envision all the way up to NovaPure, through what we see in the pipeline will only increase. And that's really all I can say at this point in time. We believe it's a double-digit growth portfolio, driven by the high-value products on the NovaPure, higher-end products of that portfolio, and it's going to be about 100-plus basis point volume expansion every year just to keep up with that demand."

Overall, o",996,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we're entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our market-led strategy. 
Overall, our 2019 performance demonstrated the favorable market conditions and durability of our business. The commitment and focus of our One West team is delivering superior value to customers, through our high-quality products and solutions is what differentiates West as the global leader for containment and delivery of injectable medicines. 
We ended the year with 13% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. We expanded growth and operating profit margins largely through strong high-value product sales growth and great results from our global operations initiatives. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, and we generated strong year-over-year growth in operating cash flow. 
As we enter 2020, we're building on the positive momentum we generated in 2019. We are introducing full year 2020 financial guidance that assumes organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, which is at the upper end of our usual 6% to 8% range. We're also forecasting double-digit earnings growth, adjusted for tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
Bernard will go into greater detail on our 2020 guidance shortly. Slide 4 shows a detailed summary of the sales performance in 2019. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 14.7% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 60% of Proprietary Products sales grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout the year. Let's take a look at the performance of the market units for the quarter. 
Starting with Biologics. This market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. Our biologic customers from emerging biotech to large biopharma continue to come to West and our partner, Daikyo, as the preferred choice for high-value product offerings. This is reinforced by the very high participation rate we continue to experience with all new biologic and biosimilar approvals in 2019. 
The generics market unit finished the year on a solid note with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by sales of Westar components and products from our self-injection delivery platforms. As we have discussed in past calls, our self-injection delivery platforms are being adopted by not only biologic customers but also by small molecule generic customers looking to differentiate their drugs with our devices. 
Our Pharma market unit saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, strong high-value product sales growth was a driver combined with a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the impact from the previously reported voluntary recall of our Vial2Bag product.
And Contract Manufacturing ended the year with high single-digit organic sales growth for the fourth quarter, led once again by sales of health care related injection and diagnostic devices. 
On Slide 5, we have several exciting product launches that positions the company for continued growth, such as NovaPure 3 mL cartridge components that satisfy an unmet market need with the increase in sensitive biologic products being developed in dosages larger than 1 mL. 
We expanded our self-injection platform with SmartDose Gen. II injector with a patient experience in mind, enabling subcu delivery of high-viscosity drugs at dosages up to 10 mls. We also introduced an advanced elastomer formulation, which enhances performance and reliability featuring Westar Select quality and low particulate levels, while mitigating risk for our customers. And we launched AccelTRA Select, a line of products that provides generic customers with high quality, ready-to-use components with market-leading delivery times. 
Turning to Slide 6. We outlined our One West Global Operations strategy and management system. Operating with the excellence and efficiency that is inherent in our One West system has enabled our success and growth in 2018, and will do so for the foreseeable future. Our Global Operations team had another excellent year. The team is focused on continuous improvements related to service, quality and safety, while at the same time, driving efficiency gains. 
Over the past year, we've completed the restructuring program that was announced in early 2018 and reduced our global manufacturing footprint to 25 sites. We are improving productivity, making more informed choices in capital investments and have set the stage for the next phase of improvements through automation and advanced manufacturing systems. 
The efficiencies we have gained by employing this new global operating system has meant we have additional cash available to reinvest in the business. 
Highlighted on Slide 7 are investments we completed in 2019 that will drive growth going forward. The acquisition of our Korean distributor creates a direct presence for West in a market seeing strong growth, especially in biologic drug manufacturing. We also increased a minority stake to 49% in Daikyo Seiko of Japan. After more than 40 years of partnership, we know that our 2 companies share a unique, committed to science, quality and technical expertise that continues to prove valuable to the customers and patients we serve together. 
In addition, in 2019, we enhanced our global digital capabilities with the opening of our Digital Technology Center in India. The DTC serves as a center of excellence for our global digital and transformation team, supporting many areas of our business, including digital marketing, data analytics and supporting the future of digital manufacturing and automation capabilities. 
Driving sustainable business practices has been a long-standing imperative at West, as shown on Slide 8. In 2018, we received several accolades for our efforts across the 6 pillars of our corporate responsibility program. At West, we are committed to nurturing a culture of diversity and inclusion along with supporting the communities in which our team members live and work through both philanthropy and sustainable business practices. We made great strides in both areas in 2019. 
Now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance, 2020 guidance and our long-term outlook.

Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all 4 market units. I will take you thro",919,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all 4 market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some year-end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First up, Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 to 20. We recorded net sales of $470.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. We also saw double-digit organic sales growth in our 3 Proprietary Product market units and high single-digit organic sales growth in contract manufacturing. 
For the full year, we recorded net sales of $1.84 billion, representing organic sales growth of 10% and 10 basis points of inorganic growth. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $153.2 million in gross profit, $20 million or 15% above Q4 of last year and our gross profit margin of 32.5% was 100 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the full year of 32.9% was a 110 basis point expansion from the previous year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $73.1 million recorded this quarter compared to $67.1 million in the same period last year for a 9% increase. 
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 15.5% was a 40 basis point reduction from the same period last year. As mentioned on our Q3 call, SG&A expenses for Q4 2018 were low due to the release of bonuses, primarily as a result of the Vial2Bag recall. Adjusting for this, we would have seen adjusted operating profit margin expand by approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.1% for the year was 160 basis points increase from 2018. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% for the quarter and approximately 15% for the year. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 13% for the quarter and 18% for the full year. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? 
On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.7 million or 12.2 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $3.3 million or 0.8 percentage points of growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $6.9 million or a reduction of 1.6 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.5% for Q4 2019, up from 31.5% in Q4 2018. Proprietary Products' fourth quarter gross profit margin of 38% was 100 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Proprietary Products' full year gross profit of 38.6% was 150 basis points above the margin achieved in 2018. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products' gross profit margin for the fourth quarter were a favorable mix of products sold, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Our high-value products represented 63% of Q4 Proprietary Products sales and generated double-digit organic sales growth. 
Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 16.4% was flat compared to the prior year quarter, however, we saw Contract Manufacturing margins show sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. 
Now, let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow of $367.2 million for the full year 2019, an increase of $78.6 million compared to the full year 2018 and a 27% increase. 
Our 2019 capital spending was $126.4 million, $21.7 million higher than a year ago but in line with guidance. Working capital of $717.1 million at December 31, 2019, was $106.4 million higher than at December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Our cash balance at December 31 of $439.1 million was $101.7 million more than our December 2018 balance, primarily due to improved operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. We expect our full year 2020 net sales guidance to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion, including an estimated headwind of $15 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 7% to 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, and capital expenditures will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our EPS guidance. Estimated FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.04 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, and it also includes -- it also excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
To summarize the key takeaways for the year, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing; gross profit margin improvement; growth in operating profit margin; growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in full year 2019 operating and free cash flow. 
Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of continued organic sales growth and operating margin and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

And we're reinvesting in our business with digital technology, automation across our operations, and strategic partnerships to fuel our future growth. 
Our mission to improve patient lives propels us each and every day. We do not take this for granted. We realize that our products are used by millions of patients across the globe on a daily basis, which is why we're so dedicated to continuously improving our capabilities. As we look to the future and the new drugs that are being launched by our customers, we know that West will play an integral part in bringing those medicines to market. 
We are committed in the growth strategy. We're excited about the opportunities ahead of us, and we look forward to a successful 2020.

I've had the chance to travel to a number of our states, as you know, across the globe and I'm continuously impressed on the momentum, the focus, the energy and the capabilities have launched this One West Lean improvement system. 
So I'd say we are in early stages, but we're seeing some excellent traction as we go forward. And I expect that this is not just a onetime impact, but this is an annual benefit that we'll see going forward and just puts us in a much better position as we think about future investments for West. 
In regards to capacity expansions, what we're looking at and what we're investing towards is more expansion of capacity on current existing platforms. To give you an example, we're investing in additional growth capacity in Crystal Zenith, of our 1 mL Insert Needle pre-filled strings out of Scottsdale. 
We're also investing in further expansions in the self-injection devices of SelfDose and SmartDose based on current demand that we have committed by customers. 
So these type of investments will continue to go into our high-value products like Kinston, Waterford, and other locations around the globe. But these -- it's less than land and buildings, it's more about technology, automation and more modular cell manufacturing."

Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we're entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our market-led strategy. Overall, o",996,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we're entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our market-led strategy. 
Overall, our 2019 performance demonstrated the favorable market conditions and durability of our business. The commitment and focus of our One West team is delivering superior value to customers, through our high-quality products and solutions is what differentiates West as the global leader for containment and delivery of injectable medicines. 
We ended the year with 13% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. We expanded growth and operating profit margins largely through strong high-value product sales growth and great results from our global operations initiatives. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, and we generated strong year-over-year growth in operating cash flow. 
As we enter 2020, we're building on the positive momentum we generated in 2019. We are introducing full year 2020 financial guidance that assumes organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, which is at the upper end of our usual 6% to 8% range. We're also forecasting double-digit earnings growth, adjusted for tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
Bernard will go into greater detail on our 2020 guidance shortly. Slide 4 shows a detailed summary of the sales performance in 2019. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 14.7% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 60% of Proprietary Products sales grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout the year. Let's take a look at the performance of the market units for the quarter. 
Starting with Biologics. This market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. Our biologic customers from emerging biotech to large biopharma continue to come to West and our partner, Daikyo, as the preferred choice for high-value product offerings. This is reinforced by the very high participation rate we continue to experience with all new biologic and biosimilar approvals in 2019. 
The generics market unit finished the year on a solid note with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by sales of Westar components and products from our self-injection delivery platforms. As we have discussed in past calls, our self-injection delivery platforms are being adopted by not only biologic customers but also by small molecule generic customers looking to differentiate their drugs with our devices. 
Our Pharma market unit saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, strong high-value product sales growth was a driver combined with a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the impact from the previously reported voluntary recall of our Vial2Bag product.
And Contract Manufacturing ended the year with high single-digit organic sales growth for the fourth quarter, led once again by sales of health care related injection and diagnostic devices. 
On Slide 5, we have several exciting product launches that positions the company for continued growth, such as NovaPure 3 mL cartridge components that satisfy an unmet market need with the increase in sensitive biologic products being developed in dosages larger than 1 mL. 
We expanded our self-injection platform with SmartDose Gen. II injector with a patient experience in mind, enabling subcu delivery of high-viscosity drugs at dosages up to 10 mls. We also introduced an advanced elastomer formulation, which enhances performance and reliability featuring Westar Select quality and low particulate levels, while mitigating risk for our customers. And we launched AccelTRA Select, a line of products that provides generic customers with high quality, ready-to-use components with market-leading delivery times. 
Turning to Slide 6. We outlined our One West Global Operations strategy and management system. Operating with the excellence and efficiency that is inherent in our One West system has enabled our success and growth in 2018, and will do so for the foreseeable future. Our Global Operations team had another excellent year. The team is focused on continuous improvements related to service, quality and safety, while at the same time, driving efficiency gains. 
Over the past year, we've completed the restructuring program that was announced in early 2018 and reduced our global manufacturing footprint to 25 sites. We are improving productivity, making more informed choices in capital investments and have set the stage for the next phase of improvements through automation and advanced manufacturing systems. 
The efficiencies we have gained by employing this new global operating system has meant we have additional cash available to reinvest in the business. 
Highlighted on Slide 7 are investments we completed in 2019 that will drive growth going forward. The acquisition of our Korean distributor creates a direct presence for West in a market seeing strong growth, especially in biologic drug manufacturing. We also increased a minority stake to 49% in Daikyo Seiko of Japan. After more than 40 years of partnership, we know that our 2 companies share a unique, committed to science, quality and technical expertise that continues to prove valuable to the customers and patients we serve together. 
In addition, in 2019, we enhanced our global digital capabilities with the opening of our Digital Technology Center in India. The DTC serves as a center of excellence for our global digital and transformation team, supporting many areas of our business, including digital marketing, data analytics and supporting the future of digital manufacturing and automation capabilities. 
Driving sustainable business practices has been a long-standing imperative at West, as shown on Slide 8. In 2018, we received several accolades for our efforts across the 6 pillars of our corporate responsibility program. At West, we are committed to nurturing a culture of diversity and inclusion along with supporting the communities in which our team members live and work through both philanthropy and sustainable business practices. We made great strides in both areas in 2019. 
Now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance, 2020 guidance and our long-term outlook.

Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all 4 market units.

We'll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all 4 market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some year-end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First up, Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 to 20. We recorded net sales of $470.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. We also saw double-digit organic sales growth in our 3 Proprietary Product market units and high single-digit organic sales growth in contract manufacturing. 
For the full year, we recorded net sales of $1.84 billion, representing organic sales growth of 10% and 10 basis points of inorganic growth. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $153.2 million in gross profit, $20 million or 15% above Q4 of last year and our gross profit margin of 32.5% was 100 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the full year of 32.9% was a 110 basis point expansion from the previous year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $73.1 million recorded this quarter compared to $67.1 million in the same period last year for a 9% increase. 
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 15.5% was a 40 basis point reduction from the same period last year. As mentioned on our Q3 call, SG&A expenses for Q4 2018 were low due to the release of bonuses, primarily as a result of the Vial2Bag recall. Adjusting for this, we would have seen adjusted operating profit margin expand by approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.1% for the year was 160 basis points increase from 2018. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% for the quarter and approximately 15% for the year. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 13% for the quarter and 18% for the full year. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? 
On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.7 million or 12.2 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $3.3 million or 0.8 percentage points of growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $6.9 million or a reduction of 1.6 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.5% for Q4 2019, up from 31.5% in Q4 2018. Proprietary Products' fourth quarter gross profit margin of 38% was 100 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Proprietary Products' full year gross profit of 38.6% was 150 basis points above the margin achieved in 2018. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products' gross profit margin for the fourth quarter were a favorable mix of products sold, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Our high-value products represented 63% of Q4 Proprietary Products sales and generated double-digit organic sales growth. 
Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 16.4% was flat compared to the prior year quarter, however, we saw Contract Manufacturing margins show sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. 
Now, let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow of $367.2 million for the full year 2019, an increase of $78.6 million compared to the full year 2018 and a 27% increase. 
Our 2019 capital spending was $126.4 million, $21.7 million higher than a year ago but in line with guidance. Working capital of $717.1 million at December 31, 2019, was $106.4 million higher than at December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Our cash balance at December 31 of $439.1 million was $101.7 million more than our December 2018 balance, primarily due to improved operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. We expect our full year 2020 net sales guidance to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion, including an estimated headwind of $15 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 7% to 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, and capital expenditures will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our EPS guidance. Estimated FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.04 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, and it also includes -- it also excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
To summarize the key takeaways for the year, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing; gross profit margin improvement; growth in operating profit margin; growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in full year 2019 operating and free cash flow. 
Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of continued organic sales growth and operating margin and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

So I'd say we are in early stages, but we're seeing some excellent traction as we go forward. And I expect that this is not just a onetime impact, but this is an annual benefit that we'll see going forward and just puts us in a much better position as we think about future investments for West. 
In regards to capacity expansions, what we're looking at and what we're investing towards is more expansion of capacity on current existing platforms. To give you an example, we're investing in additional growth capacity in Crystal Zenith, of our 1 mL Insert Needle pre-filled strings out of Scottsdale. 
We're also investing in further expansions in the self-injection devices of SelfDose and SmartDose based on current demand that we have committed by customers. 
So these type of investments will continue to go into our high-value products like Kinston, Waterford, and other locations around the globe. But these -- it's less than land and buildings, it's more about technology, automation and more modular cell manufacturing."

One of those is follow-up to Paul. Coming at this CapEx spending a little bit different, you've talked really from the time Bernard joined, the CapEx budget has come down pretty dramatically, hit maybe a lower point than we expected in 2018, up a little bit in 2019. I think your 7% target means it goes up another $15 million or $17 million in 2020. Can you talk maybe about the additional context of what is -- not only where that -- those dollars are going, as you just answered, but what's driving the reincrease of those dollars?"

So it's driven by customer demand and customer interest. So we typically spend between $40 million to $50 million on maintenance CapEx. And on IT, we're looking at about $10 million to $15 million.

Overall, o",996,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we're entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our market-led strategy. 
Overall, our 2019 performance demonstrated the favorable market conditions and durability of our business. The commitment and focus of our One West team is delivering superior value to customers, through our high-quality products and solutions is what differentiates West as the global leader for containment and delivery of injectable medicines. 
We ended the year with 13% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. We expanded growth and operating profit margins largely through strong high-value product sales growth and great results from our global operations initiatives. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, and we generated strong year-over-year growth in operating cash flow. 
As we enter 2020, we're building on the positive momentum we generated in 2019. We are introducing full year 2020 financial guidance that assumes organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, which is at the upper end of our usual 6% to 8% range. We're also forecasting double-digit earnings growth, adjusted for tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
Bernard will go into greater detail on our 2020 guidance shortly. Slide 4 shows a detailed summary of the sales performance in 2019. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 14.7% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 60% of Proprietary Products sales grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout the year. Let's take a look at the performance of the market units for the quarter. 
Starting with Biologics. This market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. Our biologic customers from emerging biotech to large biopharma continue to come to West and our partner, Daikyo, as the preferred choice for high-value product offerings. This is reinforced by the very high participation rate we continue to experience with all new biologic and biosimilar approvals in 2019. 
The generics market unit finished the year on a solid note with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by sales of Westar components and products from our self-injection delivery platforms. As we have discussed in past calls, our self-injection delivery platforms are being adopted by not only biologic customers but also by small molecule generic customers looking to differentiate their drugs with our devices. 
Our Pharma market unit saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, strong high-value product sales growth was a driver combined with a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the impact from the previously reported voluntary recall of our Vial2Bag product.
And Contract Manufacturing ended the year with high single-digit organic sales growth for the fourth quarter, led once again by sales of health care related injection and diagnostic devices. 
On Slide 5, we have several exciting product launches that positions the company for continued growth, such as NovaPure 3 mL cartridge components that satisfy an unmet market need with the increase in sensitive biologic products being developed in dosages larger than 1 mL. 
We expanded our self-injection platform with SmartDose Gen. II injector with a patient experience in mind, enabling subcu delivery of high-viscosity drugs at dosages up to 10 mls. We also introduced an advanced elastomer formulation, which enhances performance and reliability featuring Westar Select quality and low particulate levels, while mitigating risk for our customers. And we launched AccelTRA Select, a line of products that provides generic customers with high quality, ready-to-use components with market-leading delivery times. 
Turning to Slide 6. We outlined our One West Global Operations strategy and management system. Operating with the excellence and efficiency that is inherent in our One West system has enabled our success and growth in 2018, and will do so for the foreseeable future. Our Global Operations team had another excellent year. The team is focused on continuous improvements related to service, quality and safety, while at the same time, driving efficiency gains. 
Over the past year, we've completed the restructuring program that was announced in early 2018 and reduced our global manufacturing footprint to 25 sites. We are improving productivity, making more informed choices in capital investments and have set the stage for the next phase of improvements through automation and advanced manufacturing systems. 
The efficiencies we have gained by employing this new global operating system has meant we have additional cash available to reinvest in the business. 
Highlighted on Slide 7 are investments we completed in 2019 that will drive growth going forward. The acquisition of our Korean distributor creates a direct presence for West in a market seeing strong growth, especially in biologic drug manufacturing. We also increased a minority stake to 49% in Daikyo Seiko of Japan. After more than 40 years of partnership, we know that our 2 companies share a unique, committed to science, quality and technical expertise that continues to prove valuable to the customers and patients we serve together. 
In addition, in 2019, we enhanced our global digital capabilities with the opening of our Digital Technology Center in India. The DTC serves as a center of excellence for our global digital and transformation team, supporting many areas of our business, including digital marketing, data analytics and supporting the future of digital manufacturing and automation capabilities. 
Driving sustainable business practices has been a long-standing imperative at West, as shown on Slide 8. In 2018, we received several accolades for our efforts across the 6 pillars of our corporate responsibility program. At West, we are committed to nurturing a culture of diversity and inclusion along with supporting the communities in which our team members live and work through both philanthropy and sustainable business practices. We made great strides in both areas in 2019. 
Now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance, 2020 guidance and our long-term outlook.

We'll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all 4 market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some year-end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First up, Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 to 20. We recorded net sales of $470.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. We also saw double-digit organic sales growth in our 3 Proprietary Product market units and high single-digit organic sales growth in contract manufacturing. 
For the full year, we recorded net sales of $1.84 billion, representing organic sales growth of 10% and 10 basis points of inorganic growth. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $153.2 million in gross profit, $20 million or 15% above Q4 of last year and our gross profit margin of 32.5% was 100 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the full year of 32.9% was a 110 basis point expansion from the previous year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $73.1 million recorded this quarter compared to $67.1 million in the same period last year for a 9% increase. 
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 15.5% was a 40 basis point reduction from the same period last year. As mentioned on our Q3 call, SG&A expenses for Q4 2018 were low due to the release of bonuses, primarily as a result of the Vial2Bag recall. Adjusting for this, we would have seen adjusted operating profit margin expand by approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.1% for the year was 160 basis points increase from 2018. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% for the quarter and approximately 15% for the year. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 13% for the quarter and 18% for the full year. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? 
On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.7 million or 12.2 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $3.3 million or 0.8 percentage points of growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $6.9 million or a reduction of 1.6 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.5% for Q4 2019, up from 31.5% in Q4 2018. Proprietary Products' fourth quarter gross profit margin of 38% was 100 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Proprietary Products' full year gross profit of 38.6% was 150 basis points above the margin achieved in 2018. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products' gross profit margin for the fourth quarter were a favorable mix of products sold, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Our high-value products represented 63% of Q4 Proprietary Products sales and generated double-digit organic sales growth. 
Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 16.4% was flat compared to the prior year quarter, however, we saw Contract Manufacturing margins show sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. 
Now, let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow of $367.2 million for the full year 2019, an increase of $78.6 million compared to the full year 2018 and a 27% increase. 
Our 2019 capital spending was $126.4 million, $21.7 million higher than a year ago but in line with guidance. Working capital of $717.1 million at December 31, 2019, was $106.4 million higher than at December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Our cash balance at December 31 of $439.1 million was $101.7 million more than our December 2018 balance, primarily due to improved operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. We expect our full year 2020 net sales guidance to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion, including an estimated headwind of $15 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 7% to 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, and capital expenditures will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our EPS guidance. Estimated FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.04 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, and it also includes -- it also excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
To summarize the key takeaways for the year, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing; gross profit margin improvement; growth in operating profit margin; growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in full year 2019 operating and free cash flow. 
Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of continued organic sales growth and operating margin and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

I've had the chance to travel to a number of our states, as you know, across the globe and I'm continuously impressed on the momentum, the focus, the energy and the capabilities have launched this One West Lean improvement system. 
So I'd say we are in early stages, but we're seeing some excellent traction as we go forward. And I expect that this is not just a onetime impact, but this is an annual benefit that we'll see going forward and just puts us in a much better position as we think about future investments for West. 
In regards to capacity expansions, what we're looking at and what we're investing towards is more expansion of capacity on current existing platforms. To give you an example, we're investing in additional growth capacity in Crystal Zenith, of our 1 mL Insert Needle pre-filled strings out of Scottsdale. 
We're also investing in further expansions in the self-injection devices of SelfDose and SmartDose based on current demand that we have committed by customers. 
So these type of investments will continue to go into our high-value products like Kinston, Waterford, and other locations around the globe. But these -- it's less than land and buildings, it's more about technology, automation and more modular cell manufacturing."

The second area we're seeing an uptick in -- and the demand are around self-injection, the platform. And in particularly, when you start thinking about SmartDose and SelfDose.

In fact, that's the other area of capacity expansion we have going on, both in U.S. and Europe to keep up with demand. So while the percentage is, let's say it's smaller, like, i.e., less than 10% of the high-value product portfolio, it's going to be much more meaningful over the next few years to come. 
So we're really confident of the runway we have ahead of us and the penetration of when you go from Envision all the way up to NovaPure, through what we see in the pipeline will only increase. And that's really all I can say at this point in time. We believe it's a double-digit growth portfolio, driven by the high-value products on the NovaPure, higher-end products of that portfolio, and it's going to be about 100-plus basis point volume expansion every year just to keep up with that demand."

Overall, o",996,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we're entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our market-led strategy. 
Overall, our 2019 performance demonstrated the favorable market conditions and durability of our business. The commitment and focus of our One West team is delivering superior value to customers, through our high-quality products and solutions is what differentiates West as the global leader for containment and delivery of injectable medicines. 
We ended the year with 13% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. We expanded growth and operating profit margins largely through strong high-value product sales growth and great results from our global operations initiatives. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, and we generated strong year-over-year growth in operating cash flow. 
As we enter 2020, we're building on the positive momentum we generated in 2019. We are introducing full year 2020 financial guidance that assumes organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, which is at the upper end of our usual 6% to 8% range. We're also forecasting double-digit earnings growth, adjusted for tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
Bernard will go into greater detail on our 2020 guidance shortly. Slide 4 shows a detailed summary of the sales performance in 2019. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 14.7% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 60% of Proprietary Products sales grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout the year. Let's take a look at the performance of the market units for the quarter. 
Starting with Biologics. This market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. Our biologic customers from emerging biotech to large biopharma continue to come to West and our partner, Daikyo, as the preferred choice for high-value product offerings. This is reinforced by the very high participation rate we continue to experience with all new biologic and biosimilar approvals in 2019. 
The generics market unit finished the year on a solid note with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by sales of Westar components and products from our self-injection delivery platforms. As we have discussed in past calls, our self-injection delivery platforms are being adopted by not only biologic customers but also by small molecule generic customers looking to differentiate their drugs with our devices. 
Our Pharma market unit saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, strong high-value product sales growth was a driver combined with a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the impact from the previously reported voluntary recall of our Vial2Bag product.
And Contract Manufacturing ended the year with high single-digit organic sales growth for the fourth quarter, led once again by sales of health care related injection and diagnostic devices. 
On Slide 5, we have several exciting product launches that positions the company for continued growth, such as NovaPure 3 mL cartridge components that satisfy an unmet market need with the increase in sensitive biologic products being developed in dosages larger than 1 mL. 
We expanded our self-injection platform with SmartDose Gen. II injector with a patient experience in mind, enabling subcu delivery of high-viscosity drugs at dosages up to 10 mls. We also introduced an advanced elastomer formulation, which enhances performance and reliability featuring Westar Select quality and low particulate levels, while mitigating risk for our customers. And we launched AccelTRA Select, a line of products that provides generic customers with high quality, ready-to-use components with market-leading delivery times. 
Turning to Slide 6. We outlined our One West Global Operations strategy and management system. Operating with the excellence and efficiency that is inherent in our One West system has enabled our success and growth in 2018, and will do so for the foreseeable future. Our Global Operations team had another excellent year. The team is focused on continuous improvements related to service, quality and safety, while at the same time, driving efficiency gains. 
Over the past year, we've completed the restructuring program that was announced in early 2018 and reduced our global manufacturing footprint to 25 sites. We are improving productivity, making more informed choices in capital investments and have set the stage for the next phase of improvements through automation and advanced manufacturing systems. 
The efficiencies we have gained by employing this new global operating system has meant we have additional cash available to reinvest in the business. 
Highlighted on Slide 7 are investments we completed in 2019 that will drive growth going forward. The acquisition of our Korean distributor creates a direct presence for West in a market seeing strong growth, especially in biologic drug manufacturing. We also increased a minority stake to 49% in Daikyo Seiko of Japan. After more than 40 years of partnership, we know that our 2 companies share a unique, committed to science, quality and technical expertise that continues to prove valuable to the customers and patients we serve together. 
In addition, in 2019, we enhanced our global digital capabilities with the opening of our Digital Technology Center in India. The DTC serves as a center of excellence for our global digital and transformation team, supporting many areas of our business, including digital marketing, data analytics and supporting the future of digital manufacturing and automation capabilities. 
Driving sustainable business practices has been a long-standing imperative at West, as shown on Slide 8. In 2018, we received several accolades for our efforts across the 6 pillars of our corporate responsibility program. At West, we are committed to nurturing a culture of diversity and inclusion along with supporting the communities in which our team members live and work through both philanthropy and sustainable business practices. We made great strides in both areas in 2019. 
Now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance, 2020 guidance and our long-term outlook.

We'll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all 4 market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some year-end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First up, Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 to 20. We recorded net sales of $470.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. We also saw double-digit organic sales growth in our 3 Proprietary Product market units and high single-digit organic sales growth in contract manufacturing. 
For the full year, we recorded net sales of $1.84 billion, representing organic sales growth of 10% and 10 basis points of inorganic growth. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $153.2 million in gross profit, $20 million or 15% above Q4 of last year and our gross profit margin of 32.5% was 100 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the full year of 32.9% was a 110 basis point expansion from the previous year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $73.1 million recorded this quarter compared to $67.1 million in the same period last year for a 9% increase. 
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 15.5% was a 40 basis point reduction from the same period last year. As mentioned on our Q3 call, SG&A expenses for Q4 2018 were low due to the release of bonuses, primarily as a result of the Vial2Bag recall. Adjusting for this, we would have seen adjusted operating profit margin expand by approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.1% for the year was 160 basis points increase from 2018. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% for the quarter and approximately 15% for the year. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 13% for the quarter and 18% for the full year. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? 
On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.7 million or 12.2 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $3.3 million or 0.8 percentage points of growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $6.9 million or a reduction of 1.6 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.5% for Q4 2019, up from 31.5% in Q4 2018. Proprietary Products' fourth quarter gross profit margin of 38% was 100 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Proprietary Products' full year gross profit of 38.6% was 150 basis points above the margin achieved in 2018. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products' gross profit margin for the fourth quarter were a favorable mix of products sold, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Our high-value products represented 63% of Q4 Proprietary Products sales and generated double-digit organic sales growth. 
Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 16.4% was flat compared to the prior year quarter, however, we saw Contract Manufacturing margins show sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. 
Now, let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow of $367.2 million for the full year 2019, an increase of $78.6 million compared to the full year 2018 and a 27% increase. 
Our 2019 capital spending was $126.4 million, $21.7 million higher than a year ago but in line with guidance. Working capital of $717.1 million at December 31, 2019, was $106.4 million higher than at December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. 
Our cash balance at December 31 of $439.1 million was $101.7 million more than our December 2018 balance, primarily due to improved operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. We expect our full year 2020 net sales guidance to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion, including an estimated headwind of $15 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 7% to 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, and capital expenditures will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our EPS guidance. Estimated FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.04 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, and it also includes -- it also excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
To summarize the key takeaways for the year, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing; gross profit margin improvement; growth in operating profit margin; growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in full year 2019 operating and free cash flow. 
Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of continued organic sales growth and operating margin and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

I've had the chance to travel to a number of our states, as you know, across the globe and I'm continuously impressed on the momentum, the focus, the energy and the capabilities have launched this One West Lean improvement system. 
So I'd say we are in early stages, but we're seeing some excellent traction as we go forward. And I expect that this is not just a onetime impact, but this is an annual benefit that we'll see going forward and just puts us in a much better position as we think about future investments for West. 
In regards to capacity expansions, what we're looking at and what we're investing towards is more expansion of capacity on current existing platforms. To give you an example, we're investing in additional growth capacity in Crystal Zenith, of our 1 mL Insert Needle pre-filled strings out of Scottsdale. 
We're also investing in further expansions in the self-injection devices of SelfDose and SmartDose based on current demand that we have committed by customers. 
So these type of investments will continue to go into our high-value products like Kinston, Waterford, and other locations around the globe. But these -- it's less than land and buildings, it's more about technology, automation and more modular cell manufacturing."

So it does go back to -- unfortunately, it goes back a few years ago.

So while the percentage is, let's say it's smaller, like, i.e., less than 10% of the high-value product portfolio, it's going to be much more meaningful over the next few years to come.

And that's really all I can say at this point in time. We believe it's a double-digit growth portfolio, driven by the high-value products on the NovaPure, higher-end products of that portfolio, and it's going to be about 100-plus basis point volume expansion every year just to keep up with that demand."

Thank you for joining us today. The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world, as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandemi",645,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world, as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandemic has made clear the importance of global health care and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. Our mission to improve patient lives cannot be any more meaningful than in times like today. We take great pride that for nearly 100 years, we have provided innovative, high-quality products and solutions for the containment and delivery of injectable medicines. Despite the COVID-19 challenges, the West team remains focused on creating and delivering value to all our stakeholders. West has 2 priorities that are guiding us through this pandemic. First and foremost, we're focused on the well-being and safety of our team members across the globe. Our crisis management team was engaged at the outset, implementing precautionary measures across our company to protect our teams. It seems nearly every day, I learned about another great way that our team is stepping up to deliver the critical components to meet the urgent needs of our customers and their patients, while looking out for the safety of one another. These moments are not only inspirational, but they serve as a testament to the collective strength of the One West team, and I'm grateful for their unwavering commitment to our mission. 
In addition, our culture of philanthropy and community involvement has our team members offering their time, meeting skills and knowledge in support of local response efforts. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our second priority is the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components and solutions to our customers. The strong tenets of our market-led strategy and globalization of the manufacturing network are contributing to the resiliency of West business in today's climate. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we experienced throughout our 2019 have continued in the first quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. Despite the current challenges, so far, we have been able to maintain operations at normal capacity. For the benefit of our customers, we have been able to leverage our world-class global manufacturing network by enabling the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep up the increase in demand. Because of the constantly changing environment and its effect on the economy, we conduct business impact analysis daily and make adjustments as they are required. These assessments are an integral part of our business continuity plans within each of our global sites and operations network. Throughout the past several months, we have monitored our supply chain, including our close partner, Daikyo, and at this time, do not foresee any negative impact from direct or indirect suppliers. As the pandemic has intensified, as expected, we have seen an increase in customer orders in recent weeks. We are monitoring order flow to ensure that we're addressing the true demand for our products. 
As shown on Slide 5, despite today's uncertain environment, I am pleased to report that we had a strong first quarter performance, and we entered the second quarter well positioned. We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the first quarter. 
As we enter the second quarter, the demand for our products continues to be solid from both existing customers as well as new opportunities from companies looking to develop COVID-19 solutions. Each day seems to bring new challenges, supply chain, transportation, government regulations. And I want to emphasize that across West, we're operating with a sense of urgency to address and manage these issues. Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance. Bernard?"

I hope everyone is healthy and safe during this time. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and generics market units and contract manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in slides 13 to 16. We recorded net sales of $491.5 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 11.8% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 63% of Proprietary Products grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q1. 
Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market units experienced high single-digit growth, led by sales -- excuse me, Westar and FluroTec components. Our Pharma market unit saw mid single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar, NovaPure and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the first quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection systems. 
Moving to Slide 7. We continue to see improvements in gross profit. We recorded $167 million in gross profit, $20 million or 13.6% above Q1 of last year, and gross profit margin of 34% with a 90 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $88 million reported this quarter compared to $71.3 million in the same period last year or a 23.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 36% for Q1. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 31%. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.1 million or 11.5 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $6.6 million or 1.5 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.7 million or a reduction of 2.2 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance, Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 34% for Q1 2020, up from 33.1% in Q1 2019. Proprietary Products first quarter gross profit margin of 40.2% was 130 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. The key drivers of the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products. Production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, contract manufacturing first quarter gross profit margin of 14.3% was 30 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our Proprietary Products gross profit expansion. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 20% increase. Our Q1 2020 capital spending was $32.1 million, $3.3 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $633.1 million at March 31, 2020, was $74 million lower than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance of March 31 of $335.3 million was $103.8 million less than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to $115 million of expenditures under our share repurchase program. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remains strong. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion. This includes an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to prior guidance, which forecasted a $15 million headwind. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62 compared to prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.55. Capital expenditure will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07, based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of $0.04. The revised guidance also includes a $0.07 EPS impact from our first quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter. Strong top line growth in both proprietary and contract manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

And I think last year, Q1 was also a very good quarter. So on a full year basis, it was up over 150 bps. I'm not asking will these trends continue. But just what -- if you peel back the onion a little bit, it seems like, obviously, mix is driving a lot of that. And is that just mix within mix as you not only increase your high-value products percentage, but maybe go up to scale within high-value products to more of like, say, the NovaPure and stuff like that.

There's -- what's happening with proprietary is really 2 levers are being pulled simultaneously. One is the high-value product mix effect, but more importantly, is that we're seeing increased growth and contribution of that growth with the products that have even higher margins. You start thinking about NovaPure, Daikyo Crystal Zenith, even the FluroTec. And when you look at those in totality, that's roughly, let's say, about half of the incremental growth when it comes to the high-value products and with a much higher margin. So the mix shift is occurring through high-value products, but even more pronounced with the higher-margin subsets of that portfolio. The second lever that we are holding and the team is doing a really good job is this globalization of our operations. And as you know, we've been on this journey for a couple of years now, and the team has done a phenomenal job to start implementing lean processes and initiatives across our plants, which is allowing us to be more efficient and more effective and higher throughput. So the combination of both of them are giving us that type of margin expansion in proprietary. And what excites me is to think about the future pipeline, it is around the NovaPure, the FluroTec, the CZ, the self-injection portfolio. And that's what's really exciting as we think about the long-term growth trajectory of this business."

We had some -- frankly, Bernard can get in a little more detail, but we did have some additional costs. But what we're seeing right now and with the approach we've taken with this -- with the market units, we're able to have much more granular discussions with our customers. And as we start thinking about Q2 and Q3, we are actively working in all 3 corridors. To give you an example, in the diagnostics, our contract manufacturing arm of the business is currently scaling up on consumable products that are used in a couple of the devices that have been introduced in the market recently in the pipe. We won't speak about any specific customer, but these have been introduced recently into the hospitals, in the clinic setting. When it comes to therapeutics, there are a few that are in a market that we're already supporting and has been commercialized, but they're -- they're currently, as you know, going through clinical tests to see the ability to combat COVID-19, and we're in those areas. And then lastly, the vaccines. And those are a little more long term, as we look out 2021. And our FluroTec technology is a perfect candidate for the vaccine market. So it's kind of a staged approach, and we'll see some of the benefit in 2020 and -- but most of it will be in 2021. You want to -- Bernard, talk about the oil impact."

No, absolutely. We took a very proactive approach months ago. We started to see what we learned from our colleagues in Asia, particularly in our Chingpu facility in China and also in South and Singapore. What we've done is we've taken a -- there's multiple steps that we've taken. One is the split shifts to minimize as they did the shift handovers minimized interaction and so that social distance is very important. Also temperature monitoring. We also put a program in place that only is central employees were allowed to go into the facility. So you can imagine at our plants, all the 25 plants around the world, we have very important roles, but these are individuals that actually can work from remotely. And so we put that in place immediately. One other element we put in place is we really focused on ensuring that when our colleagues are not feeling well or there's some question about their health, that they don't feel pressure to come into the office. So we relax some of our attendance policies. We improved. We expanded our compensation -- if somebody had to stay home for a period of time that we covered, taking care of themselves and/or their family members. So those are many different levers that we put in place and to ensure that people that are in the plants should be in the plants and also mitigating any risk that we have for maybe coming from the outside. This crisis management team we put in place is monitoring it daily. We can tell you if there's absence is an issues in any particular site. And I am very pleased and actually humbled on how well the absence is very low in multiple sites. And I know in Europe, it went up slightly, but it came back down to normal rates in the last several weeks, which is a real testament. Our employees really understand the purpose of why we're doing this and to support the community. So there's a lot of levers that we pull, Paul. It's not just 1 solution, there's many.

But on the proprietary side, the underlying core business, if you look at Q1 and Q4 of last year and the momentum that has been built up on the core, it's been relatively consistent.

Thank you for joining us today. The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandem",644,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 
The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandemic has made clear the importance of global health care and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. Our mission to improve patient lives cannot be any more meaningful than in times like today. We take great pride that for nearly 100 years, we have provided innovative, high-quality products and solutions for the containment and delivery of injectable medicines. Despite the COVID-19 challenges, the West team remains focused on creating and delivering value to all our stakeholders. 
West has 2 priorities that are guiding us through this pandemic. First and foremost, we're focused on the well-being and safety of our team members across the globe. Our crisis management team was engaged at the outset, implementing precautionary measures across our company to protect our teams. It seems nearly every day, I learned about another great way that our team is stepping up to deliver the critical components to meet the urgent needs of our customers and their patients, while looking out for the safety of one another. These moments are not only inspirational, but they serve as a testament to the collective strength of the One West team, and I'm grateful for their unwavering commitment to our mission. 
In addition, our culture of philanthropy and community involvement has our team members offering their time, unique skills and knowledge in support of local response efforts. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our second priority is the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components and solutions to our customers. The strong tenets of our market-led strategy and globalization of the manufacturing network are contributing to the resiliency of West's business in today's climate. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we experienced throughout 2019 have continued in the first quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. Despite the current challenges, so far, we have been able to maintain operations at normal capacity. For the benefit of our customers, we have been able to leverage our world-class global manufacturing network by enabling the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep up the increase in demand. Because of the constantly changing environment and its effect on the economy, we conduct business impact analyses daily and make adjustments as they are required. These assessments are an integral part of our business continuity plans within each of our global sites and operations network. Throughout the past several months, we have monitored our supply chain, including our close partner, Daikyo, and at this time, do not foresee any negative impact from direct or indirect suppliers. As the pandemic has intensified, as expected, we have seen an increase in customer orders in recent weeks. We are monitoring order flow to ensure that we're addressing the true demand for our products. 
As shown on Slide 5, despite today's uncertain environment, I am pleased to report that we had a strong first quarter performance, and we entered the second quarter well positioned. We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the first quarter. 
As we enter the second quarter, the demand for our products continues to be solid from both existing customers as well as new opportunities from companies looking to develop COVID-19 solutions. Each day seems to bring new challenges; supply chain, transportation, government regulations. And I want to emphasize that across West, we're operating with a sense of urgency to address and manage these issues. 
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance. Bernard?"

I hope everyone is healthy and safe during this time. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue perform",960,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning. I hope everyone is healthy and safe during this time. 
So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our Biologics and Generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in slides 13 to 16. We recorded net sales of $491.5 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 11.8% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 63% of Proprietary Products sales, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q1. 
Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The Generics market units experienced high single-digit growth led by sales of Westar and FluroTec components. Our Pharma market unit saw mid-single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar, NovaPure and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the first quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection systems. 
Moving to Slide 7. We continue to see improvements in gross profit. We recorded $167 million in gross profit, $20 million or 13.6% above Q1 of last year, and gross profit margin of 34% with a 90 basis point expansion from the same period last year. 
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $88 million reported this quarter compared to $71.3 million in the same period last year or a 23.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. 
And finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 36% for Q1. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 31%. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.1 million or 11.5 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $6.6 million or 1.5 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.7 million or a reduction of 2.2 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance, Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 34% for Q1 2020, up from 33.1% in Q1 2019. Proprietary Products' first quarter gross profit margin of 40.2% was 130 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. The key drivers of the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products. 
Production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, Contract Manufacturing's first quarter gross profit margin of 14.3% was 30 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our Proprietary Products' gross profit expansion. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 20% increase. Our Q1 2020 capital spending was $32.1 million, $3.3 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $633.1 million at March 31, 2020, was $74 million lower than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance of March 31 of $335.3 million was $103.8 million less than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to $115 million of expenditures under our share repurchase program. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remains strong. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion. This includes an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to prior guidance, which forecasted a $15 million headwind. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62 compared to prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.55. Capital expenditure will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of $0.04. The revised guidance also includes a $0.07 EPS impact from our first quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter. Strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

There's -- what's happening with Proprietary is really 2 levers are being pulled simultaneously. One is the high-value product mix effect, but more importantly is that we're seeing increased growth and contribution of that growth with the products that have even higher margins. You start thinking about NovaPure, Daikyo, Crystal Zenith, even the FluroTec. And when you look at those in totality, that's roughly, let's say, about half of the incremental growth when it comes to the high-value products and with a much higher margin. So the mix shift is occurring through high-value products, but even more pronounced with the higher-margin subsets of that portfolio. 
The second lever that we are holding and the team is doing a really good job is this globalization of our operations. And as you know, we've been on this journey for a couple of years now, and the team has done a phenomenal job to start implementing lean processes and initiatives across our plants, which is allowing us to be more efficient and more effective and higher throughput. So the combination of both of them are giving us that type of margin expansion in Proprietary. And what excites me is if we think about the future pipeline, it is around the NovaPure, the FluroTec, the CZ, the self-injection portfolio. And that's what's really exciting as we think about the long-term growth trajectory of this business."

And I mentioned 3 areas around diagnostics, therapeutics and also vaccines. In Q1, we did not see any incremental revenue as a company due to COVID-19. We had some -- frankly, Bernard can get in a little more detail, but we did have some additional costs. But what we're seeing right now and with the approach we've taken with this -- with the market units, we're able to have much more granular discussions with our customers. And as we start thinking about Q2 and Q3, we are actively working in all 3 corridors. To give you an example, in the diagnostics, our Contract Manufacturing arm of the business is currently scaling up on consumable products that are used in a couple of the devices that have been introduced in the market recently in the pipe. We won't speak about any specific customer, but these have been introduced recently into the hospitals, in the clinic setting. When it comes to therapeutics, there are a few that are in a market that we're already supporting and has been commercialized, but they're -- they're currently, as you know, going through clinical tests to see the ability to combat COVID-19, and we're in those areas. And then lastly, the vaccines. And those are a little more long term as we look out 2021. And our FluroTec technology is a perfect candidate for the vaccine market. So it's kind of a staged approach, and we'll see some of the benefit in 2020 and -- but most of it will be in 2021. You want to, Bernard, talk about the oil impact."

And then we have also some other costs that we're absorbing in supporting our employees as we're managing through the pandemic. We saw some of it in Q1, and there were some primarily showed up in our CM gross margin, which was probably impacted most by that. But I think, again, we will see some benefit, but there are other headwinds and offsets there."

Thank you, Paul, and good morning. No, you're absolutely correct. We took a very proactive approach months ago when we started to see what we learned from our colleagues in Asia, particularly in our Qingpu facility in China and also in South -- Singapore. What we've done is we've taken a -- there's multiple steps that we've taken. One is the split shifts to minimize -- as they did the shift handovers, minimize interaction so that social distancing is very important. Also temperature monitoring. We also put a program in place that only essential employees were allowed to go into the facility. So you can imagine at our plants, all the 25 plants around the world, we have very important roles, but these are individuals that actually can work from remotely, and so we put that in place immediately. One other element we put in place is we really focused on ensuring that when our colleagues are not feeling well or there's some question about their health, that they don't feel pressure to come into the office. So we relaxed some of our attendance policies. We improved. We expanded our compensation if somebody had to stay home for a period of time with the COVID, taking care of themselves and/or their family members. 
So those are many different levers that we put in place and to ensure that people are in the plants, should be in the plants and also mitigating any risk that we have for maybe coming from the outside. This crisis management team we put in place is monitoring it daily. We can tell you if there's absenteeism issues in any particular site. And I am very pleased and actually humbled on how well the absenteeism is very low in multiple sites. And I know in Europe, it went up slightly, but it came back down to normal rates in the last several weeks, which is a real testament and our employees really understand the purpose of why we're doing this and to support the community. So there's a lot of levers that we pull, Paul. It's not just one solution, there's many.

In recent weeks, the conversations have intensified where customers are coming to us, and that's where our commercial organization has done a great job of categorizing and working with customers to alleviate their concerns, not to do increasing safety stock because our lead times have not increased because of the global network that we put in place. So -- and we were able to categorize any incremental revenues, is it due to vaccines, therapeutics, supporting therapies, hospital enablement, and also, frankly, increasing safety stocks, and that's what we're keeping an eye on at this point in time.

In regards to COVID-19, specifically around vaccine, as customer, we won't give out customer names. But I can tell you that we're on many of the products that we currently develop, and we'll be going into clinical trials hopefully soon that we can participate on that. I think reason why we have a good, very strong participation rate in vaccines is one of the characteristics is required is the coating on the elastomer. And the FluroTec technology is a market-leading technology. So we're feeling really good in that regard. Secondly, around that, when we start thinking about the criticality or the urgency to get these materials manufactured, it gives us the ability to flex our global operations. And as we're building 40-plus billion components a year, the demand on vaccines, while it's important, it's a good size, it's not going to be too much of a challenge considering we have multiple sites that can produce these products using FluroTec's technology.

If we exclude those costs and if business as normal, our margin in CM would have been north of 15%. The impact on the Proprietary business was a lot less. But -- so that gives us encouragement to know that we're on the right track, and our teams are delivering within Contract Manufacturing to get to the mid to high teens. We will be making progress throughout 2020 and into early 2021. But we are on the right track. That there were -- it was onetime cost."

I know you kind of answered this a little bit earlier for somebody else's question, but just wanted to kind of talk more about like on the organic side. So you guys started the year very strong. And I think in your prepared remarks, Eric, you said that you guys didn't really see any COVID-related revenues yet in Q1. So it's probably hard to say from your vantage point, but is really, I guess, if you kind of look at the rest of the year, that confidence that you have that you guys will be towards the higher end of your organic or your long-term organic guidance of that 6% to 8%, is that driven by just like the base demand for the business? Or is it more so related to the COVID-related, like, incremental demand? Or kind of if you have to pick between that mix, which side does it more fall on that you have that confidence that you'll get to that 8% as opposed to the 7% to 8% that you guys talked about last quarter?"

And so when we have better visibility and clarity around that, then we'll bring that into the discussion. 
On the CM side, it's a little bit higher in Q1 that we -- than we traditionally would see. And I think that will come down a little bit going back to what Bernard said earlier, the full year probably looking at high single digits, maybe touching the 10% mark. But on the Proprietary side, the underlying core business, if you look at Q1 and Q4 of last year and the momentum that has been built up on the core, it's been relatively consistent. So it gives me confidence that the guidance that Bernard walked us through is really taking a lot of the opportunity to pull the '19 out."

Thank you for joining us today. The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandem",644,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 
The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandemic has made clear the importance of global health care and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. Our mission to improve patient lives cannot be any more meaningful than in times like today. We take great pride that for nearly 100 years, we have provided innovative, high-quality products and solutions for the containment and delivery of injectable medicines. Despite the COVID-19 challenges, the West team remains focused on creating and delivering value to all our stakeholders. 
West has 2 priorities that are guiding us through this pandemic. First and foremost, we're focused on the well-being and safety of our team members across the globe. Our crisis management team was engaged at the outset, implementing precautionary measures across our company to protect our teams. It seems nearly every day, I learned about another great way that our team is stepping up to deliver the critical components to meet the urgent needs of our customers and their patients, while looking out for the safety of one another. These moments are not only inspirational, but they serve as a testament to the collective strength of the One West team, and I'm grateful for their unwavering commitment to our mission. 
In addition, our culture of philanthropy and community involvement has our team members offering their time, unique skills and knowledge in support of local response efforts. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our second priority is the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components and solutions to our customers. The strong tenets of our market-led strategy and globalization of the manufacturing network are contributing to the resiliency of West's business in today's climate. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we experienced throughout 2019 have continued in the first quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. Despite the current challenges, so far, we have been able to maintain operations at normal capacity. For the benefit of our customers, we have been able to leverage our world-class global manufacturing network by enabling the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep up the increase in demand. Because of the constantly changing environment and its effect on the economy, we conduct business impact analyses daily and make adjustments as they are required. These assessments are an integral part of our business continuity plans within each of our global sites and operations network. Throughout the past several months, we have monitored our supply chain, including our close partner, Daikyo, and at this time, do not foresee any negative impact from direct or indirect suppliers. As the pandemic has intensified, as expected, we have seen an increase in customer orders in recent weeks. We are monitoring order flow to ensure that we're addressing the true demand for our products. 
As shown on Slide 5, despite today's uncertain environment, I am pleased to report that we had a strong first quarter performance, and we entered the second quarter well positioned. We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the first quarter. 
As we enter the second quarter, the demand for our products continues to be solid from both existing customers as well as new opportunities from companies looking to develop COVID-19 solutions. Each day seems to bring new challenges; supply chain, transportation, government regulations. And I want to emphasize that across West, we're operating with a sense of urgency to address and manage these issues. 
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance. Bernard?"

We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue perform",960,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning. I hope everyone is healthy and safe during this time. 
So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our Biologics and Generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in slides 13 to 16. We recorded net sales of $491.5 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 11.8% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 63% of Proprietary Products sales, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q1. 
Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The Generics market units experienced high single-digit growth led by sales of Westar and FluroTec components. Our Pharma market unit saw mid-single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar, NovaPure and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the first quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection systems. 
Moving to Slide 7. We continue to see improvements in gross profit. We recorded $167 million in gross profit, $20 million or 13.6% above Q1 of last year, and gross profit margin of 34% with a 90 basis point expansion from the same period last year. 
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $88 million reported this quarter compared to $71.3 million in the same period last year or a 23.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. 
And finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 36% for Q1. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 31%. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.1 million or 11.5 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $6.6 million or 1.5 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.7 million or a reduction of 2.2 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance, Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 34% for Q1 2020, up from 33.1% in Q1 2019. Proprietary Products' first quarter gross profit margin of 40.2% was 130 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. The key drivers of the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products. 
Production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, Contract Manufacturing's first quarter gross profit margin of 14.3% was 30 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our Proprietary Products' gross profit expansion. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 20% increase. Our Q1 2020 capital spending was $32.1 million, $3.3 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $633.1 million at March 31, 2020, was $74 million lower than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance of March 31 of $335.3 million was $103.8 million less than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to $115 million of expenditures under our share repurchase program. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remains strong. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion. This includes an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to prior guidance, which forecasted a $15 million headwind. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62 compared to prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.55. Capital expenditure will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of $0.04. The revised guidance also includes a $0.07 EPS impact from our first quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter. Strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

But just what -- if you peel back the onion a little bit, it seems like, obviously, mix is driving a lot of that.

There's -- what's happening with Proprietary is really 2 levers are being pulled simultaneously. One is the high-value product mix effect, but more importantly is that we're seeing increased growth and contribution of that growth with the products that have even higher margins. You start thinking about NovaPure, Daikyo, Crystal Zenith, even the FluroTec. And when you look at those in totality, that's roughly, let's say, about half of the incremental growth when it comes to the high-value products and with a much higher margin. So the mix shift is occurring through high-value products, but even more pronounced with the higher-margin subsets of that portfolio. 
The second lever that we are holding and the team is doing a really good job is this globalization of our operations. And as you know, we've been on this journey for a couple of years now, and the team has done a phenomenal job to start implementing lean processes and initiatives across our plants, which is allowing us to be more efficient and more effective and higher throughput. So the combination of both of them are giving us that type of margin expansion in Proprietary. And what excites me is if we think about the future pipeline, it is around the NovaPure, the FluroTec, the CZ, the self-injection portfolio. And that's what's really exciting as we think about the long-term growth trajectory of this business."

We had some -- frankly, Bernard can get in a little more detail, but we did have some additional costs. But what we're seeing right now and with the approach we've taken with this -- with the market units, we're able to have much more granular discussions with our customers. And as we start thinking about Q2 and Q3, we are actively working in all 3 corridors. To give you an example, in the diagnostics, our Contract Manufacturing arm of the business is currently scaling up on consumable products that are used in a couple of the devices that have been introduced in the market recently in the pipe. We won't speak about any specific customer, but these have been introduced recently into the hospitals, in the clinic setting. When it comes to therapeutics, there are a few that are in a market that we're already supporting and has been commercialized, but they're -- they're currently, as you know, going through clinical tests to see the ability to combat COVID-19, and we're in those areas. And then lastly, the vaccines. And those are a little more long term as we look out 2021. And our FluroTec technology is a perfect candidate for the vaccine market. So it's kind of a staged approach, and we'll see some of the benefit in 2020 and -- but most of it will be in 2021. Do you want to, Bernard, talk about the oil impact?"

We saw some of it in Q1, and there were some primarily showed up in our CM gross margin, which was probably impacted most by that.

What we've done is we've taken a -- there's multiple steps that we've taken. One is the split shifts to minimize -- as they did the shift handovers, minimize interaction so that social distancing is very important. Also temperature monitoring. We also put a program in place that only essential employees were allowed to go into the facility. So you can imagine at our plants, all the 25 plants around the world, we have very important roles, but these are individuals that actually can work from remotely, and so we put that in place immediately. One other element we put in place is we're really focused on ensuring that when our colleagues are not feeling well or there's some question about their health, that they don't feel pressure to come into the office. So we relaxed some of our attendance policies. We improved. We expanded our compensation if somebody had to stay home for a period of time with the COVID, taking care of themselves and/or their family members. 
So those are many different levers that we put in place and to ensure that people are in the plants, should be in the plants and also mitigating any risk that we have for maybe coming from the outside. This crisis management team we put in place is monitoring it daily. We can tell you if there's absenteeism issues in any particular site. And I am very pleased and actually humbled on how well the absenteeism is very low in multiple sites. And I know in Europe, it went up slightly, but it came back down to normal rates in the last several weeks, which is a real testament and our employees really understand the purpose of why we're doing this and to support the community. So there's a lot of levers that we pull, Paul. It's not just one solution, there's many. And we're not going to let off on the intensity of this -- of our approach because we cannot afford to have an issue at a point."

In recent weeks, the conversations have intensified where customers are coming to us, and that's where our commercial organization has done a great job of categorizing and working with customers to alleviate their concerns, not to do increasing safety stock because our lead times have not increased because of the global network that we put in place. So -- and we were able to categorize any incremental revenues, is it due to vaccines, therapeutics, supporting therapies, hospital enablement, and also, frankly, increasing safety stocks, and that's what we're keeping an eye on at this point in time. That has been as pronounced. We've learned our lesson back in 2015 and 2016. And so we're very conscious of that, and we have the right programs in place to monitor and manage through this."

So our participation rate is -- it continued to improve. 
In regards to the COVID-19, specifically around vaccine, as customer, we won't give out customer names. But I can tell you that we're on many of the products that are being currently develop, and we'll be going into clinical trials hopefully soon that we can participate on that. I think reason why we have a good, very strong participation rate in vaccines is one of the characteristics is required is the coating on the elastomer. And the FluroTec technology is a market-leading technology. So we're feeling really good in that regard. Secondly, around that, when we start thinking about the criticality or the urgency to get these materials manufactured, it gives us the ability to flex our global operations. And as we're building 40-plus billion components a year, the demand on vaccines, while it's important, it's a good size, it's not going to be too much of a challenge considering we have multiple sites that can produce these products using FluroTec's technology. So that's how I would look at it from the vaccine perspective for the participation rate."

Thank you for joining us today. The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandem",644,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 
The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandemic has made clear the importance of global health care and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. Our mission to improve patient lives cannot be any more meaningful than in times like today. We take great pride that for nearly 100 years, we have provided innovative, high-quality products and solutions for the containment and delivery of injectable medicines. Despite the COVID-19 challenges, the West team remains focused on creating and delivering value to all our stakeholders. 
West has 2 priorities that are guiding us through this pandemic. First and foremost, we're focused on the well-being and safety of our team members across the globe. Our crisis management team was engaged at the outset, implementing precautionary measures across our company to protect our teams. It seems nearly every day, I learned about another great way that our team is stepping up to deliver the critical components to meet the urgent needs of our customers and their patients, while looking out for the safety of one another. These moments are not only inspirational, but they serve as a testament to the collective strength of the One West team, and I'm grateful for their unwavering commitment to our mission. In addition, our culture of philanthropy and community involvement has our team members offering their time, unique skills and knowledge in support of local response efforts. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our second priority is the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components and solutions to our customers. The strong tenets of our market-led strategy and globalization of the manufacturing network are contributing to the resiliency of West's business in today's climate. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we experienced throughout 2019 have continued in the first quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. Despite the current challenges, so far, we have been able to maintain operations at normal capacity. For the benefit of our customers, we have been able to leverage our world-class global manufacturing network by enabling the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep up the increase in demand. Because of the constantly changing environment and its effect on the economy, we conduct business impact analyses daily and make adjustments as they are required. These assessments are an integral part of our business continuity plans within each of our global sites and operations network. Throughout the past several months, we have monitored our supply chain, including our close partner, Daikyo, and at this time, do not foresee any negative impact from direct or indirect suppliers. As the pandemic has intensified, as expected, we have seen an increase in customer orders in recent weeks. We are monitoring order flow to ensure that we're addressing the true demand for our products. 
As shown on Slide 5, despite today's uncertain environment, I am pleased to report that we had a strong first quarter performance, and we entered the second quarter well positioned. We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the first quarter. 
As we enter the second quarter, the demand for our products continues to be solid from both existing customers as well as new opportunities from companies looking to develop COVID-19 solutions. Each day seems to bring new challenges; supply chain, transportation, government regulations. And I want to emphasize that across West, we're operating with a sense of urgency to address and manage these issues. 
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance. Bernard?"

We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue perform",960,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning. I hope everyone is healthy and safe during this time. 
So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our Biologics and Generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in slides 13 to 16. We recorded net sales of $491.5 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 11.8% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 63% of Proprietary Products sales, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q1. 
Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The Generics market units experienced high single-digit growth led by sales of Westar and FluroTec components. Our Pharma market unit saw mid-single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar, NovaPure and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the first quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection systems. 
Moving to Slide 7. We continue to see improvements in gross profit. We recorded $167 million in gross profit, $20 million or 13.6% above Q1 of last year, and gross profit margin of 34% with a 90 basis point expansion from the same period last year. 
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $88 million reported this quarter compared to $71.3 million in the same period last year or a 23.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. 
And finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 36% for Q1. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 31%. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.1 million or 11.5 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $6.6 million or 1.5 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.7 million or a reduction of 2.2 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance, Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 34% for Q1 2020, up from 33.1% in Q1 2019. Proprietary Products' first quarter gross profit margin of 40.2% was 130 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. The key drivers of the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products. 
Production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, Contract Manufacturing's first quarter gross profit margin of 14.3% was 30 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our Proprietary Products' gross profit expansion. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 20% increase. Our Q1 2020 capital spending was $32.1 million, $3.3 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $633.1 million at March 31, 2020, was $74 million lower than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance of March 31 of $335.3 million was $103.8 million less than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to $115 million of expenditures under our share repurchase program. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remains strong. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion. This includes an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to prior guidance, which forecasted a $15 million headwind. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62 compared to prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.55. Capital expenditure will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of $0.04. The revised guidance also includes a $0.07 EPS impact from our first quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter. Strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

Obviously, very good growth and coming from the usual suspects here. I'm particularly impressed with the margin side and the growth side, 130 bps up year-over-year. And I think last year, Q1 was also a very good quarter. So on a full year basis, it was up over 150 bps. I'm not asking will these trends continue. But just what -- if you peel back the onion a little bit, it seems like, obviously, mix is driving a lot of that. And is that just mix within mix as you not only increase your high-value products percentage, but maybe go up to scale within high-value products to more of like, say, the NovaPure and stuff like that? Can you give us a little more color on that?"

There's -- what's happening with Proprietary is really 2 levers are being pulled simultaneously. One is the high-value product mix effect, but more importantly is that we're seeing increased growth and contribution of that growth with the products that have even higher margins. You start thinking about NovaPure, Daikyo, Crystal Zenith, even the FluroTec. And when you look at those in totality, that's roughly, let's say, about half of the incremental growth when it comes to the high-value products and with a much higher margin. So the mix shift is occurring through high-value products, but even more pronounced with the higher-margin subsets of that portfolio. 
The second lever that we are holding and the team is doing a really good job is this globalization of our operations. And as you know, we've been on this journey for a couple of years now, and the team has done a phenomenal job to start implementing lean processes and initiatives across our plants, which is allowing us to be more efficient and more effective and higher throughput. So the combination of both of them are giving us that type of margin expansion in Proprietary. And what excites me is if we think about the future pipeline, it is around the NovaPure, the FluroTec, the CZ, the self-injection portfolio. And that's what's really exciting as we think about the long-term growth trajectory of this business."

And I mentioned 3 areas around diagnostics, therapeutics and also vaccines. In Q1, we did not see any incremental revenue as a company due to COVID-19. We had some -- frankly, Bernard can get in a little more detail, but we did have some additional costs. But what we're seeing right now and with the approach we've taken with this -- with the market units, we're able to have much more granular discussions with our customers. And as we start thinking about Q2 and Q3, we are actively working in all 3 corridors. To give you an example, in the diagnostics, our Contract Manufacturing arm of the business is currently scaling up on consumable products that are used in a couple of the devices that have been introduced in the market recently in the pipe. We won't speak about any specific customer, but these have been introduced recently into the hospitals, in the clinic setting. When it comes to therapeutics, there are a few that are in a market that we're already supporting and has been commercialized, but they're -- they're currently, as you know, going through clinical tests to see the ability to combat COVID-19, and we're in those areas. And then lastly, the vaccines. And those are a little more long term as we look out 2021. And our FluroTec technology is a perfect candidate for the vaccine market. So it's kind of a staged approach, and we'll see some of the benefit in 2020 and -- but most of it will be in 2021. Do you want to, Bernard, talk about the oil impact?"

And then we have also some other costs that we're absorbing in supporting our employees as we're managing through the pandemic. We saw some of it in Q1, and there were some primarily showed up in our CM gross margin, which was probably impacted most by that. But I think, again, we will see some benefit, but there are other headwinds and offsets there."

Thank you, Paul, and good morning. No, you're absolutely correct. We took a very proactive approach months ago when we started to see -- what we learned from our colleagues in Asia, particularly in our Qingpu facility in China and also in South -- Singapore. What we've done is we've taken a -- there's multiple steps that we've taken. One is the split shifts to minimize -- as they did the shift handovers, minimize interaction so that social distancing is very important. Also temperature monitoring. We also put a program in place that only essential employees were allowed to go into the facility. So you can imagine at our plants, all the 25 plants around the world, we have very important roles, but these are individuals that actually can work from remotely, and so we put that in place immediately. One other element we put in place is we're really focused on ensuring that when our colleagues are not feeling well or there's some question about their health, that they don't feel pressure to come into the office. So we relaxed some of our attendance policies. We improved. We expanded our compensation if somebody had to stay home for a period of time with the COVID, taking care of themselves and/or their family members. 
So those are many different levers that we put in place and to ensure that people are in the plants, should be in the plants and also mitigating any risk that we have for maybe coming from the outside. This crisis management team we put in place is monitoring it daily. We can tell you if there's absenteeism issues in any particular site. And I am very pleased and actually humbled on how well the absenteeism is very low in multiple sites. And I know in Europe, it went up slightly, but it came back down to normal rates in the last several weeks, which is a real testament and our employees really understand the purpose of why we're doing this and to support the community. So there's a lot of levers that we pull, Paul. It's not just one solution, there's many.

I want to -- let me start, and then Bernard will talk a little more about the puts and takes. I just want to caution. I mean absolutely, when you think -- if you look at the resiliency of the business and how the team is executing well under these circumstances, and I do truly believe the tenets that we put in place from the market led, the globalization of the operations, digitization, which is allowing us to get better analytics and real-time information, it's really allowing us to drive growth. And we saw that -- similar growth in Q1. We saw that in Q4 last year. And so we believe it's a continuation. But frankly speaking, the operating environment that everybody is in today is difficult. And so we want to be -- from my point of view, we want to be prudent and stick with what we've guided. I know there's some additional elements to that, that Bernard will go through, and we'll get more data points over the next several weeks and months so that we -- next time we have this call, we can get better information on how the trajectory will go for the balance of the year. 
Bernie, you want to give some puts and takes."

So if you take that into account, we're absorbing that while maintaining guidance between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion. So essentially, it is raising guidance on revenue. And as Eric said, it's still early in the year. We're in unprecedented times with a lot of unknowns out there. So again, we felt it was the right thing to do to maintain where we are and see how the remainder of the year progresses. But what we're seeing is that our order book is solid. Our manufacturing and operation units are functioning as they should and in line with our expectations, and we weathered some storms in the first quarter. But again, I don't think it's appropriate to raise it much higher at this point. You've got to think -- you've got to remember that piece on the FX."

In regards to the COVID-19, specifically around vaccine, as customer, we won't give out customer names. But I can tell you that we're on many of the products that are being currently develop, and we'll be going into clinical trials hopefully soon that we can participate on that. I think reason why we have a good, very strong participation rate in vaccines is one of the characteristics is required is the coating on the elastomer. And the FluroTec technology is a market-leading technology. So we're feeling really good in that regard. Secondly, around that, when we start thinking about the criticality or the urgency to get these materials manufactured, it gives us the ability to flex our global operations. And as we're building 40-plus billion components a year, the demand on vaccines, while it's important, it's a good size, it's not going to be too much of a challenge considering we have multiple sites that can produce these products using FluroTec's technology. So that's how I would look at it from the vaccine perspective for the participation rate."

This pandem",644,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 
The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandemic has made clear the importance of global health care and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. Our mission to improve patient lives cannot be any more meaningful than in times like today. We take great pride that for nearly 100 years, we have provided innovative, high-quality products and solutions for the containment and delivery of injectable medicines. Despite the COVID-19 challenges, the West team remains focused on creating and delivering value to all our stakeholders. 
West has 2 priorities that are guiding us through this pandemic. First and foremost, we're focused on the well-being and safety of our team members across the globe. Our crisis management team was engaged at the outset, implementing precautionary measures across our company to protect our teams. It seems nearly every day, I learned about another great way that our team is stepping up to deliver the critical components to meet the urgent needs of our customers and their patients, while looking out for the safety of one another. These moments are not only inspirational, but they serve as a testament to the collective strength of the One West team, and I'm grateful for their unwavering commitment to our mission. In addition, our culture of philanthropy and community involvement has our team members offering their time, unique skills and knowledge in support of local response efforts. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our second priority is the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components and solutions to our customers. The strong tenets of our market-led strategy and globalization of the manufacturing network are contributing to the resiliency of West's business in today's climate. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we experienced throughout 2019 have continued in the first quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. Despite the current challenges, so far, we have been able to maintain operations at normal capacity. For the benefit of our customers, we have been able to leverage our world-class global manufacturing network by enabling the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep up the increase in demand. Because of the constantly changing environment and its effect on the economy, we conduct business impact analyses daily and make adjustments as they are required. These assessments are an integral part of our business continuity plans within each of our global sites and operations network. Throughout the past several months, we have monitored our supply chain, including our close partner, Daikyo, and at this time, do not foresee any negative impact from direct or indirect suppliers. As the pandemic has intensified, as expected, we have seen an increase in customer orders in recent weeks. We are monitoring order flow to ensure that we're addressing the true demand for our products. 
As shown on Slide 5, despite today's uncertain environment, I am pleased to report that we had a strong first quarter performance, and we entered the second quarter well positioned. We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the first quarter. 
As we enter the second quarter, the demand for our products continues to be solid from both existing customers as well as new opportunities from companies looking to develop COVID-19 solutions. Each day seems to bring new challenges; supply chain, transportation, government regulations. And I want to emphasize that across West, we're operating with a sense of urgency to address and manage these issues. 
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance. Bernard?"

I hope everyone is healthy and safe during this time. 
So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our Biologics and Generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. 
First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in slides 13 to 16. We recorded net sales of $491.5 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 11.8% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 63% of Proprietary Products sales, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q1. 
Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The Generics market units experienced high single-digit growth led by sales of Westar and FluroTec components. Our Pharma market unit saw mid-single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar, NovaPure and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the first quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection systems. 
Moving to Slide 7. We continue to see improvements in gross profit. We recorded $167 million in gross profit, $20 million or 13.6% above Q1 of last year, and gross profit margin of 34% with a 90 basis point expansion from the same period last year. 
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $88 million reported this quarter compared to $71.3 million in the same period last year or a 23.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. 
And finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 36% for Q1. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 31%. 
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.1 million or 11.5 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $6.6 million or 1.5 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.7 million or a reduction of 2.2 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance, Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 34% for Q1 2020, up from 33.1% in Q1 2019. Proprietary Products' first quarter gross profit margin of 40.2% was 130 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. The key drivers of the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products. 
Production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, Contract Manufacturing's first quarter gross profit margin of 14.3% was 30 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our Proprietary Products' gross profit expansion. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 20% increase. Our Q1 2020 capital spending was $32.1 million, $3.3 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $633.1 million at March 31, 2020, was $74 million lower than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance of March 31 of $335.3 million was $103.8 million less than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to $115 million of expenditures under our share repurchase program. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remains strong. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion. This includes an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to prior guidance, which forecasted a $15 million headwind. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62 compared to prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.55. Capital expenditure will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of $0.04. The revised guidance also includes a $0.07 EPS impact from our first quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter. Strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

Obviously, very good growth and coming from the usual suspects here. I'm particularly impressed with the margin side and the growth side, 130 bps up year-over-year. And I think last year, Q1 was also a very good quarter. So on a full year basis, it was up over 150 bps. I'm not asking will these trends continue. But just what -- if you peel back the onion a little bit, it seems like, obviously, mix is driving a lot of that. And is that just mix within mix as you not only increase your high-value products percentage, but maybe go up to scale within high-value products to more of like, say, the NovaPure and stuff like that? Can you give us a little more color on that?"

There's -- what's happening with Proprietary is really 2 levers are being pulled simultaneously. One is the high-value product mix effect, but more importantly is that we're seeing increased growth and contribution of that growth with the products that have even higher margins. You start thinking about NovaPure, Daikyo, Crystal Zenith, even the FluroTec. And when you look at those in totality, that's roughly, let's say, about half of the incremental growth when it comes to the high-value products and with a much higher margin. So the mix shift is occurring through high-value products, but even more pronounced with the higher-margin subsets of that portfolio. 
The second lever that we are holding and the team is doing a really good job is this globalization of our operations. And as you know, we've been on this journey for a couple of years now, and the team has done a phenomenal job to start implementing lean processes and initiatives across our plants, which is allowing us to be more efficient and more effective and higher throughput. So the combination of both of them are giving us that type of margin expansion in Proprietary. And what excites me is if we think about the future pipeline, it is around the NovaPure, the FluroTec, the CZ, the self-injection portfolio. And that's what's really exciting as we think about the long-term growth trajectory of this business."

We had some -- frankly, Bernard can get in a little more detail, but we did have some additional costs. But what we're seeing right now and with the approach we've taken with this -- with the market units, we're able to have much more granular discussions with our customers. And as we start thinking about Q2 and Q3, we are actively working in all 3 corridors. To give you an example, in the diagnostics, our Contract Manufacturing arm of the business is currently scaling up on consumable products that are used in a couple of the devices that have been introduced in the market recently in the pipe. We won't speak about any specific customer, but these have been introduced recently into the hospitals, in the clinic setting. When it comes to therapeutics, there are a few that are in a market that we're already supporting and has been commercialized, but they're -- they're currently, as you know, going through clinical tests to see the ability to combat COVID-19, and we're in those areas. And then lastly, the vaccines. And those are a little more long term as we look out 2021. And our FluroTec technology is a perfect candidate for the vaccine market. So it's kind of a staged approach, and we'll see some of the benefit in 2020 and -- but most of it will be in 2021. Do you want to, Bernard, talk about the oil impact?"

We saw some of it in Q1, and there were some primarily showed up in our CM gross margin, which was probably impacted most by that.

We took a very proactive approach months ago when we started to see -- what we learned from our colleagues in Asia, particularly in our Qingpu facility in China and also in South -- Singapore. What we've done is we've taken a -- there's multiple steps that we've taken. One is the split shifts to minimize -- as they did the shift handovers, minimize interaction so that social distancing is very important. Also temperature monitoring. We also put a program in place that only essential employees were allowed to go into the facility. So you can imagine at our plants, all the 25 plants around the world, we have very important roles, but these are individuals that actually can work from remotely, and so we put that in place immediately. One other element we put in place is we're really focused on ensuring that when our colleagues are not feeling well or there's some question about their health, that they don't feel pressure to come into the office. So we relaxed some of our attendance policies. We improved. We expanded our compensation if somebody had to stay home for a period of time with the COVID, taking care of themselves and/or their family members. 
So those are many different levers that we put in place and to ensure that people are in the plants, should be in the plants and also mitigating any risk that we have for maybe coming from the outside. This crisis management team we put in place is monitoring it daily. We can tell you if there's absenteeism issues in any particular site. And I am very pleased and actually humbled on how well the absenteeism is very low in multiple sites. And I know in Europe, it went up slightly, but it came back down to normal rates in the last several weeks, which is a real testament and our employees really understand the purpose of why we're doing this and to support the community. So there's a lot of levers that we pull, Paul. It's not just one solution, there's many.

But I can tell you that we're on many of the products that are being currently develop, and we'll be going into clinical trials hopefully soon that we can participate on that. I think reason why we have a good, very strong participation rate in vaccines is one of the characteristics is required is the coating on the elastomer. And the FluroTec technology is a market-leading technology. So we're feeling really good in that regard. Secondly, around that, when we start thinking about the criticality or the urgency to get these materials manufactured, it gives us the ability to flex our global operations. And as we're building 40-plus billion components a year, the demand on vaccines, while it's important, it's a good size, it's not going to be too much of a challenge considering we have multiple sites that can produce these products using FluroTec's technology.

On the CM side, it's a little bit higher in Q1 that we -- than we traditionally would see. And I think that will come down a little bit going back to what Bernard said earlier, the full year probably looking at high single digits, maybe touching the 10% mark. But on the Proprietary side, the underlying core business, if you look at Q1 and Q4 of last year and the momentum that has been built up on the core, it's been relatively consistent.

I would like to begin by saying that I'm incredibly proud of how our team members across the globe have remained steadfast in our commitment to supply the much-needed components and solutions to our customers under tough circumstances. Our Q2 performance emphasizes the continued resolve of our talented team members, the strength of our company and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the lives of patients, which could be more meaningful than at times like today. Driven by our mission, we experienced another solid quarter reinforced by the right market-led strategy to continuously deliver value for our customers and the patients we jointly serve.
Moving to Slide 4. The pandemic remains our priority. Given the ever-changing situation, there's a huge sense of urgency in [indiscernible] development. As the market leader, our teams are working tirelessly with our customers to ensure we supply the right components and solutions to help resolve this pandemic. The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines, including vaccines, is a complex one, driven by years of science, which West has pioneered. We're helping our customers in the selection, testing and verification of components. We're doing this in a way that prepares our customers for the future commercial scale-up and launch of any successful vaccine candidates. As we stated during our first quarter earnings call, we have seen a high adoption rate of our oral polymer-coated stoppers made by both West and our partner, Daikyo. These are the industry standard for packaging-sensitive molecules with an outstanding track record of quality and reliability.
Notably, some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made this decision to use the best-in-industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety. As our customers' backing development rapidly moves into clinical trials, the entire West team has stepped up to make certain we can supply the demand for our high-value products as well as any immediate surge in request for therapeutics. The organization is also preparing for the potential volume surges that could come if and when vaccines are approved for human use. All the work over the past few years across the enterprise to drive commercial and operational excellence, along with globalizing West manufacturing operations, has put us in the best possible position to meet the future pandemic demand.
We are accelerating our capacity expansion to manufacture FluroTec and NovaPure components. These investments were in our 5-year plan, and we have brought them forward to address the expected increase in demand the latter part of this year and into 2021. From our perspective, it is still too early to estimate how much volume could be generated by vaccine packaging. However, whether it's hundreds of millions or billions of doses, our West team is prepared and ready when the time comes.
Turning to Slide 5 and our performance in the second quarter. Our financial position remains strong. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters have continued in the second quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. We had 14% organic sales growth in the second quarter, driven again by robust high-value product sales. And with HVP sales growth, we have experienced strong gross and operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in a strong adjusted EPS for the second quarter. To be clear, the majority of the organic growth in the second quarter was from our base business with some incremental growth coming from COVID-19 sales related to therapeutics. As for guidance, we believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year. That said, because of the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with COVID-19 solutions, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and the outlook. Bernard?"

I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe during this time. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance early in our biologics and generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020.
First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 13 to 17. We recorded net sales of $527.2 million, representing organic sales growth of 14.3%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $19 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic and stay-at-home restrictions, such as dental, veterinary and elective procedures.
We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $195.1 million in gross profit, $37.2 million or 23.6% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 37% was a 340 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $106 million recorded this quarter compared to $81.9 million in the same period last year for a 29.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 40% for Q2. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.09 in Q2, EPS grew by approximately 38%.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Proprietary Product sales grew organically by 13.3% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 65% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q2. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit experienced double-digit growth led by FluroTec and film-coated products sales. Our pharma market unit saw low single-digit growth, with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and FluroTec components, and Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the second quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection devices.
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $59.4 million or 12.6 percentage points of growth, including approximately $19 million of volume-driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $7.8 million or 1.7 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.6 million or a reduction of 2 percentage points.
Looking at margin performance. Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37% for Q2 2020, up from 33.6% in Q2 2019. Proprietary Products' second quarter gross profit margin of 42.8% with 330 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products' gross profit margin were: favorable mix of products sold, driven by high-value products; production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Contract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 19% was 470 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. Improvement is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. There was approximately 180 to 200 basis points positive impact on margin, primarily due to a onetime engineering project work. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% with a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our gross profit expansion. One point to note, we took a onetime charge of $6.3 million for asset impairment. This is included in other operating expenses.
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $205.2 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $52.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 34% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $69.2 million, $12.1 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $735.4 million at June 30, 2020, was $18.3 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in inventory, mainly as a result of increasing our safety stock levels and accounts receivable due to increased sales activity. Both DSO and DPO improved in the quarter. Our cash balance at June 30 of $445.9 million was $6.8 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remains strong.
Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.035 billion and $2.055 billion. This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of $60 million. There is an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 12.5%, this compares to prior guidance of $1.95 to $1.97 billion and growth of 8%. We do expect growth in Contract Manufacturing to be less in H2 versus H1 as a result of tougher comps. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.25 compared to prior guidance of $3.52 to $3.62. As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand. CapEx guidance has raised to $170 million to $180 million. This compares to previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. The revised guidance also includes $0.16 EPS impact from our H1 tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
So to summarize the key takeaways for the second quarter, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing. Gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. Our long-term construct remains at approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and continued EPS expansion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

One is, in regards to FluroTec and NovaPure components, primarily most of the interest -- and again, we have a pretty healthy participation rate with the number of companies working on a vaccine solution. In the vaccine area, we're seeing more interest around FluroTec as the primary technology and -- versus NovaPure. Now there are certain situations where NovaPure is a better solution, and customers have elected to go in that direction, but majority, I would say, is in FluroTec. In some of the therapeutics that we're working on, whether they're already marketed or being labeled expanded that's using the combination, mostly NovaPure and some FluroTec.
In regards to the second part, that's a tough question where we stand today. As you think about how our customers are looking at vial configuration, whether it's 1 dose or multiple doses per vial. And it's a little bit uncertain at this point in time. But the way that we've mapped out all these opportunities with our customers, each 1 is a little different from a number of doses, the volumes that we're looking at would accommodate either 1 dose or multiple doses per vial. But at this point in time, I think it's pretty difficult to pinpoint exactly number of doses per vial that our customers will be going with."

When you think about Crystal Zenith, it's already proven technology in the marketplace with a number of critical drugs, specifically around the biologics. And the demand that we have for Crystal Zenith is increasing. In fact, we are in process of increasing capacity in our Scottsdale, Arizona facility to address the increase around our 1 mL insert-needle technology. We do see certain customers that require the Crystal Zenith technology in the areas of vaccine exploring that option. But I would say, at this point, we have not gone out and side government grants. Frankly, I think our company as the market leader, we're leading from the front, and we've worked with a number of customers around the CZ technology. But I would say right now, what it looks like is that the preferred solution on the immediate phase would be around glass."

What's happening with the Contract Manufacturing really is around the diagnostics area, also injectables, auto injectors. And what we're finding is this -- a lot of this is installed capacity that we've been ramping up for the last couple of years. We do see that the growth rate of high single digits to low double digits is more in line with what we expect of Contract Manufacturing, and it has been running a little bit stronger over the last several quarters. But on the other side, we continue to have discussions about future installed capacity of similar products. So we see the second half of this year a little bit softer than the first half from a Contract Manufacturing perspective. But that's purely a comp issue and on the growth rates. From a dollar perspective, we don't see any softening in Contract Manufacturing. And you can -- we see the revenue itself growing, but it will grow at slower rates, purely because of the comps that we're facing in the back half of the year. And you can see the positive impact that's having, John, on margins, where we were able to report 19%. Now there were some onetime gains in there regarding certain engineering work that we were doing, which we would not expect to repeat in the second half of the year, but we forecast to see strong quarter-over-quarter growth when we compare to last year on the margin front. And this is something that we've been talking about for a while as we continue to improve the efficiencies and the utilization within the Contract Manufacturing network and taking a lot of the learnings that we've had a Proprietary over the last number of years and really starting to implement those within Contract Manufacturing. And so I would continue to see -- expect to see margin expansion, but not to the levels of 19%."

I realize that some funding going into certain manufacturing or R&D side, but we're not seeing the money really going into the percentage of COGs or the money going into the COGs of the supply base, so it's low. If you think about our product on a configuration, could be anywhere between $0.15 to $0.35. And if it's 1 dose or 5 dose, you can see how, from a per dose perspective, it's not a significant percentage of the COGs.

The -- I guess the curiosity that I have is that the -- that historical argument has been 1 that you've made. I've certainly made that the cost of these components as a percentage of, in most cases, a very high-priced, maybe even 4 figure per dose type price on a biologic is a very, very small percentage. When we're talking about at price per dose at what some of these companies are promising at like $10 or if it's a 4 or 5 dose per vial, it's -- maybe it's $40 or $50 of value, is a very different equation than $1,000 dose biologic. How is it that the interest level or the sensitivity to that price is as low as it is -- or appears to be as low as it is? And I guess to spin the question the other way, if customers are able to get over that so easily in this environment, is that a signal that the adoption rate outside of COVID for high-value products should significantly accelerate because the price sensitivity is really as low as it is?"

Dave, so just so we're clear, we have -- we're not getting support from any government. West is investing an extra $4 million essentially this year in CapEx and even some into 2020, and we've -- obviously, we're funding that ourselves. And when you look at you're comparing the cost of our product to the selling -- the selling [indiscernible] price, what we're saying is the cost of our product is a percentage of their COGs. So their COGs doesn't change no matter what they sell the product at, the cost of producing is still the same. And we're still a relatively low part of that. And then if you work out the price per dose, potentially, there could be 5, 10, 20 doses in a vial, where we sell 1 stopper per vial, so you got to divide back the cost to by the number of doses, so it becomes a really small part of the COGs. Regarding pricing, we haven't gone and tried to jack-up prices in this whole process. We're maintaining the pricing essentially that we've had in place on many of these products. Now pricing changes a lot of time regarding configuration, but I think that's the way to look at it rather than saying as a percentage of their price, if that's helpful for you, and then the number of doses per vial."

I would like to begin by saying that I'm incredibly proud of how our team members across the globe have remained steadfast in our commitment to supply the much-needed components and solutions to our customers under tough circumstances. Our Q2 performance emphasizes the continued resolve of our talented team members, the strength of our company and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. 
We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the lives of patients, which could be more meaningful than at times like today. Driven by our mission, we experienced another solid quarter reinforced by the right market-led strategy to continuously deliver value for our customers and the patients we jointly serve.
Moving to Slide 4. The pandemic remains our priority. Given the ever-changing situation, there's a huge sense of urgency in vaccine development. As the market leader, our teams are working tirelessly with our customers to ensure we supply the right components and solutions to help resolve this pandemic. The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines, including vaccines, is a complex one, driven by years of science, which West has pioneered. We're helping our customers in the selection, testing and verification of components. We're doing this in a way that prepares our customers for the future commercial scale up and launch of any successful vaccine candidates. As we stated during our first quarter earnings call, we have seen a high adoption rate of our fluoropolymer coated stoppers made by both West and our partner, Daikyo. These are the industry standard for packaging-sensitive molecules with an outstanding track record of quality and reliability.
Notably, some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made this decision to use the best-in-industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety. As our customers' vaccine development rapidly moves into clinical trials, the entire West team has stepped up to make certain we can supply the demand for our high-value products as well as any immediate surge in request for therapeutics. The organization is also preparing for the potential volume surges that could come if and when vaccines are approved for human use. All the work over the past few years across the enterprise to drive commercial and operational excellence along with globalizing West manufacturing operations has put us in the best possible position to meet the future pandemic demand.
We are accelerating our capacity expansion to manufacture FluroTec and NovaPure components. These investments were in our 5-year plan, and we have brought them forward to address the expected increase in demand the latter part of this year and into 2021. From our perspective, it is still too early to estimate how much volume could be generated by vaccine packaging. However, whether it's hundreds of millions or billions of doses, our West team is prepared and ready when the time comes.
Turning to Slide 5 and our performance in the second quarter. Our financial position remains strong. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters have continued in the second quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. We had 14% organic sales growth in the second quarter, driven again by robust high-value product sales. And with HVP sales growth, we have experienced strong gross and operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in a strong adjusted EPS for the second quarter. 
To be clear, the majority of the organic growth in the second quarter was from our base business with some incremental growth coming from COVID-19 sales related to therapeutics. As for guidance, we believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year. That said, because of the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with COVID-19 solutions, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and the outlook. Bernard?"

I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe during this time. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020.
First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 13 to 17. We recorded net sales of $527.2 million, representing organic sales growth of 14.3%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $19 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers, affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic and stay-at-home restrictions, such as dental, veterinary and elective procedures.
We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $195.1 million in gross profit, $37.2 million or 23.6% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 37% was a 340 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $106 million recorded this quarter compared to $81.9 million in the same period last year for a 29.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 40% for Q2. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.09 in Q2, EPS grew by approximately 38%.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Proprietary Product sales grew organically by 13.3% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 65% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q2. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit experienced double-digit growth led by FluroTec and film-coated products sales. Our Pharma market unit saw low single-digit growth, with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the second quarter, led, once again, by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection devices.
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $59.4 million or 12.6 percentage points of growth, including approximately $19 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $7.8 million or 1.7 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.6 million or a reduction of 2 percentage points.
Looking at margin performance. Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37% for Q2 2020, up from 33.6% in Q2 2019. Proprietary Products' second quarter gross profit margin of 42.8% was 330 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products' gross profit margin were: favorable mix of products sold, driven by high-value products; production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. 
Contract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 19% was 470 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. Improvement is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. There was approximately 180 to 200 basis points positive impact on margin, primarily due to a onetime engineering project work. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% with a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our gross profit expansion. One point to note, we took a onetime charge of $6.3 million for asset impairment. This is included in other operating expenses.
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $205.2 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $52.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 34% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $69.2 million, $12.1 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $735.4 million at June 30, 2020 was $18.3 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in inventory, mainly as a result of increasing our safety stock levels and accounts receivable due to increased sales activity. 
Both DSO and DPO improved in the quarter. Our cash balance at June 30 of $445.9 million was $6.8 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remained strong.
Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.035 billion and $2.055 billion. This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of $60 million. There is an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 12.5%. This compares to prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $1.97 billion and growth of 8%. We do expect growth in Contract Manufacturing to be less in H2 versus H1 as a result of tougher comps. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.25 compared to prior guidance of $3.52 to $3.62. 
As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand. CapEx guidance has raised to $170 million to $180 million. This compares to previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. The revised guidance also includes $0.16 EPS impact from our H1 tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
So to summarize the key takeaways for the second quarter, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. Our long-term construct remains at approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and continued EPS expansion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

One is, in regards to FluroTec and NovaPure components, primarily most of the interest with -- and again, we have a pretty healthy participation rate with the number of companies working on a vaccine solution. In the vaccine area, we're seeing more interest around FluroTec as the primary technology and -- versus NovaPure. Now there are certain situations where NovaPure is a better solution, and customers have elected to go in that direction, but majority, I would say, is in FluroTec. In some of the therapeutics that we're working on, whether they're already marketed or being labeled expanded, that's using the combination, mostly NovaPure and some FluroTec.
In regards to the second part, that's a tough question where we stand today. As you think about how our customers are looking at vial configuration, whether it's one dose or multiple doses per vial. And it's a little bit uncertain at this point in time. But the way that we've mapped out all these opportunities with our customers, each one is a little different from a number of doses, the volumes that we're looking at would accommodate either one dose or multiple doses per vial.  But at this point in time, I think it's pretty difficult to pinpoint exactly number of doses per vial that our customers will be going with."

I think when you think about the preferred solution in the market right now, it's still glass.

When you think about Crystal Zenith, it's already a proven technology in the marketplace with a number of critical drugs, specifically around the biologics. And the demand that we have for Crystal Zenith is increasing. In fact, we are in process of increasing capacity in our Scottsdale, Arizona facility to address the increase around our 1mL Insert Needle technology. 
We do see certain customers that require the Crystal Zenith technology in the areas of vaccine exploring that option. But I would say, at this point, we have not gone out and side government grants. Frankly, I think our company -- as the market leader, we're leading from the front, and we've worked with a number of customers around the CZ technology. But I would say right now, what it looks like is that the preferred solution on the immediate phase would be around glass."

What's happening with the Contract Manufacturing really is around the diagnostics area and also injectables, auto injectors. And what we're finding is this -- a lot of this is installed capacity that we've been ramping up for the last couple of years. We do see that the growth rate of high single digits to low double digits is more in line with what we expect of Contract Manufacturing, and it has been running a little bit stronger over the last several quarters. 
But on the other side, we continue to have discussions about future installed capacity of similar products. So we see the second half of this year a little bit softer than the first half from a Contract Manufacturing perspective. But that's purely a comp issue and on the growth rates, from a dollar perspective, we don't see any softening in Contract Manufacturing. And you can see the revenue itself growing, but it will grow at slower rates, purely because of the comps that we're facing in the back half of the year. And you can see the positive impact that's having, John, on margins, where we were able to report 19%. Now there were some onetime gains in there regarding certain engineering work that we were doing, which we would not expect to repeat in the second half of the year, but we forecast to see strong quarter-over-quarter growth when we compare to last year on the margin front. And this is something that we've been talking about for a while as we continue to improve the efficiencies and the utilizations within the Contract Manufacturing network and taking a lot of the learnings that we've had in Proprietary over the last number of years and really starting to implement those within Contract Manufacturing. And so I would continue to see -- expect to see margin expansion, but not to the levels of 19%."

I realize that there's some funding going into certain manufacturing or R&D side, but we're not seeing the money really going into the percentage of COGs or the money going into the COGs of the supply base, so it's low. If you think about our product on a configuration, could be anywhere between $0.15 to $0.35. And if it's one dose or 5 dose, you can see how, from a per dose perspective, it's not a significant percentage of the COGs. So I think we're well positioned, and the expectation is to continue with our policies around how we price according to the value we create to support our customers."

The -- I guess the curiosity that I have is that the -- that historical argument has been one that you've made. I've certainly made that the cost of these components as a percentage of, in most cases, a very high-priced, maybe even 4 figure per dose type price on a biologic is a very, very small percentage. When we're talking about a price per dose at what some of these companies are promising at like $10 or if it's a 4 or 5 dose per vial, it's -- maybe it's $40 or $50 of value, is a very different equation than $1,000 dose biologic. How is it that the interest level or the sensitivity to that price is as low as it is -- or appears to be as low as it is? And I guess to spin the question the other way, if customers are able to get over that so easily in this environment, is that a signal that the adoption rate outside of COVID for high-value products should significantly accelerate because the price sensitivity is really as low as it is?"

Dave, so -- just so we're clear, we have -- we're not getting support from any government. West is investing an extra $40 million essentially this year in CapEx and even some into 2020, and we've -- obviously, we're funding that ourselves. And when you look at -- you're comparing the cost of our product to the selling -- the end selling price, what we're saying is the cost of our product is a percentage of their COGs. So their COGs doesn't change no matter what they sell the product at, the cost of producing is still the same. And we're still a relatively low part of that. And then if you work out the price per dose, potentially, there could be 5, 10, 20 doses in a vial, where we sell one stopper per vial, so you got to divide back the cost by the number of doses, so it becomes a really small part of the COGs. 
Regarding pricing, we haven't gone and tried to jack-up prices in this whole process. We're maintaining the pricing essentially that we've had in place on many of these products. Now pricing changes a lot of time regarding configuration, but I think that's the way to look at it rather than saying as a percentage of their price, if that's helpful for you, and then the number of doses per vial."

And so there's a comfort of when they think about how they can go to the market fast. When you think about regulatory, you think about safety, you think about quality and scale, and we have the scale. We can manufacture the volumes that we're speaking of in a very, very short period of time. So I think, Dave, that's where that gives the customers confidence and comfort to continue to go after that part of our portfolio versus using this basic standard product. And -- so I'll stop there, but that's the reason why we're seeing the demand in that area."

I would like to begin by saying that I'm incredibly proud of how our team members across the globe have remained steadfast in our commitment to supply the much-needed comp",703,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin by saying that I'm incredibly proud of how our team members across the globe have remained steadfast in our commitment to supply the much-needed components and solutions to our customers under tough circumstances. Our Q2 performance emphasizes the continued resolve of our talented team members, the strength of our company and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. 
We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the lives of patients, which could be more meaningful than at times like today. Driven by our mission, we experienced another solid quarter reinforced by the right market-led strategy to continuously deliver value for our customers and the patients we jointly serve.
Moving to Slide 4. The pandemic remains our priority. Given the ever-changing situation, there's a huge sense of urgency in vaccine development. As the market leader, our teams are working tirelessly with our customers to ensure we supply the right components and solutions to help resolve this pandemic. The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines, including vaccines, is a complex one, driven by years of science, which West has pioneered. We're helping our customers in the selection, testing and verification of components. We're doing this in a way that prepares our customers for the future commercial scale up and launch of any successful vaccine candidates. As we stated during our first quarter earnings call, we have seen a high adoption rate of our fluoropolymer coated stoppers made by both West and our partner, Daikyo. These are the industry standard for packaging-sensitive molecules with an outstanding track record of quality and reliability.
Notably, some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made this decision to use the best-in-industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety. As our customers' vaccine development rapidly moves into clinical trials, the entire West team has stepped up to make certain we can supply the demand for our high-value products as well as any immediate surge in request for therapeutics. The organization is also preparing for the potential volume surges that could come if and when vaccines are approved for human use. All the work over the past few years across the enterprise to drive commercial and operational excellence, along with globalizing West's manufacturing operations, has put us in the best possible position to meet the future pandemic demand. 
We are accelerating our capacity expansion to manufacture FluroTec and NovaPure components. These investments were in our 5-year plan, and we have brought them forward to address the expected increase in demand the latter part of this year and into 2021. From our perspective, it is still too early to estimate how much volume could be generated by vaccine packaging. However, whether it's hundreds of millions or billions of doses, our West team is prepared and ready when the time comes.
Turning to Slide 5 and our performance in the second quarter. Our financial position remains strong. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters have continued in the second quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. We had 14% organic sales growth in the second quarter, driven again by robust high-value product sales. And with HVP sales growth, we have experienced strong gross and operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in a strong adjusted EPS for the second quarter. 
To be clear, the majority of the organic growth in the second quarter was from our base business with some incremental growth coming from COVID-19 sales related to therapeutics. As for guidance, we believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year. That said, because of the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with COVID-19 solutions, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and the outlook. Bernard?"

I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe during this time. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020.
First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 13 to 17. We recorded net sales of $527.2 million, representing organic sales growth of 14.3%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $19 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers, affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic and stay-at-home restrictions, such as dental, veterinary and elective procedures.
We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $195.1 million in gross profit, $37.2 million or 23.6% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 37% was a 340 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $106 million recorded this quarter compared to $81.9 million in the same period last year for a 29.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 40% for Q2. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.09 in Q2, EPS grew by approximately 38%.
Moving to Slide 7. Our proprietary product sales grew organically by 13.3% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q2. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. 
The generics market unit experienced double-digit growth led by FluroTec and film-coated products sales. Our Pharma market unit saw low single-digit growth, with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the second quarter, led, once again, by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection devices.
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $59.4 million or 12.6 percentage points of growth, including approximately $19 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $7.8 million or 1.7 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.6 million or a reduction of 2 percentage points.
Looking at margin performance. Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37% for Q2 2020, up from 33.6% in Q2 2019. Proprietary products second quarter gross profit margin of 42.8% was 330 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. The key drivers for the continued improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by high-value products; production efficiencies; and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. 
Contract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 19% was 470 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. Improvement is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. There was approximately 180 to 200 basis points positive impact on margin, primarily due to a onetime engineering project work. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our gross profit expansion. One point to note, we took a onetime charge of $6.3 million for asset impairment. This is included in other operating expenses.
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $205.2 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $52.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 34% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $69.2 million, $12.1 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $735.4 million at June 30, 2020 was $18.3 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in inventory, mainly as a result of increasing our safety stock levels and accounts receivable due to increased sales activity. 
Both DSO and DPO improved in the quarter. Our cash balance at June 30 of $445.9 million was $6.8 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remain strong.
Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.035 billion and $2.055 billion. This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of $60 million. There is an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 12.5%. This compares to prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $1.97 billion and growth of 8%. We do expect growth in Contract Manufacturing to be less in H2 versus H1 as a result of tougher comps. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.25 compared to prior guidance of $3.52 to $3.62. 
As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand. CapEx guidance has raised to $170 million to $180 million. This compares to previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. The revised guidance also includes $0.16 EPS impact from our H1 tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
So to summarize the key takeaways for the second quarter, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. Our long-term construct remains at approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and continued EPS expansion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

One is, in regards to FluroTec and NovaPure components, primarily most of the interest with -- and again, we have a pretty healthy participation rate with the number of companies working on a vaccine solution. In the vaccine area, we're seeing more interest around FluroTec as the primary technology and -- versus NovaPure. Now there are certain situations where NovaPure is a better solution, and customers have elected to go in that direction, but the majority, I would say, is in FluroTec. In some of the therapeutics that we're working on, where they're already marketed or being labeled expanded, that's using the combination, mostly NovaPure and some FluroTec.
In regards to the second part, that's a tough question where we stand today. As you think about how our customers are looking at vial configuration, whether it's one dose or multiple doses per vial. And it's a little bit uncertain at this point in time. But the way that we've mapped out all these opportunities with our customers, each one is a little different from a number of doses, the volumes that we're looking at would accommodate either one dose or multiple doses per vial. But at this point in time, I think it's pretty difficult to pinpoint exactly number of doses per vial that our customers will be going with."

I think when you think about the preferred solution in the market right now, it's still glass. And so I know that the companies that are manufacturing glass are working on making sure they have the appropriate volumes, but I can't speak to them specifically. When you think about Crystal Zenith, it's already a proven technology in the marketplace with a number of critical drugs, specifically around the biologics. And the demand that we have for Crystal Zenith is increasing. In fact, we are in process of increasing capacity in our Scottsdale, Arizona facility to address the increase around our 1mL Insert Needle technology. 
We do see certain customers that require the Crystal Zenith technology in the areas of vaccine exploring that option. But I would say, at this point, we have not gone out and sought government grants. Frankly, I think our company, as the market leader, we're leading from the front, and we've worked with a number of customers around the CZ technology. But I would say right now, what it looks like is that the preferred solution on the immediate phase would be around glass."

The -- I guess the curiosity that I have is that the -- that historical argument has been one that you've made. I've certainly made that the cost of these components as a percentage of, in most cases, a very high-priced, maybe even 4 figure per dose type price on a biologic is a very, very small percentage. When we're talking about a price per dose at what some of these companies are promising at like $10 or if it's a 4 or 5 dose per vial, it's -- maybe it's $40 or $50 of value, is a very different equation than $1,000 dose biologic. How is it that the interest level or the sensitivity to that price is as low as it is -- or appears to be as low as it is? And I guess to spin the question the other way, if customers are able to get over that so easily in this environment, is that a signal that the adoption rate outside of COVID for high-value products should significantly accelerate because the price sensitivity is really as low as it is?"

So -- just so we're clear, we have -- we're not getting support from any government. West is investing an extra $40 million essentially this year in CapEx and even some into 2020. We've -- obviously, we're funding that ourselves. And when you look at -- you're comparing the cost of our product to the selling -- the end selling price. What we're saying is the cost of our product is a percentage of their COGS. So their COGS doesn't change no matter what they sell the product at, the cost of producing is still the same. And we're still a relatively low part of that. And then if you work out the price per dose, potentially, there could be 5, 10, 20 doses in a vial. Well, we sell one stopper per vial, so you got to divide back the cost of the stopper by the number of doses, so it becomes a really small part of the COGS. 
Regarding pricing, we haven't gone and tried to jack-up prices in this whole process. We're maintaining the pricing essentially that we've had in place on many of these products. Now, pricing changes a lot of times regarding configuration, but I think that's the way to look at it rather than saying as a percentage of their price, if that's helpful for you, and then the number of doses per vial."

I would like to begin by saying that I'm incredibly proud of how our team members across the globe have remained steadfast in our commitment to supply the much-needed components and solutions to our customers under tough circumstances. Our Q2 performance emphasizes the continued resolve of our talented team members, the strength of our company and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. 
We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the lives of patients, which could be more meaningful than at times like today. Driven by our mission, we experienced another solid quarter reinforced by the right market-led strategy to continuously deliver value for our customers and the patients we jointly serve.
Moving to Slide 4. The pandemic remains our priority. Given the ever-changing situation, there's a huge sense of urgency in vaccine development. As the market leader, our teams are working tirelessly with our customers to ensure we supply the right components and solutions to help resolve this pandemic. The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines, including vaccines, is a complex one, driven by years of science, which West has pioneered. We're helping our customers in the selection, testing and verification of components. We're doing this in a way that prepares our customers for the future commercial scale up and launch of any successful vaccine candidates. As we stated during our first quarter earnings call, we have seen a high adoption rate of our fluoropolymer coated stoppers made by both West and our partner, Daikyo. These are the industry standard for packaging-sensitive molecules with an outstanding track record of quality and reliability.
Notably, some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made this decision to use the best-in-industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety. As our customers' vaccine development rapidly moves into clinical trials, the entire West team has stepped up to make certain we can supply the demand for our high-value products as well as any immediate surge in request for therapeutics. The organization is also preparing for the potential volume surges that could come if and when vaccines are approved for human use. All the work over the past few years across the enterprise to drive commercial and operational excellence, along with globalizing West's manufacturing operations, has put us in the best possible position to meet the future pandemic demand. 
We are accelerating our capacity expansion to manufacture FluroTec and NovaPure components. These investments were in our 5-year plan, and we have brought them forward to address the expected increase in demand the latter part of this year and into 2021. From our perspective, it is still too early to estimate how much volume could be generated by vaccine packaging. However, whether it's hundreds of millions or billions of doses, our West team is prepared and ready when the time comes.
Turning to Slide 5 and our performance in the second quarter. Our financial position remains strong. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters have continued in the second quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. We had 14% organic sales growth in the second quarter, driven again by robust high-value product sales. And with HVP sales growth, we have experienced strong gross and operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in a strong adjusted EPS for the second quarter. 
To be clear, the majority of the organic growth in the second quarter was from our base business with some incremental growth coming from COVID-19 sales related to therapeutics. As for guidance, we believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year. That said, because of the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with COVID-19 solutions, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and the outlook. Bernard?"

I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe during this time. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020.
First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 13 to 17. We recorded net sales of $527.2 million, representing organic sales growth of 14.3%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $19 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers, affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic and stay-at-home restrictions, such as dental, veterinary and elective procedures.
We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $195.1 million in gross profit, $37.2 million or 23.6% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 37% was a 340 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $106 million recorded this quarter compared to $81.9 million in the same period last year for a 29.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 40% for Q2. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.09 in Q2, EPS grew by approximately 38%.
Moving to Slide 7. Our proprietary product sales grew organically by 13.3% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q2. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. 
The generics market unit experienced double-digit growth led by FluroTec and film-coated products sales. Our Pharma market unit saw low single-digit growth, with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the second quarter, led, once again, by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection devices.
So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $59.4 million or 12.6 percentage points of growth, including approximately $19 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $7.8 million or 1.7 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.6 million or a reduction of 2 percentage points.
Looking at margin performance. Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37% for Q2 2020, up from 33.6% in Q2 2019. Proprietary products second quarter gross profit margin of 42.8% was 330 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. The key drivers for the continued improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by high-value products; production efficiencies; and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. 
Contract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 19% was 470 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. Improvement is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. There was approximately 180 to 200 basis points positive impact on margin, primarily due to a onetime engineering project work. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our gross profit expansion. One point to note, we took a onetime charge of $6.3 million for asset impairment. This is included in other operating expenses.
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $205.2 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $52.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 34% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $69.2 million, $12.1 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $735.4 million at June 30, 2020 was $18.3 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in inventory, mainly as a result of increasing our safety stock levels and accounts receivable due to increased sales activity. 
Both DSO and DPO improved in the quarter. Our cash balance at June 30 of $445.9 million was $6.8 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remain strong.
Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.035 billion and $2.055 billion. This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of $60 million. There is an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 12.5%. This compares to prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $1.97 billion and growth of 8%. We do expect growth in Contract Manufacturing to be less in H2 versus H1 as a result of tougher comps. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.25 compared to prior guidance of $3.52 to $3.62. 
As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand. CapEx guidance has raised to $170 million to $180 million. This compares to previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million.
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. The revised guidance also includes $0.16 EPS impact from our H1 tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
So to summarize the key takeaways for the second quarter, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. Our long-term construct remains at approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and continued EPS expansion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

One is, in regards to FluroTec and NovaPure components, primarily most of the interest with -- and again, we have a pretty healthy participation rate with the number of companies working on a vaccine solution. In the vaccine area, we're seeing more interest around FluroTec as the primary technology and -- versus NovaPure. Now there are certain situations where NovaPure is a better solution, and customers have elected to go in that direction, but the majority, I would say, is in FluroTec. In some of the therapeutics that we're working on, where they're already marketed or being labeled expanded, that's using the combination, mostly NovaPure and some FluroTec.
In regards to the second part, that's a tough question where we stand today. As you think about how our customers are looking at vial configuration, whether it's one dose or multiple doses per vial. And it's a little bit uncertain at this point in time. But the way that we've mapped out all these opportunities with our customers, each one is a little different from a number of doses, the volumes that we're looking at would accommodate either one dose or multiple doses per vial.

And the demand that we have for Crystal Zenith is increasing. In fact, we are in process of increasing capacity in our Scottsdale, Arizona facility to address the increase around our 1mL Insert Needle technology. 
We do see certain customers that require the Crystal Zenith technology in the areas of vaccine exploring that option. But I would say, at this point, we have not gone out and sought government grants. Frankly, I think our company, as the market leader, we're leading from the front, and we've worked with a number of customers around the CZ technology. But I would say right now, what it looks like is that the preferred solution on the immediate phase would be around glass."

I've certainly made that the cost of these components as a percentage of, in most cases, a very high-priced, maybe even 4 figure per dose type price on a biologic is a very, very small percentage. When we're talking about a price per dose at what some of these companies are promising at like $10 or if it's a 4 or 5 dose per vial, it's -- maybe it's $40 or $50 of value, is a very different equation than $1,000 dose biologic. How is it that the interest level or the sensitivity to that price is as low as it is -- or appears to be as low as it is? And I guess to spin the question the other way, if customers are able to get over that so easily in this environment, is that a signal that the adoption rate outside of COVID for high-value products should significantly accelerate because the price sensitivity is really as low as it is?"

So -- just so we're clear, we have -- we're not getting support from any government. West is investing an extra $40 million essentially this year in CapEx and even some into 2020. We've -- obviously, we're funding that ourselves. And when you look at -- you're comparing the cost of our product to the selling -- the end selling price. What we're saying is the cost of our product is a percentage of their COGS. So their COGS doesn't change no matter what they sell the product at, the cost of producing is still the same. And we're still a relatively low part of that. And then if you work out the price per dose, potentially, there could be 5, 10, 20 doses in a vial. Well, we sell one stopper per vial, so you got to divide back the cost of the stopper by the number of doses, so it becomes a really small part of the COGS. 
Regarding pricing, we haven't gone and tried to jack-up prices in this whole process. We're maintaining the pricing essentially that we've had in place on many of these products. Now, pricing changes a lot of times regarding configuration, but I think that's the way to look at it rather than saying as a percentage of their price, if that's helpful for you, and then the number of doses per vial."

Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we dive into our Q3 results and raise 2020 guidance, I'd like to make clear the importance of our mission at West and the values that form the pillars in which we operate. 
In today's uncertain environment and what seems like a new set of challenges each day. We remain focused on 2 key priorities: keeping our team members safe, and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high-quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we jointly serve.  
Moving to Slide 5. West is uniquely positioned to satisfy increasing market demand by leveraging our global operation scale and resources. 
Our team recognized at the outset of the pandemic, the need to increase production capacity. We were already supporting the growth trajectory of our base business and the future demand for our products required for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, meant that we needed to act quickly and decisively to address the increase in demand, we brought forward planned capital investments in production capacity. 
Earlier this month, we installed new manufacturing equipment at one of our HBP sites to prepare for the future demand of Flurotec and NovaPure. 
As of this week, that capacity is operational, and we have additional equipment being installed at a second HVP site with more installations planned in the coming months at other global sites. 
The strength of our performance this past quarter demonstrates the forward momentum we have built over time with our market-led strategy and the One West team approach to satisfy market demand. 
Now turning to Slide 6. The disruption caused by the pandemic has impacted the way all of us conduct business and our daily lives. 
West is no exception. Thankfully, the changes we have been making over the past several years, the way we do business have enabled us to address these disruptions from a position of strength. 
Customers come to West for a scientific and technical expertise, and this differentiates us in the market.  
Despite the pandemic, we continue to share our expertise through our enhanced knowledge center, webinars, published articles and technical presentations at virtual conferences. 
We have been investing in digital technology, in automation with 2 objectives in mind: bringing new connected products to market as well as enhancing the productivity of our operations at every level of the organization. 
While we're early in our digital journey, I would like to share a few examples of our recent success. Starting with our manufacturing automation strategy. We made great strides over the past year in helping us achieve continuous improvements in quality, safety, service and cost. 
For example, our St. Petersburg, Florida site has developed an automation process for robotically loading and unloading molding presses. 
This has conservatively reduced idle production time associated with product changeovers and improved operating efficiency. 
And our Kinston site has automated molding, trimming, renting processes, which will drive higher quality in final product and greater efficiency gains.  
And I'm especially pleased with the team's agility in bringing forward the production capacity expansion, I mentioned earlier. A great deal of planning and engineering went into this initiative to help us meet our customers' requirements.  
On the digital front, we have just introduced West Virtual, the future of customer interactions with a truly immersive, fully interactive online experience. 
We expect this tool to be a primary customer interface even beyond the current pandemic. 
Turning to Slide 7 and our performance in the third quarter. Our financial results remain strong. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters continued in the third quarter, and the outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive. 
We had over 18% organic sales growth in the third quarter, driven again by robust high-value product sales as well as sales and contract manufacturing. 
And we experienced solid growth and operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in its strong adjusted EPS and free cash flow for the third quarter.  
Similar to the second quarter, our base business had solid organic sales growth in the third quarter. We also had incremental sales associated with many COVID-19 development projects we are supporting for both therapeutics and vaccines. Specifically for vaccines, towards the back end of the quarter, we were asked by our customers to accelerate initial deliveries of components. 
These more than offset continued sales decline of products associated with injectable drugs and treatments such as dental and elective surgeries that have been impacted negatively by the pandemic. 
As for guidance for the remainder of the year, we are confident that we're well positioned with the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with pandemic solutions. 
Therefore, we're raising our sales and EPS guidance for the remainder of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance and guidance. Bernard?"

So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and generics market units and contract manufacturing. 
I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. 
And finally, we'll review our updated 2020 guidance. First off, Q3. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 16.0 to 20. 
We recorded net sales of $548 million, representing organic sales growth of 18.2%. COVID related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $32 million in the quarter. 
The net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatments and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. 
Excluding net COVID impact, organic sales grew by approximately 11%. Looking at slide 9. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 20.3% in the quarter. 
High-value products, which made up more than 65% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q3. 
Looking at the performance of the market units. The biologics market units delivered strong double-digit growth. 
We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit experienced high single-digit growth, led by sales of Teflon Stoppers and Flurotec components. 
Our pharma market unit saw mid-single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and Flurotec components. 
In contract manufacturing, a double-digit organic sales growth for the third quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection device. We continue to see improvement in gross profit.
We recorded $194.6 million in gross profit, $46.8 million or a 31.7% above Q3 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 35.5% was a 310 basis point expansion from the same period last year. 
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $103.9 million recorded this quarter compared to $17.1 million in the same period last year for a 48.2% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 19% was a 360 basis point increase from the same period last year. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 46% for Q3. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.02 in Q3, EPS grew by approximately 53%. 
Let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. 
Volume and mix contributed $77.1 million or 16.9 percentage points of growth, including approximately $32 million of volume-driven by COVID '19 related net demand. 
Sales price increases contributed $6.1 million or 1.3 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $8.7 million or an increase of 1.9 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 35.5% for Q3 2020, up from 32.4% in Q3 2019. Proprietary Products, third quarter gross profit margin of 40.8% was 260 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019. 
The key drivers of the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by the growth in high-value products, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. 
Contract manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 17.9% with 350 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019. 
This is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. 
On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $323.8 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $63 million compared to the same period last year, a 24.2% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $116.7 million, $27.9 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. 
Working capital of $790.6 million at September 30, 2020, was $73.5 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales activity and inventory mainly as a result of increasing safety stock. 
Our cash balance at September 30 of $519.4 million was $80.3 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. 
Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity remains strong. Turning to guidance. 
Slide 13 provides a high level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.1 billion and $2.11 billion. 
This includes estimated net cohort incremental revenues of approximately $85 million. There is an estimated headwind of $4 million based on current foreign exchange rates. 
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 14% to 15%. This compares to prior guidance of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion and growth of approximately 12%. 
We expect our full year 2020 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $4.50 to $4.55 compared to prior guidance of $4.15 to $4.25. 
As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID vaccine demand. 
CapEx guidance remains at $170 million to $180 million. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our revised guidance. 
Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. The revised guidance also includes $0.18 EPS impact from our tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
So to summarize the key takeaways for the third quarter, strong top line growth in both proprietary and contract manufacturing. 
Gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. 
Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

And so we have a pretty robust construct around the hurdle rates that we have to meet. But that is something that we have started to look at. 
And if we have any updates for given the future, we'll obviously communicate those to you. The one thing that we are cognizant of is that we have a very strong and robust organic growth story and strategic plan in place. 
And our priority is to make sure that we continue to deliver on that and not get distracted. So hopefully, that answers your question."

Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we dive into our Q3 results and raise 2020 guidance, I'd like to make clear the importance of our mission at West and the values that form the pillars in which we operate. 
In today's uncertain environment and what seems like a new set of challenges each day. We remain focused on 2 key priorities: keeping our team members safe, and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high-quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we jointly serve.  
Moving to Slide 5. West is uniquely positioned to satisfy increasing market demand by leveraging our global operation scale and resources. 
Our team recognized at the outset of the pandemic, the need to increase production capacity. We were already supporting the growth trajectory of our base business and the future demand for our products required for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, meant that we needed to act quickly and decisively to address the increase in demand, we brought forward planned capital investments in production capacity. 
Earlier this month, we installed new manufacturing equipment at one of our HBP sites to prepare for the future demand of Flurotec and NovaPure. 
As of this week, that capacity is operational, and we have additional equipment being installed at a second HVP site with more installations planned in the coming months at other global sites. 
The strength of our performance this past quarter demonstrates the forward momentum we have built over time with our market-led strategy and the One West team approach to satisfy market demand. 
Now turning to Slide 6. The disruption caused by the pandemic has impacted the way all of us conduct business and our daily lives. 
West is no exception. Thankfully, the changes we have been making over the past several years, the way we do business have enabled us to address these disruptions from a position of strength. 
Customers come to West for a scientific and technical expertise, and this differentiates us in the market.  
Despite the pandemic, we continue to share our expertise through our enhanced knowledge center, webinars, published articles and technical presentations at virtual conferences. 
We have been investing in digital technology, in automation with 2 objectives in mind: bringing new connected products to market as well as enhancing the productivity of our operations at every level of the organization. 
While we're early in our digital journey, I would like to share a few examples of our recent success. Starting with our manufacturing automation strategy. We made great strides over the past year in helping us achieve continuous improvements in quality, safety, service and cost. 
For example, our St. Petersburg, Florida site has developed an automation process for robotically loading and unloading molding presses. 
This has conservatively reduced idle production time associated with product changeovers and improved operating efficiency. 
And our Kinston site has automated molding, trimming, renting processes, which will drive higher quality in final product and greater efficiency gains.  
And I'm especially pleased with the team's agility in bringing forward the production capacity expansion, I mentioned earlier. A great deal of planning and engineering went into this initiative to help us meet our customers' requirements.  
On the digital front, we have just introduced West Virtual, the future of customer interactions with a truly immersive, fully interactive online experience. 
We expect this tool to be a primary customer interface even beyond the current pandemic. 
Turning to Slide 7 and our performance in the third quarter. Our financial results remain strong. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters continued in the third quarter, and the outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive. 
We had over 18% organic sales growth in the third quarter, driven again by robust high-value product sales as well as sales and contract manufacturing. 
And we experienced solid growth and operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in its strong adjusted EPS and free cash flow for the third quarter.  
Similar to the second quarter, our base business had solid organic sales growth in the third quarter. We also had incremental sales associated with many COVID-19 development projects we are supporting for both therapeutics and vaccines. Specifically for vaccines, towards the back end of the quarter, we were asked by our customers to accelerate initial deliveries of components. 
These more than offset continued sales decline of products associated with injectable drugs and treatments such as dental and elective surgeries that have been impacted negatively by the pandemic. 
As for guidance for the remainder of the year, we are confident that we're well positioned with the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with pandemic solutions. 
Therefore, we're raising our sales and EPS guidance for the remainder of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance and guidance. Bernard?"

So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and generics market units and contract manufacturing. 
I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. 
And finally, we'll review our updated 2020 guidance. First off, Q3. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 16.0 to 20. 
We recorded net sales of $548 million, representing organic sales growth of 18.2%. COVID related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $32 million in the quarter. 
The net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatments and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. 
Excluding net COVID impact, organic sales grew by approximately 11%. Looking at slide 9. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 20.3% in the quarter. 
High-value products, which made up more than 65% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q3. 
Looking at the performance of the market units. The biologics market units delivered strong double-digit growth. 
We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit experienced high single-digit growth, led by sales of Teflon Stoppers and Flurotec components. 
Our pharma market unit saw mid-single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and Flurotec components. 
In contract manufacturing, a double-digit organic sales growth for the third quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection device. We continue to see improvement in gross profit.
We recorded $194.6 million in gross profit, $46.8 million or a 31.7% above Q3 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 35.5% was a 310 basis point expansion from the same period last year. 
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $103.9 million recorded this quarter compared to $17.1 million in the same period last year for a 48.2% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 19% was a 360 basis point increase from the same period last year. 
Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 46% for Q3. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.02 in Q3, EPS grew by approximately 53%. 
Let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. 
Volume and mix contributed $77.1 million or 16.9 percentage points of growth, including approximately $32 million of volume-driven by COVID '19 related net demand. 
Sales price increases contributed $6.1 million or 1.3 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $8.7 million or an increase of 1.9 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 35.5% for Q3 2020, up from 32.4% in Q3 2019. Proprietary Products, third quarter gross profit margin of 40.8% was 260 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019. 
The key drivers of the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by the growth in high-value products, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. 
Contract manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 17.9% with 350 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019. 
This is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. 
On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $323.8 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $63 million compared to the same period last year, a 24.2% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $116.7 million, $27.9 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. 
Working capital of $790.6 million at September 30, 2020, was $73.5 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales activity and inventory mainly as a result of increasing safety stock. 
Our cash balance at September 30 of $519.4 million was $80.3 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. 
Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity remains strong. Turning to guidance. 
Slide 13 provides a high level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.1 billion and $2.11 billion. 
This includes estimated net cohort incremental revenues of approximately $85 million. There is an estimated headwind of $4 million based on current foreign exchange rates. 
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 14% to 15%. This compares to prior guidance of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion and growth of approximately 12%. 
We expect our full year 2020 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $4.50 to $4.55 compared to prior guidance of $4.15 to $4.25. 
As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID vaccine demand. 
CapEx guidance remains at $170 million to $180 million. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our revised guidance. 
Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. The revised guidance also includes $0.18 EPS impact from our tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
So to summarize the key takeaways for the third quarter, strong top line growth in both proprietary and contract manufacturing. 
Gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. 
Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and EPS expansion. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

So the Fluorotech coating that is used on both stoppers and plungers. 
And so therefore, that's somewhat foundational and that has been -- the demand has obviously increased due to the current pandemic. We start thinking about penetration of Envision, which is continuously grow nicely. And then Novapure, which is the highest level quality product that we provide in the marketplace. 
And that is -- the adoption rate is starting to -- continues to accelerate. It is still less than 10% or, frankly, less than 5% of our sales in proprietary. 
But the highest growth that we're seeing. And what's really encouraging, as you know, we have good visibility of what's in the pipeline and what our customers are looking to use for primary containment, Novapure is now becoming quite a, I'd call it, a staple in the biologics space. 
So we anticipate strong growth in Novapure, not just near-term but more long-term on the base business. And in addition to that, when you start to think about some of the vaccines that are being looked at and being developed for COVID, we are seeing interest levels around Novapure."
