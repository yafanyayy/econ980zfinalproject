As I reflect on the past year at Realty Income, I remain inspired by the dedication of our colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue numerous profitable growth initiatives while contributing to a record year of acqui",1743,"Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. As I reflect on the past year at Realty Income, I remain inspired by the dedication of our colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue numerous profitable growth initiatives while contributing to a record year of acquisitions for our company. During the fourth quarter, we closed on the merger with NAREIT, welcoming many talented new colleagues that will further help drive our ambitious goals while amplifying our competitive position in the industry. 
We are committed to a seamless and successful transition as we collectively work to integrate our team, processes and systems. We remain on track to achieve over 75% of our annualized G&A cost synergies in year 1 post merger, as we outlined upon announcing the merger in April of last year. Specifically, we have achieved over $42 million of our $37.5 million targeted synergies in year 1, representing full year 2022, with over $50 million in G&A synergies expected in year 2, representing full year 2023. 
Also, I continue to be impressed by the talent and dedication of our new team members as we work to integrate our 2 platforms and further strengthen our one team. And while we creatively bring together the best practices of VEREIT and Realty Income with our integration efforts to productively scale our operations, I'm encouraged by our integration work completed to date and our journey ahead. Beyond the merger, our business set a quarterly record for investment volume in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, we strengthened our foothold in Spain through additional high-quality acquisitions, including our second acquisition of properties leased to a key partner in Carrefour, one of the world's leading grocery retailers. Our strategic expansion into Continental Europe meaningfully increases our total addressable universe as we estimate the total addressable market in Europe to be $8 trillion, nearly double that of the U.S. We expect our investment activity in Europe to continue contributing to our competitive cost of capital as we look to further hedge our currency risk with debt priced at meaningfully lower yields than in the U.S. 
Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue creating value by capitalizing on our portable competitive advantages globally to deliver favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. With regards to recent developments, as previously disclosed this month, we announced our intent to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor, the East Coast's leading integrated resort and casino located less than 5 miles from downtown Boston. The $1.7 billion acquisition is being consummated at a 5.9% cash cap rate with a 30-year [indiscernible] lease term. 
The property represents our first investment in the gaming industry and would represent less than 3.5% of our pro forma annual rent. While the property type is new, the lens we use to pursue the merits of the transaction is not. Our investment strategy centers around partnership with best-in-class operators occupying high-quality real estate locations, which is particularly important when entering a new business vertical and geography. We followed this strategy with the Diageo sale leaseback in 2010 when executing our first transaction in the vineyard space, with the Sainsbury's sale leaseback in 2019 when expanding our business internationally. 
And more recently, with the Carrefour sale leaseback when we entered into Spain last year. Our debt transaction in the gaming industry with Wynn Resorts represents the same commitment to partnering with the premier leaders in the respective industries together with a commitment to our overall investment strategy. The Encore Boston Harbor  acquisition will add further diversification to our industry and client roster. After closing this transaction, we expect Wynn Resorts will become 1 of our top 10 clients. Our capacity to pursue and absorb a transaction of this size with a single client was supported by the enhanced size and scale that we gained through the VEREIT merger. 
And it is a testament to our ability to complete large-scale transactions without significantly impacting our prudent portfolio diversification metrics. The Encore Boston Harbor transaction meets our key investment criteria and illustrates that our investment opportunity set is not constrained by a particular property type. The merits of this transaction are first, the real estate. We're acquiring 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate strategically located on the banks of the Mystic River. 
After opening in 2019, the property is still ramping but already generates $210 million in annual EBITDA, resulting in 2.1x rent coverage initially. Second, the client [indiscernible]. We are entering into a 30-year triple net lease with attractive annual rent escalators at 1.75% annually for the first 10 years and the greater of 1.75% or CPI thereafter capped at 2.5%. Wynn Resorts is one of the largest premier gaming operators in the U.S. with an enterprise value of approximately $20 billion. They maintain a healthy balance sheet, moderate leverage and significant liquidity. 
Third, the industry performance. The gaming industry in the U.S. has recovered to pre-COVID levels. And in Massachusetts, gaming revenues grew 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, outperforming the aggregate regional gaming market that grew 8% during the same time frame. Pending regulatory procedures, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. Craig and his team have been a pleasure to work with, and we are pleased to cultivate this new relationship with Wynn Resorts as we expand our universe of net lease investments across many industries. 
Now turning to the results for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.5% occupancy based on property count. Bolstered by the inherent quality of our real estate and enhanced by the proactive efforts of our talented and experienced asset management team, we re-leased 232 leases this quarter, recapturing 101.8% of expiring rent and bringing our full year 2021 recapture rate to 103.4%. 
Since our public listing in 1994, we have executed over 4,100 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry and is a testament to the merit of our asset management team. After closing the VEREIT merger, we look forward with an enhanced key competitive advantage of size and scale. 
With an enterprise value of more than $57 billion, our portfolio now includes over 11,100 properties leased to approximately 1,040 clients in the United States and Europe across a diversified set of 60 distinct industries. Our total portfolio annualized contractual rent increased by over 50% since the end of the third quarter, ending the year at over $2.9 billion. With our expanded size and scale, we have greater client and industry diversification, which further improves our competitive positioning to pursue large portfolio or sale-leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry and be a one-stop solution for multibillion-dollar opportunities. 
Since the end of the third quarter, our top 10 client concentration has decreased to 29.1% from 34.8%, and we believe represents one of the highest quality portfolios in the net lease industry. Additionally, our top industry concentration has decreased, creating additional investment capacity. Our top 5 industries now comprise 40% of our annualized contractual rent compared to over 43% at the end of the third quarter and a top industry exposure, which includes convenience stores and grocery stores have declined meaningfully. 
With the growth in concentration of our targeted industries, theater and health and fitness industry concentrations have naturally declined. In terms of the casual dining contribution from our VEREIT merger, the majority of your concentration is with Red Lobster that has experienced improved operating performance is now owned by Thai Union and established strong financial sponsor. Our international geographic concentration also declined pursuant to our very transaction, providing further room to achieve profitable growth in Europe and beyond. 
We have already started to see the benefits of our expanded platform through increased sourcing and acquisition volume. In 2021, we sourced approximately $84.5 billion of acquisition opportunities and approximately 39% was sourced from international markets. Reflecting our stringent investment criteria, we closed on approximately 8% of the total opportunities, bringing our total 2021 property level acquisitions to $6.4 billion, an annual record for our company. Of the $6.4 billion invested in 2021, over 40% or approximately $2.6 billion was invested during the fourth quarter. 
Over $1 billion of our volume in the fourth quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to nearly $4.3 billion of invested capital at the end of the year. We believe the market is efficient, and we're experiencing a competitive environment for high-quality assets leased to strong operators. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisition is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the fourth quarter of 5.4% and 5.5% for the year. The largest industries represented in our fourth quarter acquisition were European grocery stores and U.S. automotive services, which represent a continued investment in industries well positioned to perform in a variety of economic cycles, given its necessity-based retail proposition for consumers. 
The weighted average remaining lease term of assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 14.2 years. We continue to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 140 basis points during the quarter and 150 basis points during the year, consistent with our historical average, while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace. Inflation has been an important topic to investors in the last few months. I want to emphasize that we believe our business is, by design, well positioned to drive shareholder value in this climate. 
From a balance sheet perspective, having a [ well-staggered ] fixed-rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024, limits our debt refinancing risk in a potentially rising rate environment. And we believe we actually benefit from an inflationary environment given our lease expiration schedule and our proven ability to recapture more than the value of expiring rent upon re-leasing. Finally, the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle, which makes the value proposition of owning realty income comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods, as compared to other sectors in the marketplace whose value is high to growth in future years. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. During the quarter, our capital markets activity was highlighted by the issuance of over $1.7 billion of equity, primarily through our ATM program, which enabled us to simultaneously complete the VEREIT merger and finance a record quarter for acquisitions while finishing the year within our targeted leverage parameters. As we emphasized when we announced the merger in April, we intended to close the transaction in a leverage-neutral manner relative to our target leverage levels, which we are pleased to have accomplished. 
One of the benefits of our enhanced size and scale is daily trading liquidity in our stock that provides us with the ability to issue significant amounts of equity through the ATM in a cost-efficient manner without disrupting the market price of our stock. As a result, we entered 2022 from a position of strength with a net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3x. Subsequent to year-end, we issued $500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28%, with a weighted average term of 12.5 years. 
This was the third sterling-denominated debt offering we have priced in the last 16 months, and we could not be more appreciative of the support we have received from the sterling fixed income investor base. Moving on to the financial results for the quarter. In fourth quarter, our business generated $0.94 of AFFO per share, supported by our healthy portfolio, closing of the VEREIT merger, strong acquisition pace and collection of almost 100% of contractual rent during the fourth quarter. Going forward, we will no longer be providing COVID-19 disclosures as we believe portfolio operating performance has returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of overall collection. 
In 2021, our business generated $3.59 per AFFO per share, finishing near the high end of guidance and representing 5.9% annual growth. Given the health of our portfolio and our active global investment pipeline, we remain comfortable with our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint. Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. 
In December, we were pleased to have increased our dividend by 5.1% as compared to the same period last year. The increase in the dividend was intended to share with our shareholders the accretion from the recently closed VEREIT merger, together with continued earnings accretion that we were able to generate throughout the year from our business. We have now increased the dividend 114x since our 1994 listing and remain proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. Now I would like to hand the call back to Sumit."

We want to try to partner with the best-in-class operators and get the premier assets that they operate. If you look at the Boston Harbor asset, it is the premier superregional asset in the United States. If you look at the coverage, and this is an asset that is still not fully stabilized. It's at 2.1x. If you think about Wynn, they are an S&P 500 company that is arguably the best operator in the space. If you look at regional gaming and compare it to the volatility associated with the strip, it tends to be a lot less volatile. 
And more specifically, if you look at the Massachusetts market, which has grown at almost 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Even compared to the national average on the gaming side, it was almost 2x that. If you look at the actual asset itself and you see what we've paid for the asset and compare it to what was actually invested in the asset -- and these are all public numbers, you'll start to get very comfortable with the fact that we feel very comfortable about what we've paid in terms of replacement cost. And we've been very open with the market with respect to our desire to continue to explore new avenues of growth. 
And this is one that completely fits that profile of trying to partner with the best-in-class operators and trying to add best-in-class real estate to our portfolio. If you look at the lease structure, it's a 30-year lease with growth that is in excess of what we are able to generate on the rest of the portfolio. And those are the reasons why we felt this was the right opportunity for us to sort of enter into the gaming space, with the right operator as a partner and with the right asset."

We would have thought that given the fact that we've been in this expectation of higher inflation, higher interest rate environment that would start to sort of [ circulate ] into the rest of the acquisitions market, we haven't seen that yet. Now history would suggest that cap rates do tend to adjust, especially if some of these increases become more than just an expectation. But at least the current market situation is one where we are not seeing even a stabilization of the cap rate. 
We continue to see downward pressure. And this is where being able to partner and lean on relationships, et cetera, is going to allow us to potentially get that 5, 10, 15 basis points above market. And that is the hope. But I do think that in the next 6 months to 9 months when interest rates do rise, that cap rates will follow suit. This is a phenomenon that we have seen played out in the past, and there is no expectation that it's not going to play out, but we don't see that currently. In terms of what are we underwriting for the rest of the year. Our hope is that it is slightly above where we ended up last year, but we can't guarantee that. 
Our pipeline is incredibly robust with, again, opportunities that we love. And like I said, at least in the current market, we are not seeing cap rates move. The one point I will add, and I think I covered that in my prepared remarks is the fact that we have inherited a team that was very used to focusing on the high yielding side of the market. And that's part of our business. And that particular team has already started to produce results, above and beyond what we were being able to do premerger. And so could we see that help us on being able to achieve slightly higher cap rates? Potentially, but it's still too early to tell. But that is a team that is -- has hit the ground running and is performing as we had expected, and it's great to have them as part of the broader team."

We approach this as a relationship, and we try to address what their pressure points were. We try to understand what causes those pressure points. And therefore, came up with a very bespoke lease that works for our partner at Wynn and works for us. 
With respect to minimum capital requirements, et cetera, we feel like the entire brand of Wynn is associated with their investments in their properties. And you don't have to take my word for it. You just -- you can go and actually visit the property and see for yourself what I mean when I say that. And the fact that we don't have that specifically outlined in the lease is one that we were very comfortable with. Plus there are other protections that supported to us through the gaming licenses that you get in the Massachusetts. 
And so we feel like looking at it holistically, we are very well protected. Partnering with somebody like Wynn who invests in their properties above and beyond what most other operators do plus certain other provisions that we could lean on I think, gave us the comfort and allowed us to partner with them because that was a pressure point for them. So we are very, very comfortable with where we ended up. And we were glad we could do it and structure it so that Craig and his team were very comfortable moving forward."

That is certainly a cost of doing business in Europe and one that we take into account when we are underwriting assets and looking at long-term return profiles of opportunities that we ultimately end up pursuing. And one of the ways we try to protect ourselves is by essentially match funding with local denominated currency these acquisitions, which is why if you look at it, the international portfolio on a stand-alone basis, you will find that we have raised a lot more debt to finance that business while not compromising obviously, on a fully consolidated basis, the overall leverage profile of our business. 
And the interest expense associated with that debt is a natural hedge and a natural protection to minimize the effective tax rate that we end up paying. So that's a very important point in our capital strategy of how we want to continue to grow our European business. Having said that, it is true that the cost of debt in Europe, even in this increasing rate environment, continues to be less than what we can achieve here in the U.S. Today, I would say, if you were to look at a 10-year unsecured, it's probably in the 3.1%, 3.2% ZIP code for us. 
Whereas we can probably get 2.8%, 2.7-ish percent in the U.K. and 1.9%, potentially even slightly less in Mainland Europe in terms of 10-year unsecured bond. So that's what I meant when I said that our cost of capital is very portable and the advantages that accrue to us due to this cost of capital and our ratings essentially, gets inflated when we are able to take advantage of markets such as Mainland Europe and the U.K. So that's the strategy, and that's what we feel most comfortable with."

And it's the last statement that you made, which is how we think about occupancy. We say it's roughly around 98%. Keep in mind, we've also just inherited 3,000 assets through the merger that we have digested and we feel very comfortable saying that it's right around 98%. If you look at where we were last year, you look at the year before that, that tends to be the guidance that we gave to the market. Look, we could flex that number. We could try to have a higher occupancy number, if that was a target for us. 
But what we are trying to balance Caitlin, and I'm just sharing a little bit about how we think about our business, is trying to optimize the economic outcome on each one of these assets that is coming through to us. And we try to figure out whether it makes sense to sell it and maximize our total return profile, even vacant or invest capital and try to capture the rents and create a profile that is superior to selling it vacant or completely repositioned that asset. 
And all of those elements are on the table, and we go through and we try to figure out what is the best outcome. And the reason why we say 98% is because there will be a few assets that we want to hold on to and reposition and/or take the time to find the right tenant so that we maximize the total return profile. And that does sort of put downward pressure on our occupancy number. So when we talk about approximately 98%, it's to give us the flexibility to do what we want to do on the asset management side. 
And you probably have tracked this, you can see that we have, more often than not, beaten that. So it really is more a mindset rather than a very precise point that we are trying to strike with regards to occupancy to give us the flexibility that we need to maximize economic outcome."

So you have those speed bumps, if you will, to sort of make sure that we continue to be a very diversified portfolio. 
Having said that, we just executed on a -- well, it's not closed yet, but we've announced a $1.7 billion transaction. And yet, it's going to represent less than 3.5% of our overall client concentration. So we clearly have more room here, both on the industry side as well as on the specific client side to grow this business. We haven't entered into the gaming industry to basically say this is one transaction and we are done. This does become a new avenue of growth. 
However, we will continue to remain very selective in terms of how we decide to grow this particular area. But those are the metrics that you can look to sort of to help us through the concentrating, both on the industry side as well as on the client side. But we certainly would like to grow this business. And for the right opportunity, we are more than willing to compromise some of these limits that we have in our investment policy. Of course, it will require Board approval, but we've done that in the past. 
If you recall, Walgreens used to be north of 5% at one point. So was 7-Eleven. And post the merger, both of them have dropped below 5% today. But for the right clients and the right opportunity, we are more than happy to make compromises on those limits."

I want to say about 2.5% of our revenues come from ground leases. But let me tell you that when you go into this market today and a particular opportunity is being marketed as a ground lease, i.e., there's a building, but you don't really own the building. If you look at the pricing, the expectation of the seller is that you're paying for both the building as well as the ground because the building is going to come with the ground at the expiration of the lease term. 
And so yes, it's -- you can claim that this is a ground lease that you are purchasing, but the actual proceeds being paid for those opportunities, are essentially a fee simple opportunities. So we don't talk about the fact that a certain portion of our rent concentration comes from ground leases, primarily because we recognize that more often than not, we are paying for the building as well.

Today, if you talk to Craig and his team, they're actually having to pass on some of the patrons given the lack of parking space that is required to accommodate this increase in traffic. So the goal is for them to develop a multistoried aboveground -- potentially even below ground parking that is going to not just be a parking lot, but also it's going to have an entertainment venue of up to 1,000 seats, maybe it's 999 seats. Plus a few other entertainment areas right in that -- in the same building that is going to get constructed across the street. 
And it's going to have an enclosed tunnel, aboveground tunnel pathway that leads right into the casino into the Encore Boston Harbor building from this building.

There's a confidence level, there's a feel for the market. There's a feel for the opportunities that we are seeing. And that is the reason why based on the earnings guidance we came out, the underlying acquisitions guidance was above $5 billion. We don't know what the makeup or the composition of $5 billion worth of transactions are going to look like, some of which could be assets like the gaming asset that we just announced. 
But that's a very big asset. So we feel now even more confident that above $5 billion is very much an achievable number, assuming that we are able to close on this transaction by the fourth quarter. But it is very difficult to say, oh, you should completely exclude this number from the $5 billion or it was inclusive of the entire $1.7 billion, just given the sheer size of this. But what it does allow us to do is stand in front of you today and say with a high level of confidence -- a higher level of confidence that achieving a north of $5 billion number for this year is, in fact, something that we feel very good about. So that's how I would answer that question."

And then maybe thinking bigger picture, you've obviously been in the net lease space for a long period of time. As you look back to other periods of times where you've been in a rising interest rate environment, and you compare it to the kind of current environment we're in, what do you think are kind of the factors, if you will, that will drive cap rates to be more reflective of kind of rising rates? And I guess maybe as you look at kind of the competitive set that you compete with for these net lease investments, how kind of interest rate sensitive maybe are they today versus kind of the competitive set in other periods of time kind of similar to the one we're in today?"

Rising interest rate environment, what happens to cap rates then. And what we found is that there is a positive correlation between rising interest rate environments and cap rates, but there tends to be a bit of a lag. Is it 6 months, 9 months, 12 months? It's somewhere in that ZIP code, but there is. And if you think about it fundamentally, obviously, if cap rates are rising, especially in the private markets that leans on the debt environment a lot more, the cost of that debt is going up. 
And so at some point, there's a mismatch between existing cap rates and the cost of financing that particular opportunity. And so those do tend to sort of balance out and reach an equilibrium point. That's what we've seen in years past. There is one difference in today's environment, and that is that net lease as a product has become much, much more institutional. And we have seen a plethora of capital coming into our space on the equity side, on the sovereign wealth side and, of course, with the preponderance of public net lease companies that have recently come into the fore. 
So I think that wall of capital that is now interested in net lease is going to potentially put a curve on how quickly we get to this equilibrium point going forward. And I think in this sort of environment, once again, the fact that we are an A-, A3-rated company. And yes, our cost of debt will certainly go up and has gone up. But it will tend to go up less than a lot of our competitors who are perhaps not as rated as highly. And also in the private markets, the folks that lean on leverage a lot more and therefore, there -- the impact to their cost of capital will be much higher than the impact to ours, I think is an advantage that should allow us to continue to do transactions that others might have to step away from. 
So even though I believe in today's environment, that the equilibrium point might take a little bit longer to achieve. I believe that some of the advantages that Realty Income as a platform is able to sort of embrace, I do think that, that will play out more in our favor and will allow us to do things that others might not be able to get to as quickly."

And I think I've received questions around, hey, this is a very large transaction, it's $1.7 billion. How are you going to finance it? For us, yes, it's a single transaction, but the size of that transaction is -- it's not unprecedented. We just did $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. And -- just in that quarter, and we're able to match fund our acquisitions by raising our equity, $1.7 billion of equity in the fourth quarter through the ATM. 
And obviously, we did some more debt on the unsecured side post the fourth quarter. So for us, I think, again, one of the big advantages that we have is the liquidity that our stock affords us. We are trading close to $200 million in stock on a daily basis and are able to very easily raise capital to match fund, what might seem nominally as being a very large number we are able to match fund it without this overhang situation. So we -- if it closes in the third quarter or whether it closes in the fourth quarter, it doesn't really matter to us because we'll have a much better feel for it internally. 
And we'll be able to match fund accordingly. So yes, it's a big number on a single asset, but I don't think we see this as necessarily causing any overhang or should not cause any overhang issues for us."

Welcome, everyone. As I reflect on the past year at Realty Income, I remain inspired by the dedication of our colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue numerous profitable growth initiatives while contributing to a record year of acquisitions for our company. 
During the fourth quarter, we closed on the merger with VEREIT, welcoming many talented new colleagues that will further help drive our ambitious goals while amplifying our competitive position in the industry.
We are committed to a seamless and successful transition as we collectively work to integrate our one team, processes and systems. We remain on track to achieve over 75% of our annualized G&A cost synergies in year 1 post merger, as we outlined upon announcing the merger in April of last year. Specifically, we have achieved over $42 million of our $37.5 million targeted synergies in year 1, representing full year 2022, with over $50 million in G&A synergies expected in year 2, representing full year 2023.
Also, I continue to be impressed by the talent and dedication of our new team members as we work to integrate our 2 platforms and further strengthen our one team. And while we creatively bring together the best practices of VEREIT and Realty Income with our integration efforts to productively scale our operations, I'm encouraged by our integration work completed to date and our journey ahead. 
Beyond the merger, our business set a quarterly record for investment volume in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we strengthened our foothold in Spain through additional high-quality acquisitions, including our second acquisition of properties leased to a key partner in Carrefour, one of the world's leading grocery retailers. 
Our strategic expansion into Continental Europe meaningfully increases our total addressable universe, as we estimate the total addressable market in Europe to be $8 trillion, nearly double that of the U.S. We expect our investment activity in Europe to continue contributing to our competitive cost of capital as we look to further hedge our currency risk with debt priced at meaningfully lower yields than in the U.S. 
Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue creating value by capitalizing on our portable competitive advantages globally to deliver favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. With regards to recent developments, as previously disclosed this month, we announced our intent to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor, the East Coast's leading integrated resort and casino located less than 5 miles from downtown Boston. The $1.7 billion acquisition is being consummated at a 5.9% cash cap rate with a 30-year initial lease term.
The property represents our first investment in the gaming industry and would represent less than 3.5% of our pro forma annual rent. While the property type is new, the lens we use to pursue the merits of the transaction is not. Our investment strategy centers around partnership with best-in-class operators occupying high-quality real estate locations, which is particularly important when entering a new business vertical and geography. We followed this strategy with the Diageo sale leaseback in 2010 when executing our first transaction in the Vineyard space, with the Sainsbury's sale leaseback in 2019 when expanding our business internationally. And more recently, with the Carrefour sale leaseback when we entered into Spain last year. 
Our debut transaction in the gaming industry with Wynn Resorts represents the same commitment to partnering with the premier leaders in the respective industries together with a commitment to our overall investment strategy. The Encore Boston Harbor acquisition will add further diversification to our industry and client roster. After closing this transaction, we expect Wynn Resorts will become 1 of our top 10 clients. Our capacity to pursue and absorb a transaction of this size with a single client was supported by the enhanced size and scale that we gained through the VEREIT merger. And it is a testament to our ability to complete large-scale transactions without significantly impacting our prudent portfolio diversification metrics. 
The Encore Boston Harbor transaction meets our key investment criteria and illustrates that our investment opportunity set is not constrained by a particular property type. The merits of this transaction are first, the real estate. We're acquiring 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate strategically located on the banks of the Mystic River. After opening in 2019, the property is still ramping but already generates $210 million in annual EBITDAR, resulting in 2.1x rent coverage initially. 
Second, the client lease. We are entering into a 30-year triple net lease with attractive annual rent escalators at 1.75% annually for the first 10 years and the greater of 1.75% or CPI thereafter capped at 2.5%. Wynn Resorts is one of the largest premier gaming operators in the U.S. with an enterprise value of approximately $20 billion. They maintain a healthy balance sheet, moderate leverage and significant liquidity.
Third, the industry performance. The gaming industry in the U.S. has recovered to pre-COVID levels. And in Massachusetts, gaming revenues grew 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, outperforming the aggregate regional gaming market that grew 8% during the same time frame. Pending regulatory procedures, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. Craig and his team have been a pleasure to work with, and we are pleased to cultivate this new relationship with Wynn Resorts as we expand our universe of net lease investments across many industries.
Now turning to the results for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.5% occupancy based on property count. Bolstered by the inherent quality of our real estate and enhanced by the proactive efforts of our talented and experienced asset management team, we re-leased 232 leases this quarter, recapturing 101.8% of expiring rent and bringing our full year 2021 recapture rate to 103.4%. 
Since our public listing in 1994, we have executed over 4,100 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry and is a testament to the merit of our asset management team. 
After closing the VEREIT merger, we look forward with an enhanced key competitive advantage of size and scale. With an enterprise value of more than $57 billion, our portfolio now includes over 11,100 properties leased to approximately 1,040 clients in the United States and Europe across a diversified set of 60 distinct industries. 
Our total portfolio annualized contractual rent increased by over 50% since the end of the third quarter, ending the year at over $2.9 billion. With our expanded size and scale, we have greater client and industry diversification, which further improves our competitive positioning to pursue large portfolio or sale-leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry and be a one-stop solution for multibillion-dollar opportunities.
Since the end of the third quarter, our top 10 client concentration has decreased to 29.1% from 34.8%, and we believe it represents one of the highest quality portfolios in the net lease industry. Additionally, our top industry concentration has decreased, creating additional investment capacity. Our top 5 industries now comprise 40% of our annualized contractual rent compared to over 43% at the end of the third quarter and a top industry exposure, which includes convenience stores and grocery stores have declined meaningfully.
With the growth in concentration of our targeted industries, theater and health and fitness industry concentrations have naturally declined. In terms of the casual dining contribution from our VEREIT merger, the majority of their concentration is with Red Lobster that has experienced improved operating performance is now owned by Thai Union an established strong financial sponsor. 
Our international geographic concentration also declined pursuant to our VEREIT transaction, providing further room to achieve profitable growth in Europe and beyond.
We have already started to see the benefits of our expanded platform through increased sourcing and acquisition volume. In 2021, we sourced approximately $84.5 billion of acquisition opportunities and approximately 39% was sourced from international markets. Reflecting our stringent investment criteria, we closed on approximately 8% of the total opportunities, bringing our total 2021 property level acquisitions to $6.4 billion, an annual record for our company. Of the $6.4 billion invested in 2021, over 40% or approximately $2.6 billion was invested during the fourth quarter.
Over $1 billion of our volume in the fourth quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to nearly $4.3 billion of invested capital at the end of the year. We believe the market is efficient, and we're experiencing a competitive environment for high-quality assets leased to strong operators. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisition is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the fourth quarter of 5.4% and 5.5% for the year. 
The largest industries represented in our fourth quarter acquisition were European grocery stores and U.S. automotive services, which represent a continued investment in industries well positioned to perform in a variety of economic cycles, given its necessity-based retail proposition for consumers.
The weighted average remaining lease term of assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 14.2 years. We continue to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 140 basis points during the quarter and 150 basis points during the year, consistent with our historical average, while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace. 
Inflation has been an important topic to investors in the last few months. I want to emphasize that we believe our business is, by design, well positioned to drive shareholder value in this climate. 
From a balance sheet perspective, having a well-staggered fixed-rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024, limits our debt refinancing risk in a potentially rising rate environment. And we believe we actually benefit from an inflationary environment given our lease expiration schedule and our proven ability to recapture more than the value of expiring rent upon re-leasing. 
Finally, the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle, which makes the value proposition of owning realty income comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods, as compared to other sectors in the marketplace whose value is [ high to ]  growth in future years. 
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. 
During the quarter, our capital markets activity was highlighted by the issuance of over $1.7 billion of equity, primarily through our ATM program, which enabled us to simultaneously complete the VEREIT merger and finance a record quarter for acquisitions while finishing the year within our targeted leverage parameters. As we emphasized when we announced the merger in April, we intended to close the transaction in a leverage-neutral manner relative to our target leverage level, which we are pleased to have accomplished.
One of the benefits of our enhanced size and scale is daily trading liquidity in our stock that provides us with the ability to issue significant amounts of equity through the ATM in a cost-efficient manner without disrupting the market price of our stock. 
As a result, we entered 2022 from a position of strength with a net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3x. Subsequent to year-end, we issued [ $500 million ] in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28%, with a weighted average term of 12.5 years. 
This was the third sterling-denominated debt offering we have priced in the last 16 months, and we could not be more appreciative of the support we have received from the Sterling fixed income investor base. 
Moving on to the financial results for the quarter. In fourth quarter, our business generated $0.94 of AFFO per share, supported by our healthy portfolio, closing of the VEREIT merger, strong acquisition pace and collection of almost 100% of contractual rent during the fourth quarter. Going forward, we will no longer be providing COVID-19 disclosures as we believe portfolio operating performance has returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of overall collection.
In 2021, our business generated $3.59 of AFFO per share, finishing near the high end of guidance and representing 5.9% annual growth. Given the health of our portfolio and our active global investment pipeline, we remain comfortable with our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint. 
Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In December, we were pleased to have increased our dividend by 5.1% as compared to the same period last year. The increase in the dividend was intended to share with our shareholders, the accretion from the recently closed VEREIT merger, together with continued earnings accretion that we were able to generate throughout the year from our business. 
We have now increased the dividend 114x since our 1994 listing and remain proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. 
Now I would like to hand the call back to Sumit."

We want to try to partner with the best-in-class operators and get the premier assets that they operate. If you look at the Boston Harbor asset, it is the premier superregional asset in the United States. If you look at the coverage, and this is an asset that is still not fully stabilized. It's at 2.1x. If you think about Wynn, they are an S&P 500 company that is arguably the best operator in the space. If you look at regional gaming and compare it to the volatility associated with the strip, it tends to be a lot less volatile.
And more specifically, if you look at the Massachusetts market, which has grown at almost 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Even compared to the national average on the gaming side, it was almost 2x that. 
If you look at the actual asset itself and you see what we've paid for the asset and compare it to what was actually invested in the asset, and these are all public numbers, you'll start to get very comfortable with the fact that we feel very comfortable about what we've paid in terms of replacement cost. 
And we've been very open with the market with respect to our desire to continue to explore new avenues of growth and this is one that completely fits that profile of trying to partner with the best-in-class operators and trying to add best-in-class real estate to our portfolio. 
If you look at the lease structure, it's a 30-year lease with growth that is in excess of what we are able to generate on the rest of the portfolio. And those are the reasons why we felt this was the right opportunity for us to sort of enter into the gaming space, with the right operator as a partner and with the right asset."

We continue to see a very aggressive cap rate market, especially for the type of products that we are pursuing. We would have thought that given the fact that we've been in this -- expectation of higher inflation, higher interest rate environment that would start to sort of percolate into the rest of the acquisitions market, we haven't seen that yet. 
Now history would suggest that cap rates do tend to adjust, especially if some of these increases become more than just an expectation. But at least the current market situation is one where we are not seeing even a stabilization of the cap rate, we continue to see downward pressure. 
And this is where being able to partner and lean on relationships, et cetera, is going to allow us to potentially get that 5, 10, 15 basis points above market. And that is the hope. But I do think that in the next 6 months to 9 months when interest rates do rise, that cap rates will follow suit. This is a phenomenon that we have seen played out in the past, and there is no expectation that it's not going to play out, but we don't see that currently. 
In terms of what are we underwriting for the rest of the year? Our hope is that it is slightly above where we ended up last year, but we can't guarantee that. Our pipeline is incredibly robust with, again, opportunities that we love.  And like I said, at least in the current market, we are not seeing cap rates move. 
The one point I will add, and I think I covered that in my prepared remarks is the fact that we have inherited a team that was very used to focusing on the higher yielding side of the market. And that's part of our business. And that particular team has already started to produce results, above and beyond what we were being able to do premerger. And so could we see that help us on being able to achieve slightly higher cap rates? Potentially, but it's still too early to tell. But that is a team that is -- has hit the ground running and is performing as we had expected, and it's great to have them as part of the broader team."

The fact that we partnered with Wynn and to work with Craig and his team, that tool allowed us to continue to refine our thesis around the risks associated with this business. And we are very comfortable that we have underwritten this particular opportunity appropriately. And we have leaned on experts where needed and also obviously leaned a lot on our own research department that continues to be the best-in-class in my opinion, across the street.

We approach this as a relationship, and we try to address what their pressure points were. We try to understand what causes those pressure points. And therefore, came up with a very bespoke lease that works for our partner at Wynn and works for us. 
With respect to minimum capital requirements, et cetera, we feel like the entire brand of Wynn is associated with their investments in their properties. And you don't have to take my words for it. You just -- you can go and actually visit the property and see for yourself what I mean when I say that. And the fact that we don't have that specifically outlined in the lease is one that we were very comfortable with. Plus there are other protections that supported to us through the gaming licenses that you get in the Massachusetts.
And so we feel like looking at it holistically, we are very well protected. Partnering with somebody like Wynn who invests in their properties above and beyond what most other operators do plus certain other provisions that we could lean on I think, gave us the comfort and allowed us to partner with them because that was a pressure point for them. So we are very, very comfortable with where we ended up. And we were glad we could do it and structure it so that Craig and his team were very comfortable moving forward."

And one of the ways we try",297,"Yes, Caitlin. That is certainly a cost of doing business in Europe and one that we take into account when we are underwriting assets and looking at long-term return profiles of opportunities that we ultimately end up pursuing. 
And one of the ways we try to protect ourselves is by essentially match funding with local denominated currency these acquisitions, which is why if you look at it, the international portfolio on a stand-alone basis, you will find that we have raised a lot more debt to finance that business while not compromising obviously, on a fully consolidated basis, the overall leverage profile of our business.
And the interest expense associated with that debt is a natural hedge and a natural protection to minimize the effective tax rate that we end up paying. So that's a very important point in our capital strategy of how we want to continue to grow our European business. 
Having said that, it is true that the cost of debt in Europe, even in this increasing rate environment, continues to be less than what we can achieve here in the U.S. Today, I would say, if you were to look at a 10-year unsecured, it's probably in the 3.1%, 3.2% ZIP code for us. Whereas we can probably get 2.8%, 2.7-ish percent in the U.K. and 1.9%, potentially even slightly less in Mainland Europe in terms of 10-year unsecured bond. So that's what I meant when I said that our cost of capital is very portable and the advantages that accrue to us due to this cost of capital and our ratings essentially, gets inflated when we are able to take advantage of markets such as Mainland Europe and the U.K. So that's the strategy, and that's what we feel most comfortable with."

Keep in mind, we've also just inherited 3,000 assets through the merger that we have digested and we feel very comfortable saying that it's right around 98%. 
If you look at where we were last year, you look at the year before that, that tends to be the guidance that we gave to the market. Look, we could flex that number. We could try to have a higher occupancy number, if that was a target for us. But what we are trying to balance Caitlin, and I'm just sharing a little bit about how we think about our business, is trying to optimize the economic outcome on each one of these assets that is coming through to us. And we try to figure out whether it makes sense to sell it and maximize our total return profile, even vacant or invest capital and try to capture the rents and create a profile that is superior to selling it vacant or completely repositioned that asset.
And all of those elements are on the table, and we go through and we try to figure out what is the best outcome. And the reason why we say 98% is because there will be a few assets that we want to hold on to and reposition and/or take the time to find the right tenant so that we maximize the total return profile. And that does sort of put downward pressure on our occupancy number. So when we talk about approximately 98%, it's to give us the flexibility to do what we want to do on the asset management side. 
And you probably have tracked this, you can see that we have, more often they've not beaten that. So it really is more a mindset rather than a very precise point that we are trying to strike with regards to occupancy is to give us this flexibility that we need to maximize economic outcome."

Having said that, we just executed on a -- well, it's not closed yet, but we've announced a $1.7 billion transaction. And yet, it's going to represent less than 3.5% of our overall client concentration. So we clearly have more room here, both on the industry side as well as on the specific client side to grow this business. We haven't entered into the gaming industry to basically say this is one transaction and we are done. This does become a new avenue of growth. 
However, we will continue to remain very selective in terms of how we decide to grow this particular area. But those are the metrics that you can look to sort of to help us through the concentrating, both on the industry side as well as on the client side.

Part of it obviously came through the VEREIT merger, but also organically in order to continue to pursue and expand the avenues of growth, we have rightsized the team both on the research side, on the acquisition side, on the asset management side, on the property management side, et cetera, et cetera.

And so part of how we think about looking at new opportunities, new verticals, is to see the profile of the existing leases that are percolating in the market within those spaces. And that is certainly an element that we take into consideration before deciding to pursue routes."

So there is a parking lot that is across the street from where the main building is located. Today, if you talk to Craig and his team, they're actually having to pass on some of the patrons given the lack of parking space that is required to accommodate this increase in traffic. So the goal is for them to develop a multistoried aboveground, potentially even below ground parking that is going to not just be a parking lot, but also it's going to have an entertainment venue of up to 1,000 seats, maybe it's 999 seats. Plus a few other entertainment areas right in that -- in the same building that is going to get constructed across the street.
And it's going to have an enclosed tunnel, aboveground tunnel pathway that leads right into the casino into the Encore Boston Harbor building from this building. And so the expectation is that this is going to get built over the next couple of years and will actually add to the overall performance of the building. 
And clearly, this is a very symbiotic relationship between this parking lot, this enclosed pathway that's going to connect the 2 buildings. And so we -- they have the ability -- once constructed, and there's a 6-year time frame within which they have to do this, which gives them plenty of time to be able to consummate their current plans. We will buy this building at a 7% yield. And obviously, this should translate into even better coverages than we currently have at the particular building.

There's a confidence level, there's a feel for the market. There's a feel for the opportunities that we are seeing. And that is the reason why based on the earnings guidance that came out, the underlying acquisitions guidance was above $5 billion. We don't know what the makeup or the composition of $5 billion worth of transactions are going to look like, some of which could be assets like the gaming asset that we just announced. But that's a very big asset. 
So we feel now even more confident that above $5 billion is very much an achievable number, assuming that we are able to close on this transaction by the fourth quarter. But it is very difficult to say, oh, you should completely exclude this number from the $5 billion or it was inclusive of the entire $1.7 billion, just given the sheer size of this. But what it does allow us to do is stand in front of you today and say with a high level of confidence -- a higher level of confidence that achieving a north of $5 billion number for this year is, in fact, something that we feel very good about. So that's how I would answer that question."

And I guess maybe as you look at kind of the competitive set that you compete with for these net lease investments, how kind of interest rate sensitive maybe are they today versus kind of the competitive set in other periods of time kind of similar to the one we're in today?"

Rising interest rate environments, what happens to cap rates then. And what we found is that there is a positive correlation between rising interest rate environments and cap rates, but there tends to be a bit of a lag now. Is it 6 months, 9 months, 12 months? It's somewhere in that ZIP code, but there is. And if you think about it fundamentally, obviously, if cap rates are rising, especially in the private markets that leans on the debt environment a lot more, the cost of that debt is going up. 
And so at some point, there's a mismatch between existing cap rates and the cost of financing that particular opportunity. And so those do tend to sort of balance out and reach an equilibrium point. That's what we've seen in years past. 
There is one difference in today's environment, and that is that net lease as a product has become much, much more institutional. And we have seen a plethora of capital coming into our space on the private equity side, on the sovereign wealth side and, of course, with the preponderance of public net lease companies that have recently come into the floor. 
So I think that wall of capital that is now interested in net lease is going to potentially put a curve on how quickly we get to this equilibrium point going forward. And I think in this sort of environment, once again, the fact that we are an A-, A3-rated company. And yes, our cost of debt will certainly go up and has gone up. But it will tend to go up less than a lot of our competitors who are perhaps not as rated as highly. And also in the private markets, the folks that lean on leverage a lot more and therefore, there -- the impact to their cost of capital will be much higher than the impact to ours, I think is an advantage that should allow us to continue to do transactions that others might have to step away from.
So even though I believe in today's environment, that the equilibrium point might take a little bit longer to achieve. I believe that some of the advantages that Realty Income as a platform is able to sort of embrace. I do think that, that will play out more in our favor and will allow us to do things that others might not be able to get to as quickly."

For us, yes, it's a single transaction, but that the size of that transaction is -- it's not unprecedented. We just did $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. And -- just in that quarter, and we're able to match fund our acquisitions by raising our equity, $1.7 billion of equity in the fourth quarter through the ATM. 
And obviously, we did some more debt on the unsecured side post the fourth quarter. So for us, I think, again, one of the big advantages that we have is the liquidity that our stock affords us. We are trading close to $200 million in stock on a daily basis and are able to very easily raise capital to match fund, what might seem nominally as being a very large number, we are able to match fund it without this overhang situation. So we -- if it closes in the third quarter or whether it closes in the fourth quarter, it doesn't really matter to us because we'll have a much better feel for it internally. 
And we'll be able to match fund accordingly. So yes, it's a big number on a single asset, but I don't think we see this as necessarily causing any overhang or should not cause any overhang issues for us."

I want to express my deep appreciation of our One Team whose dedication and collaboration showcased the strength of our team through",1190,"Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. 2022 is off to a strong start, and we are continuing to build momentum in our business. I want to express my deep appreciation of our One Team whose dedication and collaboration showcased the strength of our team through a timely closing of the first quarter while integrating new processes and systems following the close of the VEREIT merger last November. 
All integration efforts are progressing, and we remain committed to delivering continued scalability. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives and partnerships with our clients. In April, we published our second annual sustainability report, which details our commitments, goals and progress on our ESG efforts. I welcome all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to build sustainable relationships for the benefit of those we serve and encourage everyone listening to read through our 2021 sustainability report, which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility page of our website. 
Looking at macro trends. Inflation persists as an important topic on the minds of many stakeholders, and I want to emphasize that we believe our business is, by design, well positioned to drive value in this climate. Our business model is one that generates significant recurring revenue that flows through to the bottom line. As a triple net lease REIT, our business is insulated from inflation. Our clients are responsible for covering taxes, insurance and other operating expenses. And as prices increase, many of our clients pass the incremental cost burden on to their consumers or suppliers. 
The efficiency of our model is reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margin, which is routinely around 94%. Maintaining a conservative capital structure has been a key tenet of our business since our founding, and having a well-staggered fixed-rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024 limits our debt refinancing risk in a rising rate environment. 
In summary, we believe the appeal of our consistent and predictable stream of cash flows is amplified during periods of volatility like we find ourselves in today. To that end, we look at the last period in which the Federal Reserve increased interest rates from December 2015 through 2018 as a helpful case study. 
During this period, Realty Income's total return outperformed the S&P 500 and the MSCI U.S. REIT Index both in year 1 of the rate hike cycle and throughout the 3-year duration of that cycle. And during the Great Recession, Realty Income exhibited less operational and financial volatility as compared to many other S&P 500 REITs that carry A credit ratings. 
From an organic growth standpoint, our asset management team continues to report impressive recapture rates. This quarter, we recaptured over 106% of rental revenue on expiring leases. Given our lease expiration schedule and proven rent recapture track record, we believe we are well positioned to manage through an inflationary environment. 
Through 2024, nearly 12% of our portfolio annualized contractual rent is set to expire. And in this regard, inflation could serve as a tailwind to our business as rents and costs to build rise. 
On the acquisition front, our transaction flow remains strong. Certain categories of the market has seen discernible increase in cap rates, which we believe should accrue to our advantage as a net acquirer. Historically, we have observed that when interest rates increase, cap rates are just following a lag period of 6 to 12 months. Much of this cap rate expansion can be attributed to levered buyers who have relied upon record low debt pricing to underwrite their returns. Given the current yield environment, we are in a comparatively strong position given our financing strategy. And as such, we would expect our competitive standing to strengthen further. 
Now turning to the results for the quarter. Our size and scale, in conjunction with strong relationships we have across the marketplace, continue to provide benefits through robust sourcing and acquisition volumes. This quarter, we sourced over $34 billion of acquisition opportunities, and approximately 40% of this amount was sourced from international markets. 
Our total property level acquisitions for the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion. Approximately half of our volume in the first quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to approximately $5 billion of invested capital. 
As we announced in February, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor Resort and Casino lease to Wynn Resorts under a 30-year triple net lease with favorable annual rent increases. The $1.7 billion transaction includes more than 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate less than 5 miles from Downtown Boston. Pending regulatory procedures, we continue to anticipate this transaction closing during the fourth quarter of 2022. 
We believe the market is efficient. And while cap rates have stabilized, significant competition remains with the high-quality assets we pursue. Our average initial cash cap rate for the quarter was 5.6%, which reflects the quality of locations and clients we are adding to our portfolio. 
As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. 
We estimate the difference between cash and straight line cap rates to be approximately an additional 70 basis points in the first quarter. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.3 years, and the top industry invested during the quarter was grocery stores. We continue to have access to attractively priced capital, which has allowed us to maintain healthy spreads on our investments even as interest rates rise. 
We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.6% occupancy based on property count. The weighted average remaining lease term of our overall portfolio is approximately 8.9 years, which, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we see as an advantage. 
As leases roll, we continue to favorably recapture rent as a result of diligent underwriting and the inherent quality of our real estate enhanced by the proactive efforts of our experienced asset management team. This quarter, we re-leased 119 leases, recapturing 106.2% of expiring rent. And since our public listing in 1994, we have executed 4,260 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 101% of rent on those re-leased contracts. 
We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates because we believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. During the quarter, we sold 34 properties, generating net proceeds of approximately $122 million. Approximately 84% of the sales volume during the quarter related to former VEREIT properties that were sold rated. And our portfolio delivered healthy same-store rent growth increasing 4.1% during the quarter. This was largely attributed to the reversal of $9.4 million of rental revenue reserves during the quarter within the same store pool compared to a reserve of $8 million recognized for the same pool during the year ago period. 
Excluding the impact of reserves in both periods, we estimate that our same-store rent growth would have been approximately 1.2%. 
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

During the first quarter, our business generated AFFO per share of $0.98, supported by a strong acquisition pace and a healthy portfolio. 
As Sumit mentioned, during the quarter, we recognized a $9.4 million reversal of non-straight-line rental revenue reserves. This was primarily driven by the $7.7 million reversal of our outstanding reserves related to AMC, reflecting the recovery from the pandemic. 
Given the performance of our One Team, the health of our portfolio and progress achieved during the first quarter of 2022, we reaffirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint. 
From a leverage standpoint, we ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.4x in line with our target leverage ratios. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal with a well-staggered predominantly fixed rate debt maturity schedule and no corporate bond maturities until 2024. As Sumit mentioned in his opening remarks, our modest debt maturity schedule through the end of next year limits our refinancing risk in a raising rate environment. 
Our size and scale provide us access to attractively price debt across several markets. For example, in January, we issued GBP 500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28% with a weighted average term of 12.5 years. During the quarter, we issued over $660 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. And subsequent to the quarter end, we entered into a definitive agreement for the private placement of a GBP 600 million sterling-denominated offering of senior unsecured notes, pricing 8-year, 10-year and 15-year notes at a weighted average fixed rate of 3.22% with a weighted average tenor of approximately 10.5 years. We greatly appreciate the support from the investors who have participated in our capital markets transactions. 
Finally, just last week, we announced the recast and upsizing of our credit facility, which now includes a $4.25 billion multicurrency revolving line of credit with an initial maturity in June 2026 and 2 6-month extension options as well as a $1 billion accordion feature. At our current credit rating, the new revolving line of credit provides a borrowing rate of adjusted SOFR plus 72.5 basis points as compared to our previous credit facility of LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points. 
In total, 25 lenders participated in our recast, and we greatly appreciate the support of our relationship banks, many of whom have supported us for decades and have been integral towards our growth. 
We've been most active during the last 12 months within corporate finance and capital markets. I'd like to make special mention of [ Jonathan Pong ] and his team who have worked tirelessly to bring our corporate financing strategies and capital markets execution together with our partners to fruition on behalf of all whom we serve. 
Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In March, we celebrated the payment of our 620th monthly dividend by virtually bringing the New York Stock Exchange closing bell. 
At Realty Income, the dividend is sacrosanct, and we are proud to be one of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. And the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle. As a result, the value proposition of owning Realty Income is comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods versus those whose value is tied to growth in future years. 
And now I would like to pass the call back to Sumit."

We are also starting to see on the retail side some of the transactions that were struck again in the fourth quarter of last year with potential levered buyers coming back. And certainty of close is taking on paramount importance with regards to the sellers, and they're coming back at slightly higher cap rates. We see this more on the larger dollar retail acquisition opportunities, not so much on the QSR and smaller opportunities. But we are starting to see movement higher on the retail side, but it is not as dominant and it's not as widespread as we see it on the industrial side."

A lot of it is organic. This is becoming part of their balance sheet management strategy going forward. And some of these are much larger than what we have typically seen in years past.

So Nick, if you recall, when we first came out with our guidance, this was in late October, I think, of last year, which was very unusual for us, and a lot of what was driving that thinking then was making sure that people were able to underwrite what this merger was going to mean for the pro forma company. And we had come out with a number of $5 billion -- approximately $5 billion. We haven't changed that. And like you've said, we've obviously made the announcement subsequent to that initial guidance of a $1.7 billion transaction. And what I can share with you, Nick, is not all of that $1.7 billion was contemplated when we had first come out with the $5 billion. In fact, we weren't even sure we had a deal at that time. 
So could that $5 billion go up? Yes. But what I -- what keeps us a little bit on the sidelines is this continued volatility that we are seeing on the capital markets side. And from a pure sourcing perspective, as you can see from the numbers that we've posted, from a -- the next 4- to 5-month pipeline perspective, I can continue to share with you that the momentum is there. It is incredibly positive. And what sort of keeps us sort of hedging is what's going to happen in the last 4 to 5 months if this continued volatility remains. 
We are very comfortable with the $5 billion number, and it's actually, we say, above $5 billion. And I think we can also go so far as to say that not all of that $1.7 billion, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, was contemplated when we came out with the numbers that we did."

Look, I think by design, we had chosen to enter into Western Europe. And we, by design, chose the U.K. primarily because of the ease of affordability of our cost of capital and processes and tax regime, et cetera, et cetera. 
You're absolutely right that we have chosen to continue to work with some very large operators, and that investment pipeline has continued to be a major source of our growth of what is today a $5 billion portfolio. The good news here is the operators that we are partnering with, they are very, very large. And so there is a tremendous amount of runway for us to continue to do the consolidation. 
I think there was an element of your question that also touched on, given what is happening in Eastern Europe, how are we impacted? How are our operators impacted? What I can share with you is, as of right now, all of the operators that we have done business with in Europe, none of them have operations today. None of them have operations in Russia, Ukraine or any of the adjacent countries that are potentially being impacted by what's playing out in Eastern Europe. The only operator ironically that does have some element of exposure to Russia is actually Couche-Tard that has about 36 assets, which is less than 1% of their overall footprint -- global footprint that is based in Russia. And outside of that, none of our operators today have operations in either of those impacted countries. 
So we have a tremendous amount of pipeline. We have a fair amount of runway to not only continue to grow with the operators that we've established, but also as we branch out into new countries with other dominant operators in those countries, and some of which, as you can tell, Carrefour was a brand new name for us, and we did the sale-leaseback in Spain. We have continued to grow that name. 
And as we continue to add more and more countries, and even within countries, as we get more comfortable with the landscape and operators, you'll start to see a few other very large names get added to our client registry. So, so far, so good. And by design, we've stayed on the western side of Europe. And those businesses continue to do well."

There is about 156 assets that are vacant in our portfolio close to 11,500 assets. So it's not significant, as you can tell, which is clearly why we have 98.6% occupancy. Look, for us, it is -- this quarter happened to be one where of all the assets sold, about 97%, 98% -- I believe it was $118 million, $119 million of the $122 million were vacant asset sales. And even that number was largely dominated by 2 industrial assets that we sold vacant where we were able to strike very good total return profiles. 
This is going to continue to ebb and flow. There'll be quarters where we have some occupied assets that we have opportunistically decided to sell. And clearly, selling vacant assets is very much part and parcel of our business. And when we do sell vacant assets, we give you a total return profile on what is the unlevered return that we were able to achieve, which this first quarter was north of 9% on an unlevered basis. So these are assets that we may have held for 10, 12, 15 years, have generated a fair amount of cash flow. And even when sold vacant, especially in inflationary environments, it allows us to create and capture the kind of returns that we are posting. 
But the point I want to make and I want to leave with you, Haendel, is selling vacant assets is absolutely part of our business. We go through an asset management analysis where we try to figure out what is the most economic -- what is the most positive outcome in terms of the economics of selling the asset, re-leasing the asset, repositioning the asset or entering into a negotiation with the existing client. And once we sort of go through that, we make the determination to go down one of these paths. And that's what drives our thinking in terms of how we decide whether to sell vacant assets or occupied assets. And that will continue to be the mantra that dictates our asset management strategy going forward."

Because, yes, if what we have experienced in the market more recently sort of creates this disconnect between private market valuations and public market valuations, and obviously, selling assets becomes very much part and parcel of our strategy. 
Truth be told, Haendel, we've never, outside of those very small pockets of time, i.e., when the pandemic first started, where we had a few weeks where there was a dislocation. For a sustained period, we've never encountered a scenario where asset prices were being valued in the private market higher than what our public market valuation indicated. But if that were to play out, hypothetically speaking, we would not be averse to raising capital, if needed, through asset sales. 
This is, again, I think, will accrue to our benefit given the quality of assets that we have being able to assemble especially over the last 10 years, and more specifically, over the last 3 to 4 years. So that continues to remain a strategy but one that we hope doesn't play out because I think the only scenario where I can see that happening is a macro environment where things are incredibly uncertain. And I hope that, that doesn't play out that way. But look, it's absolutely a theoretical strategy that we can lean on if needed."

Look, it is certainly a story that is playing out very differently for those that are well-capitalized businesses versus those that tend to be smaller operators in this high inflationary environment. We had [ Neil's ] team, the research team, do an analysis on our top 150 clients. And they represent about 85% of our rent. And we were like very focused on what is going to happen to their balance sheet, their ability to pay in the event that interest rates were to rise 300 basis points from where it is currently. And, this is a big and, they didn't have the ability to pass through any of those increased costs that they were bearing on to their customers, which is a highly unlikely scenario, but we were trying to figure out what would happen in that particular scenario for us. And it was 11 of these operators of the 150 representing less than 5% of our rent where the coverages fell below 1x. 
So we feel like -- again, by design, we've created a client registry that's predominantly made up of very well capitalized operators. But those one-off operators -- and Caitlin, and you're right, we have 1,000 different clients. So we certainly have a few one-off operators that tend to be smaller operators. It is going to be more difficult for them to be able to absorb this and their inability to pass through their costs. But we've had a few general merchandising stores. We've had a few folks who are going to -- who have actually talked about increasing EBIT margins because of their ability to pass through a lot of the costs. And predominantly, our client registries made up of those types of folks. 
So yes, hypothetically, Caitlin, the smaller operators will suffer in this environment and may not make it. But thankfully, we don't have too much exposure to that, and it is very small in terms of percentage of our overall rent."

We did the first sale-leaseback with Dollar General. This was, I believe, in 2015, 2016 time frame, and it was maybe $130 million, $140 million sale-leaseback. We subsequently continued to grow our opportunity with Dollar General through multiple sale-leasebacks. It's a similar story with 7-Eleven. A lot of these clients that you see in our top 20 have grown over multiple years, and they continue to have ambitious growth profile. So that channel of growth remains for us. 
Then we also have the ability to do first-time sale-leasebacks in a large way with clients like Wynn. These are asset classes that tend to be very large. But again, given that we are about a $57 billion, $58 billion company today, it is going to register as a 3.5% client. 
And clearly, we have said this very openly that in the event, Wynn decides to continue to execute and grow their footprint beyond the 2 locations that they currently have, we would love to continue to partner with them. And so this is a function of being able to do first-time sale-leasebacks in a big way. And now that we are of the size that we are, our ability to absorb those -- and when I say big, I mean $1 billion sale-leasebacks, even multiple billion-dollar sale-leasebacks.

I wish our business was a spigot where you could switch it off and turn it back on at a moment's notice. Unfortunately, our business doesn't work quite like that. When you think about how we source opportunities and how we create a pipeline of opportunities and what is the timing that it takes from making a decision to pursuing a particular transaction and then closing it, it could take anywhere between 4 to 6 months from start to finish. So unless you have a crystal ball, it is very, very difficult to be able to sort of do exactly what you suggested, which would have been perfect, if we could. 
The other thing I would tell you is there's a lag even in our cost of capital. When you have volatile situations like this, but you're seeing opportunities that seem very well priced on a pure real estate underwriting in terms of replacement costs, in terms of price per pound, and you think about the leases that we are able to capture with the clients that are engaging in these types of transactions, you obviously built into your underwriting a particular buffer. And hopefully, we've been conservative enough where we are still being able to capture positive healthy spreads to our cost of capital while continuing to enhance the -- our basic AFFO per share growth as well as our client registry with new relationships. So it's very difficult. We had a different mindset over the next 6 to 9 months, which said, hey, the world is going to fall apart. We absolutely will pull in our horns just like we did in that very first quarter right after the -- it was actually the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic hit where we slowed down our ability to sort of continue looking at transactions, and truth be told, even the market there, the transaction market sort of went silent for a bit, just because people are very unsure of how things are going to play out. But that I've already shared with you is not the case. 
Sourcing remains very healthy. And we feel like even with the appropriate flexing of our own cost of capital, we are able to grow our business in a manner that is very much aligned with our acquisition strategy. But Josh, I'll be very honest, if our views change, we will stop continuing to build the pipeline. But that is not the case right now."

And if you look at our lease maturity schedule -- and I think I said this during my prepared remarks, that 12% of our leases are going to renew over the next 2.5 years. And so it does -- if we can keep this momentum, I don't know if it will be 106%, but the other thing I would say about that 106% is it's effectively net increases. And so if we can keep it in that ZIP code, that will become a major growth driver for our business, and it will become an internal growth driver of our business, especially if we continue down this highly inflationary environment. 
The other good news is if you think about our international expansion, a lot of those leases tend to be CPI-adjusted leases. And they don't tend to have this collar -- a ceiling and a floor that we experience here, but it's a relative comment. I would say the vast majority of CPI leases that we have here in the U.S. tend to have a collar. And I would say maybe 1/3 to even 40% of the leases in the international markets tend to be -- basically do not have a collar around it, and they are very much tied to CPI growth. 
And so I think all of that will start to percolate through our portfolio and will help us drive more internal growth than what we have historically experienced in our business. And we think of this as an opportunity, and we've been talking about asset management now for about 5 years, 6 years in anticipation of what we are now starting to experience as a company. 
And so look, we think we are very positively set up to take advantage of this situation. And it then helps us alleviate some of the pressure of just growing through external measures, which, of course, is also something that the team is doing very well."

We are also very encouraged by the pipeline of [indiscernible] movies that are going to be released over the next 2 to 3 months. We are very hopeful that, that will translate to more attendance.

Having said all of that, we also did a fair amount of downside scenario analysis where we looked at some of these locations, and we feel like we have the ability, the capital, the relationships to reposition these assets in the event that the business doesn't play out. 
I think the wrong economic decision today would be to sell some of these assets at what I would consider to be [ fire sale ] prices. And again, just to remind everyone, 82% of our portfolio is in the top 2 quartiles of performance for both these operators.

Welcome, everyone. 2022 is off to a strong start, and we are continuing to build momentum in our business. I want to express my deep appreciation of our One Team whose dedication and collaboration showcased the strength of our team through a timely closing of the first quarter while integrating new processes and systems following the close of the VEREIT merger last November.  
All integration efforts are progressing, and we remain committed to delivering continued scalability. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives and partnerships with our clients. In April, we published our second annual sustainability report, which details our commitments, goals and progress on our ESG efforts. I welcome all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to build sustainable relationships for the benefit of those we serve and encourage everyone listening to read through our 2021 sustainability report, which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility page of our website.  
Looking at macro trends. Inflation persists as an important topic on the minds of many stakeholders, and I want to emphasize that we believe our business is, by design, well positioned to drive value in this climate. Our business model is one that generates significant recurring revenue that flows through to the bottom line. As a triple net lease REIT, our business is insulated from inflation. Our clients are responsible for covering taxes, insurance and other operating expenses. And as prices increase, many of our clients pass the incremental cost burden on to their consumers or suppliers.  
The efficiency of our model is reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margin, which is routinely around 94%. Maintaining a conservative capital structure has been a key tenet of our business since our founding, and having a well-staggered fixed-rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024 limits our debt refinancing risk in a rising rate environment.  
In summary, we believe the appeal of our consistent and predictable stream of cash flows is amplified during periods of volatility like we find ourselves in today. To that end, we look at the last period in which the Federal Reserve increased interest rates from December 2015 through 2018 as a helpful case study.  
During this period, Realty Income's total return outperformed the S&P 500 and the MSCI US REIT Index both in year 1 of the rate hike cycle and throughout the 3-year duration of that cycle. And during the Great Recession, Realty Income exhibited less operational and financial volatility as compared to many other S&P 500 REITs that carry A credit ratings.  
From an organic growth standpoint, our asset management team continues to report impressive rent recapture rates. This quarter, we recaptured over 106% of rental revenue on expiring leases. Given our lease expiration schedule and proven rent recapture track record, we believe we are well positioned to manage through an inflationary environment.  
Through 2024, nearly 12% of our portfolio annualized contractual rent is set to expire. And in this regard, inflation could serve as a tailwind to our business as rents and costs to build rise.  
On the acquisition front, our transaction volume flow remains strong. Certain categories of the market have seen discernible increase in cap rates, which we believe should accrue to our advantage as a net acquirer. Historically, we have observed that when interest rate increase, cap rates adjust, following a lag period of 6 to 12 months. Much of this cap rate expansion can be attributed to levered buyers who have relied upon record low debt pricing to underwrite their returns. Given the current yield environment, we are in a comparatively strong position given our financing strategy. And as such, we would expect our competitive standing to strengthen further.  
Now turning to the results for the quarter. Our size and scale, in conjunction with strong relationships we have across the marketplace, continue to provide benefits through robust sourcing and acquisition volumes. This quarter, we sourced over $34 billion of acquisition opportunities, and approximately 40% of this amount was sourced from international markets.  
Our total property-level acquisitions for the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion. Approximately half of our volume in the first quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to approximately $5 billion of invested capital.  
As we announced in February, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor Resort and Casino leased to Wynn Resorts under a 30-year triple net lease with favorable annual rent increases. The $1.7 billion transaction includes more than 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate less than 5 miles from Downtown Boston.  Pending regulatory procedures, we continue to anticipate this transaction closing during the fourth quarter of 2022.  
We believe the market is efficient. And while cap rates have stabilized, significant competition remains with the high-quality assets we pursue. Our average initial cash cap rate for the quarter was 5.6%, which reflects the quality of locations and clients we are adding to our portfolio.  
As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis.  We estimate the difference between cash and straight-line cap rates to be approximately an additional 70 basis points in the first quarter. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.3 years, and the top industry invested during the quarter was grocery stores. We continue to have access to attractively priced capital, which has allowed us to maintain healthy spreads on our investments even as interest rates rise.  
We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.6% occupancy based on property count. The weighted average remaining lease term of our overall portfolio is approximately 8.9 years, which, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we see as an advantage.  
As leases roll, we continue to favorably recapture rent as a result of diligent underwriting and the inherent quality of our real estate enhanced by the proactive efforts of our experienced asset management team. This quarter, we re-leased 119 leases, recapturing 106.2% of expiring rent. And since our public listing in 1994, we have executed 4,260 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 101% of rent on those re-leased contracts.  
We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates because we believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. During the quarter, we sold 34 properties, generating net proceeds of approximately $122 million. Approximately 84% of the sales volume during the quarter related to former VEREIT properties that were sold vacant. And our portfolio delivered healthy same-store rent growth increasing 4.1% during the quarter. This was largely attributed to the reversal of $9.4 million of rental revenue reserves during the quarter within the same-store pool compared to a reserve of $8 million recognized for the same pool during the year ago period.  
Excluding the impact of reserves in both periods, we estimate that our same-store rent growth would have been approximately 1.2%.  
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

During the first quarter, our business generated AFFO per share of $0.98, supported by a strong acquisition pace and a healthy portfolio.  
As Sumit mentioned, during the quarter, we recognized a $9.4 million reversal of non-straight-line rental revenue reserves. This was primarily driven by the $7.7 million reversal of our outstanding reserves related to AMC, reflecting the recovery from the pandemic.  
Given the performance of our One Team, the health of our portfolio and progress achieved during the first quarter of 2022, we reaffirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint.  
From a leverage standpoint, we ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.4x, in line with our target leverage ratios. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal with a well-staggered predominantly fixed-rate debt maturity schedule and no corporate bond maturities until 2024. As Sumit mentioned in his opening remarks, our modest debt maturity schedule through the end of next year limits our refinancing risk in a raising rate environment.  
Our size and scale provide us access to attractively price debt across several markets. For example, in January, we issued GBP 500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28% with a weighted average term of 12.5 years. During the quarter, we issued over $660 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. And subsequent to the quarter end, we entered into a definitive agreement for the private placement of a GBP 600 million sterling-denominated offering of senior unsecured notes, pricing 8-year, 10-year and 15-year notes at a weighted average fixed rate of 3.22% with a weighted average tenor of approximately 10.5 years. We greatly appreciate the support from the investors who have participated in our capital markets transactions.  
Finally, just last week, we announced the recast and upsizing of our credit facility, which now includes a $4.25 billion multicurrency revolving line of credit with an initial maturity in June 2026 and 2 6-month extension options as well as a $1 billion accordion feature. At our current credit rating, the new revolving line of credit provides a borrowing rate of adjusted SOFR plus 72.5 basis points as compared to our previous credit facility of LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points.  
In total, 25 lenders participated in our recast, and we greatly appreciate the support of our relationship banks, many of whom have supported us for decades and have been integral towards our growth.  
We've been most active during the last 12 months within corporate finance and capital markets. I'd like to make special mention of Jonathan Pong and his team who have worked tirelessly to bring our corporate financing strategies and capital markets execution together with our partners to fruition on behalf of all whom we serve.  
Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In March, we celebrated the payment of our 620th monthly dividend by virtually ringing the New York Stock Exchange closing bell.  
At Realty Income, the dividend is sacrosanct, and we are proud to be one of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. And the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle. As a result, the value proposition of owning Realty Income is comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods versus those whose value is tied to growth in future years.  
And now I would like to pass the call back to Sumit."

I think the most obvious difference in cap rates -- increasing cap rates we see is in the industrial sector and more so here in the U.S. than in the international markets. I would say if I was asked to quantify what this change is in terms of what we were seeing in the third and fourth quarter of last year to what we started to see in the first quarter and beyond of this year, I would say it's in the tune of 25 to 50 basis points of increase in cap rates on the industrial sector.  
We are also starting to see on the retail side some of the transactions that were struck again in the fourth quarter of last year with potential levered buyers coming back. And certainty of close is taking on paramount importance with regards to the sellers, and they're coming back at slightly higher cap rates. We see this more on the larger dollar retail acquisition opportunities, not so much on the QSR and smaller opportunities. But we are starting to see movement higher on the retail side, but it is not as dominant and it's not as widespread as we see it on the industrial side."

So Nick, if you recall, when we first came out with our guidance, this was in late October, I think, of last year, which was very unusual for us. And a lot of what was driving that thinking then was making sure that people were able to underwrite what this merger was going to mean for the pro forma company. And we had come out with a number of $5 billion -- approximately $5 billion. 
We haven't changed that. And like you've said, we've obviously made the announcement subsequent to that initial guidance of a $1.7 billion transaction. And what I can share with you, Nick, is not all of that $1.7 billion was contemplated when we had first come out with the $5 billion. In fact, we weren't even sure we had a deal at that time. 
So could that $5 billion go up? Yes. But what I -- what keeps us a little bit on the sidelines is this continued volatility that we are seeing on the capital markets side. And from a pure sourcing perspective, as you can see from the numbers that we've posted, from a -- the next 4- to 5-month pipeline perspective, I can continue to share with you that the momentum is there. It is incredibly positive. And what sort of keeps us sort of hedging is what's going to happen in the last 4 to 5 months if this continued volatility remains. 
We are very comfortable with the $5 billion number. And it's actually, we say, above $5 billion. And I think we can also go so far as to say that not all of that $1.7 billion, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, was contemplated when we came out with the numbers that we did."

Look, I think by design, we had chosen to enter into Western Europe. And we, by design, chose the U.K. primarily because of the ease of affordability of our cost of capital and processes and tax regime, et cetera, et cetera. 
You're absolutely right that we have chosen to continue to work with some very large operators, and that investment pipeline has continued to be a major source of our growth of what is today a $5 billion portfolio. The good news here is the operators that we are partnering with, they are very, very large. And so there is a tremendous amount of runway for us to continue to do the consolidation. 
I think there was an element of your question that also touched on, given what is happening in Eastern Europe, how are we impacted? How are our operators impacted? What I can share with you is, as of right now, all of the operators that we have done business with in Europe, none of them have operations -- today, none of them have operations in Russia, Ukraine or any of the adjacent countries that are potentially being impacted by what's playing out in Eastern Europe. The only operator ironically that does have some element of exposure to Russia is actually Couche-Tard that has about 36 assets, which is less than 1% of their overall footprint -- global footprint that is based in Russia. And outside of that, none of our operators today have operations in either of those impacted countries. 
So we have a tremendous amount of pipeline. We have a fair amount of runway to not only continue to grow with the operators that we've established. But also, as we branch out into new countries with other dominant operators in those countries, and some of which, as you can tell, Carrefour was a brand new name for us, and we did the sale-leaseback in Spain. We have continued to grow that name. 
And as we continue to add more and more countries, and even within countries, as we get more comfortable with the landscape and operators, you'll start to see a few other very large names get added to our client registry. So, so far, so good. And by design, we've stayed on the Western side of Europe. And those businesses continue to do well."

So it's not significant, as you can tell, which is clearly why we have 98.6% occupancy. Look, for us,",359,"Yes. It's about -- so I'll answer your last question first, Haendel. There is about 156 assets that are vacant in our portfolio, close to 11,500 assets. So it's not significant, as you can tell, which is clearly why we have 98.6% occupancy. Look, for us, it is -- this quarter happened to be one where of all the assets sold, about 97%, 98% -- I believe it was $118 million, $119 million of the $122 million were vacant asset sales. And even that number was largely dominated by 2 industrial assets that we sold vacant where we were able to strike very good total return profiles. 
This is going to continue to ebb and flow. There'll be quarters where we have some occupied assets that we have opportunistically decided to sell. And clearly, selling vacant assets is very much part and parcel of our business. And when we do sell vacant assets, we give you a total return profile on what is the unlevered return that we were able to achieve, which this first quarter was north of 9% on an unlevered basis. So these are assets that we may have held for 10, 12, 15 years, have generated a fair amount of cash flow. And even when sold vacant, especially in inflationary environments, it allows us to create and capture the kind of returns that we are posting. 
But the point I want to make and I want to leave with you, Haendel, is selling vacant assets is absolutely part of our business. We go through an asset management analysis where we try to figure out what is the most economic -- what is the most positive outcome in terms of the economics of selling the asset, re-leasing the asset, repositioning the asset or entering into a negotiation with the existing client. And once we sort of go through that, we make the determination to go down one of these paths. And that's what drives our thinking in terms of how we decide whether to sell vacant assets or occupied assets. And that will continue to be the mantra that dictates our asset management strategy going forward."

Because, yes, if what we have experienced in the market more recently sort of creates this disconnect between private market valuations and public market valuations, then obviously, selling assets becomes very much part and parcel of our strategy. 
Truth be told, Haendel, we've never, outside of those very small pockets of time, i.e., when the pandemic first started, where we had a few weeks where there was a dislocation, for a sustained period, we've never encountered a scenario where asset prices were being valued in the private market higher than what our public market valuation indicated. But if that were to play out, hypothetically speaking, we would not be averse to raising capital, if needed, through asset sales. 
This is -- this, again, I think, will accrue to our benefit given the quality of assets that we have been able to assemble especially over the last 10 years and more specifically, over the last 3 to 4 years. So that continues to remain a strategy but one that we hope doesn't play out because I think the only scenario where I can see that happening is a macro environment where things are incredibly uncertain. And I hope that, that doesn't play out that way. But look, it's absolutely a theoretical strategy that we can lean on if needed."

Look, it is certainly a story that is playing out very differently for those that are well-capitalized businesses versus those that tend to be smaller operators in this high inflationary environment. We had Neil's team, the research team, do an analysis on our top 150 clients. And they represent about 85% of our rent. And we were like very focused on what is going to happen to their balance sheet, their ability to pay in the event that interest rates were to rise 300 basis points from where it is currently. And -- this is a big and, they didn't have the ability to pass through any of those increased costs that they were bearing on to their customers, which is a highly unlikely scenario, but we were trying to figure out what would happen in that particular scenario for us. And it was 11 of these operators of the 150 representing less than 5% of our rent where the coverages fell below 1x. 
So we feel like -- again, by design, we've created a client registry that's predominantly made up of very well capitalized operators. But those one-off operators -- and Caitlin, you're right, we have 1,000 different clients, so we certainly have a few one-off operators that tend to be smaller operators. It is going to be more difficult for them to be able to absorb this and their inability to pass through their costs. But we've had a few general merchandising stores. We've had a few folks who are going to -- who have actually talked about increasing EBIT margins because of their ability to pass through a lot of these costs. And predominantly, our client registry is made up of those types of folks. 
So yes, hypothetically, Caitlin, the smaller operators will suffer in this environment and may not make it. But thankfully, we don't have too much exposure to that, and it is very small in terms of percentage of our overall rent."

In terms of the industry itself, no surprise. We are getting a lot of inbounds from potential sale-leaseback opportunities. And the team is reviewing them one at a time. But our thesis around this particular space remains the same. We want to partner with the best-in-class operators and find assets that are truly one-of-a-kind, just like we did with the Boston asset.

So Ron, I mean, you've seen us grow our existing relationships to areas where they start to dominate our shareholder registry. So for instance -- I'll give you a perfect example. We did the first sale-leaseback with Dollar General. This was, I believe, in 2015, 2016 time frame, and it was maybe $130 million, $140 million sale-leaseback. We subsequently continued to grow our opportunity with Dollar General through multiple sale-leasebacks. It's a similar story with 7-Eleven. A lot of these clients that you see in our top 20 have grown over multiple years, and they continue to have ambitious growth profile. So that channel of growth remains for us. 
Then we also have the ability to do first-time sale-leasebacks in a large way with clients like Wynn. These are asset classes that tend to be very large. But again, given that we are about a $57 billion, $58 billion company today, it is going to register as a 3.5% client. 
And clearly, we have said this very openly that in the event Wynn decides to continue to execute and grow their footprint beyond the 2 locations that they currently have, we would love to continue to partner with them. And so this is a function of being able to do first-time sale-leasebacks in a big way. And now that we are of the size that we are, our ability to absorb those -- and when I say big, I mean $1 billion sale-leasebacks, even multiple billion-dollar sale-leasebacks, that has grown over the last few years and especially post the VEREIT merger."

I wish our business was a spigot where you could switch it off and turn it back on at a moment's notice. Unfortunately, our business doesn't work quite like that. When you think about how we source opportunities and how we create a pipeline of opportunities and what is the timing that it takes from making a decision to pursuing a particular transaction and then closing it, it could take anywhere between 4 to 6 months from start to finish. So unless you have a crystal ball, it is very, very difficult to be able to sort of do exactly what you suggested, which would have been perfect, if we could. 
The other thing I would tell you is there's a lag even in our cost of capital. When you have volatile situations like this, but you're seeing opportunities that seem very well priced on a pure real estate underwriting in terms of replacement costs, in terms of price per pound, when you think about the leases that we are able to capture with the clients that are engaging in these types of transactions, you obviously build into your underwriting a particular buffer. 
And hopefully, we've been conservative enough where we are still being able to capture positive healthy spreads to our cost of capital while continuing to enhance the -- our basic AFFO per share growth as well as our client registry with new relationships. So it's very difficult. And we had a different mindset over the next 6 to 9 months, which said, hey, the world is going to fall apart. 
We absolutely will pull in our horns just like we did in that very first quarter right after the -- it was actually the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic hit, where we slowed down our ability to sort of continue looking at transactions and truth be told, even the market there. The transaction market sort of went silent for a bit, just because people were very unsure of how things are going to play out. But that, I've already shared with you, is not the case. 
Sourcing remains very healthy. And we feel like even with the appropriate flexing of our own cost of capital, we are able to grow our business in a manner that is very much aligned with our acquisition strategy. But Josh, I'll be very honest, if our views change, we will stop continuing to build the pipeline. But that is not the case right now."

I mean if you look at our world vis-a-vis our peers, we are at right around 8, 8.5 years. And if you look at our lease maturity schedule -- and I think I said this during my prepared remarks, that 12% of our leases are going to renew over the next 2.5 years. And so it does -- if we can keep this momentum, I don't know if it will be 106%, but the other thing I would say about that 106% is it's effectively net increases. And so if we can keep it in that ZIP code, that will become a major growth driver for our business, and it will become an internal growth driver of our business, especially if we continue down this highly inflationary environment. 
The other good news is if you think about our international expansion, a lot of those leases tend to be CPI-adjusted leases. And they don't tend to have this collar, a ceiling and a floor, that we experience here, but it's a relative comment. I would say the vast majority of CPI leases that we have here in the U.S. tend to have a collar. And I would say maybe 1/3 to even 40% of the leases in the international markets tend to be -- basically do not have a collar around it, and they are very much tied to CPI growth. 
And so I think all of that will start to percolate through our portfolio and will help us drive more internal growth than what we have historically experienced in our business. And we think of this as an opportunity, and we've been talking about asset management now for about 5 years, 6 years in anticipation of what we are now starting to experience as a company. 
And so look, we think we are very positively set up to take advantage of this situation. And it then helps us alleviate some of the pressure of just growing through external measures, which, of course, is also something that the team is doing very well."

In fact, all indications have been -- all trend lines have indicated that the theater business is getting back to a strong footing despite all of the noise that we hear about the theater business and PVOD and all of that. 
In fact, I was looking at some numbers. In the first quarter of 2022, we are back to about 75% of 2019 levels. And so clearly, this is a business that is largely driven by content. We are also very encouraged by the pipeline of big tent movies that are going to be released over the next 2 to 3 months. We are very hopeful that, that will translate to more attendance. And the good news is a couple of these large operators like Regal and AMC are cash-flowing positive on the assets that we own. 
So I think all of that leads us to believe that this industry, as we had hoped and our hypothesis was, is sort of on the mend. Having said all of that, we also did a fair amount of downside scenario analysis where we looked at some of these locations. And we feel like we have the ability, the capital, the relationships to reposition these assets in the event that the business doesn't play out. 
I think the wrong economic decision today would be to sell some of these assets at what I would consider to be fire sale prices. And again, just to remind everyone, 82% of our portfolio is in the top 2 quartiles of performance for both these operators. So we feel very good about the theater business, but more specifically about the portfolio that we own.

And I'd like to thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to all my Realty Income colleagues who continue to make significant contributions towards our growth initiatives while serving our clients and all stakeholders as one Realty Income team. 
We are pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business amidst an uncertain macro environment, which we believe once again demonstrates the stability of our business model and its ability to thrive irrespective of the economic cycle. The strength of our global investment pipeline has allowed us to invest over $3.2 billion in high-quality real estate in the first half of the year, including approximately $1.7 billion during the second quarter. 
Given this momentum, we are increasing our 2022 acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion. On the topic of acquisitions, I'd like to mention 2 key developments that we are observing in the marketplace. First, as demonstrated by the weighted average 5.7% cash cap rate, we were able to achieve on our investments in the second quarter. 
Cap rates are moving higher in our target markets. Our second quarter cap rate ticked higher compared to the 5.6% and 5.4% cap rates we achieved in the previous 2 quarters. The positive correlation between cap rates and interest rates is also evident in our acquisition pipeline. Second, as a coronary to rising debt and equity costs that have impacted much of our competition,  the pipeline of acquisition opportunities materializing for us at accretive spreads continues to grow. 
As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. On a straight-line basis, we estimate our second quarter cap rate to be approximately 6.2%. And generally, the difference between cash and straight-line cap rates ranges between 50 and 70 basis points in any given period. 
Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $26 billion in this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume to approximately $60 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 5% of sourced volume year-to-date. 
During the second quarter, as a percentage of revenue, approximately 39% of acquisition volume was leased to investment-grade rated clients. We remain committed to our underwriting principles of partnering with well-capitalized clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Our international investment volume continues to comprise a significant percentage of our total volume, representing 41% of global volume in the second quarter at a cash cap rate of approximately 5.8%. 
We are encouraged that our size, scale and access to well-priced capital provides us with the platform and currency to actively deploy capital as we build continued momentum heading into 2023.  It was also an active quarter with regard to dispositions. We sold 70 properties, generating net sale proceeds of $150 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.3%. 
Year-to-date, we have sold 104 properties with net sales proceeds totaling $272 million, generating an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.4%. Capital recycling continues to be a value accretive activity for us. And importantly, the unlevered returns we have been able to deliver speak to the attractive risk-adjusted investment profile of our properties that have gone through our full investment cycle. 
Our diligent underwriting process, exposure to high-quality credit clients and the inherent quality of our real estate continued to deliver consistent performance. At the end of the second quarter, our occupancy was 98.9%, the highest occupancy rate we have achieved in over 10 years. Based on our current occupancy rates and client profile, we are increasing our year-end 2022 occupancy guidance to over 98%. 
During the second quarter, we re-leased 193 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 105.6%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.9%. At quarter end, 43.2% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Further, our properties leased to clients on our portfolio watch list represents less than 4% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent, which is largely consistent with the low percentages we have seen so far this year. 
Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2% during the quarter and 3% year-to-date. With the continued strong operations performance of our portfolio, we are increasing our guidance for same-store rent growth to approximately 2% for 2022. 
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

Our investment goals are supported by our we",611,"Thank you, Sumit. During the second quarter, our business generated $0.97 of AFFO per share, representing 10.2% year-over-year growth. .
The growth engine of our company revolves around accretive acquisitions. Our investment goals are supported by our well-capitalized balance sheet and favorable cost of capital which remain competitive advantages for us in the net lease industry. We finished the quarter well within our target leverage ratios with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis, giving annualized effect to net investment activity during the quarter. 
It was another active quarter for us on the capital raising front as we issued approximately $1.8 billion of long-term and permanent capital, including nearly $1.1 billion of equity through our ATM program and a GBP 600 million private placement note offering, which priced at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.22% with a blended tenor of 10.5 years. 
As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $1 billion of commercial paper and revolver borrowings, net of cash. Our outstanding CP and revolver borrowings essentially represent our only variable rate debt exposure across a total debt principal balance of almost $16 billion. As Sumit mentioned previously, our ability to access well-priced capital is a competitive advantage and we took steps during the quarter to further bolster this capacity. As previously announced in April this year, we recast and upsized our multicurrency revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $4.25 billion. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we upsized our U.S. commercial paper program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established a euro commercial paper program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion commercial paper programs for which our revolving credit facility serves as a liquidity backstop will give us the flexibility to efficiently finance our short-term funding needs at materially lower rates than comparable facility borrowings. 
Given the momentum we continue to see in our investment activities in Europe, the establishment of a euro program was a strategic goal of ours this year, and it will serve as an efficient tool for us to take advantage of the comparably lower all-in commercial paper rates in the euro market. With the health of our portfolio and investment progress achieved year-to-date, balanced alongside the timing of capital deployment and continued capital markets volatility, we affirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.95, representing nearly 9% annual growth at the midpoint. 
From a dividend perspective, as the monthly dividend company, consistent quarterly increases in dividend reflects the confidence we have as the cash flow generating capacity of our business. In June, we increased our dividend for the 116th time in our company's history. And last month, we declared our 625th consecutive common stock monthly dividend. 
From a sustainability perspective, further in June, we published our green bond allocation report, and I'm pleased to report that the net proceeds from our inaugural green bond offering have been fully allocated to eligible green projects in accordance with the criteria outlined in our green financing framework. 
From a merger perspective, lastly, I'm pleased to report that we have completed the integration of our Baby merger, which culminated in the conversion to a single ERP system for the combined entities during the second quarter. 
This could not have been accomplished so seamlessly without the commitment and dedication of our talented One Team. And finally, we remain on track to achieve the expected $45 million to $55 million of annualized run rate cost synergies we initially shared over a year ago when we announced the merger. 
And now I would like to pass the call back to Sumit."

They are adjusting a lot quicker than I had originally anticipated. We do have a much bigger team and with the varied merger of some of the team members that we have inherited, they are definitely producing and focusing on a certain area of the high-yield market that is actually resulting in transactions for us. The offset to that, however, is the capital market. Look, on a relative basis, we are doing very well. If you look at our 10-year unsecured bond spreads, they have moved, I would say, approximately 85 basis points. 
You look at our peers, our net lease peers with a BBB rating, it's moved 120 to 150 basis points. If you look at our cost of equity, it is essentially unchanged from the beginning of the year. But if you look at our net lease peers, they've dropped by about 1.8x. So those are the positive momentum, but it is true also that our cost of capital overall has also increased. And the question really is around can we generate the right spread to move the needle on the overall FFO per share growth. And the answer is yes. But as you know, there is an adjustment period which is why we have increased our acquisition guidance to over $6 billion from over $5 billion as a testament to what we are seeing in terms of benefits accruing to us based on some of what I just discussed. 
We are starting to see a lot more transactions coming back to us, those that we were not willing to price at the levels that the sellers were expecting when they initially brought it to us, are now coming back with an adjusted cap rate, which works. It is also true that the overall team has been able to just source more. And those are sort of shown in the sourcing volumes that we have shared with you of $60 billion year-to-date. 
But with interest rate movements and more importantly, the velocity at which these interest rates have moved, the spreads continue to be right around at 110, 111 basis points year-to-date, which is slightly below our overall average. So that's the reason why that this positive momentum is being reflected in higher acquisition volume, but not necessarily translating into higher earnings guidance."

I mean there have been quarters actually where the international acquisition number has been not the 50% of the overall volume. .
And as we start to grow into newer markets, et cetera, obviously, the total addressable market continues to increase for us. And as we become much more mature in each one of these newer markets, the sourced volume as well as which translates to closed volume will increase. 
But I wouldn't go so far as to say that at this point in time, we should be thinking anything north of this 40% number, 41% is what we achieved in the second quarter as being -- should be the guiding composition of the overall acquisition numbers going forward. 
There will be quarters where we'll do more, just like we've done in the past, but 40% seems to be the right number."

That's a great question, Nick, and welcome back to our space. I would say that the movement in cap rates here in the U.S. are certainly much more pronounced than what we have seen in the international markets. 
And it is largely a function of the Fed being a lot more aggressive than the ECB or the Bank of England have been. Having said that, we just saw an announcement earlier today that the Bank of England has moved its interest rates 50 basis points. So we do see that translating to higher cap rates in the U.K. as well as in the rest of Continental Europe. So just to quantify some of these movements, I would say that depending on the product and when I say retail, you can go from groceries, which have moved the most because they had become the most aggressive they've moved up about 100 basis points to some of the other industries that we focus on within the retail space, I would quantify that movement as being right around 25 to 50 basis points. 
And you should start to see that being reflected in the subsequent quarters and the acquisition cap rates, cash cap rates that we're going to share with the market going forward. In Europe, we have also seen movement, but it hasn't been quite as pronounced, maybe 5 to 10 basis points. On the industrial side, the movement has been a bit more visible 25 to 50 basis points, similar to what we experienced here in the U.S. 
But I would say the industrial market has continued to see an expansion on cap rates. And I would say, from beginning to end, maybe circa 50 basis points of movement on average. Now obviously, there are certain markets where the movement has been a lot, lot less than that in land Empire comes to mind. But the more secondary tertiary markets, you have seen a more pronounced movement than it could be even north of 50 to 75 basis [indiscernible]"

So the overall debt market has sort of become a lot more expensive for some of these levered buyers. And that's what we've seen, is that they are no longer being able to honor the original cap rate transactions were being struck at. And of course, we chose not to pursue those transactions at those given pricing. And so when they do come back to us, and as long as we like the transaction, it was just a pricing discussion. We are being able to now either all of the cap rate that we had or even expand out those cap rates to reflect current market conditions,  but the fact that the surety of close has become so much more important for the sellers today, is clearly prevalent in a lot of the discussions that we are having with the sellers today."

And unfortunately, if we were in a lab where we could control all variables that sort of drive this correlation, it would be a lot easier of an answer to give you. .
Historically, when we've done these correlations, we have found that the lag to be anywhere between 9 to perhaps even as long as 12 months. I was a lot more skeptical coming into this particular situation coming into this year and seeing the rising interest rate environment. 
Just because of the sheer volume of capital that has come into our space on the institutional side. And I was a bit hesitant to continue to say, ""Hey, it's going to be this 9- to 12-month lag before cap rates start to reflect the new environment because of this worth of capital. However, what I didn't take into account was the debt markets adjusting as quickly as they did. And even this new capital that has come into our space, both on the private equity side as well as on the public side of the equation,  the debt markets adjusted a lot faster. 
And therefore, the pullback from these newer buyers in our space has been a lot more acute, which has resulted in cap rates adjusting a lot faster. I mean we've had a rising interest rate environment now for the last 6 months, and we are already starting to see cap rates adjust 25 to 50 basis points. 
And like I said, in the grocery sector, we saw sale leasebacks being done in the low 4s that are now coming back and being done in the low 5s to mid-5s. So it's not a constant, Connor, that I can point to. It is a reflection of the environment that you are faced with, but it's a good thing for us, truth be told that cap rates can adjust as quickly as they have in a rising interest rate environment. I just hope that the corollary is not true."

Just look at what we did this quarter. I mean 62% of what we did was subinvestment grade or non-rated. So it is -- I don't believe true to say that all we focus on is investment-grade credit and that particular product. What we have tried to share with the market clearly unsuccessfully sell is that we focus on risk-adjusted returns. There are points in time where the risk-adjusted returns on investment grade credit is far superior to what we were seeing on the noninvestment-grade side, and we live it there and we try to do those transactions. 
And then there are other times where the exact opposite is true, where sub-investment grade is allowing you to capture risk-adjusted returns that are far superior. And so we find ourselves in that period today where we are finding very good opportunities on the noninvestment-grade side of the equation.  And as such are being able to get a lot of those transactions over the finish line, i.e., 62% in the second quarter. 
So we are indifferent to the credit ratings. What we focus on is looking at the totality of that particular opportunity to then ascribe a return profile that makes sense for the risk that we are undertaking. And that will continue to vary. We don't target investment grade. Investment grade tends to be a byproduct of the underwriting. So hopefully, that clarifies the question you asked."

On the new guidance, can you just talk about the moving pieces that kept the AFO per share number unchanged despite the higher acquisition [indiscernible]. I know Sumit said, potentially tighter spreads versus the cost of capital, but I'm curious if there was an FX impact or interest expense impact or anything else?"

I think, Brad, just to start off, Sumit had started to touch on this in terms of some of the moving pieces given the fact that we had increased our acquisition volume to over $6 billion. But kept as you observed our AFFO per share guidance the same and reaffirmed it. 
And there are some factors there in terms of, first, the volatility in the capital markets, as we've discussed the overall rate hikes and the magnitude of those hikes and any future actions that may be taken, both in terms of the European and U.S. environment. We also, to the point that you were making, we do actually hedge from the perspective of FX to protect our international income as well as we've got hedges in place to lower our effective interest rates, and we'll touch on that a bit more in a second. 
But the other thing too is that just the general timing of the investment volume, the team has just been doing a great job. We've got really strong momentum as Sumit discussed in the market. And the acquisitions that we close from now towards the end of the year, while our attractive are really going to be setting us up nicely for 2023. 
So the timing of that isn't as beneficial for the year in AFFO as it will be for the full year impact next year. And I think, to the upside, we still have some clients on cash accounting, that have just started under their deferral arrangements. 
And so we'll be monitoring them for continued consistent payment performance, and make the appropriate calls and alignment with our policy and guidelines when we may be taking them off of cash accounting. But I'd love to turn it over to Jonathan to talk a little bit more specifically about hedging and the impact."

Yes, Brad, you've seen us obviously issue a lot of local currency debt in the sterling market that's intentional, obviously, much lower haul in rates there. 
But certainly, from a natural hedge perspective, having interest expense denominated in the same currency where we're now getting rent limits the exposure that we have in volatility. And then we have a cleanup methodology where we hedge a portion of AFFO that is unhedged. And so from that dynamic, we feel like we've mitigated the range of outcomes, upside and downside, but there is still some unhedged exposure. About 60% of our foreign-denominated AFFO is unhedged. So for every 10% move in the dollar, for instance, you're looking at maybe $0.015 of volatility on an annualized basis. So we're not completely hedged, which can lead to upside if we see some mean reversion here in the dollar. But just a little bit of conservatism that we're taking here sitting here in August."

And then, Sumit, some of your peers this quarter have talked about portfolios trading at a discount to single assets. Is that something that you've seen? 
And are you interested potentially in pursuing more portfolio deals? 
No more than in the past, Brad. Portfolio deals generally do tend to trade at a discount, especially in times like this when the cost of capital have gone up. And a lot of these potential buyers of big portfolios are sort of sitting on the sidelines. So this is essentially reverted back to where it was, where we would get a discount on portfolio transactions. 
And so if you look at our volume today, about 62% of what we did were portfolio transactions. So that actually accrues to our benefit, Brad, and we are certainly seeing exactly the same scenario as some of our peers have commented."

Focusing on the Euro CP side, we absolutely intend to utilize that to the extent that we have a use of euro currency. But right now, obviously, interest rates are much lower comparatively. We could probably issue 1 year year-old CPA in a 25 basis point context and that compares to revolver borrowings that are 75 basis points or so. So certainly, having a liability and a very cheap liability at that denominated in euros will be additive on all fronts, limiting the amount of derivatives that we have to engage with to hedge our exposure and lowering the old interest rate that we have to pay on your borrowings."

And this was absolutely a testament to the amount of capital that had come into our space and the cost of debt available that allow these buyers to essentially hit the yield that they required on a cash-on-cash basis. And the unwinding was as quick, partially driven by what the Fed chose to do, partially driven by how that translated into the debt market. 
And then the withdrawal of some of this capital that relied on the debt markets. So I think that phenomena is very unique to that particular sector of retail. And we didn't see that compression in any other sector that I can think of."

And if you kind of look historically back at this other than really like a week during COVID in March of '20, you have to go all the way back to the rate of administration to find sort of this relative value on both the pound and on the on the euro impact that far, but in terms of the dollar strength. So my question is, does that impact at all your view about where to allocate capital at this point? Or are you completely agnostic to the exchange rate?"

Obviously, this is something that we have an acute focus on -- like we said, we are not 100% hedged. That wouldn't be economically prudent to do so. We are about 40% hedged on our income stream. And we have instituted strategies to sort of mitigate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. 
Having said all of that, we did exactly the same analysis, Chris, to figure out at which point in time where these exchange rates at current levels and concluded the same that, look, again, I might look foolish in 3 months from now. 
But this looks like the low point in terms of foreign exchange between the GBP and the U.S. and the euro in the U.S. And you're starting to see with increases in interest rates by the Bank of England, similar to the ECB, you're starting to see that correct itself and start to revert a little bit more to the mean. 
So that could potentially act as a tailwind. But not knowing and not trying to take a forecast on where these things are going to play out. That's the reason -- one of the main reasons why we kept our range exactly the same, but we believe that we are very well situated currently. Ultimately, this is a long game. And what we want is to let the product and the acquisition opportunities dictate with is with an eye on the exchange rate, dictate how we build out our portfolio. So totally not fair to say we would be agnostic, but it is something we keep in mind, but doesn't necessarily drive our strategy in its entirety."

Having said that, I think when we do decide to pursue sale leasebacks in a meaningful way. It is possible that some of those transactions would be much larger in size. For instance, if you think about our inaugural transaction that we did when we first went into the U.K., it was a sale-leaseback that we did with Sainsbury's. That was $0.5 billion. 
If you think about the gaming industry and the sale leaseback we've done with them, it's going to dominate that particular quarter because it's a $1.7 billion transaction.

And I'd like to thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to all my Realty Income colleagues who continue to make significant contributions towards our growth initiatives while serving our clients and all stakeholders as one Realty Income team.  
We are pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business amidst an uncertain macro environment, which we believe once again demonstrates the stability of our business model and its ability to thrive irrespective of the economic cycle. The strength of our global investment pipeline has allowed us to invest over $3.2 billion in high-quality real estate in the first half of the year, including approximately $1.7 billion during the second quarter.  
Given this momentum, we are increasing our 2022 acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion. On the topic of acquisitions, I'd like to mention 2 key developments that we are observing in the marketplace. First, as demonstrated by the weighted average 5.7% cash cap rate, we were able to achieve on our investments in the second quarter. Cap rates are moving higher in our target markets. Our second quarter cap rate ticked higher compared to the 5.6% and 5.4% cap rates we achieved in the previous 2 quarters. The positive correlation between cap rates and interest rates is also evident in our acquisition pipeline. Second, as a coronary to rising debt and equity costs that have impacted much of our competition, the pipeline of acquisition opportunities materializing for us at accretive spreads continues to grow.  
As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. On a straight-line basis, we estimate our second quarter cap rate to be approximately 6.2%. And generally, the difference between cash and straight-line cap rates ranges between 50 and 70 basis points in any given period.  
Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $26 billion in this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume to approximately $60 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 5% of sourced volume year-to-date.  
During the second quarter, as a percentage of revenue, approximately 39% of acquisition volume was leased to investment-grade rated clients. We remain committed to our underwriting principles of partnering with well-capitalized clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Our international investment volume continues to comprise a significant percentage of our total volume, representing 41% of global volume in the second quarter at a cash cap rate of approximately 5.8%.
We are encouraged that our size, scale and access to well-priced capital provides us with the platform and currency to actively deploy capital as we build continued momentum heading into 2023. It was also an active quarter with regard to dispositions. We sold 70 properties, generating net sale proceeds of $150 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.3%.
Year-to-date, we have sold 104 properties with net sales proceeds totaling $272 million, generating an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.4%. Capital recycling continues to be a value accretive activity for us. And importantly, the unlevered returns we have been able to deliver speak to the attractive risk-adjusted investment profile of our properties that have gone through our full investment cycle.
Our diligent underwriting process, exposure to high-quality credit clients and the inherent quality of our real estate continued to deliver consistent performance. At the end of the second quarter, our occupancy was 98.9%, the highest occupancy rate we have achieved in over 10 years. Based on our current occupancy rates and client profile, we are increasing our year-end 2022 occupancy guidance to over 98%.  
During the second quarter, we re-leased 193 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 105.6%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.9%. At quarter end, 43.2% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Further, our properties leased to clients on our portfolio watch list represents less than 4% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent, which is largely consistent with the low percentages we have seen so far this year.  
Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2% during the quarter and 3% year-to-date. With the continued strong operations performance of our portfolio, we are increasing our guidance for same-store rent growth to approximately 2% for 2022. 
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

The growth engine of our company revolves around accretive acquisitions. Our investment goals are supported by our well-capitalized balance sheet and favorable cost of capital which remain competitive advantages for us in the net lease industry. We finished the quarter well within our target leverage ratios with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis, giving annualized effect to net investment activity during the quarter.  
It was another active quarter for us on the capital raising front as we issued approximately $1.8 billion of long-term and permanent capital, including nearly $1.1 billion of equity through our ATM program and a GBP 600 million private placement note offering, which priced at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.22% with a blended tenor of 10.5 years.  
As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $1 billion of commercial paper and revolver borrowings, net of cash. Our outstanding CP and revolver borrowings essentially represent our only variable rate debt exposure across a total debt principal balance of almost $16 billion. As Sumit mentioned previously, our ability to access well-priced capital is a competitive advantage and we took steps during the quarter to further bolster this capacity. As previously announced in April this year, we recast and upsized our multicurrency revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $4.25 billion.
Subsequent to quarter end, we upsized our U.S. commercial paper program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established a euro commercial paper program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion commercial paper programs for which our revolving credit facility serves as a liquidity backstop will give us the flexibility to efficiently finance our short-term funding needs at materially lower rates than comparable facility borrowings. 
Given the momentum we continue to see in our investment activities in Europe, the establishment of a euro program was a strategic goal of ours this year, and it will serve as an efficient tool for us to take advantage of the comparably lower all-in commercial paper rates in the euro market. With the health of our portfolio and investment progress achieved year-to-date, balanced alongside the timing of capital deployment and continued capital markets volatility, we affirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.95, representing nearly 9% annual growth at the midpoint.  
From a dividend perspective, as the monthly dividend company, consistent quarterly increases in dividend reflects the confidence we have in the cash flow generating capacity of our business. In June, we increased our dividend for the 116th time in our company's history. And last month, we declared our 625th consecutive common stock monthly dividend.
From a sustainability perspective, further in June, we published our green bond allocation report, and I'm pleased to report that the net proceeds from our inaugural green bond offering have been fully allocated to eligible green projects in accordance with the criteria outlined in our Green Financing Framework. 
From a merger perspective, lastly, I'm pleased to report that we have completed the integration of our VEREIT merger, which culminated in the conversion to a single ERP system for the combined entities during the second quarter.
This could not have been accomplished so seamlessly without the commitment and dedication of our talented One Team. And finally, we remain on track to achieve the expected $45 million to $55 million of annualized run rate cost synergies we initially shared over a year ago when we announced the merger.
And now I would like to pass the call back to Sumit."

They are adjusting a lot quicker than I had originally anticipated. We do have a much bigger team and with the VEREIT merger of some of the team members that we have inherited, they are definitely producing and focusing on a certain area of the high-yield market that is actually resulting in transactions for us. The offset to that, however, is the capital market. Look, on a relative basis, we are doing very well. If you look at our 10-year unsecured bond spreads, they have moved, I would say, approximately 85 basis points.
You look at our peers, our net lease peers with a BBB rating, it's moved 120 to 150 basis points. If you look at our cost of equity, it is essentially unchanged from the beginning of the year. But if you look at our net lease peers, they've dropped by about 1.8x. So those are the positive momentum, but it is true also that our cost of capital overall has also increased. And the question really is around can we generate the right spread to move the needle on the overall AFFO per share growth. And the answer is yes. But as you know, there is an adjustment period which is why we have increased our acquisition guidance to over $6 billion from over $5 billion as a testament to what we are seeing in terms of benefits accruing to us based on some of what I just discussed. 
We are starting to see a lot more transactions coming back to us, those that we were not willing to price at the levels that the sellers were expecting when they initially brought it to us, are now coming back with an adjusted cap rate, which works. It is also true that the overall team has been able to just source more. And those are sort of shown in the sourcing volumes that we have shared with you of $60 billion year-to-date.
But with interest rate movements and more importantly, the velocity at which these interest rates have moved, the spreads continue to be right around at 110, 111 basis points year-to-date, which is slightly below our overall average. So that's the reason why that this positive momentum is being reflected in higher acquisition volume, but not necessarily translating into higher earnings guidance."

And as we start to grow into newer markets, et cetera, obviously, the total addressable market continues to increase for us. And as we become much more mature in each one of these newer markets, the sourced volume as well as which translates to closed volume will increase.
But I wouldn't go so far as to say that at this point in time, we should be thinking anything north of this 40% number, 41% is what we achieved in the second quarter as being -- should be the guiding composition of the overall acquisition numbers going forward.

And it is largely a function of the Fed being a lot more aggressive than the ECB or the Bank of England have been. Having said that, we just saw an announcement earlier today that the Bank of England has moved its interest rates 50 basis points. So we do see that translating to higher cap rates in the U.K. as well as in the rest of Continental Europe. So just to quantify some of these movements, I would say that depending on the product and when I say retail, you can go from groceries, which have moved the most because they had become the most aggressive they've moved up about 100 basis points to some of the other industries that we focus on within the retail space, I would quantify that movement as being right around 25 to 50 basis points.  
And you should start to see that being reflected in the subsequent quarters and the acquisition cap rates, cash cap rates that we're going to share with the market going forward. In Europe, we have also seen movement, but it hasn't been quite as pronounced, maybe 5 to 10 basis points. On the industrial side, the movement has been a bit more visible, 25 to 50 basis points, similar to what we experienced here in the U.S.
But I would say the industrial market has continued to see an expansion on cap rates. And I would say, from beginning to end, maybe circa 50 basis points of movement on average. Now obviously, there are certain markets where the movement has been a lot, lot less than that Inland Empire comes to mind. But the more secondary tertiary markets, you have seen a more pronounced movement than it could be even north of 50 to 75 basis."

The big banks, the BFAs, the JPMorgans, the Wells, I'm not going to say that they have a moratorium on new loans, but it is much more difficult for them to create new bank debt or increased revolvers, et cetera, for more distressed credit.
So the overall debt market has sort of become a lot more expensive for some of these levered buyers. And that's what we've seen, is that they are no longer being able to honor the original cap rate that transactions were being struck at. And of course, we chose not to pursue those transactions at those given pricing. And so when they do come back to us, and as long as we like the transaction, it was just a pricing discussion. We are being able to now either all of the cap rate that we had or even expand out those cap rates to reflect current market conditions, but the fact that the surety of close has become so much more important for the sellers today, is clearly prevalent in a lot of the discussions that we are having with the sellers today."

And unfortunately, if we were in a lab where we could control all variables that sort of drive this correlation, it would be a lot easier of an answer to give you. 
Historically, when we've done these correlations, we have found that the lag to be anywhere between 9 to perhaps even as long as 12 months. I was a lot more skeptical coming into this particular situation coming into this year and seeing the rising interest rate environment.  
Just because of the sheer volume of capital that has come into our space on the institutional side. And I was a bit hesitant to continue to say, ""Hey, it's going to be this 9- to 12-month lag before cap rates start to reflect the new environment because of this worth of capital."" However, what I didn't take into account was the debt markets adjusting as quickly as they did. And even this new capital that has come into our space, both on the private equity side as well as on the public side of the equation, the debt markets adjusted a lot faster.  
And therefore, the pullback from these newer buyers in our space has been a lot more acute, which has resulted in cap rates adjusting a lot faster. I mean we've had a rising interest rate environment now for the last 6 months, and we are already starting to see cap rates adjust 25 to 50 basis points.  
And like I said, in the grocery sector, we saw sale leasebacks being done in the low 4s that are now coming back and being done in the low 5s to mid-5s. So it's not a constant, Connor, that I can point to. It is a reflection of the environment that you are faced with, but it's a good thing for us, truth be told that cap rates can adjust as quickly as they have in a rising interest rate environment. I just hope that the corollary is not true."

Just look at what we did this quarter. I mean 62% of what we did was sub investment grade or non-rated. So it is -- I don't believe true to say that all we focus on is investment-grade credit and that particular product. What we have tried to share with the market clearly unsuccessfully so is that we focus on risk-adjusted returns. There are points in time where the risk-adjusted returns on investment grade credit is far superior to what we were seeing on the noninvestment-grade side, and we pivot there and we try to do those transactions.  
And then there are other times where the exact opposite is true, where sub-investment grade is allowing you to capture risk-adjusted returns that are far superior. And so we find ourselves in that period today where we are finding very good opportunities on the non-investment-grade side of the equation. And as such are being able to get a lot of those transactions over the finish line, i.e., 62% in the second quarter.  
So we are indifferent to the credit ratings. What we focus on is looking at the totality of that particular opportunity to then ascribe a return profile that makes sense for the risk that we are undertaking. And that will continue to vary. We don't target investment grade. Investment grade tends to be a byproduct of the underwriting. So hopefully, that clarifies the question you asked."

I think, Brad, just to start off, Sumit had started to touch on this in terms of some of the moving pieces given the fact that we had increased our acquisition volume to over $6 billion. But kept as you observed our AFFO per share guidance the same and reaffirmed it.
And there are some factors there in terms of, first, the volatility in the capital markets, as we've discussed the overall rate hikes and the magnitude of those hikes and any future actions that may be taken, both in terms of the European and U.S. environment. We also, to the point that you were making, we do actually hedge from the perspective of FX to protect our international income as well as we've got hedges in place to lower our effective interest rates, and we'll touch on that a bit more in a second.
But the other thing too is that just the general timing of the investment volume, the team has just been doing a great job. We've got really strong momentum as Sumit discussed in the market. And the acquisitions that we close from now towards the end of the year, while are attractive are really going to be setting us up nicely for 2023.  
So the timing of that isn't as beneficial for the year in AFFO as it will be for the full year impact next year. And I think, to the upside, we still have some clients on cash accounting, that have just started under their deferral arrangements. And so we'll be monitoring them for continued consistent payment performance, and make the appropriate calls and alignment with our policy and guidelines as to when we may be taking them off of cash accounting. But I'd love to turn it over to Jonathan to talk a little bit more specifically about hedging and the impact."

Yes, Brad, you've seen us obviously issue a lot of local currency debt in the sterling market that's intentional, obviously, much lower haul in rates there. But certainly, from a natural hedge perspective, having interest expense denominated in the same currency where we're now getting rent limits the exposure that we have in volatility. And then we have a cleanup methodology where we hedge a portion of AFFO that is unhedged. 
And so from that dynamic, we feel like we've mitigated the range of outcomes, upside and downside, but there is still some unhedged exposure. About 60% of our foreign-denominated AFFO is unhedged. So for every 10% move in the dollar, for instance, you're looking at maybe $0.015 of volatility on an annualized basis. So we're not completely hedged, which can lead to upside if we see some mean reversion here in the dollar. But just a little bit of conservatism that we're taking here sitting here in August."

And this was absolutely a testament to the amount of capital that had come into our space and the cost of debt available that allow these buyers to essentially hit the yield that they required on a cash-on-cash basis.

Their deferral arrangements started in July. And so we will be looking at their continued strong collections performance and make the appropriate calls in relation to our policies and things as we continue through this year and determine if we will be taking any of those clients off of cash accounting. And some of that impact, Ron, is also one of the variables that we factored in as it relates to the upper end of our guidance."

So first half of the year, we've actually benefited from some paybacks on deferral agreements that have actually resulted in flat or even negative bad debt expense.
So a little bit of conservatism in the back half of the year just given the macro environment, and uncertainties, but definitely assuming just a normalized run rate in a pre-pandemic year."

And we have instituted strategies to sort of mitigate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market.
Having said all of that, we did exactly the same analysis, Chris, to figure out at which point in time were these exchange rates at current levels and concluded the same that, look, again, I might look foolish in 3 months from now. But this looks like the low point in terms of foreign exchange between the GBP in the U.S. and the euro in the U.S. And you're starting to see with increases in interest rates by the Bank of England, similar to the ECB, you're starting to see that correct itself and start to revert a little bit more to the mean. 
So that could potentially act as a tailwind. But not knowing and not trying to take a forecast on where these things are going to play out. That's the reason -- one of the main reasons why we kept our range exactly the same, but we believe that we are very well situated currently. Ultimately, this is a long game. And what we want is to let the product and the acquisition opportunities dictate with us, with an eye on the exchange rate, dictate how we build out our portfolio. So totally not fair to say we would be agnostic, but it is something we keep in mind, but doesn't necessarily drive our strategy in its entirety."

Having said that, I think when we do decide to pursue sale leasebacks in a meaningful way. It is possible that some of those transactions would be much larger in size. For instance, if you think about our inaugural transaction that we did when we first went into the U.K., it was a sale-leaseback that we did with Sainsbury's. That was $0.5 billion.
If you think about the gaming industry and the sale leaseback we've done with them, it's going to dominate that particular quarter because it's a $1.7 billion transaction. And we see similar types of opportunities where when and if those close in a given quarter, it's going to dominate that particular quarter.

At Realty Income, we pride ourselves in having a consistent and dependable business model. For 53 years as an operating company, we have persevered through a variety of macroeconomic climates, and our track record of stability, notably during periods of volatility, is particularly relevant during current times. 
We sit here today well positioned and operating very well across all areas of our business. We are grateful for all of our team members who make the success possible. 
To start off, we capitalized on opportunities to bolster our balance sheet in the third quarter, including raising over $2 billion of equity on the ATM, with approximately $700 million of proceeds received during the third quarter as well as over $1.3 billion remaining, subject to our settlement on a forward basis in alignment with our capital strategy. In addition, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in October to further increase our liquidity. 
Between cash and cash equivalents, our availability under our credit facility, our liquidity as of the end of the third quarter was over $2.5 billion, which, when combined with the $1.3 billion of our unsettled forward equity and approximately $744 million in net bond proceeds, equates to liquidity of approximately $4.6 billion had the forwards and net bond proceeds being received at quarter end. 
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we acquired approximately $1.9 billion in high-quality real estate, bringing us to approximately $5.1 billion in acquisitions year-to-date. A significant portion of the properties purchased in Q3 were part of portfolio deals or large transactions. We believe these deals were accessible to us because of our size, scale, relationships, ability to close access to and cost of capital, together with our research and technology-driven analytic capabilities. 
For Realty Income, our competitive advantages allow us to design and execute on strategies that benefit all those we serve, including our clients. The pending $1.7 billion Encore Boston Harbor transaction, which we continue to expect to close this year, remains an example of this dynamic. Based on our current total portfolio annualized base rent, the transaction would comprise approximately 3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent once closed. 
Further leveraging our international capabilities, we made our advent into Italy last week, investing approximately EUR [ 165 ] million in 7 high-performing wholesale clubs operated by Metro AG in major Italian cities like Rome and Florence. Metro is a pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry and operates almost 700 stores across Europe. Metro is publicly listed and investment-grade rated and has continued to perform well during and since the pandemic. We are delighted to add them as a client and hope we will be able to add to this initial portfolio over time. 
During the third quarter, we did experience cap rate expansion, registering a 6.1% cash cap rate on investments, which compares favorably to the [ 5.7% ] cap rate we realized our investments in the second quarter. This resulted in a third quarter investment spread of [ 165 ] basis points based on actual capital raised, which is higher than our year-to-date total of [ 161 ] basis points and above our historical average. As we move towards year-end, we continue to see cap rates push higher as capital costs increase. This is consistent with the historical correlation we've come to expect, which has tended to preserve investment spreads as the market adjusts. 
Transaction flow remains strong, with sourcing volume totaling approximately $18 billion this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume approximately $78 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 6.5% of sourced volume year-to-date. 
The international market continues to be an important part of our strategy, and it remains an active component of our volume, representing approximately 33% of investment volume in the third quarter. 
Capital recycling continues to be a strong component of our funding strategy, which also has the dual purpose of culling noncore properties from the portfolio. During the third quarter, we sold 34 properties, generating net sale proceeds of $142 million at an unlevered IRR of 12.8%, illustrating the full cycle attractiveness of owning net lease real estate under long-term leases. We intend to continue to act opportunistically to dispose of assets at moments in time when we can obtain attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
In addition to the disposition of properties on our balance sheet, we also sold our interest in 7 properties owned in an industrial JV that we assumed as part of our VEREIT merger. The gross purchase price totaled $905 million at a low 4% cap rate. Our share of net sale proceeds was approximately $113.5 million. 
Our core portfolio continues to perform, and by and large, our clients have generally continued to perform very well despite [indiscernible] market changes and shifts in consumer behavior. A point to note, as previously publicly announced, one of our clients, Cineworld, commenced Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September. Despite being one of its largest landlords, Cineworld represented only 1.5% of our total portfolio annualized base rent as of Q3. We'll continue working closely with Cineworld as this process continues towards resolution. 
For some color regarding theaters, for the third quarter 2022, we collected approximately 85% of the contractual rent across our theater portfolio as Cineworld Group plc was not yet required to pay rent for the month of September. For the month of October 2022, we have collected 100% of the contractual rent across our theater clients, including Cineworld. 
For some specifics, our Cineworld portfolio consists of 41 properties, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement, and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Through September, we have recognized $23.5 million of cumulative reserves on these properties, representing primarily contractual rent and expense recoveries that have not been collected dating back to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These 22 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $1.6 million of monthly contractual base rent or 40% of our total exposure to Cineworld. Based on current public information and our internal analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets are generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio. 
Our locations are freestanding single-tenant assets typically with large land areas and close proximity to population centers, supporting potential conversion to residential, industrial or life science uses. We have received reverse inquiries from multifamily and industrial developers exploring opportunities on these sites. We believe there is alternative and adaptive reuse potential if Regal were to vacate any locations as part of bankruptcy. 
Moving on to some of the most important key operational metrics delivering value that continue to demonstrate a consistent well-positioned real estate portfolio. At the end of the third quarter, our occupancy was 98.9%. In Q3, we released [ 169 ] leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 108.5%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 106.7%. As we look forward, less than 4% of our contractual base rent comes due through the end of 2023, providing strong visibility into our near-term portfolio performance. At quarter end, approximately 43% of our portfolio's total annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Our properties leased to clients in our portfolio watch list represented less than 4% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent. 
Lastly, our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date, and we continue to expect full year same-store growth to be approximately 2%. 
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

Put simply, it was another productive quarter for us. In the third quarter, our business generated $0.98 per share of AFFO, representing 7.7% year-over-year growth.

In the third quarter, our business generated $0.98 per share of AFFO, representing 7.7% year-over-year growth. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR was 5.3x or 5.2x, giving effect to the annualization of net investment activity during the quarter. These ratios do not reflect the $1.3 billion in outstanding equity forwards we had at quarter end. 
As Sumit previously mentioned, we were both active and prudent in our capital-raising efforts since the end of the second quarter. 
In addition to raising over $2 billion during the quarter at an initial weighted average price of approximately [ $68 ] per share, subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $750 million bond transaction, the majority of which served as a synthetic euro offering to take advantage of favorable foreign exchange dynamics while also allowing us to return to the U.S. dollar public fixed income market, which we last accessed in 2020. 
In conjunction with this offering, we executed a USD 600 million to euro 10-year cross-currency swap, resulting in the receipt of approximately $612 million in euro proceeds, an effective fixed rate euro-denominated semiannual yield to maturity of 4.7%. Additionally, giving effect to $500 million of interest rate hedges, which were terminated with the operated, we generated a $72 million cash settlement gain at pricing, which, when amortized over the 10-year tenure of the note, is expected to result in an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 3.93%. 
Financial flexibility has long been a hallmark of our strategy, and our ability to move between various financing markets given our international capital needs is a competitive advantage. 
As previously reported in the third quarter, we upsized our U.S. commercial paper program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established a euro commercial paper program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our multicurrency $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, gives us the flexibility to efficiently match fund our short-term funding needs in various currencies at much lower rates than comparable U.S. facility borrowings. 
As we look forward, we have limited near-term refinancing risk as only $23 million of mortgage debt comes due through the end of 2023 and our next unsecured debt maturity is not until 2024. With continued stable and consistent results in the quarter, we tightened our AFFO guidance range by $0.06 to $3.87 to $3.94, maintaining the midpoint at a 9% year-over-year growth rate, consistent with what we initially provided a year ago. 
As the monthly dividend company, Realty Income's dividend will remain sacrosanct to our mission. This is a testament to our confidence in the time-tested consistency of our business model supported by a conservative balance sheet and diverse real estate portfolio leased to clients that are leaders in their respective industries. 
In September, we increased the dividend for the 117th time and for the 100th consecutive quarter, representing a 5.1% increase compared to the dividend declared 1 year ago. We are proud of these accomplishments and the work our talented colleagues perform every day to help drive this consistent track record. 
Earlier this week, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our VEREIT merger. We've grown together as one team over the last year, and I'm pleased that we remain on track to realize over $50 million in run rate annual cost synergies that we estimated when we announced the merger. 
And with that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit."

We are definitely seeing movement in cap rates. If we were to compare it to what -- where the environment was at the beginning of the year, which is what I would say we saw over the last couple of years, and compare it to cap rates that we are seeing today and what we experienced in the third quarter, I would say retail cap rates have moved circa 100 basis points. And it's a story of basically 2 ends of the credit spectrum. 
If you think about the high investment-grade grocery assets, those at the beginning of the year were trading in the low 4 cap rate range, and those have moved the most. I would say today, they are in the 5.5%, maybe even in the 5.6% ZIP code. So that's about 150 basis points. And then on the other end of the spectrum, it was the higher yielding cap rates that had compressed quite a bit over the last few years that also saw similar movement. But the stuff that was in between has seen movements circa of 100 basis points, and that's really what is starting to translate into actual realized cap rates that you noticed for the third quarter. 
Having said all of that, things don't happen at the spur of the moment. I mean a lot of these transactions -- we started to have discussions with our potential clients about the movement that we were seeing in our cost of capital, which was quite brutal and quite immediate. And thanks to the relationships, thanks to our ability to close all of the things that I enumerated in my prepared remarks, some of the more institutional type clients were also experiencing similar dynamics, and we're more than willing to adjust cap rates to continue to do business and continue to fund their respective businesses. And I think that's what you sort of saw translating to the 40 basis points of increased cap rate that we were able to realize in the third quarter. But it is a timing thing. 
I just want to be very careful that depending on -- if, for instance, if the gaming asset in Boston, if that were to have closed in the third quarter, that's already been sort of -- it's a transaction that's going to have a 5.9% cap rate, that's going to sway the overall cap rate. So it really is a question of when did those transactions get under contract and what is the timing of close that's going to dictate what the quarter results are. But having said all of that, I think we are definitely seeing movement, and it is in the quantum that I described earlier. 
It's a similar story on the industrial side. I would say that industrial cap rates have also moved considerably, and this is something that we started seeing even in the early part of the year. I think in my first quarter comments, I had talked about maybe seeing a 25 to 50 basis point movement. This was on the heels of Amazon announcing that they are no longer going to be big takers of industrial assets. They accounted for about 20% of the volume over the last few years. That started to see some movement -- that resulted in some movement on the industrial side. And then that movement continued through the second quarter. 
And I'll say today, despite what we quoted in our joint venture that we sold in the low 4s, I would say similar assets that we were pursuing are in the 5.5 ZIP code today. So there's clearly movement. And the hope is that the movement will continue in the right direction over the next coming months. And our portfolio is a testament -- our portfolio as well as our pipeline is a testament to that."

So the spread we were able to achieve third quarter year-to-date was right around [ 161 ] basis points, and this is based on actual capital raised throughout the year. And for the quarter, it was closer to [ 165 ] basis points. 
And one of the things I'll point to is that in our investor deck, I believe it's Page 26, we do lay out precisely how we calculate our cost of capital. And there are basically 3 components to it, one of which is the free cash flow that we are generating as well as the cost of equity, loaded for the cost of raising that equity and our bond prices. 
But there was a strange thing that played out in the third quarter, and I don't know if I've got this fact 100% right. But we reached our 52-week high as well as our 52-week low during the third quarter. That was the level of volatility that we experienced. And we will call it luck, call it Jonathan Pong doing his thing. We were able to raise a lot of our equity capital on a forward basis with an average price of [ $68 ], and that's $2 billion worth of equity, $700 million of which we obviously was able to -- we were able to close and settle at the end of the third quarter, and $1.3 billion of which we will settle at the end of the fourth quarter. And so that's the reason why I want to be very precise around the actual realized spread versus what traditionally has been a calculation of average WACC over a given period. 
This is the first quarter where we felt like there was a massive diversion precisely driven by the volatility that I just spoke about. But yes, that's how we calculate our WACC."

R.J., it's going to be a function of how quickly the cap rates adjust. Clearly, there are mechanisms available to us on the capital side and on the financing side that we are going to avail of, but that's limited in terms of what is the ultimate spread that we can realize. And we are being incredibly disciplined around making sure that the team is pivoting to hurdle that we need to achieve on the cap rate side in order to continue to maintain spreads that we feel like represents the right spread for the kind of risk that we are taking based on the acquisitions that we are pursuing. 
And I think I mentioned this in the second quarter, but I'll say it again: I have been pleasantly surprised with how quickly cap rates have moved. And again, based on some of the transactions that we are seeing in our pipeline, we are very optimistic that we'll be able to continue to maintain the spreads that we have historically maintained. And we see that over the continuing next few quarters. 
But timing will be of the essence. Like I said, if there are certain transactions that we entered into, especially on the development side, that was -- that 12 months ago, those are going to not be quite as accretive transactions that we are entering into today, which will potentially close in the fourth quarter, and some of which will close in the first quarter, that have spreads that are more in line with what our historical spreads have been.

I think that is part of the reason why you saw a tailing off on the sourcing side. 
We were averaging around $30 billion per quarter. Third quarter, I would still claim, was quite robust with $18 billion worth of sourcing, 1/3 of which was from the international market. And so on a relative basis, yes, there was a bit of a slowing down, and it's largely being driven by the time it takes for sellers to adjust to the new environment. And there, too, it really is a story of those that are institutional sellers, they are able to adjust to it a lot quicker than some of the noninstitutional, more private owners of real estate for whom it has taken and will take a little bit more time to adjust."

It should also come as no surprise to you that some of the institutional owners of real estate were far more willing to enter into sale leaseback as an alternative source of raising capital, especially given their traditional sources of capital, which may have been the leverage finance market or the high-yield market and the disruption that they saw there. And so about 50% of what we did in the third quarter were largely -- were sale-leaseback transactions. And so I think that will give you a flavor for some of the transactions that we did.

Having said that, I will say that the sellers in the U.S. are far more accepting of the changing financing environment than perhaps in Europe. And Europe is [ by country ]. It's a smaller market. And so it does take a little bit longer for things to adjust. 
Having said all of that, we are finding very good opportunities in the U.K. And now with the advent into Italy, I believe that momentum will continue. Because for precisely some of the reasons that I think we touched on during the second quarter, the debt markets are very unsettled. It has a very high cost associated with it. And that's driving some of the transactions actually on both sides of the pond. But one of the additional dynamics that we are seeing play out in Europe is some of the pressures that some of the funds are feeling. And in order for them to raise the appropriate level of capital, monetizing real estate is creating opportunities for us. 
And so I wouldn't read too much into it. There is still a very, very healthy pipeline that we have within Realty Income. And the sourcing volumes continue to be, yes, lower than what we saw in the first half, but still very healthy."

If Kroger is going out there, and this is a publicly announced transaction with regards to Albertsons, Kroger is still BBB rated. S&P reaffirmed the rating, although they did put it on a negative outlook. And they're acquiring Albertsons, which is a BB-rated credit, still solid rated. But I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing. Now there are obviously a lot of other social issues that we have to also address and take into consideration. But from a pure credit standpoint, it's actually -- it's a stronger outcome for us that suddenly 30 basis points that we have of Albertsons that has a BB credit associated with it is now going to get enhanced to a BBB rating. 
So from a purely a credit perspective, that's not necessarily a bad outcome for us, but that obviously doesn't address a lot of other issues that should be addressed and, I think, is percolating through the markets today around the viability of this combination.

We'll see how it all plays out. 
With regards to Regal and the ultimate outcome, you read a fair amount of optimism into some of our prepared remarks and when we have answered questions directly. That is a true read. I'm not saying that Regal will continue to run 41 assets when they emerge from Chapter 11, but what I am telling you is the ultimate economic outcome on this portfolio, we feel very comfortable about. And a lot of it has largely been driven by unsolicited inbounds that we have been receiving, even on some of the assets that we recognized to be not very good performers and recognizing that the best use for these assets perhaps may not be a theater asset going forward, but something totally different. And when you start to look at where these are located, the amount of land, in some cases, north of 10 acres, creating a mixed use or a multifamily makes it tremendous amounts. And value creation opportunities for us to partner with some of these developers can create a lot of value for us. 
Yes, it's going to take time, but we feel fairly optimistic that the ultimate economic outcome on this portfolio will be one that we will be very comfortable with."

You just need one other competitor to come in and undercut what the normal situation would dictate in terms of cap rates to continue to keep a [ lid ] on cap rates. Having said all of that, if you look at the trend lines, there is no doubt that cap rates are moving, and they're moving much faster than -- and I've said this before -- than what I expected. 
It is also true that clients with whom we have relationships, we've been able to enter into contracts with them where we've asked even from where we first started and didn't have a contract to when they came back and reengaged with us and said, look, the cost of capital environment has changed for us. This is what we'll be able to do. They're still chosen to work with us exclusively, and these tend to be larger transactions. So there is no doubt that having fewer competitors out there who have the cost of capital, to be able to transact that spreads that would be acceptable to their investors, creates an opportunity for us. And this is a relative gain. 
We have been able to move cap rates, but I think it would be overstating if I were to tell you that everything that happens going forward, we are going to be the beneficiary of. That's not the case. But we will do better than our share. I think that, Ron, you can take away from what I'm saying."

And if that -- if the transaction size continues to be bigger and bigger, you're going to start going beyond that is how you should think about it. 
There is a dearth in this particular environment of potential buyers being able to write large checks, and that is our single biggest advantage today, along with the fact that, obviously, on a relative basis, our cost of capital has held up. But it is going to be very much a asset-by-asset, portfolio-by-portfolio discussion in terms of what is that delta between the one-off market and the portfolio market. 
In terms of how long is it going to take, I'll tell you that a Chick-fil-A -- 15-year Chick-fil-A will still trade in the [ forest ] today. There is enough buyers -- private buyers who can write a check for $5 million or $4 million who don't necessarily need to rely on the debt markets in order to do so. And so it's a tough question to answer in terms of how quickly the one-off market is going to adjust. 
There will be an adjustment, there's no doubt, because even a lot of the private buyers would lean on the debt markets to finance some of their asset purchase. But it's tough for me to -- I mean I saw this Chick-fil-A example literally a week ago, and I asked the team what is the ask and what do you think it's going to trade at. And the answer was mid-4s. 
And so how long will it take for that to adjust? Who knows? The good news here is it helps us on the disposition side. And if we have one-off assets that we feel like we can take advantage of this market, we'll certainly do so. It's not a big part of our business. But like I said, more than 70% of what we buy are portfolio deals. And so there, I think we are getting the kind of differential that it warrants. And so we continue to focus on that side of the business."

And it's a very interesting geography, Italy is. It's the fourth largest GDP in Europe.

And that's the reason why we find Italy to be very fascinating. The -- and we haven't disclosed the cap rates. But suffice it to say, it was a very healthy cap rate. And even in this environment, is allowing us to capture spreads that are very acceptable to us. 
The point about Europe that I want you to take away is not so much that cap rates taking longer to adjust. It is adjusting. It will take longer. But to your point, I think the pain in Europe is going to be a lot longer than the pain that we are planning on experiencing here in the U.S. And therefore, it will create opportunities.

And I want to remind you, Harsh, when you think about when we first went into the U.K., this was in 2019, retail was not in favor. Brexit has dominated the conversation, and we were able to do deals that subsequent to us having done those deals, cap rates compressed to the tune of 70 basis points, 80 basis points, perhaps even more. And so we are going to be opportunistic. We are going to position ourselves and use our inherent competitive advantages to execute transactions where it makes sense. But yes, we will be very diligent and very selective. But we didn't enter Europe to shy away when things got rough. We believe the exact opposite that it's going to be at times like this and what we believe will happen in Europe over the next 12 months that will create opportunities for us."

And the fact that we do have 11,700 assets, we tend to control a lot more of the assets for a given client. And so not talking about leverage, but we can have a much more holistic conversation with clients that not only take into account near-term resolutions, but midterm resolutions as well and come up with a win-win situation, and therefore, be able to get the kind of re-leasing spreads that we have. 
Having said all of that, it is quite -- I'm very happy that we were able to do 108%, but it is -- I want to view it as an outlier. But if you look at the history of the company, since we've been reporting this, we've basically been right around 100%, 101% net of re-leasing spreads.

So I don't know if I would say to you, Nick, that, that 5 9 would be dramatically different today, but we haven't seen an asset like that yet. So difficult for me to opine on that."

At Realty Income, we pride ourselves in having a consistent and dependable business model. For 53 years as an operating company, we have persevered through a variety of macroeconomic climates, and our track record of stability, notably during periods of volatility, is particularly relevant during current times.
We sit here today well positioned and operating very well across all areas of our business. We are grateful for all of our team members who make the success possible. 
To start off, we capitalized on opportunities to bolster our balance sheet in the third quarter, including raising over $2 billion of equity on the ATM, with approximately $700 million of proceeds received during the third quarter as well as over $1.3 billion remaining, subject to our settlement on a forward basis in alignment with our capital strategy. In addition, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in October to further increase our liquidity.
Between cash and cash equivalents, our availability under our credit facility, our liquidity as of the end of the third quarter was over $2.5 billion, which, when combined with the $1.3 billion of our unsettled forward equity and approximately $744 million in net bond proceeds, equates to liquidity of approximately $4.6 billion had the forwards and net bond proceeds being received at quarter end.
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we acquired approximately $1.9 billion in high-quality real estate, bringing us to approximately $5.1 billion in acquisitions year-to-date. A significant portion of the properties purchased in Q3 were part of portfolio deals or large transactions. We believe these deals were accessible to us because of our size, scale, relationships, ability to close access to and cost of capital, together with our research and technology-driven analytics capabilities.
For Realty Income, our competitive advantages allow us to design and execute on strategies that benefit all those we serve, including our clients. The pending $1.7 billion Encore Boston Harbor transaction, which we continue to expect to close this year, remains an example of this dynamic. Based on our current total portfolio annualized base rent, the transaction would comprise approximately 3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent once closed.
Further leveraging our international capabilities, we made our advent into Italy last week, investing approximately EUR 165 million in 7 high-performing wholesale clubs operated by Metro AG in major Italian cities like Rome and Florence. Metro is a pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry and operates almost 700 stores across Europe. Metro is publicly listed and investment-grade rated and has continued to perform well during and since the pandemic. We are delighted to add them as a client and hope we will be able to add to this initial portfolio over time.
During the third quarter, we did experience cap rate expansion, registering a 6.1% cash cap rate on investments, which compares favorably to the 5.7% cap rate we realized our investments in the second quarter. This resulted in a third quarter investment spread of 165 basis points based on actual capital raised, which is higher than our year-to-date total of 161 basis points and above our historical average. As we move towards year-end, we continue to see cap rates push higher as capital costs increase. This is consistent with the historical correlation we've come to expect, which has tended to preserve investment spreads as the market adjusts.
Transaction flow remains strong, with sourcing volume totaling approximately $18 billion this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume approximately $78 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 6.5% of sourced volume year-to-date.
The international market continues to be an important part of our strategy, and it remains an active component of our volume, representing approximately 33% of investment volume in the third quarter.
Capital recycling continues to be a strong component of our funding strategy, which also has the dual purpose of culling noncore properties from the portfolio. During the third quarter, we sold 34 properties, generating net sale proceeds of $142 million at an unlevered IRR of 12.8%, illustrating the full cycle attractiveness of owning net lease real estate under long-term leases. We intend to continue to act opportunistically to dispose of assets at moments in time when we can obtain attractive risk-adjusted returns.
In addition to the disposition of properties on our balance sheet, we also sold our interest in 7 properties owned in an industrial JV that we assumed as part of our VEREIT merger. The gross purchase price totaled $905 million at a low 4% cap rate. Our share of net sale proceeds was approximately $113.5 million.
Our core portfolio continues to perform, and by and large, our clients have generally continued to perform very well despite the cyclical market changes and shifts in consumer behavior. A point to note, as previously publicly announced, one of our clients, Cineworld, commenced Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September. Despite being one of its largest landlords, Cineworld represented only 1.5% of our total portfolio annualized base rent as of Q3. We'll continue working closely with Cineworld as this process continues towards resolution.
For some color regarding theaters, for the third quarter 2022, we collected approximately 85% of the contractual rent across our theater portfolio as Cineworld Group plc was not yet required to pay rent for the month of September. For the month of October 2022, we have collected 100% of the contractual rent across our theater clients, including Cineworld.
For some specifics, our Cineworld portfolio consists of 41 properties, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement, and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Through September, we have recognized $23.5 million of cumulative reserves on these properties, representing primarily contractual rent and expense recoveries that have not been collected dating back to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These 22 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $1.6 million of monthly contractual base rent or 40% of our total exposure to Cineworld. Based on current public information and our internal analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets are generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio.
Our locations are freestanding single-tenant assets typically with large land areas and close proximity to population centers, supporting potential conversion to residential, industrial or life science uses. We have received reverse inquiries from multifamily and industrial developers exploring opportunities on these sites. We believe there is alternative and adaptive reuse potential if Regal were to vacate any locations as part of bankruptcy.
Moving on to some of the most important key operational metrics delivering value that continue to demonstrate a consistent well-positioned real estate portfolio. At the end of the third quarter, our occupancy was 98.9%. In Q3, we re-leased 169 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 108.5%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 106.7%. As we look forward, less than 4% of our contractual base rent comes due through the end of 2023, providing strong visibility into our near-term portfolio performance. At quarter end, approximately 43% of our portfolio's total annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Our properties leased to clients in our portfolio watch list represented less than 4% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent.
Lastly, our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date, and we continue to expect full year same-store growth to be approximately 2%.
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

In the third quarter, our business generated $0.98 per share of AFFO, representing 7.7% year-over-year growth. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAre was 5.3x or 5.2x, giving effect to the annualization of net investment activity during the quarter. These ratios do not reflect the $1.3 billion in outstanding equity forwards we had at quarter end.
As Sumit previously mentioned, we were both active and prudent in our capital-raising efforts since the end of the second quarter.
In addition to raising over $2 billion during the quarter at an initial weighted average price of approximately $68 per share, subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $750 million bond transaction, the majority of which served as a synthetic euro offering to take advantage of favorable foreign exchange dynamics while also allowing us to return to the U.S. dollar public fixed income market, which we last accessed in 2020.
In conjunction with this offering, we executed a USD 600 million to euro 10-year cross-currency swap, resulting in the receipt of approximately $612 million in euro proceeds, an effective fixed rate euro-denominated semiannual yield to maturity of 4.7%. Additionally, giving effect to $500 million of interest rate hedges, which were terminated with the off-rating, we generated a $72 million cash settlement gain at pricing, which, when amortized over the 10-year tenure of the note, is expected to result in an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 3.93%.
Financial flexibility has long been a hallmark of our strategy, and our ability to move between various financing markets given our international capital needs is a competitive advantage.
As previously reported in the third quarter, we upsized our U.S. commercial paper program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established a euro commercial paper program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our multicurrency $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, gives us the flexibility to efficiently match fund our short-term funding needs in various currencies at much lower rates than comparable U.S. facility borrowings. 
As we look forward, we have limited near-term refinancing risk as only $23 million of mortgage debt comes due through the end of 2023 and our next unsecured debt maturity is not until 2024. With continued stable and consistent results in the quarter, we tightened our AFFO guidance range by $0.06 to $3.87 to $3.94, maintaining the midpoint at a 9% year-over-year growth rate, consistent with what we initially provided a year ago.
As the monthly dividend company, Realty Income's dividend will remain sacrosanct to our mission. This is a testament to our confidence in the time-tested consistency of our business model supported by a conservative balance sheet and diverse real estate portfolio leased to clients that are leaders in their respective industries.
In September, we increased the dividend for the 117th time and for the 100th consecutive quarter, representing a 5.1% increase compared to the dividend declared 1 year ago. We are proud of these accomplishments and the work our talented colleagues perform every day to help drive this consistent track record.
Earlier this week, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our VEREIT merger. We've grown together as one team over the last year, and I'm pleased that we remained on track to realize over $50 million in run rate annual cost synergies that we estimated when we announced the merger.
And with that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit."

We are definitely seeing movement in cap rates. If we were to compare it to what -- where the environment was at the beginning of the year, which is what I would say we saw over the last couple of years, and compare i",650,"It's more the former than the latter. We are definitely seeing movement in cap rates. If we were to compare it to what -- where the environment was at the beginning of the year, which is what I would say we saw over the last couple of years, and compare it to cap rates that we are seeing today and what we experienced in the third quarter, I would say retail cap rates have moved circa 100 basis points. And it's a story of basically 2 ends of the credit spectrum.
If you think about the high investment-grade grocery assets, those at the beginning of the year were trading in the low 4 cap rate range, and those have moved the most. I would say today, they are in the 5.5%, maybe even in the 5.6% ZIP code. So that's about 150 basis points. And then on the other end of the spectrum, it was the higher yielding cap rates that had compressed quite a bit over the last few years that also saw similar movement. But the stuff that was in between has seen movements circa of 100 basis points, and that's really what is starting to translate into actual realized cap rates that you noticed for the third quarter. 
Having said all of that, things don't happen at the spur of the moment. I mean a lot of these transactions -- we started to have discussions with our potential clients about the movement that we were seeing in our cost of capital, which was quite brutal and quite immediate. And thanks to the relationships, thanks to our ability to close all of the things that I enumerated in my prepared remarks, some of the more institutional type clients were also experiencing similar dynamics, and were more than willing to adjust cap rates to continue to do business and continue to fund their respective businesses. And I think that's what you sort of saw translating to the 40 basis points of increased cap rate that we were able to realize in the third quarter. But it is a timing thing.
I just want to be very careful that depending on -- if, for instance, if the gaming asset in Boston, if that were to have closed in the third quarter, that's already been sort of -- it's a transaction that's going to have a 5.9% cap rate, that's going to sway the overall cap rate. So it really is a question of when did those transactions get under contract and what is the timing of close that's going to dictate what the quarter results are. But having said all of that, I think we are definitely seeing movement, and it is in the quantum that I described earlier.
It's a similar story on the industrial side. I would say that industrial cap rates have also moved considerably, and this is something that we started seeing even in the early part of the year. I think in my first quarter comments, I had talked about maybe seeing a 25 to 50 basis point movement. This was on the heels of Amazon announcing that they are no longer going to be big takers of industrial assets. They accounted for about 20% of the volume over the last few years. That started to see some movement -- that resulted in some movement on the industrial side. And then that movement continued through the second quarter. 
And I'll say today, despite what we quoted in our joint venture that we sold in the low 4s, I would say similar assets that we were pursuing are in the 5.5 ZIP code today. So there's clearly movement. And the hope is that the movement will continue in the right direction over the next coming months. And our portfolio is a testament -- our portfolio as well as our pipeline is a testament to that."

A couple of other things is also just our access to the international borrowings, which are a nice tailwind, and you can see that demonstrated in what we were able to do with the euro commercial paper program. And as Sumit articulated, our relationships with clients, our ability to pivot in the marketplace, together with our strong pipeline and the timing of the Encore transaction, which could be a positive or a negative.

So the spread we were able to achieve third quarter year-to-date was right around 161 basis points, and this is based on actual capital raised throughout the year. And for the quarter, it was closer to 165 basis points.
And one of the things I'll point to is that in our investor deck, I believe it's Page 26, we do lay out precisely how we calculate our cost of capital. And there are basically 3 components to it, one of which is the free cash flow that we are generating as well as the cost of equity, loaded for the cost of raising that equity and our bond prices.
But there was a strange thing that played out in the third quarter, and I don't know if I've got this fact 100% right. But we reached our 52-week high as well as our 52-week low during the third quarter. That was the level of volatility that we experienced. And we will call it luck, call it Jonathan Pong doing his thing. We were able to raise a lot of our equity capital on a forward basis with an average price of $68 and that's $2 billion worth of equity, $700 million of which we obviously was able to -- we were able to close and settle at the end of the third quarter, and $1.3 billion of which we will settle at the end of the fourth quarter. And so that's the reason why I want to be very precise around the actual realized spread versus what traditionally has been a calculation of average WACC over a given period.
This is the first quarter where we felt like there was a massive diversion precisely driven by the volatility that I just spoke about. But yes, that's how we calculate our WACC."

R.J., it's going to be a function of how quickly the cap rates adjust. Clearly, there are mechanisms available to us on the capital side and on the financing side that we are going to avail of, but that's limited in terms of what is the ultimate spread that we can realize. And we are being incredibly disciplined around making sure that the team is pivoting to hurdle rates that we need to achieve on the cap rate side in order to continue to maintain spreads that we feel like represents the right spread for the kind of risk that we are taking based on the acquisitions that we are pursuing.
And I think I mentioned this in the second quarter, but I'll say it again: I have been pleasantly surprised with how quickly cap rates have moved. And again, based on some of the transactions that we are seeing in our pipeline, we are very optimistic that we'll be able to continue to maintain the spreads that we have historically maintained. And we see that over the continuing next few quarters.
But timing will be of the essence. Like I said, if there are certain transactions that we entered into, especially on the development side, that was -- that's 12 months ago, those are going to not be quite as accretive transactions that we are entering into today, which will potentially close in the fourth quarter, and some of which will close in the first quarter, that have spreads that are more in line with what our historical spreads have been.

And it goes back to having sticky sellers, sellers who haven't quite embraced the changing cost of capital environment who are hoping for this to have a shorter duration disruption and starting to recognize that given what the Fed is doing, given what they're seeing on the inflation side, that this may be a longer process than what they had anticipated. I think that is part of the reason why you saw a tailing off on the sourcing side.
We were averaging around $30 billion per quarter. Third quarter, I would still claim, was quite robust with $18 billion worth of sourcing, 1/3 of which was from the international market. And so on a relative basis, yes, there was a bit of a slowing down, and it's largely being driven by the time it takes for sellers to adjust to the new environment. And there, too, it really is a story of those that are institutional sellers, they are able to adjust to it a lot quicker than some of the noninstitutional, more private owners of real estate for whom it has taken and will take a little bit more time to adjust."

And so it will come as no surprise to you that over 70% of what we did were portfolio deals in the third quarter. It should also come as no surprise to you that some of the institutional owners of real estate were far more willing to enter into sale leaseback as an alternative source of raising capital, especially given their traditional sources of capital, which may have been the leverage finance market or the high-yield market and the disruption that they saw there. And so about 50% of what we did in the third quarter were largely -- were sale-leaseback transactions. And so I think that will give you a flavor for some of the transactions that we did. 
It was still mostly, I want to say, 94% was retail, and there was about 4%, 4.5% of industrial assets that we did, but largely driven by what we are seeing on the retail side."

Having said that, I will say that the sellers in the U.S. are far more accepting of the changing financing environment than perhaps in Europe. And Europe is -- by country, it's a smaller market. And so it does take a little bit longer for things to adjust.
Having said all of that, we are finding very good opportunities in the U.K. And now with the advent into Italy, I believe that momentum will continue. Because for precisely some of the reasons that I think we touched on during the second quarter, the debt markets are very unsettled. It has a very high cost associated with it. And that's driving some of the transactions actually on both sides of the pond. But one of the additional dynamics that we are seeing play out in Europe is some of the pressures that some of the funds are feeling. And in order for them to raise the appropriate level of capital, monetizing real estate is creating opportunities for us.
And so I wouldn't read too much into it. There is still a very, very healthy pipeline that we have within Realty Income. And the sourcing volumes continue to be, yes, lower than what we saw in the first half, but still very healthy."

Look, I mean, anytime you have consolidation, the question needs to be asked, who is doing the consolidation? If Kroger is going out there, and this is a publicly announced transaction with regards to Albertsons, Kroger is still BBB rated. S&P reaffirmed the rating, although they did put it on a negative outlook. And they're acquiring Albertsons, which is a BB-rated credit, still solid rated. But I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing. Now there are obviously a lot of other social issues that we have to also address and take into consideration. But from a pure credit standpoint, it's actually -- it's a stronger outcome for us that suddenly 30 basis points that we have of Albertsons that has a BB credit associated with it is now going to get enhanced to a BBB rating.
So from a purely credit perspective, that's not necessarily a bad outcome for us, but that obviously doesn't address a lot of other issues that should be addressed and, I think, is percolating through the markets today around the viability of this combination. But by and large, there isn't a standard answer that all consolidation is good. It really does depend on the specific situations."

With regards to Regal and the ultimate outcome, you read a fair amount of optimism into some of our prepared remarks and when we have answered questions directly. That is a true read. I'm not saying that Regal will continue to run 41 assets when they emerge from Chapter 11, but what I am telling you is the ultimate economic outcome on this portfolio, we feel very comfortable about. And a lot of it has largely been driven by unsolicited inbounds that we have been receiving, even on some of the assets that we recognized to be not very good performers and recognizing that the best use for these assets perhaps may not be a theater asset going forward, but something totally different. And when you start to look at where these are located, the amount of land, in some cases, north of 10 acres, creating a mixed use or a multifamily makes it tremendous amount of sense. And the value creation opportunities for us to partner with some of these developers can create a lot of value for us.

It is also true that clients with whom we have relationships, we've been able to enter into contracts with them where we've asked even from where we first started and didn't have a contract to when they came back and reengaged with us and said, look, the cost of capital environment has changed for us. This is what we'll be able to do. They're still chosen to work with us exclusively, and these tend to be larger transactions. So there is no doubt that having fewer competitors out there who have the cost of capital, to be able to transact that spreads that would be acceptable to their investors, creates an opportunity for us.

Harsh, that's a very difficult question. But if you are forcing me to answer that question, I would say anywhere in the region of 20 to 30 basis points, 35 basis points.

But if you are forcing me to answer that question, I would say anywhere in the region of 20 to 30 basis points, 35 basis points. And if that -- if the transaction size continues to be bigger and bigger, you're going to start going beyond that is how you should think about it.
There is a dearth in this particular environment of potential buyers being able to write large checks, and that is our single biggest advantage today, along with the fact that, obviously, on a relative basis, our cost of capital has held up. But it is going to be very much an asset-by-asset, portfolio-by-portfolio discussion in terms of what is that delta between the one-off market and the portfolio market.
In terms of how long is it going to take, I'll tell you that a Chick-fil-A -- 15-year Chick-fil-A will still trade in the [ 4s ] today. There is enough buyers -- private buyers who can write a check for $5 million or $4 million who don't necessarily need to rely on the debt markets in order to do so. And so it's a tough question to answer in terms of how quickly the one-off market is going to adjust.
There will be an adjustment, there's no doubt, because even a lot of the private buyers would lean on the debt markets to finance some of their asset purchase. But it's tough for me to -- I mean I saw this Chick-fil-A example literally a week ago, and I asked the team what is the ask and what do you think it's going to trade at. And the answer was [ mid-4s ].
And so how long will it take for that to adjust? Who knows? The good news here is it helps us on the disposition side. And if we have one-off assets that we feel like we can take advantage of this market, we'll certainly do so. It's not a big part of our business. But like I said, more than 70% of what we buy are portfolio deals. And so there, I think we are getting the kind of differential that it warrants. And so we continue to focus on that side of the business."

Look, that's a fantastic transaction. We started having conversations around this transaction if I want to -- maybe at the beginning of this year, perhaps even late last year. And it's a very interesting geography, Italy is. It's the fourth largest GDP in Europe. It is one that we feel like we can find these types of transactions with investment-grade rated or highly rated operators executing very good businesses who are looking for real estate partners. And that's the reason why we find Italy to be very fascinating. The -- and we haven't disclosed the cap rates. But suffice it to say, it was a very healthy cap rate. And even in this environment, is allowing us to capture spreads that are very acceptable to us.
The point about Europe that I want you to take away is not so much that cap rates taking longer to adjust. It is adjusting. It will take longer. But to your point, I think the pain in Europe is going to be a lot longer than the pain that we are planning on experiencing here in the U.S. And therefore, it will create opportunities. And we want to be front in line to take advantage of those opportunities.
And I think under Neil's tutelage, the team is very comfortable, continuing to cultivate the relationships that they have established and in some of the areas that we would like to grow our business. That work is already being -- is already underway. And so this is going to continue to be a very important area of growth for our business.
And I want to remind you, Harsh, when you think about when we first went into the U.K., this was in 2019, retail was not in favor. Brexit has dominated the conversation, and we were able to do deals that subsequent to us having done those deals, cap rates compressed to the tune of 70 basis points, 80 basis points, perhaps even more. And so we are going to be opportunistic. We are going to position ourselves and use our inherent competitive advantages to execute transactions where it makes sense. But yes, we will be very diligent and very selective. But we didn't enter into Europe to shy away when things got rough. We believe the exact opposite that it's going to be at times like this and what we believe will happen in Europe over the next 12 months that will create opportunities for us."

It's a testament to us controlling more assets for given operators. There is certainly a backdrop of -- switching costs have gotten much higher for a lot of our clients. One of the things that we would compete with is the ability for our clients to basically say I'm going to go and build a new asset down the road. And that's going to be a better outcome. But now given the inflationary environment, given the construction costs, the switching cost hurdles have certainly crept up. And the fact that we do have 11,700 assets, we tend to control a lot more of the assets for a given client. And so not talking about leverage, but we can have a much more holistic conversation with clients that not only take into account near-term resolutions, but midterm resolutions as well and come up with a win-win situation, and therefore, be able to get the kind of re-leasing spreads that we have.
Having said all of that, it is quite -- I'm very happy that we were able to do a 108%, but it is -- I want to view it as an outlier. But if you look at the history of the company, since we've been reporting this, we've basically been right around 100%, 101% net of re-leasing spreads. So this, on a proportion basis, is certainly higher, and I think it's a testament to the environment we find ourselves."

Renewing with an existing client based on the 5% increase, engaging with an existing client that is asking for a 10% reduction from where it's closing and then looking at the alternative of selling the assets and putting the proceeds to use in the current cap rate environment. Once we go through that decision tree, and let's also throw in repositioning of the asset as a fourth variable, we decide what is the most favorable outcome.
And so far, the outcome that -- for the last few years has been resulting in north of 103%, 104%, 105% of re-leasing spreads, but it is possible that it might revert back to 100% or 101% because it is more favorable for us to keep an existing client while taking a bit of a haircut.
