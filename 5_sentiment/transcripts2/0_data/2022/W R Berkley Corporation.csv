And I would echo Josh's comment welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me are cohosting with me is also Bill Berkley, Executive Chairman; and Rich Baio, Group CFO. We're going to follow a similar agenda to what we've done in the past. I'm going to hand it over to Rich in short order. He's going to walk us through some of the highlights from the quarter and the year, and then he'll hand it back to me. I'll offer a couple of quick thoughts, and then we'll quickly move on to the Q&A session. 
But before I do hand it over to Rich, I did want to make a couple of very quick comments. I guess number one is, I think anyone who's has had an opportunity to have a look at the release, you would have recognized that it was a great year, and it was a great way to finish off with a sort of -- this doesn't happen on its own, and I just wanted to take again a moment to both thank and congratulate my colleagues. This is very much a team sport, so the appreciation goes to everyone throughout the organization. 
Let me pivot also to a couple of macro observations. We can obviously get consumed by the results of the past 90 days or the results for the year. But we also spent a good deal of time thinking about what the business is going to be doing going forward, how we are positioned for the environment that we see coming our way. And quite frankly, we are very encouraged on multiple fronts. If we start by examining the underwriting side of the business, the growth that you saw throughout the year, including the fourth quarter remains very robust. It's coming through in both exposure as well as rates, and we really do not see that losing momentum. And Rich and I will be talking a little bit more about that later on. 
But again, as we see it, the growth will continue and the rate increases. There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to be able to get rate increases that outpace trend by something that would be measured in the hundreds of basis points. So again, very promising front. Turning over for a moment to the investment side of the business. Again, we have, in my opinion, taking a very disciplined approach for an extended period of time in keeping not just the quality high, but the duration short. 
As we've discussed in the past, this has come at a price. But we think that we're going to be rewarded for that discipline going forward as you see interest rates moving up. You're going to see an opportunity for us to invest at higher rates, and you're going to see an opportunity for us to, under those circumstances, take the duration back out or extended. Both of these circumstances on the underwriting side and how we are poised there as well as how we're positioned on the investment side are going to have a very meaningful impact on the company's economic model. 
And as this unfolds, I think it's going to be quite consequential of what it's going to mean for the earnings power of the business. So let me pause there, and I will hand it over to Rich. And I'll be back once he is through with his comments with a few other observations. And then we will, again, as promised, move it over to Q&A. Rich?"
254504,1763386857,2479137,"W. R. Berkley Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2022",2022-01-27,"Earnings Calls","W. R. Berkley Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rob. And obviously, I'll be focusing on the financial side here. So the company had another terrific quarter, as Rob had alluded to, with a number of areas reaching record level on a quarterly basis as well as on a full year basis. Operating in",827,"Thank you, Rob. And obviously, I'll be focusing on the financial side here. So the company had another terrific quarter, as Rob had alluded to, with a number of areas reaching record level on a quarterly basis as well as on a full year basis. Operating income increased 64% over the prior year's quarter to a record $284 million or $1.53 per share. On a full year basis, operating income reached a record $952 million or $5.10 per share. The key contributors are related to record underwriting results for the quarter and full year as well as strong net investment income. 
The positive momentum in the business continued throughout the year with growth in quarterly gross premiums written of 24.5% to almost $2.8 billion, bringing us to a record $10.7 billion for the full year. Similarly, net premiums written grew 26.6% toward full year of approximately $8.9 billion. On Page 7 of the earnings release, [indiscernible] net premiums written by line of business for the comparable periods. All lines of business grew in the Assurant segment, including workers' compensation, albeit from incline payrolls. 
The total for this segment amounted to $2 billion with a [indiscernible] 25.8% for the prior year. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment also grew in all lines of business, totaling $273 million and growing 33% for the quarter. The growth in exposure and compounding rate improvements in most lines of business will continue to earn through the income statement. In the 3 most recent consecutive quarters, total net premiums written had an average increase of almost 26%, which has contributed to the acceleration in net premiums earned of 17% for the full year. Pretax quarterly underwriting income was a record $261 million, surpassing 2 other core records this year. 
On a full year basis, record pretax underwriting income of $845 million was more than twice to next closest year, which occurred in 2019. The company continued to [ straight ] its management to cat exposes and despite heightened cat activity, such losses did not materially impact our earnings. We reported cat losses of $49 million or 2.2 loss ratio points compared with $42 million or 2.3 loss ratio points in the prior year. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 1 loss ratio point to 58.2%, primarily driven by rate improvements. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by approximately $1.3 million in the current quarter. 
That brings our reported loss ratio to 60.4%. The expense ratio continued to improve over the prior year, representing a benefit of 1.8 points to 27.8%. The growth in net premiums earned continues to be a major contributor to the improvement in our expense ratio as it outpaced expenses by 7.4% in the quarter. Our newer operating units continue to grow their portfolio, adding scale to the business and moving closer to a more normalized expense ratio. We continue to make investments in the business as evidenced by the 3 newly formed operating units as we look into their future prospects. 
We anticipate that our expense ratio for 2022 should be in the range of 28% to 29%. Closing out the underwriting performance, our current accident year combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 86% for the quarter compared with 88.8% for the prior year quarter. Turning to investments. Net investment income was $165 million for the quarter. The [indiscernible] investment portfolio, primarily investment funds, provided strong results. Our core portfolio improved despite the low interest rate environment. On a full year basis, our investment income of $672 million is only a few million dollars lower than our record reported in 2018. 
We continue to maintain a highly liquid portfolio with a duration of 2.4 years and maintained a high credit quality of AA-. Operating cash flows remained strong throughout the year with a record level of almost $2.2 billion for the full year. Pretax net investing in the quarter was driven by increased unrealized gains in our equity portfolio, contributing to the full year results of $107 million. The full year realized gains included the sale of a private equity investment and real estate property sales. 
The effective tax rate was 17% in the current quarter, which largely benefited from a lower foreign effective tax rate and investments in [ taxi ] securities and dividend-paying equity securities, along with closing certain examinations with tax authorities and truing up our prior year tax accrual. Stockholders' equity increased to almost $6.7 billion as of year-end after returning capital of $200 million in the quarter and $478 million for the full year. The company repurchased 0.75 million shares throughout the year at an average prior share of $69.85. 
Book value per share before dividends and share repurchases increased 3% in the quarter and 12.5% on a full year basis. The annualized return on beginning of year equity for the quarter was 18.7% and 16.2% for the full year. With that, I'll conclude my remarks and turn it back to Rob."

But clearly, the line continues to be very healthy by any measurement. We like the balance that we see between rate versus exposure growth at 1/3, 2/3. I would tell you that, that's sort of what it all adds up to when we put all the pieces together. But we look at this at a very granular level. We're looking at it by line, by exposure by territory. And again, we're trying to make sure that we have the right balance there. Long story short, really, essentially across the board, we have the -- it's all about specialty business these days. 
And we have the right people, with the right expertise whether it's on the commercial line side, admitted or nonadmitted, whether it's domestic or international or certainly would not want to leave out our colleagues on the high [indiscernible] side. We are firing on basically all cylinders. Also on the top line, Rich touched on this, I would just mention, we do have [indiscernible] to the workers' common [indiscernible]. 
We think there still are opportunities there, but one needs to be very cautious. The growth that you see in that line, as Rick commented, is really being driven by payroll growth. Off the board, everywhere else, it's pretty much just really healthy growth as a result of the broader environment. The log show, Rich covered this, I would just add my two cents the 60.4% or the [ 58.2 ] if you want to slip on the rose-colored glasses, that's fine. But I think one of the things that we work very hard at is making sure that we peel back a few layers and really understand what's going on in the business. 
So one of the things -- and I know we've talked about this in past calls that I wanted to flag for people. And that is the paid loss ratio. And the paid loss ratio for the year of '21 was at 45.2%. [indiscernible] That was a 56.9%; '18 was 57.5%; '19 was a 55.2%; '20 was 51.9%. And then, of course, you can see the meaningful progress in '21. And again, that was pretty stable quarter-to-quarter. The expenses, Rich touched on that. We still are getting some benefit, if you will, from the lack of travel as a result of COVID, though that is starting to pick up a bit. 
I would say really what's driving it more than anything else is the growth in the earned premium. And as the business continues to grow, we're going to see the benefits on multiple fronts, including the expense piece. So long story short, the underwriting is looking really good. And as I commented earlier, there's a lot of momentum. And as we look at January, and we're looking at submissions and where it looks like things are coming out. There is nothing that leads us to believe that the environment is not stable or perhaps improving, and we're very encouraged by that. 
We touched on already, and Rich offered a few comments on the investment portfolio, but I would just flag for those that are interested, not to underestimate the leverage that exists in our economic model. We have, again, been very disciplined on many fronts, including the investment portfolio and the duration as rates move up and we take that duration out and the book yield moves up. I think one should not underestimate what that means for the earnings power of the business. 
And of course, that alongside with the underwriting margin and the health of that and the scale of the business overall, I think, bodes well for the foreseeable future. So I'm going to pause there. And let's pivot over to Q&A and talk about what you all would like to talk about. Josh, if we could please open it up for questions."

And are we certainly constantly -- and this moment, there's no exception making what I would define as meaningful investments and particularly data and technology? Yes, we absolutely are. That having been said, as we also discussed in the past, I love the growth in the business over the past couple of years. Much of it has come from rate. So as we are charging more for a widget, and it's the same work as before, there's meaningful leverage in that. 
In addition to that, we have many business that have not fully scaled. To their credit, they maintained the level of underwriting discipline and market conditions weren't there. They did not lean into the marketplace. But now that there are a meaningful amount of pockets within the industry or the broader market, quite frankly, ex comp, that is providing more attractive market conditions, those businesses are scaling, and we're seeing the expense ratios as they scale drop. So we're seeing growth across the board. And it's not that we're not investing in the business, both in people and technology. We are, and we're doing that heavily. At the same time, there's a lot of leverage in the model."

The results, as Rob pointed out, come about because of everyone's effort. But everyone's effort is a reflection of our starting point, which is risk-adjusted return. And in this business that means looking at lots of things that you don't really know the answer to for a while. So you make judgments, you anticipate where things are going and what things are happening. Some of the most important judgments are inflation, social and financial. 
It has to do with what you think is going to happen with the interest rates. And all of the myriad of things that impact the business. We have a much more tightly controlled company today than we did 10 years ago, but we have to because it's a more complex company. But we run our business in the same manner, we're nimble. We only are adjusting for changes we see in the future. And while we're optimistic, we're not naive. Everything we see leads us to believe that certainly, 2022 will be an excellent year. 
Looking beyond that, difficult, but the signs are positive. And the team is prepared. So we thank all of you for your support, and we continue to be optimistic as to what we see in the future and how our experienced, but nimble team will be able to deliver outstanding results."

And I would like to echo Josh's comment, welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me or cohosting with me is also Bill Berkley, Executive Chairman; and Rich Baio, Group CFO. We're going to follow a similar agenda to what we've done in the past. I'm going to hand it over to Rich in short order. He's going to walk us through some of the highlights from the quarter and the year, and then he'll hand it back to me. I'll offer a couple of quick thoughts, and then we'll quickly move on to the Q&A session.  
But before I do hand it over to Rich, I did want to make a couple of very quick comments. I guess number one is, I think anyone who's has had an opportunity to have a look at the release, you would have recognized that it was a great year, and it was a great way to finish off with a strong quarter. This doesn't happen on its own, and I just wanted to take again a moment to both thank and congratulate my colleagues. This is very much a team sport, so the appreciation goes to everyone throughout the organization.  
Let me pivot also to a couple of macro observations. We can obviously get consumed by the results of the past 90 days or the results for the year. But we also spent a good deal of time thinking about what the business is going to be doing going forward, how we are positioned for the environment that we see coming our way. And quite frankly, we are very encouraged on multiple fronts. If we start by examining the underwriting side of the business, the growth that you saw throughout the year, including the fourth quarter, remains very robust. It's coming through in both exposure as well as rates. And we really do not see that losing momentum. And Rich and I will be talking a little bit more about that later on.  
But again, as we see it, the growth will continue. And the rate increases, there's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to be able to get rate increases that outpace trend by something that would be measured in the hundreds of basis points. So again, very promising on that front. Pivoting over to -- for a moment to the investment side of the business. Again, we have, in my opinion, taken a very disciplined approach for an extended period of time in keeping not just the quality high, but the duration short.  
As we've discussed in the past, this has come at a price. But we think that we're going to be rewarded for that discipline going forward as you see interest rates moving up. You're going to see an opportunity for us to invest at higher rates, and you're going to see an opportunity for us to, under those circumstances, take the duration back out or extended. Both of these circumstances on the underwriting side and how we are poised there as well as how we're positioned on the investment side are going to have a very meaningful impact on the company's economic model.  
And as this unfolds, I think it's going to be quite consequential of what it's going to mean for the earnings power of the business. So let me pause there, and I will hand it over to Rich. And I'll be back once he's through with his comments with a few other observations. And then we will, again, as promised, move it over to Q&A. Rich?"

And obviously, I'll be focusing on the financial side here. So the company had another terrific quarter, as Rob had alluded to, with a number of areas reaching record level on a quarterly basis as well as on a full year basis. Operating in",834,"Thank you, Rob. And obviously, I'll be focusing on the financial side here. So the company had another terrific quarter, as Rob had alluded to, with a number of areas reaching record level on a quarterly basis as well as on a full year basis. Operating income increased 64% over the prior year's quarter to a record $284 million or $1.53 per share. On a full year basis, operating income reached a record $952 million or $5.10 per share. The key contributors are related to record underwriting results for the quarter and full year as well as strong net investment income.  
The positive momentum in the business continued throughout the year with growth in quarterly gross premiums written of 24.5% to almost $2.8 billion, bringing us to a record $10.7 billion for the full year. Similarly, net premiums written grew 26.6% quarter-over-quarter to about $2.3 billion and a record full year of approximately $8.9 billion. On Page 7 of the earnings release, you'll see net premiums written by line of business for the comparable periods. All lines of business grew in the Insurance segment, including workers' compensation, albeit from increasing payrolls.  
The total for this segment amounted to $2 billion with a growth of 25.8% over the prior year. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment also grew in all lines of business, totaling $273 million and growing 33% for the quarter. The growth in exposure and compounding rate improvements in most lines of business will continue to earn through the income statement. In the 3 most recent consecutive quarters, total net premiums written had an average increase of almost 26%, which has contributed to the acceleration in net premiums earned of 17% for the full year. Pretax quarterly underwriting income was a record $261 million, surpassing 2 other quarterly records this year.  
On a full year basis, record pretax underwriting income of $845 million was more than twice the next closest year, which occurred in 2019. The company continued to demonstrate its management to cat exposed business. And despite heightened cat activity, such losses did not materially impact our earnings. We reported cat losses of $49 million or 2.2 loss ratio points compared with $42 million or 2.3 loss ratio points in the prior year. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 1 loss ratio point to 58.2%, primarily driven by rate improvement. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by approximately $1.3 million in the current quarter.  
That brings our reported loss ratio to 60.4%. The expense ratio continued to improve over the prior year, representing a benefit of 1.8 points to 27.8%. The growth in net premiums earned continues to be a major contributor to the improvement in our expense ratio as it outpaced expenses by 7.4% in the quarter. Our newer operating units continue to grow their portfolio, adding scale to the business and moving closer to a more normalized expense ratio. We continue to make investments in the business as evidenced by the 3 newly formed operating units and we look into their future prospects.  
We anticipate that our expense ratio for 2022 should be in the range of 28% to 29%. Closing out the underwriting performance, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86% for the quarter compared with 88.8% for the prior year quarter. Turning to investments. Net investment income was $165 million for the quarter. The alternative investment portfolio, primarily investment funds, provided strong results. Our core portfolio improved despite the low interest rate environment. On a full year basis, our investment income of $672 million is only a few million dollars lower than our record reported in 2018.  
We continue to maintain a highly liquid portfolio with a duration of 2.4 years and maintained a high credit quality of AA-. Operating cash flows remained strong throughout the year with a record level of almost $2.2 billion for the full year. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter was driven by increased unrealized gains in our equity portfolio contributing to the full year results of $107 million. The full year realized gains included the sale of a private equity investment and real estate property sales.  
The effective tax rate was 17% in the current quarter, which largely benefited from a lower foreign effective tax rate and investments in tax-exempt securities and dividend-paying equity securities, along with closing certain examinations with tax authorities and truing up our prior year tax accrual. Stockholders' equity increased to almost $6.7 billion as of year-end after returning capital of $200 million in the quarter and $478 million for the full year. The company repurchased 1.75 million shares throughout the year at an average prior share of $69.85.  
Book value per share before dividends and share repurchases increased 3% in the quarter and 12.5% on a full year basis. The annualized return on beginning of year equity for the quarter was 18.7% and 16.2% for the full year. With that, I'll conclude my remarks and turn it back to Rob."

But clearly, the top line continues to be very healthy by any measurement. We like the balance that we see between rate versus exposure growth at 1/3, 2/3. I would tell you that that's sort of what it all adds up to when we put all the pieces together. But we look at this at a very granular level. We're looking at it by line, by exposure, by territory. And again, we're trying to make sure that we have the right balance there. Long story short, really, essentially across the board, we have the -- it's all about specialty business these days.  
And we have the right people, with the right expertise whether it's on the commercial line side, admitted or nonadmitted. Whether it's domestic or international or -- certainly would not want to leave out our colleagues on the high net worth side. We are firing on basically all cylinders. Also on the top line, Rich touched on this, I would just mention, we do have sensitivity to the workers' comp line.  
We think there still are opportunities there, but one needs to be very cautious. The growth that you see in that line, as Rich commented, is really being driven by payroll growth. Across the board, everywhere else, it's pretty much just really healthy growth as a result of the broader environment. The loss ratio, Rich covered this, I would just add my two cents the 60.4% or the 58.2%, if you want to slip on the rose-colored glasses, that's fine. But I think one of the things that we work very hard at is making sure that we peel back a few layers and really understand what's going on in the business.  
So one of the things -- and I know we've talked about this in past calls that I wanted to flag for people. And that is the paid loss ratio. And the paid loss ratio for the year of '21 was at 45.2%. And maybe to give you a couple of other data points. If you go back to 2017, that was a 56.9%; '18 was 57.5%; '19 was a 55.2%; '20 was 51.9%. And then, of course, you can see the meaningful progress in '21. And again, that was pretty stable quarter-to-quarter. The expenses, Rich touched on that. We still are getting some benefit, if you will, from the lack of travel as a result of COVID, though that is starting to pick up a bit.  
I would say really what's driving it more than anything else is the growth in the earned premium. And as the business continues to grow, we're going to see the benefits on multiple fronts, including the expense piece. So long story short, the underwriting is looking really good. And as I commented earlier, there's a lot of momentum. And as we look at January, and we're looking at submissions and where it looks like things are coming out, there is nothing that leads us to believe that the environment is not stable or perhaps improving. And we're very encouraged by that.  
We touched on already, and Rich offered a few comments on the investment portfolio, but I would just again flag for those that are interested, not to underestimate the leverage that exists in our economic model. We have, again, been very disciplined on many fronts, including the investment portfolio and the duration. As rates move up and we take that duration out and the book yield moves up, I think one should not underestimate what that means for the earnings power of the business.  
And of course, that alongside with the underwriting margin and the health of that and the scale of the business overall, I think, bodes well for the foreseeable future. So I'm going to pause there. And let's pivot over to Q&A and talk about what you all would like to talk about. Josh, if we could please open it up for questions."

If you do the math, arguably, we may be being, some might say cautious, others might say measured and thoughtful to the tune of 1 point plus or minus? Yes. But given the level of uncertainty and the leverage around those, we think it makes sense to be measured.

First off, I think you need to understand that, as Rich pointed out, the expense ratio was impacted by special dividends. And as you may recall or be aware, a component of compensation for senior officers is restricted stock that gets deferred. And as a result of that, the dividends, as Rich said, we expense those. So the onetime special dividend. In addition to that, there is certain -- there are other aspects of deferred comp like our long-term incentive plan that is driven off of the return of the company.  
So obviously, as the performance of the company improves, there is more expense associated with remuneration. That all having been said, from my perspective, as I suggested, I think -- and we've talked in the past, there's probably 30 to 50 basis points of positive impact as a result of people not traveling as much as they do in normal times. We certainly see the earned premium will continue to grow, and we have a variety of other moving pieces. I think we should also mention that we have some new businesses as we referenced in the release, and Rich touched on that.  
Obviously, when they are brand new, they don't have a lot of earned premium, they have expense. So long story short, we talked about it. And Rich being the good measured CPA that he is, came up with the 28% to 29%. Do I think that there's a chance that we can do better than that? Yes, I think there is."

And are we certainly constantly, and this moment, there's no exception, making what I would define as meaningful investments in particularly data and technology? Yes, we absolutely are. That having been said, as we also discussed in the past, a lot of the growth in the business over the past couple of years, much of it has come from rate. So as we are charging more for a widget, and it's the same work as before, there's meaningful leverage in that.  
In addition to that, we have many business that have not fully scaled. To their credit, they maintained the level of underwriting discipline. And when market conditions weren't there, they did not lean into the marketplace. But now that there are a meaningful number of pockets within the industry or the broader market, quite frankly, ex comp, that is providing more attractive market conditions, those businesses are scaling, and we're seeing the expense ratios as they scale drop. So we're seeing growth across the board. And it's not that we're not investing in the business, both in people and technology. We are, and we're doing that heavily. At the same time, there's a lot of leverage in the model."

If medical inflation broadly gets worse or the impact of wages going up, is that a different underwriting process than when you just defined the better performing risk in a more stable environment?"

On this end of the call, in addition to myself, you also have Bill Berkley, Executive Chair; as well as Rich Baio, our Group CFO. We're going to follow the usual agenda where I'm in short order, I'm going to hand it over to Rich. He's going to walk through the highlights of the quarter. Then once he's completed his comments, I'll tag along with a few of my own observations. And shortly thereafter, we'll be opening it up for Q&A and happy to take the conversation in any direction participants would like to do so.
That having been said, before I do hand it over to Rich because I always like to steal at least a little bit of his thunder, though, I don't think the comments will come as a surprise to anyone that's had an opportunity to review the release. It was a terrific quarter for the organization really by any metric to say the least. And quite frankly, we were able to achieve these results because of the efforts of the full team across the country and around the world. All working together to achieve these types of outcomes.
I think what's important to that point is to just remind ourselves, remind each other that this effort, this is a team sport, as I've commented in the past, it's not an individual sport. And quite frankly, this isn't rocket science what we're doing. Yes, we are very fortunate that we have a lot of very intelligent people on the team working very hard. But a lot of our success comes about because of discipline, because we focus on blocking and tackling in a thoughtful and consistent way every day, because we are not only consumed by what's in the rearview mirror but we are paying close attention to what we see out the front windshield.
It seems like common sense. But quite frankly, it requires great effort every day. And again, I think we're achieving these types of results because of the efforts of the full team. So congratulations to all.
I think beyond just the results, which again, I think, speak for themselves, I would suggest that perhaps what's as, if not more exciting, is quite frankly, how the table has been set for what is likely going to be a very strong balance of '22. Additionally, how things are being set up for what should be a very strong '23. And with every passing day, there are more pieces being put into place that would suggest that it's more likely than not that '24 will also be very promising as well.
So we, as an organization, continue to be very focused on building book value. We have an obsession around the concept of risk-adjusted return. I think that came into focus not just in this quarter, but in our ability to generate good returns regardless of what may have happened on the cat front in any quarter, it's the consistency have strong results that differentiate us in the marketplace.
So with that, let me hand it over to Rich to walk us through some of the highlights, and I will be back on the heels of his comments. Rich, if you would, please."

Appreciate it. The company continues to operate extremely well, as Rob had pointed out, reporting record quarterly underwriting income and net investment gains, both of which led to the 157% growth to record quarterly net income of $591 million or $2.12 per share on a common stock split effected basis.
Operating earnings also improved 52% to $307 million or $1.10 per share on a common stock split effected basis. The primary contributors were improvement in underwriting results by 2.3 points to a calendar year combined ratio of 87.8% and growth in net investment income of almost 9.5%.
Going more into the details with our top line first. Gross premiums written grew 15.1% to a quarterly record of approximately $2.9 billion. Net premiums written also grew 17.7% to a record of more than $2.4 billion. The higher growth in net premiums written is driven by our decision to retain more business, which is evident by the lower session rate.
In the Insurance segment, all lines of business grew, generating a combined 19.2% increase to total net premiums written of almost $2.1 billion. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment also increased 9.6% to more than $300 million, driven by growth in casualty, Reinsurance & Monoline Excess. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in premium, which will continue to earn through the income statement and can be seen by the higher growth rate in net premiums earned compared with net premiums written.
Record pretax quarterly underwriting income of $274 million surpassed multiple quarterly records last year. The quarter improved $92 million and more than 50% over the prior year. Catastrophe losses were well within expectations at $29 million or 1.3 loss ratio points. This compares with $36 million or 1.9 loss ratio points in the first quarter of 2021. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 0.6 loss ratio points to 58.3%, primarily driven by rate improvement. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by almost $1 million in the current quarter, bringing our calendar year loss ratio to 59.5%.
Expense ratio is in line with expectations at 28.3%, reflecting an improvement of 1.2 points over the prior year's quarter. As previously mentioned, the growth in net premiums earned continues to benefit the expense ratio even with higher fixed costs coming from compensation, a new operating unit and increasing travel and entertainment.
In summary, these components contributed to our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes of 86.5% for the quarter compared with 88.4% for the first quarter of 2021. Net investment income increased almost 9.5% to $174 million for the quarter. The growth is primarily related to an improvement in investment funds of 33.6% in the core portfolio of 11.7%. Investment funds outperformed in the real estate, financial services and transportation funds. And the core portfolio benefited from rising interest rates and dividends received on equity securities.
The investment portfolio also maintained the same duration of 2.4 years and credit quality of a AA-. In addition, our strong operating cash flow has enabled us to put more money to work despite retaining a significant position in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.1 billion. Record pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $366 million is primarily made up of net realized gains on investments of $277 million and the change in unrealized gains on equity securities of $93 million. The key contributor to the realized gains was the sale of the real estate investment in London of $317 million gross or $251 million net of transaction expenses and the foreign currency impact including the reversal of the currency translation adjustment.
Corporate expenses increased primarily due to performance-based compensation arising in connection with the record level of earnings. The effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter, reflecting a onetime benefit from the release of a valuation allowance arising from the utilization of tax attributes as well as investments in tax-exempt securities and dividend-paying equity securities.
Stockholders' equity increased to almost $6.9 billion as of the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of 3.2% over the prior year-end. Book value per share before dividends increased 3.5% in the quarter and would have marginally increased even without the gain from the sale of the real estate investment in London. The annualized return on beginning of year equity was 35.5% for the quarter and 18.5% on an operating earnings basis.
Rob, I'll turn it back to you for further comments."

So let me keep this somewhat brief because I'm sure people have their own topics and questions that I'd like to get on to. But maybe just through my lens, a couple of sound bites.
The top line, obviously, this shy 18% from my perspective by any measure is very healthy. And if we unpack that a little bit, a couple of other data points for folks, as far as the rate increase, that's a component in their ex comp. It came in at $8.3 million. And let me give you a couple of the numbers, and then I want to dig into this a little bit more. So the new business relativity, which is a metric that we've shared with some of you in the past, is how we measure our new business pricing relative to our renewal pricing.
From our perspective, when you look at new business, one needs to recognize that there often times, not always but often times could be more risk associated with it. Your renewal book you know more about. New business you know less about. And to make a long story short, our new business relativity for the quarter came in at 1.018. So what does that mean? That means based on our macro measurements we're charging just shy of 2% more for new business relative to renewal business.
Another -- at least in my opinion, relevant data point is our renewal retention ratio came in at 82% and change. Why is that important? Because it tells you that we're -- to get the growth, we're not churning the book. We are keeping the portfolio intact. And from our perspective, that is a very healthy number. And certainly, from our perspective, also is an invitation, if you will, to keep pursuing additional rate.
I think that when you look at the 8.3%, it's also important that people understand that there's several dimensions that we're able to see that perhaps those from the outside looking in can't see. We look at this business by operating unit, by product line and are constantly assessing the margin that we believe exists in the business. And there is a constant balance or rebalancing that we are doing on a daily basis as to what type of rate we need, what margin we think is in the business. And at what point in time when we see the margin that is available is growth of exposure, the priority or is rate the priority and between those 2 components, which one is more of a priority. So at this stage, we feel very good about the available margin. And as a result, in many product lines, we are willing to allow exposure growth to be the priority over rate, though not across the board.
I also want to spend a couple of moments talking about for some number of years, we've been beating the drum about social inflation. I think we were on the earlier side compared to many of our peers. Some folks may have labeled us chicken little, but nevertheless, I am grateful that our colleagues have the insight, and we took the action that we did. That having been said, obviously, as of late, this concept of economic or financial inflation seems to be getting all the headlines with good reason. And it's important, I think, for observers to understand, to take into account that the -- in our organization's case, I can't speak to others, but in this organization's case, the majority of the policies that we write are based on or priced off of, if you will, exposure. So what do I mean by that? I mean we price our policies off of payroll, off of receipts or revenue or off of appraised value, which is done in a very timely manner at the time when we are underwriting the policy.
So I mentioned this because as people are grappling with what is the impact of economic inflation on our business model. Certainly, we are not insulated from it. We will, in a couple of moments, potentially get into the discussion around what does it mean for the investment portfolio. But from an underwriting perspective, why we are not completely insulated, the majority of our business activities, the pricing, if you will, feeds off of exposure i.e., in other words, if you own a deli and you are charging $1 more a sandwich, and we are pricing your GL. We are pricing off of your revenue and your receipts. Consequently, the premium is going up as your revenue and receipts are going up. That is separate and distinct from rate. Rate is a separate activity, if you will, and how one thinks about it from exposure growth. And again, obviously, inflation to a great economic inflation to a great extent, is contemplated in exposure growth.
A couple of quick soundbites on the loss ratio. Continued improvement from there. As Rich mentioned, we did have some cat activity, really the 2 pieces that are most noteworthy would be: one, the European storms during the quarter as well as the Australian floods. To the extent people want more detail, we can certainly get into that in the Q&A or probably best just to pick it up in the queue.
The other piece I wanted to flag on the loss ratio, and I may have touched on this last quarter, I can't remember, and I didn't go back and look at the transcript. But it's something I look at and perhaps it's of interest to others. And that is the paid loss ratio. This going to -- which came in, in the quarter at a 45.3. I'd like to give you a couple of historical data points, which you could always dig up on your own, but let me save you the work. And the numbers I'm going to read off are over the past couple of years for the first quarter, what the paid loss ratio was. And I want to give it to you for the corresponding periods because that way we're getting as close to apples-to-apples as possible. Though it's not a perfect comparison because of mix of business, et cetera.
But if we again, 2022 for the quarter, it came in at 45.3. So let's go back to 2017. If you go back to 2017, Q1, paid loss ratio, 55.5; 2018 Q1 paid loss ratio 58.8; 2019 paid loss ratio 54.2; 2020 loss -- paid loss ratio, 56.1; 2021 paid loss ratio for the first quarter, 48.2. So I flag it because it's one of the first things that my father taught me about the insurance business. The paid loss ratio, there's really not much room for gray. It's a black and white number. It's a real number. And again, I think that it is 1 data point, which people can interpret anyway they want, but I think it's, in my opinion, a helpful indicator or trend as to where things are going.
Rich talked about the expenses. Obviously, there are 2 things that we're experience -- 3 things that we're experiencing there. A, earned premium continues to grow. We're getting a benefit there. Going the other way, T&E is starting to pick up again as fortunately, knock on wood, COVID is hopefully in the rearview mirror and shrinking. And then lastly, we have 1 new operation, which now is feeding into the reported expense ratio. And it takes time for it to scale as we've discussed in the past, and we're confident it will be accretive over time.
Let me offer a couple of quick soundbites on the investment portfolio, and then I promise I'll be finishing up, and it will be the participants turn. The investment portfolio, I think, is a great example of some of the comments that I offered earlier around a focus towards discipline, a focus out the front windshield, not just the rearview mirror. And quite frankly, I think we started to see some benefit really towards the end of last year, and that benefit is really starting to crystallize and likely more to come.
So as Rich mentioned, duration for the portfolio at the end of the quarter was 2.4 years. Another data point, the book yield on the portfolio was 2.2%. Given where interest rates have gone, our new money rate in the quarter is approximately 100 basis points above that. So as they say, you can do the math and figure out what does the 100 basis points benefit mean for our investment income on our -- for our investment income, given the movement in rates that we are seeing on the fixed income portfolio. So when we talk about the table being set for the future and the opportunities coming our way and what this means for our economic model and the earnings power of the business, I think that's an important data point for people to be considering, again, in my opinion.
Another point that I'd like to make, and quite frankly, it's a little bit of a pet peeve around here, and that has to do with gains. Certainly, we've noticed that people have a tendency to back gains out of our results. And quite frankly, people can look at the numbers anyway they want. But from our perspective, we think that that's just not appropriate. We give up a fair amount in alternatives, particularly some of the activities that have a focus towards gain. We are focused on total return, and we think that is what is in the best interest of the shareholders. And again, obviously, we take an approach very focused on risk-adjusted return.
So I think that we are already benefiting from the discipline that we have exercised over the past several years, keeping that duration short. I think that benefit is going to be coming more and more into focus over the coming quarters and years. And quite frankly, I think it was a few quarters ago, we talked about how, quite frankly, if rates move up, we didn't think that we were getting paid enough by taking the duration out. I think that reality has come into focus. And I think in part that was demonstrated, as Rich referenced a few moments ago. But if you look at our book value and even if you chose, which I do not agree with, but even if you chose to back out the gain from the building that we sold in London, our book value, in spite of what happened with interest rates still went up, which I think given what has happened in the bond market is pretty outstanding.
So again, congratulations, job well done to my colleagues on the investment side. So that was probably a lot more than anyone was looking for or bargained for, but thank you for your patience and listening to me. And Emma, why don't I pause there, and let's open it up for questions."

And second of all, when we look at the submission flow that's coming into our specialty businesses in general, in particular, the E&S businesses, but the specialty businesses in general. It was very strong in the quarter. My observation from a distance. And again, we are much, much, much more a specialty player than not. But it would seem, again, from a distance that the standard market, they have a very firm view as to what is in their appetite, what isn't in their appetite. And if it's inside their appetite, they weed it out of there very quickly and very abruptly. But if it's staying in their appetite, they seem to be apparently very, very aggressive. It's almost if they don't understand the inflationary environment that we're operating in, but we're a specialty player more than not. So maybe I'm mistaken.
Long story short, flow of submissions remains very encouraging. And quite frankly, in particular, noticed March was particularly strong. So there's really nothing that we're seeing that would suggest that the momentum is getting derailed in the specialty specifically E&S, and that I think was your question, but across the board."

There are certain product lines where we're watching the competition diminish.

We've been doing the specialty business, if you will. It's been a focus of ours since 1979. So it's not that the world is stagnant. It's not that any of us live in a vacuum.

And I tried to flag that when you think about what our book yield is today versus what our new money rate is and where that's likely to go.
So -- but let's put the investments to the side for a moment. The other piece is every day that we're writing business in '22 that goes by, and we're earning it in over 12 months, and we're achieving rate that we believe is comfortably above trend that bodes well for what the outcome is likely to be. And number three, I just don't see things going. It's not like an on-off switch. The market doesn't be on a great trajectory and then all of a sudden, the bottom falls out. And I guess the last comment, and I apologize for being a bit repetitive, but I think that you're going to see certain product lines that have been doing particularly well over the recent past. At some point, they're going to peak out. But I think simultaneously, some of the product lines that perhaps haven't been as robust. At some point, you're going to see them start to tick up.
So let's use workers' compensation as an example. Workers' comp for the past several years, it's been a very competitive market. state rating bureaus have been taking the action they've been taking. And ultimately, if history is any indicator for what we should all be expecting. Eventually, it will end in tears for the industry. Commercial workers' comp is one of the largest components of the commercial lines marketplace. When that turns, that is going to be offsetting is what I'm suggesting. Other product lines that may have peaked and are going the other way. So again, I think that there is a lot of momentum out there today. I think that there are a lot of pieces in place that will bode well for tomorrow. And I think that there's arguments that you're going to be seeing as the cycle has changed and all product lines aren't marching at lockstep, you're going to see other things that will come along and perhaps lift certain portfolios for certain carriers."

We are certainly trying to take it into account when we are looking at exposures and how we underwrite whether it be purely in the underwriting and the data and the information that we collect on the employees and the hiring practices and so on and the training. Obviously, we're getting into that in our loss engineering or loss control as well. So it's an important piece, and I share the question and quite frankly, the concern.
Brian, I would suggest that one could expand that a bit even beyond the challenges that the commercial auto space faces to the broader. The reality is it's a very tight labor market. And I think as we have shared the observation in the past, oftentimes, that will lead to people working over time. That's when things sometimes can go wrong. In addition to that, oftentimes, you'll have people that are not as well trained in positions, and that can lead to unfortunate situations as well.
As far as the professional liability space, I would suggest that you not read too much into it. There is 1 piece of the professional liability space than I think we have an appropriate level of severe caution around, and that is large law firms and that may be a contributing factor to what you're referring to. But generally speaking, we still see a lot of opportunity in the vast majority of the professional space.

On this end of the call, in addition to myself, you also have Bill Berkley, Executive Chair; as well as Rich Baio, our Group CFO. 
We're going to follow the usual agenda where I'm in short order, I'm going to hand it over to Rich. He's going to walk through the highlights of the quarter. Then once he's completed his comments, I'll tag along with a few of my own observations. And shortly thereafter, we'll be opening it up for Q&A and happy to take the conversation in any direction participants would like to do so. 
That having been said, before I do hand it over to Rich, because I always like to steal at least a little bit of his thunder, though I don't think the comments will come as a surprise to anyone that's had an opportunity to review the release. It was a terrific quarter for the organization, really, by any metric to say the least. And quite frankly, we were able to achieve these results because of the efforts of the full team across the country and around the world all working together to achieve these types of outcomes. 
I think what's important to that point is to just remind ourselves, remind each other that this effort, this is a team sport, as I've commented in the past, it's not an individual sport. And quite frankly, this isn't rocket science what we're doing. Yes, we are very fortunate that we have a lot of very intelligent people on the team working very hard, but a lot of our success comes about because of discipline; because we focus on blocking and tackling in a thoughtful and consistent way every day; because we are not only consumed by what's in the rearview mirror, but we are paying close attention to what we see out the front windshield. 
It seems like common sense. But quite frankly, it requires great effort every day. And again, I think we're achieving these types of results because of the efforts of the full team. So congratulations to all. 
I think beyond just the results, which again, I think, speak for themselves, I would suggest that perhaps what's as, if not more exciting, is quite frankly, how the table has been set for what is likely going to be a very strong balance of '22. Additionally, how things are being set up for what should be a very strong '23. And with every passing day, there are more pieces being put into place that would suggest that it's more likely than not that '24 will also be very promising as well. 
So we, as an organization, continue to be very focused on building book value. We have an obsession around the concept of risk-adjusted return. I think that came into focus not just in this quarter, but in our ability to generate good returns regardless of what may have happened on the cat front in any quarter, it's the consistency have strong results that differentiate us in the marketplace. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Rich to walk us through some of the highlights, and I will be back on the heels of his comments. Rich, if you would, please."

Appreciate it. The company continues to operate extremely well, as Rob had pointed out, reporting record quarterly underwriting income and net investment gains, both of which led to the 157% growth to record quarterly net income of $591 million or $2.12 per share on a common stock split effected basis. 
Operating earnings also improved 52% to $307 million or $1.10 per share on a common stock split effected basis. The primary contributors were improvement in underwriting results by 2.3 points to a calendar year combined ratio of 87.8% and growth in net investment income of almost 9.5%. 
Going more into the details with our top line first. Gross premiums written grew 15.1% to a quarterly record of approximately $2.9 billion. Net premiums written also grew 17.7% to a record of more than $2.4 billion. The higher growth in net premiums written is driven by our decision to retain more business, which is evident by the lower session rate. 
In the Insurance segment, all lines of business grew, generating a combined 19.2% increase to total net premiums written of almost $2.1 billion. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment also increased 9.6% to more than $300 million, driven by growth in casualty Reinsurance & Monoline Excess. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in premium, which will continue to earn through the income statement and can be seen by the higher growth rate in net premiums earned compared with net premiums written. 
Record pretax quarterly underwriting income of $274 million surpassed multiple quarterly records last year. The quarter improved $92 million and more than 50% over the prior year. Catastrophe losses were well within expectations at $29 million or 1.3 loss ratio points. This compares with $36 million or 1.9 loss ratio points in the first quarter of 2021. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 0.6 loss ratio points to 58.3%, primarily driven by rate improvement. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by almost $1 million in the current quarter, bringing our calendar year loss ratio to 59.5%. 
Expense ratio is in line with expectations at 28.3%, reflecting an improvement of 1.2 points over the prior year's quarter. As previously mentioned, the growth in net premiums earned continues to benefit the expense ratio even with higher fixed costs coming from compensation, a new operating unit and increasing travel and entertainment. 
In summary, these components contributed to our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes of 86.5% for the quarter compared with 88.4% for the first quarter of 2021. Net investment income increased almost 9.5% to $174 million for the quarter. The growth is primarily related to an improvement in investment funds of 33.6% in the core portfolio of 11.7%. Investment funds outperformed in the real estate, financial services and transportation funds. And the core portfolio benefited from rising interest rates and dividends received on equity securities. 
The investment portfolio also maintained the same duration of 2.4 years and credit quality of a AA-. In addition, our strong operating cash flow has enabled us to put more money to work despite retaining a significant position in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.1 billion. Record pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $366 million is primarily made up of net realized gains on investments of $277 million and the change in unrealized gains on equity securities of $93 million. The key contributor to the realized gains was the sale of the real estate investment in London of $317 million gross or $251 million net of transaction expenses and the foreign currency impact including the reversal of the currency translation adjustment. 
Corporate expenses increased primarily due to performance-based compensation arising in connection with the record level of earnings. The effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter, reflecting a onetime benefit from the release of a valuation allowance arising from the utilization of tax attributes as well as investments in tax-exempt securities and dividend-paying equity securities. 
Stockholders' equity increased to almost $6.9 billion as of the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of 3.2% over the prior year-end. Book value per share before dividends increased 3.5% in the quarter and would have marginally increased even without the gain from the sale of the real estate investment in London. The annualized return on beginning of year equity was 35.5% for the quarter and 18.5% on an operating earnings basis.

The top line, obviously,",1859,"Okay. Rich, thank you very much. That was great. So let me keep this somewhat brief because I'm sure people have their own topics and questions that I'd like to get on to. But maybe just through my lens, a couple of sound bites. 
The top line, obviously, just shy 18%, from my perspective, by any measure is very healthy. And if we unpack that a little bit, a couple of other data points for folks, as far as the rate increase, that's a component in their ex comp. It came in at 8.3. And let me give you a couple other numbers, and then I want to dig into this a little bit more. 
So the new business relativity, which is a metric that we've shared with some of you in the past, is how we measure our new business pricing relative to our renewal pricing. From our perspective, when you look at new business, one needs to recognize that there, oftentimes -- not always, but oftentimes, could be more risk associated with it. Your renewal book you know more about, new business you know less about. And to make a long story short, our new business relativity for the quarter came in at 1.018. So what does that mean? That means based on our macro measurements, we're charging just shy of 2% more for new business relative to renewal business. 
Another -- at least in my opinion, relevant data point, is our renewal retention ratio came in at 82% and change. Why is that important? Because it tells you that we're -- to get the growth, we're not churning the book. We are keeping the portfolio intact. And from our perspective, that is a very healthy number. And certainly, from our perspective, also is an invitation, if you will, to keep pursuing additional rate. 
I think that when you look at the 8.3%, it's also important that people understand that there's several dimensions that we're able to see that perhaps those from the outside looking in can't see. We look at this business by operating unit, by product line, and are constantly assessing the margin that we believe exists in the business. And there is a constant balance or rebalancing that we are doing on a daily basis as to what type of rate we need, what margin we think is in the business. And at what point in time when we see the margin that is available is growth of exposure the priority or is rate the priority. And between those 2 components, which one is more of a priority. So at this stage, we feel very good about the available margin. And as a result, in many product lines, we are willing to allow exposure growth to be the priority over rate, though not across the board. 
I also want to spend a couple of moments talking about -- just staying on that topic of exposure. Because, obviously, for some number of years, we've been beating the drum about social inflation. I think we were on the earlier side compared to many of our peers. Some folks may have labeled us Chicken Little, but nevertheless, I am grateful that our colleagues have the insight, and we took the action that we did. That having been said, obviously, as of late, this concept of economic or financial inflation seems to be getting all the headlines with good reason. And it's important, I think, for observers to understand, to take into account, that in our organization's case -- I can't speak to others, but in this organization's case, the majority of the policies that we write are based on or priced off of, if you will, exposure. So what do I mean by that? I mean we price our policies off of payroll, off of receipts or revenue, or off of appraised value, which is done in a very timely manner at the time when we are underwriting the policy. 
So I mentioned this because as people are grappling with what is the impact of economic inflation on our business model. Certainly, we are not insulated from it. We will, in a couple of moments, potentially get into the discussion around what does it mean for the investment portfolio. But from an underwriting perspective, while we are not completely insulated, the majority of our business activities, the pricing, if you will, feeds off of exposure. I.e., in other words, if you own a deli and you are charging $1 more a sandwich, and we are pricing your GL. We are pricing off of your revenue and your receipts. Consequently, the premium is going up as your revenue and receipts are going up. That is separate and distinct from rate. Rate is a separate activity, if you will, and how one thinks about it from exposure growth. And again, obviously, inflation, to a great -- economic inflation to a great extent, is contemplated in exposure growth. 
A couple of quick soundbites on the loss ratio. Continued improvement from there. As Rich mentioned, we did have some cat activity. Really, the 2 pieces that are most noteworthy would be: one, the European storms during the quarter as well as the Australian floods. To the extent people want more detail, we can certainly get into that in the Q&A or probably best just to pick it up in the queue. 
The other piece I wanted to flag on the loss ratio, and I may have touched on this last quarter, I can't remember, and I didn't go back and look at the transcript. But it's something I look at and perhaps it's of interest to others. And that is the paid loss ratio. This going to -- which came in, in the quarter at a 45.3. I'd like to give you a couple of historical data points, which you could always dig up on your own, but let me save you the work. And the numbers I'm going to read off are over the past couple of years, for the first quarter, what the paid loss ratio was. And I want to give it to you for the corresponding periods because that way we're getting as close to apples-to-apples as possible. Though it's not a perfect comparison because of mix of business, et cetera. But if we again, 2022 for the quarter, it came in at 45.3. 
So let's go back to 2017. If you go back to 2017, Q1, paid loss ratio, 55.5; 2018 Q1 paid loss ratio 58.8; 2019 paid loss ratio 54.2; 2020 loss -- paid loss ratio, 56.1; 2021 paid loss ratio for the first quarter, 48.2. So I flag it because it's one of the first things that my father taught me about the insurance business. The paid loss ratio, there's really not much room for gray. It's a black and white number. It's a real number. And again, I think that it is 1 data point, which people can interpret anyway they want, but I think it's, in my opinion, a helpful indicator or trend as to where things are going. 
Rich talked about the expenses. Obviously, there are 2 things that we're experience -- 3 things that we're experiencing there. A, earned premium continues to grow. We're getting a benefit there. Going the other way, T&E is starting to pick up again as, fortunately, knock on wood, COVID is hopefully in the rearview mirror and shrinking. And then lastly, we have 1 new operation, which now is feeding into the reported expense ratio. And it takes time for it to scale as we've discussed in the past, and we're confident it will be accretive over time. 
Let me offer a couple of quick soundbites on the investment portfolio, and then I promise I'll be finishing up, and it will be the participants' turn. 
The investment portfolio, I think, is a great example of some of the comments that I offered earlier around a focus towards discipline, a focus out the front windshield, not just the rearview mirror. And quite frankly, I think we started to see some benefit really towards the end of last year, and that benefit is really starting to crystallize and likely more to come. 
So as Rich mentioned, duration for the portfolio at the end of the quarter was 2.4 years. Another data point, the book yield on the portfolio was 2.2%. Given where interest rates have gone, our new money rate in the quarter is approximately 100 basis points above that. So as they say, you can do the math and figure out what does the 100 basis points benefit mean for our investment income on our -- for our investment income, given the movement in rates that we are seeing on the fixed income portfolio. So when we talk about the table being set for the future and the opportunities coming our way and what this means for our economic model and the earnings power of the business, I think that's an important data point for people to be considering, again, in my opinion. 
Another point that I'd like to make, and quite frankly, it's a little bit of a pet peeve around here, and that has to do with gains. Certainly, we've noticed that people have a tendency to back gains out of our results. And quite frankly, people can look at the numbers anyway they want. But from our perspective, we think that, that's just not appropriate. We give up a fair amount of operating income, if you will, to invest in alternatives, particularly some of the activities that have a focus towards gain. We are focused on total return, and we think that is what is in the best interest of the shareholders. And again, obviously, we take an approach very focused on risk-adjusted return. 
So I think that we are already benefiting from the discipline that we have exercised over the past several years, keeping that duration short. I think that benefit is going to be coming more and more into focus over the coming quarters and years. And quite frankly, I think it was a few quarters ago, we talked about how, quite frankly, if rates move up, we didn't think that we were getting paid enough by taking the duration out. I think that reality has come into focus. And I think in part, that was demonstrated, as Rich referenced a few moments ago. But if you look at our book value, and even if you chose, which I do not agree with, but even if you chose to back out the gain from the building that we sold in London, our book value, in spite of what happened with interest rates, still went up, which I think given what has happened in the bond market, is pretty outstanding. So again, congratulations, job well done to my colleagues on the investment side. 
So that was probably a lot more than anyone was looking for or bargained for, but thank you for your patience and listening to me. And Emma, why don't I pause there, and let's open it up for questions."

My observation from a distance, and again, we are much, much, much more a specialty player than not. But it would seem, again, from a distance that the standard market, they have a very firm view as to what is in their appetite, what isn't in their appetite. And if it's out of their appetite, they weed it out of there very quickly and very abruptly. But if it's staying in their appetite, they seem to be, apparently very, very aggressive. It's almost if they don't understand the inflationary environment that we're operating in. But we're a specialty player more than not, so maybe I'm mistaken.
Long story short, flow of submissions remains very encouraging. And quite frankly, in particular, noticed March was particularly strong.

And are there -- one of the things, at least I think, is important to keep in mind and you may want to consider is that as opposed to past cycles, what's becoming more and more the cases that different product lines are marching through the cycle on their own. They are not all in perfect lockstep. So as a result of that, different product lines are in different places. There are certain product lines where we're watching the competition increase. There are certain product lines where we're watching the competition diminish. But overall, in the specialty space, the competitors that we view as real competitors, the ones that we respect, they're basically the same names today as they were 2 years ago.
We've been doing the specialty business, if you will. It's been a focus of ours since 1979. So it's not that the world is stagnant. It's not that any of us live in a vacuum. Obviously, it's continuing to change. But we have a lot of expertise. We've got a lot of data.

First off, I think we need to -- and I think you have, but I'm not sure if others have, given appropriate consideration to what this change in interest rate environment means for our economic model. And I tried to flag that when you think about what our book yield is today versus what our new money rate is and where that's likely to go.
So -- but let's put the investments to the side for a moment. The other piece is every day that we're writing business in '22 that goes by, and we're earning it in over 12 months, and we're achieving rate that we believe is comfortably above trend, that bodes well for what the outcome is likely to be. And number three, I just don't see things going -- it's not like an on-off switch. The market doesn't be on a great trajectory and then all of a sudden, the bottom falls out. 
And I guess the last comment, and I apologize for being a bit repetitive, but I think that you're going to see certain product lines that have been doing particularly well over the recent past. At some point, they're going to peak out. But I think simultaneously, some of the product lines that perhaps haven't been as robust, at some point, you're going to see them start to tick up.
So let's use workers' compensation as an example. Workers' comp for the past several years, it's been a very competitive market. State rating bureaus have been taking the action they've been taking. And ultimately, if history is any indicator for what we should all be expecting, eventually, it will end in tears for the industry. 
Commercial -- workers' comp is one of the largest components of the commercial lines marketplace. When that turns, that is going to be offsetting, is what I'm suggesting, other product lines that may have peaked and are going the other way. So again, I think that there is a lot of momentum out there today. I think that there are a lot of pieces in place that will bode well for tomorrow. And I think that there's arguments that you're going to be seeing, as the cycle has changed and all product lines aren't marching at lockstep, you're going to see other things that will come along and perhaps lift certain portfolios for certain carriers."

So long story short, we have the luxury of buying reinsurance when we think it makes economic sense for the company to a great extent, because again, we, as an organization, are not a big limits player for the most part. Approximately 90% or so of our policies have a limit of $2 million or less. At the same time, we buy when we think it makes sense for the shareholders. And at the same time, of course, we're conscious of our long-term relationships with our partners on the reinsurance side.

Presumably, people take that into account. We are certainly trying to take it into account when we are looking at exposures and how we underwrite, whether it be purely in the underwriting and the data and the information that we collect on the employees and the hiring practices and so on and the training. Obviously, we're getting into that in our loss engineering or loss control as well. So it's an important piece, and I share the question, and quite frankly, the concern.
Brian, I would suggest that one could expand that a bit even beyond the challenges that the commercial auto space faces to the broader. The reality is it's a very tight labor market. And I think as we have shared the observation in the past, oftentimes, that will lead to people working over time. That's when things sometimes can go wrong. In addition to that, oftentimes, you'll have people that are not as well trained in positions, and that can lead to unfortunate situations as well.
As far as the professional liability space, I would suggest that you not read too much into it. There is 1 piece of the professional liability space that I think we have an appropriate level of severe caution around, and that is large law firms. And that may be a contributing factor to what you're referring to. But generally speaking, we still see a lot of opportunity in the vast majority of the professional space, and it's still a cyclical business.

Co-hosting with me this afternoon is Bill Berkley, our Executive Chairman as well as Rich Baio, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow the usual agenda where I'm going to hand it over to Rich momentarily. He's going to run through some highlights of the quarter. Once Rich has completed his comments, I'll receive the baton back from him, offer a few thoughts on my own, and then we'll be pleased to open it up for Q&A and take the conversation anywhere participants would like to take it. Before I hand it over to Rich, there is a one point or a topic that I did want to flag, and it's something that we talk about with some regularity within our shop. And I don't think it's a unique observation, I'm sure everyone on the call and beyond is acutely aware of this point, but nevertheless, I think it easily falls off the radar screen as we can easily get consumed by other aspects of the industry. And that is the macro observation or reality that this is a very unusual industry for a variety of reasons, but one of them is, this is an industry where you do not know your cost of goods sold until oftentimes many years after the transaction has actually occurred. That creates additional complexity and how one operates the business. It's less consequential when you're operating through an extended period of time where things are quite stable. But when you're in a period of time where changes abound, volatility is material, it becomes much more consequential. Most businesses in other industries, I would suggest, the way they operate is akin to how you steer a car. You turn the wheel of a car, the wheels in the front of the car turn and the car will turn quickly. Because of what we're discussing now this reality of the timing of cost of goods sold relative to when the transaction occurs, in this industry it's different from what driving a car. In some ways, it's more like steering a boat, where the rotor is in the back of the boat as opposed to the wheels in the front of the vehicle. The difference in this industry, like a boat or a ship being steered from the back, is one needs to anticipate. One needs to not just be consumed by what has occurred yesterday, not just be preoccupied with what is immediately in front of them, but one needs to anticipate what is coming their way because of the delay in response to steering the ship. One needs to be trying to figure out what is around the next corner or over the hill. 
This is something that we spend a huge amount of time working at grappling with as a team. It is one of the reasons why we have been focused on certain things for a long period of time. Whether it's social inflation or economic or financial inflation, these are 2 macro topics that we have been talking about and acting upon for several years at this stage. You can see it in our underwriting and how we have selected loss picks and how we have priced our book of business. You can see it in our investment portfolio and how we have managed our duration. So while these types of topics have become very topical today and we hear people chatting about it, these are things that we anticipated and have been preparing for, as I suggested earlier, years. It's one of the reasons why we are so well positioned. It's not easy. It requires expertise. It requires experience. It requires discipline. It requires foresight, and it requires courage. Fortunately, my colleagues throughout this organization have those characteristics and traits, and that, in my opinion, is the leading reason why this organization is so well positioned today and by extension, is enjoying the results that we are talking about today and anticipate we will be talking about for many, many quarters and years to come. 
So with that, so much for me just keeping it short at the beginning and handing it over to Rich. Let me hand it over to Rich now, and I promise I'll be somewhat brief after he provides his thoughts and comments. Rich, if you would, please."

The company reported another strong quarter, as you saw, with operating income increasing 43% to $313 million or $1.12 per share. The key contributors include strong underwriting income driven by continued growth in premium volume, which I'll discuss in just a moment, along with improving net investment income and foreign currency gains. We also reported net income of $179 million or $0.65 per share. Pretax underwriting income of $268 million in large part kept pace with the record first quarter, representing an increase of 32.6% over the prior year second quarter. Our year-to-date quarterly results of $543 million increased 41% over the prior year and surpassed all prior full year results with the exception of 2021, which was a record year. Despite the heightened frequency of natural catastrophes, we reported pretax cat losses of $58 million in the quarter or 2.5 loss ratio points compared with $44 million or 2.2 loss ratio points last year. 
Drilling down further into our underwriting results, gross premiums written grew to a record level of almost $3.1 billion. Net premiums written grew 16.9% to a record of nearly $2.6 billion. Our decision to retain more business on a net basis can be seen by the lower session rate in the quarter and on year-to-date basis. Net premiums written increased in all lines of business as we disclosed in the earnings release. The Insurance segment grew 16.6% to more than $2.3 billion while the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment increased 19.1% to almost $260 million. The overall growth is significantly coming from increased exposure. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 0.3 loss ratio points to 58.5%. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $2 million in the current year, bringing our calendar year loss ratio to 60.9%. The expense ratio continues to benefit from scaling the business as evidenced by the outpaced growth in net premiums earned relative to underwriting expenses. In addition, we continue to make investments in strategic initiatives to optimize efficiency, and as such, the expense ratio improved 1 point to 27.7% over the prior year's quarter. 
In summary, the current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 1.3 loss points to 86.2% compared with the second quarter of 2021 of 87.5%. The reported calendar year combined ratio was 88.6% for the current quarter compared with 89.7% for the prior year. Net investment income for the quarter was approximately $172 million. The rising interest rate environment is a key contributor to growth and income from the core portfolio of almost 30%. On investment funds, you may recall, we report on a 1-quarter lag, and despite the decline in the equity markets in the first quarter, the investment funds performed well with a book yield of 8.3%. The transportation, real estate and energy funds led the way. The overall investment portfolio also maintained the same duration of 2.4 years and a credit quality of a AA-. Pretax net investment losses in the quarter of $172 million is primarily attributable to the net change in unrealized losses on equity securities of $132 million, which related to sector declines in financial services, energy and metal mining and manufacturing. Stockholders' equity was $6.5 billion as of June 30, 2022. Year-to-date earnings have more than offset the change in unrealized losses on investments and currency translation adjustments, both items being components of stockholders' equity. We returned capital to shareholders in the first 6 months of the year through regular and special dividends amounting to $182 million, of which $159 million was in the second quarter. The annualized operating return on beginning of year equity was 18.8% for the quarter and 10.8% on a net income basis. 
Rob, I'll turn it back to you."

So a couple of quick soundbites from me, and again, as promised, then we'll open it up for the Q&A. The top line continues to be very healthy. I would tell you that in the specialty space, in particular, E&S, but specialty in general, we are seeing continued strength in submissions, and we're feeling particularly good about that. We're also seeing finally some resilience in the reinsurance market. Consequently, as you saw the growth in that segment as well. On the insurance front, jumping around here, other liability was particularly strong. Shorter tail was strong as well and commercial auto was reasonably robust. As far as what the contribution to the 17 points of growth, rate was a meaningful contributor. Ex-comp, we were at 6.8% or so. I think it's important that people keep in mind and not confuse or decouple rate versus exposure growth. And one of the things that we've been very focused on, and I worry that some industry participants may not be as focused on, is a change in exposure, particularly in an inflationary environment is something that we pay a lot of attention to. Obviously, there's an opportunity to keep up with it through payrolls on comp, GL. As far as revenue on the property front, the appraised values that you get at the time of the underwriting and inception. But making sure that one does not fall behind is an important thing and approximately 2/3 of our policies are adjustable based on exposure. So that's a really important piece to make sure that we can keep up with inflation. 
As far as strength of economy, certainly, there is a lot of sensitivity and concern. But I would tell you, as far as audit premiums at this stage, we are seeing considerable momentum on that front. Our audit premiums during the quarter were up 45% relative to the same period last year. And just on the retention front, something that I know we've discussed in the past, and we're very sensitive to not churning the book and making sure that the quality and the integrity of the book is intact as we continue to push for rate and make sure that we're getting the appropriate exposure. Long story short, renewal retention remained just north of 80%. Loss ratio, obviously, Rich covered a bit of noise coming out of the cats. I would characterize it as frequency of modest severity and that was probably the big story behind the 2.5 points. From my perspective -- and we've heard this and we think we've talked about it in the past calls, we've heard it from some people when they look at all the rate that we've gotten. Why is it that we're not seeing the loss ratio drop even more on the current accident year. And the simple answer is, there's a lot of unknown, and there's a lot of volatility and there are a lot of various leverage assumptions that we want to make sure we are appropriately thoughtful and measured, and we don't respond to quickly. Some people would say cautious. We would say that we're just being thoughtful and measured given the inflationary environment, both social as well as economic. In addition to that, and we may have touched on this last quarter, we're sensitive to the backlog in the legal system. And our best estimate, which is nothing more than an estimate is that due to COVID, there's still probably an 18-month backlog in the court system. One other piece on the loss ratio, and I think I shared this with all last quarter. And for us, it's just one of many data points that we pay attention to, and perhaps, it's of interest to you all and that's the paid loss ratio. From our perspective, it is an important data point. It's not the whole story, but an important data point. 
So here's a little bit of historical perspective for you again on Q2. And I'm going to give you what the paid loss ratio was going back to 2017 for Q2 and that creates as much of an apples-to-apples basis as we can, at least using shorthand. So the paid loss ratio Q2 in '17 was a [ 55.9 ]. In '18, it was a 58.3. In '19, it was a 53.8. In 2020, it was 52.9. In '21, it was a 44.3. And in '22, it was 41.9. So obviously, an attractive trend. Doesn't necessarily tell the whole story, but again, from our perspective, a meaningful data point and an encouraging indicator. Expense ratio, again, Rich touched on this. We continue to see improvement for a whole host of reasons. Certainly, lots of folks are focused on it and trying to be more efficient, but the big needle mover is just the growth in the earned premium. And as you can see how it lags our written, there's likely more opportunity there over time. That having been said, we do have a few new operations. We'll have to see how they scale again over time. So 88.6 reported. If you back out the cats and you do the for, it's an 86.2. On an operating basis, obviously, a pretty attractive return by virtually any measure. 
A couple of quick comments on the investment portfolio, and again, I think Rich summarized it well. So I'm not going to belabor the point too much here, but obviously, the duration remains notably short of where our liabilities are at 2.4 years compared to the liabilities, give or take, 4 years. I think it's also worth noting, you're just in the early stages of seeing the opportunity for this company and its earnings power when you saw the book yield of climb from -- in the last quarter, last quarter being Q1 2.2 up to 2.6 in just a period of 90 days. And new money rate for us these days is certainly north of 4, probably 4.25, give or take. We talked at the beginning of the call about foresight and discipline and a variety of other behaviors or traits and the importance of it. I think it has certainly been exercised on the underwriting side, but it is important to recognize how it has been also exercised on the investment side. The earnings power of this economic model going forward in a raising or increasing rate environment should not be underestimated. It's something we've discussed in the past. I think it's something that people have an understanding for when we have the discussion, but I'm not sure if it's fully appreciated what this means for our economic model and again, the earnings power of the business as you see interest rates continue to move up. So again, when we look forward, given the opportunities that we have before us, the flow of business coming our way continues to have significant momentum. The opportunity to make sure that we are getting the rate that we want and need continues to be there as well. And of course, the leverage that we have that is very much coming our way on the investment income side, I think all these things position us well for not just the coming quarters, but the coming years in all likelihood. 
So let me pause there, Josh, if we could please open it up for questions."

So how long will it go on for? I don't know for sure. I think one of the things, Elyse, I know we've talked about in the past, and I think it is worth noting is that we're all very sort of conditioned to think about the cycle as one across product lines. And while the realities of a cycle certainly apply to all product lines, we need to remember that product lines are not marching in lockstep these days. So for example, it is our view that over the next 12 to 24 months, you are going to see the workers' comp market likely bottoming out and beginning to firm. And obviously, that's one of the, if not the largest, component of the commercial lines marketplace. So undoubtedly, there will be a moment where some commercial lines don't have the same buoyancy or resilience, but I would expect that you'll see other product lines firming as they are perhaps peaking or softening. So long story short, as far as specialty and E&S, there's nothing that we see in the short term derailing it. And I think that there are going to be other things such as comp that are in somewhat of a on-deck circle."

And when you buy someone else's business, you were buying somebody else's headaches and the seller typically knows more than the buyer. We have done the occasional acquisition, but we are very careful about that. So most deals that occur, we hear about them before they are announced because we are shown the opportunity, but again, ultimately, we have a long-term view. We are focused on risk-adjusted return and controlling the business is an important part of that. And most insurance deals, quite frankly, when people look back on by and large, they probably wouldn't do them all over again if they could, and we're not looking for that experience."

So I think it would be a mistake, in my opinion, to assume that the underwriting margin is not going to -- does not have the opportunity to improve from here. I think it's just what we're trying to message is the balance between rate and growth in many product lines rate is not the primary target for us. In addition to that, when you think about our economic model, just going back to the comments earlier, I think that you're going to find that, again, there is tremendous upside leverage for us with the investment portfolio."

So I guess, from my seat, my question would be why can we find more of a middle ground where if there are -- if there's a confidence around hundreds of basis points of margin and wants to be prudent and thoughtful at the same time, why can't there be 100 basis point of margin improvement or 150 basis points of loss ratio improvement and kind of achieve both ends of that?"

But from our perspective, loss cost trend and if you choose to unpack that, particularly economic inflation as well as social inflation are exceptionally leveraged. And if you get those wrong by not a lot, it can be a real problem. We are not interested in trying to push the business. We are not interested in trying to take any unnecessary risks. On an operating basis, we're generating a high teens return without at least as we think about it being aggressive or optimistic. We're able to do that by being measured. And given that we think about the business through a risk-adjusted return lens, we think we are generating healthy returns for shareholders without increasing the risk by declaring victory prematurely. So we're quite comfortable with where we stand. We have a healthy respect for the unknown, and it's certainly something that we pay attention to. Obviously, as the reserves season out, we will be in a position to tighten up those picks. As we have historically, we will continue to do that, but in the early years, we're just not going to want to run the risk of moving prematurely. But in spite of that caution, we're still very proud of the results."

I would tell you that the rate ticking down, what I would define as incrementally, is one I would encourage people not to read too much into it in a 90-day period. But number two, and more importantly, going back to an earlier point and what we at least attempted to articulate in the release is, when you are writing business where your returns are particularly attractive, the way you think about the balance between rate versus growth is perhaps different than it was when you didn't find the returns as attractive and rate was the priority. So each one of the businesses in the group or by product line, by territory is thinking about the balance, and it's multidimensional, but included in that is the balance between rate versus exposure growth. And I think a big piece of what you're seeing there, again, as we try to flag earlier is, there's a lot of the marketplace that we participate in that we like the rates. We like the margin that is available. We feel as though that through how we capture exposure change, we are effectively keeping up with economic inflation, and the rate that we're getting is more than adequate to keep up with any social inflation or stub of economic inflation. And we like it, and we're going to chase it and continue to optimize that balance."

Businesses are growing. Sales are robust. Payrolls are going up. And quite frankly, inflation seems to be driving a lot of it, too. So if you think about workers' comp, just as an example, payrolls are going up because of wage inflation. If you think about the local store on Main Street, maybe they're selling more, but part of that is being driven by they're charging more for their products. And of course, on the property front, we all know what has happened with values. So again, from our perspective on the audit front, we're not seeing our insurers at least at this stage in any type of financial apparel.

Well, we do write some, but just as a data point that we have shared with some folks in the past, insurance -- types of -- insurance where you can legally have a limit, 90% of our policies have a limit of $2 million or less. So as a result of that, we're just not as dependent on the reinsurance market because we're relatively cat light, and we're not a big limits player.

We are far more well positioned than many of our peers. And the rating agencies, certainly one of the ways they look at capital strength is on a relative basis. So when you see some of our peers facing challenges with their bond portfolio, perhaps, those are not the type of severe challenges that we have to deal with fortunately for us.

And I think it's not just going to be pharma, I think it's going to be other aspects of medical inflation. I mean if you look at health care providers, big hospital systems or large groups, they are bleeding out of their ears, many of them, and something is going to have to change. So when the day is all done, there's going to be a moment of reckoning between the providers and the payers, and ultimately, the workers' comp market is not completely insulated from that. I think that there's early signs if you chat with the people at NCCI that they are starting to see, in the more recent years, issues around severity trend. And they are starting to recognize the current accident years can only be supported so much by positive development coming out of prior years. In addition to that, my understanding is that the WCIRB out on the West Coast had a view that rates should be moving up, give or take, call it, I think it was 7% or so. And that got shut down by the insurance department out there. So there's growing tension there as well. So Ryan, I can't call it to the day, the week, the month or even the quarter, but there's a growing level of evidence that the music is slowing. That party is going to come to an end. It was likely prolonged by COVID because of the holiday around frequency and that has sort of allowed it to continue on for some time. But I think 24 months or so, maybe less, people are going to have to start to wake up and address it. I think the industry is probably running well over 100 at this stage as far as comp."

I would tell you that it's surprising to me, quite frankly, and I think we may have touched on this last time, but I apologize if it's repetitive. But there's a real divide these days between what I would define as standard market, that being national carriers and super regionals have an appetite for, versus what they don't have an appetite for. If they don't have an appetite for it, there seems to be more meaningful discipline in the specialty and the E&S market, and that's really attractive. I have been surprised that many national carriers and large regional carriers have been willing to be exceptionally competitive on what remains within their strike zone or their appetite. So again, I can't speak specifically to how they're thinking about loss trend and what their view is on this or that, but I can tell you that it is a very bifurcated world as far as level of competition between what is still within the appetite of the standard market and what falls outside."

So if you have [indiscernible] through the years shorter than the portfolio duration, you know what your exposure is. Whereas if your duration is 3 years longer than your portfolio -- that gives you a different kind of risk. So I would guess, the answer is, we have never been consequentially longer a year or 2, maybe 3 on the long side. And when we have been such, we've been such because we think the world is paying way too much in interest rates for the current interest rate picture. So today, it would be a different story. We don't -- we think the pricing for interest rates is such that it's unlikely that get a lot of exposure. People paying a lot too much as far as rates, and I think that that's maybe even worse because at the moment, it's really an issue where you're confronting an environment where current interest rates are significantly in excess of the current market. So we have never, as far as I remember, really gambled on interest rates substantially in excess of our forecasted duration. And the answer is, we've never been long side, doesn't suit our general conservative nature. So yes, you in fact have caught one of the views that we have primarily, and that is, you don't get rewarded for taking a long-term debt, interest returns being in excess of the return on your duration. By the way, I would be happy if somebody has the idea when it come up with that because that would be a hell of that."

Co-hosting with me this afternoon is Bill Berkley, our Executive Chairman as well as Rich Baio, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
We're going to follow the usual agenda where I'm going to hand it over to Rich momentarily. He's going to run through some highlights of the quarter. Once Rich has completed his comments, I'll receive the baton back from him, offer a few thoughts on my own, and then we'll be pleased to open it up for Q&A and take the conversation anywhere participants would like to take it. 
Before I hand it over to Rich, there is a one pointer or topic that I did want to flag, and it's something that we talk about with some regularity within our shop. And I don't think it's a unique observation, I'm sure everyone on the call and beyond is acutely aware of this point, but nevertheless, I think it easily falls off the radar screen as we can easily get consumed by other aspects of the industry. 
And that is the macro observation or reality that this is a very unusual industry for a variety of reasons, but one of them is, this is an industry where you do not know your cost of goods sold until oftentimes many years after the transaction has actually occurred. That creates additional complexity and how one operates the business. It's less consequential when you're operating through an extended period of time where things are quite stable. But when you're in a period of time where changes abound, volatility is material, it becomes much more consequential. 
Most businesses in other industries, I would suggest, the way they operate is akin to how you steer a car. You turn the wheel of a car, the wheels in the front of the car turn and the car will turn quickly. Because of what we're discussing now this reality of the timing of cost of goods sold relative to when the transaction occurs, in this industry it's different from driving a car. 
In some ways, it's more like steering a boat, where the rotor is in the back of the boat as opposed to the wheels in the front of the vehicle. The difference in this industry, like a boat or a ship being steered from the back, is one needs to anticipate. One needs to not just be consumed by what has occurred yesterday, not just be preoccupied with what is immediately in front of them, but one needs to anticipate what is coming their way because of the delay in response to steering the ship. One needs to be trying to figure out what is around the next corner or over the hill. 
This is something that we spend a huge amount of time working at grappling with as a team. It is one of the reasons why we have been focused on certain things for a long period of time. Whether it's social inflation or economic or financial inflation, these are 2 macro topics that we have been talking about and acting upon for several years at this stage. You can see it in our underwriting and how we have selected loss picks and how we have priced our book of business. 
You can see it in our investment portfolio and how we have managed our duration. So while these types of topics have become very topical today and we hear people chatting about it, these are things that we anticipated and have been preparing for, as I suggested earlier, years. It's one of the reasons why we are so well positioned. It's not easy. It requires expertise. It requires experience. It requires discipline. It requires foresight, and it requires courage. 
Fortunately, my colleagues throughout this organization have those characteristics and traits, and that, in my opinion, is the leading reason why this organization is so well positioned today and by extension, is enjoying the results that we are talking about today and anticipate we will be talking about for many, many quarters and years to come. 
So with that, so much for me just keeping it short at the beginning and handing it over to Rich. Let me hand it over to Rich now, and I promise I'll be somewhat brief after he provides his thoughts and comments. Rich, if you would, please."

The company reported another strong quarter, as you saw, with operating income increasing 43% to $313 million or $1.12 per share. The key contributors include strong underwriting income driven by continued growth in premium volume, which I'll discuss in just a moment, along with improving net investment income and foreign currency gains. 
We also reported net income of $179 million or $0.65 per share. Pretax underwriting income of $268 million in large part kept pace with the record first quarter, representing an increase of 32.6% over the prior year second quarter. Our year-to-date quarterly results of $543 million increased 41% over the prior year and surpassed all prior full year results with the exception of 2021, which was a record year. Despite the heightened frequency of natural catastrophes, we reported pretax cat losses of $58 million in the quarter or 2.5 loss ratio points compared with $44 million or 2.2 loss ratio points last year. 
Drilling down further into our underwriting results, gross premiums written grew to a record level of almost $3.1 billion. Net premiums written grew 16.9% to a record of nearly $2.6 billion. Our decision to retain more business on a net basis can be seen by the lower session rate in the quarter and on year-to-date basis. 
Net premiums written increased in all lines of business as we disclosed in the earnings release. The Insurance segment grew 16.6% to more than $2.3 billion while the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment increased 19.1% to almost $260 million. The overall growth is significantly coming from increased exposure. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 0.3 loss ratio points to 58.5%. 
Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $2 million in the current year, bringing our calendar year loss ratio to 60.9%. The expense ratio continues to benefit from scaling the business as evidenced by the outpaced growth in net premiums earned relative to underwriting expenses. In addition, we continue to make investments in strategic initiatives to optimize efficiency, and as such, the expense ratio improved 1 point to 27.7% over the prior year's quarter. 
In summary, the current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 1.3 loss points to 86.2% compared with the second quarter of 2021 of 87.5%. The reported calendar year combined ratio was 88.6% for the current quarter compared with 89.7% for the prior year. Net investment income for the quarter was approximately $172 million. The rising interest rate environment is a key contributor to growth and income from the core portfolio of almost 30%. 
On investment funds, you may recall, we report on a 1-quarter lag, and despite the decline in the equity markets in the first quarter, the investment funds performed well with a book yield of 8.3%. The transportation, real estate and energy funds led the way. The overall investment portfolio also maintained the same duration of 2.4 years and a credit quality of a AA-. 
Pretax net investment losses in the quarter of $172 million is primarily attributable to the net change in unrealized losses on equity securities of $132 million, which related to sector declines in financial services, energy and metal mining and manufacturing. Stockholders' equity was $6.5 billion as of June 30, 2022. Year-to-date earnings have more than offset the change in unrealized losses on investments and currency translation adjustments, both items being components of stockholders' equity. 
We returned capital to shareholders in the first 6 months of the year through regular and special dividends amounting to $182 million, of which $159 million was in the second quarter. The annualized operating return on beginning of year equity was 18.8% for the quarter and 10.8% on a net income basis.

So a couple of quick soundbites from me, and again, as promised, then we'll open it up for the Q&A. The top line continues to be very healthy. I would tell you that in the specialty space, in particular, E&S, but specialty in general, we are seeing continued strength in submissions, and we're feeling particularly good about that. 
We're also seeing finally some resilience in the reinsurance market. Consequently, as you saw the growth in that segment as well. On the insurance front, jumping around here, other liability was particularly strong. Shorter tail was strong as well and commercial auto was reasonably robust. As far as what the contribution to the 17 points of growth, rate was a meaningful contributor. Ex-comp, we were at 6.8% or so. 
I think it's important that people keep in mind and not confuse or decouple rate versus exposure growth. And one of the things that we've been very focused on, and I worry that some industry participants may not be as focused on, is a change in exposure, particularly in an inflationary environment is something that we pay a lot of attention to. Obviously, there's an opportunity to keep up with it through payrolls on comp, GL. As far as revenue on the property front, the appraised values that you get at the time of the underwriting and inception. But making sure that one does not fall behind is an important thing and approximately 2/3 of our policies are adjustable based on exposure. So that's a really important piece to make sure that we can keep up with inflation. 
As far as strength of economy, certainly, there is a lot of sensitivity and concern. But I would tell you, as far as audit premiums at this stage, we are seeing considerable momentum on that front. Our audit premiums during the quarter were up 45% relative to the same period last year. And just on the retention front, something that I know we've discussed in the past, and we're very sensitive to not churning the book and making sure that the quality and the integrity of the book is intact as we continue to push for rate and make sure that we're getting the appropriate exposure. 
Long story short, renewal retention remained just north of 80%. Loss ratio, obviously, Rich covered a bit of noise coming out of the cats. I would characterize it as frequency of modest severity and that was probably the big story behind the 2.5 points. From my perspective -- and we've heard this and we think we've talked about it in the past calls, we've heard it from some people when they look at all the rate that we've gotten. Why is it that we're not seeing the loss ratio drop even more on the current accident year. 
And the simple answer is, there's a lot of unknown, and there's a lot of volatility and there are a lot of various leverage assumptions that we want to make sure we are appropriately thoughtful and measured, and we don't respond too quickly. Some people would say cautious. We would say that we're just being thoughtful and measured given the inflationary environment, both social as well as economic. 
In addition to that, and we may have touched on this last quarter, we're sensitive to the backlog in the legal system. And our best estimate, which is nothing more than an estimate is that due to COVID, there's still probably an 18-month backlog in the court system. One other piece on the loss ratio, and I think I shared this with all last quarter. And for us, it's just one of many data points that we pay attention to, and perhaps, it's of interest to you all and that's the paid loss ratio. From our perspective, it is an important data point. It's not the whole story, but an important data point. 
So here's a little bit of historical perspective for you again on Q2. And I'm going to give you what the paid loss ratio was going back to 2017 for Q2 as that creates as much of an apples-to-apples basis as we can, at least using shorthand. So the paid loss ratio Q2 in '17 was a 55.9. In '18, it was a 58.3. In '19, it was a 53.8. In 2020, it was 52.9. In '21, it was a 44.3. And in '22, it was 41.9. So obviously, an attractive trend. Doesn't necessarily tell the whole story, but again, from our perspective, a meaningful data point and an encouraging indicator. 
Expense ratio, again, Rich touched on this. We continue to see improvement for a whole host of reasons. Certainly, lots of folks are focused on it and trying to be more efficient, but the big needle mover is just the growth in the earned premium. And as you can see how it lags our written, there's likely more opportunity there over time. That having been said, we do have a few new operations. We'll have to see how they scale again over time. 
So 88.6 reported. If you back out the cats and you do the butt forward, it's an 86.2. On an operating basis, obviously, a pretty attractive return by virtually any measure. 
A couple of quick comments on the investment portfolio, and again, I think Rich summarized it well. So I'm not going to belabor the point too much here, but obviously, the duration remains notably short of where our liabilities are at 2.4 years compared to the liabilities, give or take, 4 years. 
I think it's also worth noting, you're just in the early stages of seeing the opportunity for this company and its earnings power when you saw the book yield of climb from -- in the last quarter, last quarter being Q1 2.2 up to 2.6 in just a period of 90 days. And new money rate for us these days is certainly north of 4, probably 4.25, give or take. 
We talked at the beginning of the call about foresight and discipline and a variety of other behaviors or traits and the importance of it. I think it has certainly been exercised on the underwriting side, but it is important to recognize how it has been also exercised on the investment side. The earnings power of this economic model going forward in a raising or increasing rate environment should not be underestimated. 
It's something we've discussed in the past. I think it's something that people have an understanding for when we have the discussion, but I'm not sure if it's fully appreciated what this means for our economic model and again, the earnings power of the business as you see interest rates continue to move up. 
So again, when we look forward, given the opportunities that we have before us, the flow of business coming our way continues to have significant momentum. The opportunity to make sure that we are getting the rate that we want and need continues to be there as well. And of course, the leverage that we have that is very much coming our way on the investment income side, I think all these things position us well for not just the coming quarters, but the coming years in all likelihood. 
So let me pause there, Josh, if we could please open it up for questions."

All I can share with you is that there is nothing that leads us to believe that the opportunity to continue to grow the business, both based on policy count, growth and exposure in our insureds along with additional rate, we don't see that being derailed in the immediate term.
So how long will it go on for? I don't know for sure. I think one of the things, Elyse, I know we've talked about in the past, and I think it is worth noting is that we're all very sort of conditioned to think about the cycle as one across product lines. And while the realities of a cycle certainly apply to all product lines, we need to remember that product lines are not marching in lockstep these days. 
So for example, it is our view that over the next 12 to 24 months, you are going to see the workers' comp market likely bottoming out and beginning to firm. And obviously, that's one of the, if not the largest, component of the commercial lines marketplace. So undoubtedly, there will be a moment where some commercial lines don't have the same buoyancy or resilience, but I would expect that you'll see other product lines firming as they are perhaps peaking or softening. So long story short, as far as specialty and E&S, there's nothing that we see in the short term derailing it. And I think that there are going to be other things such as comp that are in somewhat of an on-deck circle."

Others might call it disciplined. And from our perspective, one of the cornerstones of operating in the insurance industry is controlling the business. And when you buy someone else's business, you were buying somebody else's headaches and the seller typically knows more than the buyer. 
We have done the occasional acquisition, but we are very careful about that. So most deals that occur, we hear about them before they are announced because we are shown the opportunity, but again, ultimately, we have a long-term view. We are focused on risk-adjusted return and controlling the business is an important part of that. And most insurance deals, quite frankly, when people look back on by and large, they probably wouldn't do them all over again if they could, and we're not looking for that experience."

Yes. That having been said, to your point earlier, we have a lot of growth still like that will be coming through in the earned premium, and that will, in part, benefit the expense ratio.

But from our perspective, loss cost trend and if you choose to unpack that, particularly economic inflation as well as social inflation are exceptionally leveraged. And if you get those wrong by not a lot, it can be a real problem. 
We are not interested in trying to push the business. We are not interested in trying to take any unnecessary risks. On an operating basis, we're generating a high teens return without at least as we think about it being aggressive or optimistic. We're able to do that by being measured. And given that we think about the business through a risk-adjusted return lens, we think we are generating healthy returns for shareholders without increasing the risk by declaring victory prematurely. 
So we're quite comfortable with where we stand. We have a healthy respect for the unknown, and it's certainly something that we pay attention to. Obviously, as the reserves season out, we will be in a position to tighten up those picks. As we have historically, we will continue to do that, but in the early years, we're just not going to want to run the risk of moving prematurely.

I would tell you that the rate ticking down, what I would define as incrementally, is one I would encourage people not to read too much into it in a 90-day period. 
But number two, and more importantly, going back to an earlier point and what we at least attempted to articulate in the release is, when you are writing business where your returns are particularly attractive, the way you think about the balance between rate versus growth is perhaps different than it was when you didn't find the returns as attractive and rate was the priority. 
So each one of the businesses in the group or by product line, by territory is thinking about the balance, and it's multidimensional, but included in that is the balance between rate versus exposure growth. And I think a big piece of what you're seeing there, again, as we try to flag earlier is, there's a lot of the marketplace that we participate in that we like the rates. 
We like the margin that is available. We feel as though that through how we capture exposure change, we are effectively keeping up with economic inflation, and the rate that we're getting is more than adequate to keep up with any social inflation or stub of economic inflation. And we like it, and we're going to chase it and continue to optimize that balance."

I think it's people anticipating what the interest rate environment is going to do to the economy. So while -- so from our perspective, our insurers, they seem to be doing quite well. Businesses are growing. Sales are robust. Payrolls are going up. And quite frankly, inflation seems to be driving a lot of it, too. 
So if you think about workers' comp, just as an example, payrolls are going up because of wage inflation. If you think about the local store on Main Street, maybe they're selling more, but part of that is being driven by they're charging more for their products. And of course, on the property front, we all know what has happened with values. 
So again, from our perspective on the audit front, we're not seeing our insurers at least at this stage in any type of financial apparel. And we are seeing their businesses grow partly due to health in the economy, but probably even more so as of late due to inflation and prices and wages going up and values."

As far as we're somewhat uniquely positioned because we are not a heavy cat player. We, generally speaking, do not write large limits business. Well, we do write some, but just as a data point that we have shared with some folks in the past, insurance -- types of -- insurance where you can legally have a limit, 90% of our policies have a limit of $2 million or less. 
So as a result of that, we're just not as dependent on the reinsurance market because we're relatively cat light, and we're not a big limits player. So we will partner with people that are true partners, and we are not inclined to be arbitraged by those that are looking to do such."

We are far more well positioned than many of our peers. And the rating agencies, certainly one of the ways they look at capital strength is on a relative basis. So when you see some of our peers facing challenges with their bond portfolio, perhaps, those are not the type of severe challenges that we have to deal with fortunately for us.

And I think that there's a lot of industry results to support that. 
Again, I think a lot of it really -- and I think -- I'm not sure I've articulated it particularly well, Ryan, but a lot of it has to do with rate adequacy. And once you believe that your rate adequate or better, then it turns into how do you think about the balance between pushing harder on rate versus growing the iceberg. 
So I agree with your point that because we are not a giant property cat writer, and I think we need to draw the distinction between cat-exposed property and traditional risk. You're maybe not seeing the same level of rate increase, but you're also in a lot of the market that we participate in. To begin with, you didn't see the same level of inadequacy in rates.

And I think the realities of medical inflation which have been somewhat benign for some period of time, I think that's going to change. I think you're going to be seeing medical inflation take off, and a lot of it has been sort of historically focused around pharma. And I think it's not just going to be pharma, I think it's going to be other aspects of medical inflation. I mean if you look at health care providers, big hospital systems or large groups, they are bleeding out of their ears, many of them, and something is going to have to change. 
So when the day is all done, there's going to be a moment of reckoning between the providers and the payers, and ultimately, the workers' comp market is not completely insulated from that. I think that there's early signs if you chat with the people at NCCI that they are starting to see, in the more recent years, issues around severity trend. 
And they are starting to recognize the current accident years can only be supported so much by positive development coming out of prior years. In addition to that, my understanding is that the WCIRB out on the West Coast had a view that rates should be moving up, give or take, call it, I think it was 7% or so. And that got shut down by the insurance department out there. So there's growing tension there as well. 
So Ryan, I can't call it to the day, the week, the month or even the quarter, but there's a growing level of evidence that the music is slowing. That party is going to come to an end. It was likely prolonged by COVID because of the holiday around frequency and that has sort of allowed it to continue on for some time. But I think 24 months or so, maybe less, people are going to have to start to wake up and address it. I think the industry is probably running well over 100 at this stage as far as comp."

Whereas shorter durations let you reset your mistakes more quickly and with more specific challenges. So if you count your integration's through the years is shorter than the portfolio duration, you know what your exposure is. Whereas if your duration is 3 years longer than your portfolio -- that gives you a different kind of risk. So I would guess, the answer is, we have never been consequentially longer a year or 2, maybe 3 on the long side. And when we have been such, we've been such because we think the world is paying way too much in interest rates for the current interest rate picture. 
So today, it would be a different story. We don't -- we think the pricing for interest rates is such that it's unlikely that get a lot of exposure. People paying a lot too much as far as rates, and I think that that's maybe even worse because at the moment, it's really an issue where you're confronting an environment where current interest rates are significantly in excess of the current market. So we have never, as far as I remember, really gambled on interest rates substantially in excess of our forecasted duration. 
And the answer is, we've never been long side, doesn't suit our general conservative nature. So yes, you in fact have caught one of the views that we have primarily, and that is, you don't get rewarded for taking a long-term debt, interest returns being in excess of the return on your duration.

And let me echo your welcome to all to our third quarter call. We appreciate your finding time to join us. .
Joining me on this end of the call is also Bill Berkley, our Executive Chairman; as well as Rich Baio, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow our typical agenda where on very short order, I'm going to be handing it over to Rich. He's going to run through some highlights of the quarter. I will follow with a couple of observations on my end, and then you will have the 3 of us at your disposal to take a Q&A session anywhere people would like to take it. 
Before I hand it over to Rich I don't want to flag or [indiscernible] and something that a good deal I think that out on end.  And particularly come to focus during [indiscernible] time what we thought on the third quarter when [indiscernible] activity [indiscernible] considerably and great intention among the many, trying to understand the exposure, trying to understand the activity, and what does that mean from a dollars and cents perspective. And those questions are well placed and are all important and appropriate. 
That having been said, in the flurry of activity around trying to understand what has transpired from a financial perspective, it is easy to lose sight of the more, what I would call, the human aspect, and the loss that has occurred and how that impacts individuals, not just their homes being destroyed, but oftentimes something even more severe such as the loss of life. 
So I did want to comment on this that it is something that my colleagues and I pay great attention to. We are sensitive to and all of those impacted by the events of the third quarter are certainly in our thoughts. Furthermore, we have many colleagues, particularly on the claims side of the business that are working tirelessly to make sure that we, as an organization, are servicing customers, making sure we, as an organization, are living up to our commitments and our promises, which is something we take very seriously. And finally, from our perspective, to the extent there is any type of silver lining in these types of situations. 
Clearly, it is an opportunity for the industry to demonstrate the value that it brings to society. We cannot undo what has been done but we certainly are in a position to assist society and picking up the pieces and trying to put it back together. That is not just an obligation but an opportunity that we, as an organization, take very seriously. So I will leave it there for the moment. And now, Rich, if you wouldn't mind taking us through the numbers having said all that. Rich, please?"

Operating income increased 14.2% to $282 million or $1.01 per share with operating return on equity of 16.9%. Net income of $229 million or $0.82 per share resulted in a return on equity of 13.8%. The company reporte",665,"Sure. Thank you, Rob. Appreciate that. Operating income increased 14.2% to $282 million or $1.01 per share with operating return on equity of 16.9%. Net income of $229 million or $0.82 per share resulted in a return on equity of 13.8%. The company reported strong underwriting income in spite of the industry-wide catastrophe events. In addition, the record quarterly net investment income and foreign currency gains resulting from the strong U.S. dollar contributed to our excellent quarterly results. 
Pretax underwriting income of $192 million, demonstrates the resiliency of our underwriting portfolio in an environment facing many challenges, including social and economic inflation as well as frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. We reported pretax catastrophe losses of $94 million in the quarter with 3.9 loss ratio points compared with $74 million or 3.5 loss ratio points in the prior year. 
Probably of no surprise, the main driver in the quarter was Hurricane Ian. We developed our best estimate on a ground-up basis, operating unit by operating unit, the predominance of which is IBNR due to the timing of the event. Focusing next on our top line, the company grew gross premiums written to a record of almost $3.1 billion. Net premiums written increased 10.8% to approximately $2.6 billion. Breaking this down further between segments. Insurance grew 11.5% to $2.2 billion, while reinsurance and monoline excess increased 6.8% to $340 million. Exposure growth is a significant contributor to the increase in premium. The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 30 basis points over the prior year to 58.6%. Prior year loss reserves developed unfavorably by 1.6 loss ratio points in the current quarter, bringing our calendar year loss ratio to 64.1%. Record quarterly net premiums earned benefited the expense ratio of 28%. We continue to invest in the business and identify strategies to operate more efficiently and optimize our technological capabilities. Wrapping up underwriting performance. 
Our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 86.6% and our calendar year combined ratio was 92.1%. Record quarterly net investment income of [ $203 million ] was led by growth in the core portfolio of 51% and and better-than-average investment fund results despite the significant downturn in the equity markets. The increased invested asset base, along with higher interest rates, is contributing to much of the growth in the core portfolio. Book yields on the fixed maturity securities has sequentially improved each quarter this year with 2.2% in the first quarter, 2.6% in the second quarter and 3% in the current quarter. The short duration of our investment portfolio of 2.4 years, combined with strong operating cash flows of almost $1.8 billion year-to-date, should contribute to further growth in net investment income and improving book yields. At the same time, the short duration in the portfolio and high credit quality of AA- has tempered the market value impact on book value. 
As it relates to the investment funds, our diversification strategy has benefited our results to date despite certain funds correlation with the equity markets. Our investment funds are reported on a 1-quarter lag. And in light of the third quarter deterioration in the broader equity markets, we may see our fourth quarter results impacted. Pretax net investment losses in the quarter of $67 million, is primarily attributable to the net change in unrealized losses on equity securities of $50 million which largely related to sector declines in technology and financial services. Stockholders' equity was more than $6.3 billion as of September 30, 2022. Strong earnings of about $1 billion on a year-to-date basis has mostly offset the impact from rising interest rates on unrealized losses. At the same time, we proactively managed our capital position as evidenced through regular and special dividends of approximately $209 million year-to-date, along with share repurchases in the third quarter of almost $7 million. 
Fitch validated this view of our financial strength early last week with an upgrade to AA- from A+. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob."

I promise I'll keep it on the brief side, though I think I say that every time, and I rarely do, but I guess it depends on your definition of brief. So the marketplace overall remains a very interesting one from our perspective. There are pockets of the market that remain extremely attractive, and there are others that is surprising the level of competition One of the observations that we have shared in the past, and we continue to see a very much a reality is how the market is still as cyclical as ever. That having been said, different product lines are marching not in lockstep, but very much to the beat of their own drum, which translates to -- they are at different points in the cycle at any moment in time. 
I would tell you that the specialty space, in particular, the E&S space remains very attractive. In addition to that, I would tell you that if it is a piece of business that falls within the appetite of the standard market, particularly a national carrier and some regional carriers. It is shocking to us how competitive some participants are willing to be. That having been said, if you have an opportunity to look at our release and you look at Page 7, you would have seen the different product lines and where the growth is coming from Certainly, in our opinion, if a leading indicator is if we are growing at a healthy rate, it means that we think there's margin there, and we are leaning into it. When you look at the various product lines, certainly short tail lines, in particular, property as of late is demonstrating more opportunity. 
In addition to that, when you look at the reinsurance space,  we are seeing a similar opportunity and it's likely you'll see us leaning into that even more. On the other hand, you have professional liability with particularly public D&O standing out as a product line that has become increasingly competitive, and workers' compensation, that is a product line that we've been talking to those that are willing to listen for an extended period of time that we've been surprised by the level of competition. 
You might say how do you reconcile that with the growth rate that you have in the product line during the period to make a long story short, it's just exposure, if you will, growth in payroll. Overall, we, as an organization, benefit from the diversity of our product offering as a result of that at any moment in time, there are parts of our portfolio that are shrinking and there are parts of our portfolio that are growing and growing dramatically. We are in the marketplace every day trying to optimize the market may move towards us. It may move away from us, but we are consistently there at a rate that we think is appropriate or then some. When you look at the growth that Rich talked about in the quarter, approximately 11%, we think is reasonably healthy. Again, the discipline on the professional liability that I alluded to a few moments ago, I think, has created a little bit of a headwind. 
That having been said, our discipline remains with our renewal retention ratio remaining at approximately 80%, and we are getting a bit of a premium on new business relative to our existing portfolio, which as we've discussed in the past, we think, makes sense because you know more about your renewal book and your new book. As you would have also picked up during -- it's somewhere in the release, we made some good progress on the rate front coming in at 7.3% ex workers' comp. 
And at that pace, we're quite comfortable that in the aggregate, we are keeping up with trend. I think another data point that's important, particularly in an inflationary market, and that is a premium to what extent if the exposure is growing, are you capturing that and making sure after the policy incepts that you're going back to collect everything you should have. And we were pleased to see the growth in our audit premiums over the corresponding period last year, up 42%. Rich walked through the loss ratio with you all the 64.1. For those that subscribe to the [indiscernible] 4 model, it's a 58.6, the 64.1 when the day is all done, in my opinion, that is reality. That having been said, breaking it down, Rich walks you through the cats of 3.9. And the last piece as far as the development goes was essentially entirely related to what I would define as isolated and unique events stemming from COVID. And to the best of our knowledge, and as clearly as we can see it, we do not envision this being an ongoing issue. Again, we view it as isolated to 2 unique situations and that's how it looks to us at this point. So that's the best of our knowledge. With the 58.6, as Rich flagged a bit of a small step in the right direction and improvement of, call it, 30 basis points on the ex cat accident year. Look, when the day is all done, we are pushing on the rate, and we are not going to declare victory prematurely. I understand some people have done the math and said, well, why isn't your ex cat accident year loss ratio improving more and it's because of something called inflation that comes in 2 different flavors that we are exposed to, both financial or economic as well as social. Expense ratio at 28%. We think that is pretty healthy by any measure, particularly for a specialty writer. Some of the realities that we had talked about during COVID and the COVID benefit on expenses. Those are starting to dissipate as people are traveling and entertainment is coming back to be part of our business. That having been said, also costs are going up. We are not just focused on inflation as far as raising our rates and what it means for our loss costs and how we're responding to that with rate increases, also it impacts our operational costs and making -- whether it be remuneration or any other expenses that we have. Rich, just on the investments, I'm just going to, I guess, echo a couple of his comments. Long story short, I think we are very much being rewarded for the discipline. 
I have made the comment in the past how we went for many years, keeping our duration short and not compromising on quality. And quite frankly, that came at a cost. There were others that were compromising on quality and taking the duration out and they serve themselves well for that day, but did not position themselves particularly well for tomorrow.  And guess what, tomorrow is here. As a result of that foresight and that discipline, we are enjoying the benefits as to what the impact has been on our book value as far as the unrealized or some perhaps other organizations maybe are realizing it. 
And in addition to that, we have the benefit of being able to put money to work at higher rates much more quickly than others. You would have -- as Rich flagged for you, our book yield ticked up considerably in a 90-day period going from about 2.6 to 3. And obviously, you all can do the math as easily as we can as to where the new money rate is likely going given where interest rates are today and it would seem as though that they are headed tomorrow. So we have a lot of room to push the duration out a bit if we think it makes sense if we are getting paid for it. And we think that we are very well positioned. 
So long story short, and I guess, desperately trying to live up to my word that I would keep it for. What's the punch line? The punchline is that we are an organization that has, is and will continue to be very focused on risk-adjusted return. When we think about risk-adjusted return, we clearly take volatility into account. We have the ability to pivot from 1 product line to another emphasizing and deemphasizing products as we see fit, depending on market conditions. Certainly, it is very possible, for example, that you will see us participate more significantly in the property cat space. 
It would be my expectation to the extent we chose to participate depending on how attractive the market gets that we would probably participate for a year or 2, unlikely more than 3 in a significant way. We are going to deploy capital with an eye towards risk-adjusted return, and we are not going to be shy to let the business go when we don't think it makes sense anymore. The same focus on risk-adjusted return that applies to underwriting also, as I mentioned a moment or 2 ago, applies to our investment activities. We are disciplined. We are focused on the idea of how much risk we are taking on and are we getting paid appropriately for it. When the day is all done, we are in business to build book value for shareholders. 
And we think that we have been able to do that again because of our eye towards risk-adjusted return. 
So let me pause there and we would like to open it up for questions, if we could, please."

And we're conscious of the environment. And while we all would like to grow, that is not going to overshadow our focus around rate adequacy. So again, I would be careful not to be too much one way or another into a certain number of basis points, but I can tell you that rate adequacy remains a priority. As far as market conditions going forward, it is pretty clear to us that property pricing, particularly [indiscernible] property pricing, but property pricing in general is going up. It has -- we haven't seen it in a long time, but it's likely to be led by the reinsurance market and the insurance market, I expect will follow. 
And we will be leaning into that in every way that we think makes sense for the organization. Will there be a spillover to other product lines? We will see with time. It's not as clear to us that, that will be the case, though to the extent those opportunities presented themselves, I promise you we will be there to catch them and try and take advantage of them. But again, certainly, as far as property and cat exposed property and perhaps the most interesting property cat reinsurance or even certain types of retro. Those are things that we are paying close attention to, not just as a buyer, but potentially as a meaningful seller. But again, we would be there when we think the margin is there. Typically, the vast majority of the time during the cycle. We do not believe the margin is there, which is why we control it very tightly, but we are not shy to lean into it if we think that it makes sense from a risk-adjusted return basis."

Inflation came up a lot in your prepared remarks, obviously. And I think last time you you gave us an update on this.

But again, at 7.3%, I think it's still very fair to say that we are outpacing it by more than 100, maybe it's 200 basis points but it's a pretty healthy margin. That having been said, as I have suggested, we are not going to declare victory prematurely. There is a huge amount of sensitivity around those assumptions. And if it proves that it's something more than we expected, we're going to make sure that we have the ability to try and absorb that. So it's going to take some time for that to season.

In addition to that, the fact of the matter is, while to move the duration out would -- in a meaningful way would require us to go pretty far out on the yield curve, and we don't think you get paid enough, quite frankly, to take it out. And we're pretty comfortable in that what I would define as 3- to 5-year zone, if you like, probably at this moment, a little bit closer to 3 than 5, but sort of in between. And that will naturally even may take the duration up a little bit, but not a huge amount.

It may not happen as quickly as one might think it should happen. It's starting to happen today, and I expect you're going to see it become even more visible as we make our way through next year. what the spillover will be into some of the other product lines I don't know.

But if we go back to a period that we were touching on earlier in our discussion, I think you flagged 2002 -- if you go back to the end of 2001, right around 9/11, the market was starting to firm a bit and then 9/11 served as a significant catalyst to affirming and giving people the conviction to really push. But if you go back and you look at the 2002 year for much of the market, that did not prove to be such a great year because pricing started to go up. But just because it was going up, it really didn't become truly adequate until 2003. So if you look at those policy years, it was really the 2003 year where it started to become more attractive. So long story short, Josh, I think there is a lag. I think you raised in my opinion, an important point, and I think that ultimately, that lag oftentimes proves to be a further catalyst to get people to push even harder.

And it's a similar story on the reinsurance front, where, again, we have the ability to flex but just demonstrating through action, if you will, we have not found the pricing to be particularly attractive until as of late, and it will likely become even more attractive, which is why if you look at sort of where our growth is and what's happened in the third quarter, it was really some recent opportunity for us to try and take advantage of a changing market, and you may see more of that. But again, we are not a big player in the space today, and I don't think it's ever going to be the lion's share of our business, but it could become a more significant part of our business temporarily over the next year or 2."

And let me echo your welcome to all to our third quarter call. We appreciate your finding time to join us. Joining me on this end of the call is also Bill Berkley, our Executive Chairman; as well as Rich Baio, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow our typical agenda where, on very short order, I'm going to be handing it over to Rich. He's going to run through some highlights of the quarter. I will follow with a couple of observations on my end, and then you will have the 3 of us at your disposal to take a Q&A session anywhere people would like to take it. 
Before I hand it over to Rich, I did want to flag or raise a thought for participants' consideration, and it's something that we spent a good deal of time thinking about on our end. And it particularly comes into focus during periods of time like what we saw in the third quarter when cat activity spikes considerably. And great attention, amongst many, turns to trying to understand exposures, trying to understand claims activity and what does that mean from a dollars and cents perspective. And those questions are well placed and are all important and appropriate. 
That having been said, in the flurry of activity around trying to understand what has transpired from a financial perspective, it is easy to lose sight of the more, what I would call, the human aspect and the loss that has occurred and how that impacts individuals, not just their homes being destroyed, but oftentimes something even more severe such as the loss of life. 
So I did want to just comment on this that it is something that my colleagues and I pay great attention to, we are sensitive to, and all of those impacted by the events of the third quarter are certainly in our thoughts. Furthermore, we have many colleagues, particularly on the claims side of the business, that are working tirelessly to make sure that we as an organization are servicing customers, making sure we as an organization are living up to our commitments and our promises, which is something we take very seriously. 
And finally, from our perspective, to the extent there is any type of silver lining in these types of situations, clearly, it is an opportunity for the industry to demonstrate the value that it brings to society. We cannot undo what has been done, but we certainly are in a position to assist society in picking up the pieces and trying to put it back together. That is not just an obligation but an opportunity that we as an organization take very seriously. 
So I will leave it there for the moment. And now, Rich, if you wouldn't mind taking us through the numbers having said all that. Rich, please?"
254504,1801924170,2661753,"W. R. Berkley Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2022",2022-10-24,"Earnings Calls","W. R. Berkley Corporation","Executives","Sure. Thank you, Rob. Appreciate that. Operating income increased 14.2% to $282 million or $1.01 per share with operating return on equity of 16.9%. Net income of $229 million or $0.82 per share resulted in a return on equity of 13.8%. The company reporte",662,"Sure. Thank you, Rob. Appreciate that. Operating income increased 14.2% to $282 million or $1.01 per share with operating return on equity of 16.9%. Net income of $229 million or $0.82 per share resulted in a return on equity of 13.8%. The company reported strong underwriting income in spite of the industry-wide catastrophe events. In addition, the record quarterly net investment income and foreign currency gains resulting from the strong U.S. dollar contributed to our excellent quarterly results. 
Pretax underwriting income of $192 million demonstrates the resiliency of our underwriting portfolio in an environment facing many challenges, including social and economic inflation as well as frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. We reported pretax catastrophe losses of $94 million in the quarter with 3.9 loss ratio points compared with $74 million or 3.5 loss ratio points in the prior year. Probably of no surprise, the main driver in the quarter was Hurricane Ian. We developed our best estimate on a ground-up basis, operating unit by operating unit, the predominance of which is IBNR due to the timing of the event. 
Focusing next on our top line. The company grew gross premiums written to a record of almost $3.1 billion. Net premiums written increased 10.8% to approximately $2.6 billion. Breaking this down further between segments, Insurance grew 11.5% to $2.2 billion, while Reinsurance & Monoline Excess increased 6.8% to $340 million. Exposure growth is a significant contributor to the increase in premium. 
The current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 30 basis points over the prior year to 58.6%. Prior year loss reserves developed unfavorably by 1.6 loss ratio points in the current quarter, bringing our calendar year loss ratio to 64.1%. Record quarterly net premiums earned benefited the expense ratio of 28%. We continue to invest in the business and identify strategies to operate more efficiently and optimize our technological capabilities. 
Wrapping up underwriting performance. Our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.6%, and our calendar year combined ratio was 92.1%. Record quarterly net investment income of $203 million was led by growth in the core portfolio of 51% and better-than-average investment fund results despite the significant downturn in the equity markets. The increased invested asset base, along with higher interest rates, is contributing to much of the growth in the core portfolio. Book yields on the fixed maturity securities has sequentially improved each quarter this year with 2.2% in the first quarter, 2.6% in the second quarter and 3% in the current quarter. The short duration of our investment portfolio of 2.4 years, combined with strong operating cash flows of almost $1.8 billion year-to-date, should contribute to further growth in net investment income and improving book yields. At the same time, the short duration of the portfolio and high credit quality of AA- has tempered the market value impact on book value. 
As it relates to the investment funds, our diversification strategy has benefited our results to date despite certain funds' correlation with the equity markets. Our investment funds are reported on a 1-quarter lag. And in light of the third quarter deterioration in the broader equity markets, we may see our fourth quarter results impacted. Pretax net investment losses in the quarter of $67 million is primarily attributable to the net change in unrealized losses on equity securities of $50 million, which largely related to sector declines in technology and financial services. 
Stockholders' equity was more than $6.3 billion as of September 30, 2022. Strong earnings of about $1 billion on a year-to-date basis has mostly offset the impact from rising interest rates on unrealized losses. At the same time, we proactively managed our capital position as evidenced through regular and special dividends of approximately $209 million year-to-date, along with share repurchases in the third quarter of almost $7 million. Fitch validated this view of our financial strength early last week with an upgrade to AA- from A+. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob."
254504,1801924170,2661753,"W. R. Berkley Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2022",2022-10-24,"Earnings Calls","W. R. Berkley Corporation","Executives","Rich, thank you very much. So let me just offer a few comments. I promise I'll keep it on the brief side, though I think I say that every time and I rarely do, but I guess it depends on your definition of brief. So the marketplace overall remains a very",1600,"Rich, thank you very much. So let me just offer a few comments. I promise I'll keep it on the brief side, though I think I say that every time and I rarely do, but I guess it depends on your definition of brief. 
So the marketplace overall remains a very interesting one from our perspective. There are pockets of the market that remain extremely attractive, and there are others that is surprising the level of competition. One of the observations that we have shared in the past and we continue to see very much a reality is how the market is still as cyclical as ever. That having been said, different product lines are marching not in lockstep but very much to the beat of their own drum, which translates to, they are at different points in the cycle at any moment in time. 
I would tell you that the specialty space, in particular, the E&S space, remains very attractive. In addition to that, I would tell you that if it is a piece of business that falls within the appetite of the standard market, particularly a national carrier and some regional carriers, it is shocking to us how competitive some participants are willing to be. 
That having been said, if you have an opportunity to look at our release and you look at Page 7, you would have seen the different product lines and where the growth is coming from. Certainly, in our opinion, if a leading indicator is if we are growing at a healthy rate, it means that we think there is margin there, and we are leaning into it. When you look at the various product lines, certainly, short-tail lines, in particular, property, as of late is demonstrating more opportunity. In addition to that, when you look at the reinsurance space, we are seeing a similar opportunity, and it is likely you'll see us leaning into that even more. 
On the other hand, you have professional liability with particularly public D&O standing out as a product line that has become increasingly competitive, and workers' compensation, that is a product line that we've been talking to those that are willing to listen for an extended period of time that we've been surprised by the level of competition. You might say, ""How do you reconcile that with the growth rate that you have in the product line during the period?"" To make a long story short, it's just exposure, if you will, growth in payroll. 
Overall, we as an organization benefit from the diversity of our product offering. As a result of that, at any moment in time, there are parts of our portfolio that are shrinking, and there are parts of our portfolio that are growing and growing dramatically. We are in the marketplace every day trying to optimize. The market may move towards us. It may move away from us, but we are consistently there at a rate that we think is appropriate or then some. 
When you look at the growth that Rich talked about in the quarter, approximately 11%, we think, is reasonably healthy. Again, the discipline on the professional liability that I alluded to a few moments ago, I think, has created a little bit of a headwind. 
That having been said, our discipline remains with our renewal retention ratio remaining at approximately 80%. And we are getting a bit of a premium on new business relative to our existing portfolio, which as we've discussed in the past, we think, makes sense because you know more about your renewal book and your new book. As you would have also picked up during -- it's somewhere in the release, we made some good progress on the rate front coming in at 7.3% ex workers' comp. And at that pace, we're quite comfortable that in the aggregate, we are keeping up with trend. 
I think another data point that's important, particularly in an inflationary market, and that is audit premiums, to what extent, if the exposure is growing, are you capturing that and making sure after the policy incepts that you're going back to collect everything you should have. And we were pleased to see the growth in our audit premiums over the corresponding period last year, up 42%. 
Rich walked through with the loss ratio with you all, the 64.1%. For those that subscribe to the but-for model, it's at 58.6%, the 64.1%. When the day is all done, in my opinion, that is reality. That having been said, breaking it down, Rich walked you through the cats of 3.9. And the last piece as far as the development goes was essentially entirely related to what I would define as isolated and unique events stemming from COVID. And to the best of our knowledge and as clearly as we can see it, we do not envision this being an ongoing issue. Again, we view it as isolated to 2 unique situations, and that's how it looks to us at this point. So that's to the best of our knowledge. 
With the 58.6%, as Rich flagged, a bit of a small step in the right direction, an improvement of, call it, 30 basis points on the ex cat accident year. Look, when the day is all done, we are pushing on the rate, and we are not going to declare victory prematurely. I understand some people have done the math and said, ""Well, why isn't your ex cat accident year loss ratio improving more?"" And it's because of something called inflation that comes in 2 different flavors that we are exposed to, both financial or economic as well as social. 
Expense ratio at 28%, we think that is pretty healthy by any measure, particularly for a specialty writer. Some of the realities that we had talked about during COVID and the COVID benefit on expenses, those are starting to dissipate as people are traveling and entertainment is coming back to be part of our business. That having been said, also, costs are going up. We are not just focused on inflation as far as raising our rates and what it means for our loss costs and how we're responding to that with rate increases. Also, it impacts our operational costs in making -- whether it be remuneration or any other expenses that we have. 
Rich touched on the investments. I'm just going to, I guess, echo a couple of his comments. Long story short, I think we are very much being rewarded for the discipline. I have made the comment in the past how we went for many years keeping our duration short and not compromising on quality. And quite frankly, that came at a cost. There were others that were compromising on quality and taking the duration out, and they served themselves well for that day but did not position themselves particularly well for tomorrow. And guess what? Tomorrow is here. 
As a result of that foresight and that discipline, we are enjoying the benefits as to what the impact has been on our book value as far as the unrealized or some perhaps other organizations maybe are realizing it. And in addition to that, we have the benefit of being able to put money to work at higher rates much more quickly than others. You would have -- as Rich flagged for you, our book yield ticked up considerably in a 90-day period going from about 2.6% to 3%. And obviously, you all can do the math as easily as we can as to where the new money rate is likely going given where interest rates are today. And it would seem as though that they are headed tomorrow. So we have a lot of room to push the duration out a bit if we think it makes sense, if we are getting paid for it. And we think that we are very well positioned. 
So long story short, and I guess desperately trying to live up to my word that I would keep it short, what's the punch line? The punch line is that we are an organization that has, is and will continue to be very focused on risk-adjusted return. When we think about risk-adjusted return, we clearly take volatility into account. We have the ability to pivot from one product line to another, emphasizing and deemphasizing products as we see fit, depending on market conditions. 
Certainly, it is very possible, for example, that you will see us participate more significantly in the property cat space. It would be my expectation to the extent we chose to participate, depending on how attractive the market gets, that we would probably participate for a year or 2, unlikely more than 3 in a significant way. We are going to deploy capital with an eye towards risk-adjusted return, and we are not going to be shy to let the business go when we don't think it makes sense anymore. 
That same focus on risk-adjusted return that applies to underwriting also, as I mentioned a moment or 2 ago, applies to our investment activities. We are disciplined. We are focused on the idea of how much risk we are taking on and are we getting paid appropriately for it. When the day is all done, we are in business to build book value for shareholders. And we think that we have been able to do that again because of our eye towards risk-adjusted return. 
So let me pause there. And Bo, we would like to open it up for questions, if we could, please."

And we're conscious of the environment. And while we all would like to grow, that is not going to overshadow our focus around rate adequacy. So again, I would be careful not to be too much one way or another into a certain number of basis points, but I can tell you that rate adequacy remains a priority. 
As far as market conditions going forward, it is pretty clear to us that property pricing, particularly cat-exposed property pricing, but property pricing in general, is going up. It has -- we haven't seen it in a long time, but it's likely to be led by the reinsurance market. And the insurance market, I expect, will follow. And we will be leaning into that in every way that we think makes sense for the organization. Will there be a spillover to other product lines? We will see with time. It's not as clear to us that, that will be the case, though to the extent that those opportunities present themselves, I promise you, we will be there to catch them and try and take advantage of them. 
But again, certainly, as far as property and cat-exposed property and perhaps the most interesting property cat reinsurance or even certain types of retro, those are things that we are paying close attention to, not just as a buyer but potentially as a meaningful seller. But again, we would be there when we think the margin is there. Typically, the vast majority of the time during a cycle, we do not believe the margin is there, which is why we control it very tightly. But we are not shy to lean into it if we think that it makes sense from a risk-adjusted return basis."

My crystal ball is really no better than anyone else's, and we are trying to err on the side of being measured around loss picks in general. But again, at 7.3%, I think it's still very fair to say that we are outpacing it by more than 100. Maybe it's 200 basis points, but it's a pretty healthy margin.

In addition to that, the fact of the matter is while -- to move the duration out would -- in a meaningful way would require us to go pretty far out on the yield curve. And we don't think you get paid enough, quite frankly, to take it out.

From our perspective, for an extended period of time, and we've offered this perspective in the past, the reinsurance marketplace has kind of gotten led around by the nose by the insurance marketplace. And there's enough pain out there that has been building for an extended period of time. It would appear as though that the reinsurance marketplace maybe has gotten the courage and the discipline that has been a long time coming. And we have our view on what is rate adequacy. 
And if we see, for example, in particular, property cat reinsurance pricing getting to a level that we think makes sense, we have been making plans and positioning ourselves, as you would expect, or at least you don't, you should be expecting, to be able to participate in a meaningful way. But we are only going to do that if we think you are getting paid enough. We are not in that product line day in and day out, riding the cycle up and down. We are going to participate, call it, on average when we think everything lines up, the planets and stars line up for, call it, 2 years out of every 15 years. And it is certainly very possible that 2023 could be 1 of those 2 years. But if we don't like it, if it doesn't get hard enough, we're not going to stick our toe in the water, let alone a foot."

And if you don't mind, I might try and narrow the brush for a moment.

In addition to that, I think the standard market needs to be paying more attention, in my opinion, to loss trends than it would appear as though from a distance that some of them are. 
As far as the specialty carriers go, I think it varies by product line and by carrier. I think there are some that are very responsible and very disciplined. It's not clear to me -- it's reasonably clear, I should say, to me at this time that property pricing is going up. It may not happen as quickly as one might think it should happen. It's starting to happen today, and I expect you're going to see it become even more visible as we make our way through next year. 
What the spillover will be into some of the other product lines, I don't know. I think one of the pieces that we have talked about in passing is workers' compensation. And I would suggest to you, that's not one to lose sight of, given that I believe it still is the largest component of the commercial lines marketplace from a premium perspective. And we have got to be getting close to the bottom there. And that may mean it's going to take another year or 2, and that's going to need to tick up. So I think there's meaningful pain to come in comp. I think property people are recognizing they need to change. I think on some of the liability lines, particularly in the standard market, I think they better be careful of loss trend."

And how quickly can they pivot and how much can they debit accounts to get to a rate to support those higher reinsurance costs, we'll have to see with time. 
But if we go back to a period that we were touching on earlier in our discussion, I think you flagged 2002, if you go back to the end of 2001, right around 9/11, the market was starting to firm a bit, and then 9/11 served as a significant catalyst to affirming and giving people the conviction to really push. But if you go back and you look at the 2002 year, for much of the market, that did not prove to be such a great year because pricing started to go up. But just because it was going up, it really didn't become truly adequate until 2003. So if you look at those policy years, it was really the 2003 year where it started to become more attractive. 
So long story short, Josh, I think there is a lag. I think you raised, in my opinion, an important point. And I think that ultimately, that lag oftentimes proves to be a further catalyst to get people to push even harder. So that's nothing more than speculation from one observer."

And I would tell you that it's somewhat on a sliding scale. The more attractive we see the opportunity, the more healthy we see the risk-adjusted return, the more inclined that we are to write more of this type of business.

Yes, I do. But that doesn't mean that it's going to be -- it's not going to become more than half of what we do or something like that.
