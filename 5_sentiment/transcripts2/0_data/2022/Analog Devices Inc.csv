So once again, ADI delivered another record quarter, marking a strong start to the year. Our continued success was driven by our unparalleled high-performance portfolio and our team's strong operational execution and intense customer focus, enabling us to better meet the growing demand for our products. 
Now looking at our first quarter results. Revenue was $2.68 billion, up more than 20% year-over-year on a combined basis. Growth was broad-based, with all segments up double-digits year-over-year, led by Industrial and Automotive. Gross margin expanded to 72% and operating margin increased to over 45%. Adjusted EPS was $1.94, up 35% year-over-year. 
Now it's been nearly 6 months since we closed the Maxim transaction. Overall, we've made great progress on the integration to date. The feedback we've received from customers and our teams has been overwhelmingly positive. And we've taken important steps to strengthen our operations. 
In the many exchanges I've had with our customers, they have expressed their enthusiasm for the combination, recognizing the increased value that ADI and Maxim together bring to the market. Broadly speaking, ADI is viewed as a trusted long-term focused partner that takes a customer-first approach to our engagements. We offer a unique combination of best-in-class engineering and unmatched domain expertise, with a high-performance portfolio that spans from microwave to bits, from nanowatts to kilowatts, and from sensor to cloud. This is enabling us to develop more complete solutions that define the edge of possible. 
The acquisition of Maxim increases the breadth and depth of our high-performance portfolio especially in power management. Here, our more comprehensive power portfolio allows us to better address opportunities across industrial, automotive, data center, connectivity and consumers. Similar to the cross-selling activity we implemented with the LTC portfolio, we're aggressively identifying areas to attach this power portfolio with ADI's leadership positions in analog, mixed signal and RF. And with our extended sales and field organizations, we're better positioned to uncover cross-selling opportunities and serve existing and new customers who have an increased need for application and design support at a solutions level. 
I've also been highly engaged with our teams across ADI. The combination has unleashed excitement throughout the organization. There's a burning desire to capitalize on the numerous opportunities to accelerate revenue growth. And I'm already seeing firsthand the benefits of our collaboration, from operations, to engineering, to sales, making me excited for what's ahead. 
Turning firstly to our manufacturing operations. The analog sector is characterized by fragmentation, with diversity across products, customers, applications and markets. To tackle this complexity, we utilize a hybrid manufacturing strategy, providing us with vast capabilities across technology, processes and packaging necessary to create innovative solutions from 7 nanometers to 7 microns for our 125,000 customers. 
The combination with Maxim enhances our hybrid manufacturing model by enabling a more diverse network of internal facilities and external partners. This increases our access to technologies and capabilities, which in turn expands the scale and the scope of our offerings. We're investing in our internal manufacturing operations to build a more robust and cost-effective model. To that end, we're expanding the footprints of our Oregon and Limerick fabs and adding significant capital to our test operations at our facilities in the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. These investments will grow our capacity this year and into 2023, provide seamless product qualifications for our customers, and give us greater optionality between our internal facilities and foundry partners. 
Now ahead of our Investor Day in April, I'd like to preview some of the secular growth trends that make us most excited about the future of our industry and for our company. 
In the industrial market, we're seeing the compounding effect of many concurrent secular trends. For example, our instrumentation business, which is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments, is aligned with growth trends from connectivity, to EVs, to sustainability. The growing technology complexity of these applications requires ADI's more advanced metrology solutions, enabling us to continue increasing our SAM. 
Our factory automation business is empowering another critical trend of more intelligent and connected factories. Here, we support tens of thousands of customers of all sizes with our precision signal chain, power management, sensing technologies, and robust wired and wireless connectivity solutions. 
In automotive electrification, we're the global leader in battery management systems for EVs, with double the market share of our nearest competitor. We're continuing to build momentum globally. And in the last quarter, we've recorded several new design wins from premium European auto manufacturers. 
Electrification is not exclusive to the automotive sector. There is a necessary shift to sustainable energy sources to deliver the environmental benefits of electrification. This vision requires green energy generation with a smart grid, which digitally monitors and adjusts performance, and also energy storage systems, which mitigate intermittency issues related to variable user demand. ADI supports this infrastructure with control and sensing technologies as well as accurate monitoring and efficient power conversion to ensure the grid parameters remain stable. 
Within automotive, we're also seeing manufacturers create a more immersive human experience by digitalizing the cabin. This requires increased bandwidth, lower latency and more efficient power management, creating new opportunities for ADI's connectivity and power portfolios. For example, our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation provide customers with the highest fidelity solution while also reducing the vehicle's weight. In addition, our GMSL franchise and functional safety certified power management solutions are critical in architecting and efficiently powering advanced driver assistance systems. Overall, our market-leading positions in BMS, audio systems and GMSL, combined with our complementary customer bases, position our automotive franchise to deliver strong growth in the years ahead. 
Turning now to advanced communications networks. In wireless ADI's market-leading software-defined transceiver portfolio is enabling next-generation communication systems, from traditional 5G, to O-RAN, to low earth orbit satellites. And we're expanding our SAM with the industry's first transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. In wireline, our optical control and power portfolios are critical to tackling the exponential growth in bandwidth and compute power of carrier networks and hyperscale data centers Here, we see a large and underserved opportunity for ADI. 
So with that backdrop, we look forward to expanding on these areas and more at our Investor Day with our senior leadership team. 
So in closing, ADI is the leader in innovating at the edge. We have an industry-leading high-performance portfolio that continues to benefit from the acceleration of mass digitalization across industries. And with Maxim, our portfolio has increased in breadth and depth, and we see even more opportunity than ever to capture additional market share. And I'm very optimistic about what our future holds. 
And so with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth, who will take us through the financial details."
251411,1765630212,2495742,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2022",2022-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. .My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. The reve",989,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. .
My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. The revenue commentary is on a pro forma basis and includes pre-acquisition Maxim revenue in the comparable period. 
ADI delivered a very strong first quarter, with record revenue, profitability and earnings. These results reflect the secular demand for ADI's products, capturing synergies and effectively passing on inflationary costs. Our manufacturing team is diligently securing additional internal and external capacity as orders remain robust across all our markets and our backlog continues to grow. This sets the stage for continued sequential growth through the balance of fiscal 2022. 
So for the first quarter, revenue of $2.68 billion finished near the high end of our outlook, with double-digit growth across all end markets and geographies. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue and 8 straight of sequential growth. 
Looking at our end market performance for the quarter, Industrial, our most diverse and profitable market, represented 50% of revenue and achieved a new all-time high. Industrial has grown more than 20% year-over-year for 5 straight quarters, underscoring our strong market positioning, supported by numerous secular tailwinds, including automation, digital health care, sustainable energy, aerospace and instrumentation. 
Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, achieved another record, with every major application posting double-digit year-over-year growth. Our battery management system offering continues to outperform and represents over 15% of automotive revenue, underscoring ADI's leadership in electric powertrains. Additionally, secular content growth inside the cabin continues to drive both the A2B and GMSL connectivity franchises to new heights. 
Communications represented 15% of revenue and exhibited strength in wireless and wireline. We are in the early days of 5G deployment and expect global rollouts, led by North America, to accelerate in 2022 and beyond. And in wireline, demand remains strong as carriers and hyperscalers continue to upgrade their cloud infrastructure from long haul to data center. 
And lastly, consumer represented 14% of revenue and was in line with seasonality. Importantly, we continue to grow year-over-year, supported by strategic investments aimed at diversifying our customer and application mix. The first quarter demonstrated our increased portfolio breadth as all segments achieved growth, including professional audio video, gaming, wearables, hearables and personal electronics. 
Now looking at the P&L. Gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-over-year, resulting in a record 71.9%. Favorable product mix, higher utilizations and synergies were key drivers of the increase. OpEx in the quarter was $702 million, better than anticipated due to faster synergy progress. Operating margin of 45.8% increased 510 basis points year-over-year. Non-op expenses were $44 million, in line with last quarter. And our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 13%. All told, adjusted EPS of $1.94 increased 35%. Our record profitability this quarter was driven by the stronger revenue growth as well as the synergy capture. 
And now moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and equivalents. And on a trailing 12-month pro forma basis, our net leverage ratio was just under 1 turn. Days of inventory increased modestly sequentially to 115 and channel inventory remains below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target. 
Looking at cash flow items. CapEx was $111 million for the quarter and $387 million over the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, during fiscal 2022, we plan to invest 6% to 8% of revenue to significantly grow our front and back-end capacity and build a more resilient hybrid manufacturing model for the long term. Importantly, this higher level of CapEx will not hinder our capital return commitments. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $2.78 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue. Our free cash flow margin was lower by about 3% due to costs related to the Maxim acquisition. Over the same time period, we returned approximately $4.2 billion or more than 150% of free cash flow via purchases and dividends. And as a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We aim to use 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to consistently grow our dividend, with the remaining free cash flow used for share repo. And just yesterday, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit increases. We have now raised our dividend 19 times in the past 18 years. Our ASR program concluded in the first quarter, and as a result, we retired approximately 14.4 million shares. We are now more than halfway towards executing our $5 billion repo commitment by the end of calendar 2022. 
So let me finish with the second quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint, we expect all B2B markets to grow sequentially and for consumer to be flattish. At the midpoint, operating margin is expected to be 46.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. And this outlook includes approximately $100 million of annual run rate synergies, split roughly evenly between cost of goods and OpEx as we exit second quarter. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 13%. So based on these inputs, adjusted EPS should be around $2.07, plus or minus $0.10. 
And finally, let me end with an invitation. We are holding our Investor Day on April 5, where we look forward to sharing ADI's long-term strategy, our new financial model and a detailed update on all phases of our synergy road map. We hope to see many of you in person at our headquarters right outside of Boston, where we will offer unique customer-led interactive technology demonstrations and displays throughout the day. This includes showcasing our wireless battery management system for EVs and much more. 
I'll hand it off to Mike for the Q&A."

So we expect that we will be chasing demand throughout the year. We've got continued order strength across the business. As I said in the prepared remarks, all end markets, all geographies are looking strong. And our backlog is continuing to expand. We've delivered 8 sequential quarters of growth, and that's supported by the manufacturing team continued to increase their ability to supply. And as I mentioned in the remarks, we expect that increase to be progressive over the balance of the year while they continue to debottleneck the process. So that will help us drive sequential growth. 
From a supply standpoint, we're going to continue to look at the balance here and keep an eye on how things are going. But our view is that this will run through the balance of this year. And we expect that we'll probably still have a little bit of catching up to do in early '23. 
On pricing, that's a longer question, so let me split that into 2 pieces. Why don't I talk margins and then I'll let Vince talk kind of pricing strategy. So from margins, we along with the rest of the industry have been passing on the higher costs that we've been seeing. So we're not using this environment to take advantage of customers, but really targeting to maintain gross margins. So we have been pushing those costs out. But built into those margins is a number of items, including the synergy execution, which is coming in faster than we thought, some benefit of mix, higher revenue because we are actually shipping more units. So I think on a quarterly basis, unit shipment is up double-digits year-over-year. And then, of course, with all this unit increase in unit shipment, utilizations are also quite strong. So there's a number of benefits that are underlying the margin piece. 
But to finish off on pricing, I'm going to pass to Vince to maybe talk about how we're -- how he's talking to customers."

Vivek, just to add a couple of other color comments here. So we've historically managed our pricing to reflect the value that we deliver to our customers. We get an innovation premium for our products. And also, we have very, very long life products",236,"Yes. Vivek, just to add a couple of other color comments here. So we've historically managed our pricing to reflect the value that we deliver to our customers. We get an innovation premium for our products. And also, we have very, very long life products in our portfolio. And customers pay us to keep security of supply for the long term. And that's an approach that we intend to keep in perpetuity. 
I think also, pricing for us is more structural than cyclical. I think the last couple of years have really brought semiconductors from the background into the foreground and shown the importance of semiconductors to the modern digital economy. And I think customers understand the value in a more meaningful way. 
So I think, as Prashanth said, cost inflation, we're in the post-Moore's Law era, cost inflation, I think, is going to be a long-term facet of the economic dynamic of the semiconductor business. So I expect that cost increases will moderate, but there will be inflation, I think, for the medium to long term here. 
So I think when you put it all together, the industry is in a better place to capture more of the value that it's been generating over these many, many decades. And then I think we will benefit from that as a company based on the quality of our innovation, but also the new dynamics in the industry."

And to the extent that the price environment seems to be structurally changing, are there any parameters you can give us? Historically, pricing did X, and now we think it's going to do sort of x plus. And because -- and the reason why I asked the question is we look at your relative growth rates to some of the end markets that you participate in, and you're clearly growing significantly faster. And there is a content side of things. But that relative growth does kind of make people concerned about inventory levels. And so we look at inventory and revenue, we probably should be looking at it on units. I'm just kind of curious how we should try to factor in that pricing dynamic. ."

I would say we were [ accentuating ] towards 0 price reduction on the average, adding more ASPs to our products for the innovation that we're creating. And then I think that for the long term is going to be a better way to gauge ADI's pricing methodology. So we're pricing for value. And we're injecting significant amounts of R&D into the company to make sure that we keep ahead of our customers' needs. So that will be, I think, the primary dynamic for value capture for ADI for the years ahead."

I've talked with a lot of automotive companies over the last 6 months or so. And my sense is that everything that we're shipping has been used and I don't see any stockpiling. So content in vehicles is increasing every year. The value generation activity in the auto sector now is -- it's driven by semiconductors and software. So we're seeing content growth of 5% to 10% per year. And I think that will continue for the foreseeable future. .
We're seeing, I think, the shift towards EVs. I've been surprised by the speed of the shift myself in the 2021 period. And that our customers are tilting the content, the semiconductor content towards premium models. So that accelerates the content growth story versus history. And then long term, we expect to be able to grow our business in the automotive sector as a multiple of SAAR. We see tremendous opportunity to continue to drive our share and growth story of EVs. In cabin connectivity where we've got a very, very strong signal processing franchise, to which we've connected our A2B connectivity, road noise cancellations, a new value creator in the cabin. And we're very excited by the GMSL, the connectivity portfolio, the high-speed connectivity portfolio that we have inherited from legacy Maxim. And we have aggressive plans to continue to build that out, both in terms of product development as well as our manufacturing footprint. 
And last but not least, power. We're underrepresented in general in power management, I'd say, across the industry, and particularly in automotive and industrial. So I think the combined portfolio of ADI-Maxim gives us a tremendous opportunity to tap in to what is actually the largest sector. Power is the largest sector of the analog market, and it's growing at a compounded rate there. So that gives you a sense for our automotive thinking."

The -- in the last call, we talked about $20 million of synergies was realized in fourth quarter. And we said that there would be minimal impact in the first half before ramping more aggressively into the second half. We've moved faster than originally planned and we've captured more earlier. So we're going to exit second quarter at about $100 million of that $275 million. And as I said in the remarks, it's roughly split between both cost of goods and OpEx. The -- we'll give you an update on that $275 million in terms of how much we believe we can actually achieve in that first Phase 1 time period. We'll do that at the April earning -- Investor Day. Vivek will also specifically talk about his plans and what he is -- has high confidence on for Phase 2 of the cost synergies. And then our Head of -- our Chief Customer Officer is going to talk about the revenue synergies that we are expecting from the combination. So we'll lay all that out for you when we see you here in Boston in a couple of weeks."

The mix, which we talked about in the prepared remarks, again, very strong industrial at 50%, is great for us. And then higher unit volume, because we are up on a unit basis double-digits, and utilization, and then pricing also fits into that. So they are all elements of that. 
In terms of how to think about the gross margin on a go-forward basis, we'll share the new operating model or the financial model for the company in April. But I will preview to say that our focus continues to be on how do we drive the best revenue growth balancing that gross margin. So as we've met with investors, there's pretty uniform agreement that what they'd like to see is higher revenue growth and make the trades that are necessary on margin to be able to deliver higher revenue growth. So we'll talk more about the model in Investor Day. But I would not be encouraging folks to be modeling very high gross margin numbers over the long term."

We are having difficulty building inventory in the channel. We get it into the channel, and it moves out very quickly. Within ADI's books, our days of inventory are up slightly, primarily, as I mentioned, that we are planning to see revenue increase sequentially for the balance of the year. So you have the raw material and the WIP is in -- is sort of in the middle of the process now before that comes out, and that is -- that's up. We also had a little bit of finished goods up, but that was purely timing on when the quarter ended versus where the goods were in the transit process.

So once again, ADI delivered another record quarter, marking a strong start to the year. Our continued success was driven by our unparalleled high-performance portfolio and our team's strong operational execution and intense customer focus, enabling us to better meet the growing demand for our products.
Now looking at our first quarter results. Revenue was $2.68 billion, up more than 20% year-over-year on a combined basis. Growth was broad-based, with all segments up double-digits year-over-year, led by Industrial and Automotive. Gross margin expanded to 72% and operating margin increased to over 45%. Adjusted EPS was $1.94, up 35% year-over-year.
Now it's been nearly 6 months since we closed the Maxim transaction. Overall, we've made great progress on the integration to date. The feedback we've received from customers and our teams has been overwhelmingly positive. And we've taken important steps to strengthen our operations.
In the many exchanges I've had with our customers, they've expressed their enthusiasm for the combination, recognizing the increased value that ADI and Maxim together bring to the market. Broadly speaking, ADI is viewed as a trusted long-term focused partner that takes a customer-first approach to our engagements. We offer a unique combination of best-in-class engineering and unmatched domain expertise, with a high-performance portfolio that spans from microwave to bits, from nanowatts to kilowatts, and from sensor to cloud. This is enabling us to develop more complete solutions that define the edge of possible.
The acquisition of Maxim increases the breadth and depth of our high-performance portfolio especially in power management. Here, our more comprehensive power portfolio allows us to better address opportunities across industrial, automotive, data center, connectivity and consumers. Similar to the cross-selling activity we implemented with the LTC portfolio, we're aggressively identifying areas to attach this power portfolio with ADI's leadership positions in analog, mixed signal and RF. And with our extended sales and field organizations, we're better positioned to uncover cross-selling opportunities and serve existing and new customers who have an increased need for application and design support at a solutions level.
I've also been highly engaged with our teams across ADI. The combination has unleashed excitement throughout the organization. There's a burning desire to capitalize on the numerous opportunities to accelerate revenue growth. And I'm already seeing firsthand the benefits of our collaboration, from operations, to engineering, to sales, making me excited for what's ahead.
Turning firstly to our manufacturing operations. The analog sector is characterized by fragmentation, with diversity across products, customers, applications and markets. To tackle this complexity, we utilized a hybrid manufacturing strategy, providing us with vast capabilities across technology, processes and packaging necessary to create innovative solutions from 7 nanometers to 7 microns for our 125,000 customers.
The combination with Maxim enhances our hybrid manufacturing model by enabling a more diverse network of internal facilities and external partners. This increases our access to technologies and capabilities, which in turn expands the scale and the scope of our offerings. We're investing in our internal manufacturing operations to build a more robust and cost-effective model. To that end, we're expanding the footprints of our Oregon and Limerick fabs and adding significant capital to our test operations at our facilities in the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. These investments will grow our capacity this year and into 2023, provide seamless product qualifications for our customers, and give us greater optionality between our internal facilities and foundry partners.
Now ahead of our Investor Day in April, I'd like to preview some of the secular growth trends that make us most excited about the future of our industry and for our company.
In the industrial market, we're seeing the compounding effect of many concurrent secular trends. For example, our instrumentation business, which is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments, is aligned with growth trends from connectivity, to EVs, to sustainability. The growing technology complexity of these applications requires ADI's more advanced metrology solutions, enabling us to continue increasing our SAM.
Our factory automation business is empowering another critical trend of more intelligent and connected factories. Here, we support tens of thousands of customers of all sizes with our precision signal chain, power management, sensing technologies, and robust wired and wireless connectivity solutions.
In automotive electrification, we're the global leader in battery management systems for EVs, with double the market share of our nearest competitor. We're continuing to build momentum globally. And in the last quarter, we've recorded several new design wins from premium European auto manufacturers.
Electrification is not exclusive to the automotive sector. There is a necessary shift to sustainable energy sources to deliver the environmental benefits of electrification. This vision requires green energy generation with a smart grid, which digitally monitors and adjusts performance, and also energy storage systems, which mitigate intermittency issues related to variable user demand. ADI supports this infrastructure with control and sensing technologies as well as accurate monitoring and efficient power conversion to ensure the grid parameters remain stable.
Within automotive, we're also seeing manufacturers create a more immersive human experience by digitalizing the cabin. This requires increased bandwidth, lower latency and more efficient power management, creating new opportunities for ADI's connectivity and power portfolios. For example, our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation provide customers with the highest fidelity solution while also reducing the vehicle's weight. In addition, our GMSL franchise and functional safety certified power management solutions are critical in architecting and efficiently powering advanced driver assistance systems. Overall, our market-leading positions in BMS, audio systems and GMSL, combined with our complementary customer bases, position our automotive franchise to deliver strong growth in the years ahead.
Turning now to advanced communications networks. In wireless ADI's market-leading software-defined transceiver portfolio is enabling next-generation communication systems, from traditional 5G, to O-RAN, to low earth orbit satellites. And we're expanding our SAM with the industry's first transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. In wireline, our optical control and power portfolios are critical to tackling the exponential growth in bandwidth and compute power of carrier networks and hyperscale data centers Here, we see a large and underserved opportunity for ADI.
So with that backdrop, we look forward to expanding on these areas and more at our Investor Day with our senior leadership team.
So in closing, ADI is the leader in innovating at the edge. We have an industry-leading high-performance portfolio that continues to benefit from the acceleration of mass digitalization across industries. And with Maxim, our portfolio has increased in breadth and depth, and we see even more opportunity than ever to capture additional market share. And I'm very optimistic about what our future holds.
And so with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth, who will take us through the financial details."
251411,1765630212,2495930,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2022",2022-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. .My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. The reve",987,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. .
My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. The revenue commentary is on a pro forma basis and includes pre-acquisition Maxim revenue in the comparable period.
ADI delivered a very strong first quarter, with record revenue, profitability and earnings. These results reflect the secular demand for ADI's products, capturing synergies and effectively passing on inflationary costs. Our manufacturing team is diligently securing additional internal and external capacity as orders remain robust across all our markets and our backlog continues to grow. This sets the stage for continued sequential growth through the balance of fiscal 2022.
So for the first quarter, revenue of $2.68 billion finished near the high end of our outlook, with double-digit growth across all end markets and geographies. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue and 8 straight of sequential growth.
Looking at our end market performance for the quarter, Industrial, our most diverse and profitable market, represented 50% of revenue and achieved a new all-time high. Industrial has grown more than 20% year-over-year for 5 straight quarters, underscoring our strong market positioning, supported by numerous secular tailwinds, including automation, digital health care, sustainable energy, aerospace and instrumentation.
Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, achieved another record, with every major application posting double-digit year-over-year growth. Our battery management system offering continues to outperform and represents over 15% of automotive revenue, underscoring ADI's leadership in electric powertrains. Additionally, secular content growth inside the cabin continues to drive both the A2B and GMSL connectivity franchises to new heights.
Communications represented 15% of revenue and exhibited strength in wireless and wireline. We are in the early days of 5G deployment and expect global rollouts, led by North America, to accelerate in 2022 and beyond. And in wireline, demand remains strong as carriers and hyperscalers continue to upgrade their cloud infrastructure from long haul to data center.
And lastly, consumer represented 14% of revenue and was in line with seasonality. Importantly, we continue to grow year-over-year, supported by strategic investments aimed at diversifying our customer and application mix. The first quarter demonstrated our increased portfolio breadth as all segments achieved growth, including professional audio-video, gaming, wearables, hearables and personal electronics.
Now looking at the P&L. Gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-over-year, resulting in a record 71.9%. Favorable product mix, higher utilizations and synergies were key drivers of the increase. OpEx in the quarter was $702 million, better than anticipated due to faster synergy progress. Operating margin of 45.8% increased 510 basis points year-over-year. Non-op expenses were $44 million, in line with last quarter. And our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 13%. All totaled, adjusted EPS of $1.94 increased 35%. Our record profitability this quarter was driven by the stronger revenue growth as well as the synergy capture.
And now moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and equivalents. And on a trailing 12-month pro forma basis, our net leverage ratio was just under 1 turn. Days of inventory increased modestly sequentially to 115 and channel inventory remains below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target.
Looking at cash flow items. CapEx was $111 million for the quarter and $387 million over the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, during fiscal 2022, we plan to invest 6% to 8% of revenue to significantly grow our front and back-end capacity and build a more resilient hybrid manufacturing model for the long term. Importantly, this higher level of CapEx will not hinder our capital return commitments. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $2.78 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue. Our free cash flow margin was lower by about 3% due to costs related to the Maxim acquisition. 
Over the same time period, we returned approximately $4.2 billion or more than 150% of free cash flow via purchases and dividends. And as a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We aim to use 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to consistently grow our dividend, with the remaining free cash flow used for share repo. And just yesterday, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit increases. We have now raised our dividend 19 times in the past 18 years. Our ASR program concluded in the first quarter, and as a result, we retired approximately 14.4 million shares. We are now more than halfway towards executing our $5 billion repo commitment by the end of calendar 2022.
So let me finish with the second quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint, we expect all B2B markets to grow sequentially and for consumer to be flattish. At the midpoint, operating margin is expected to be 46.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. And this outlook includes approximately $100 million of annual run-rate synergies, split roughly evenly between cost of goods and OpEx as we exit second quarter. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 13%. So based on these inputs, adjusted EPS should be around $2.07, plus or minus $0.10.
And finally, let me end with an invitation. We are holding our Investor Day on April 5, where we look forward to sharing ADI's long-term strategy, our new financial model and a detailed update on all phases of our synergy road map. We hope to see many of you in person at our headquarters right outside of Boston, where we will offer unique customer-led interactive technology demonstrations and displays throughout the day. This includes showcasing our wireless battery management system for EVs and much more.
I'll hand it off to Mike for the Q&A."

So we expect that we will be chasing demand throughout the year. We've got continued order strength across the business. As I said in the prepared remarks, all end markets, all geographies are looking strong. And our backlog is continuing to expand. We've delivered 8 sequential quarters of growth, and that's supported by the manufacturing team continued to increase their ability to supply. And as I mentioned in the remarks, we expect that increase to be progressive over the balance of the year while they continue to debottleneck the process. So that will help us drive sequential growth.
From a supply standpoint, we're going to continue to look at the balance here and keep an eye on how things are going. But our view is that this will run through the balance of this year. And we expect that we'll probably still have a little bit of catching up to do in early '23.
On pricing, that's a longer question, so let me split that into 2 pieces. Why don't I talk margins and then I'll let Vince talk kind of pricing strategy. So from margins, we along with the rest of the industry have been passing on the higher costs that we've been seeing. So we're not using this environment to take advantage of customers, but really targeting to maintain gross margins. So we have been pushing those costs out. But built into those margins is a number of items, including the synergy execution, which is coming in faster than we thought, some benefit of mix, higher revenue because we are actually shipping more units. So I think on a quarterly basis, unit shipment is up double-digits year-over-year. And then, of course, with all this unit -- increase in unit shipment, utilizations are also quite strong. So there's a number of benefits that are underlying the margin piece.
But to finish off on pricing, I'm going to pass to Vince to maybe talk about how we're -- how he's talking to customers."

So we've historically managed our pricing to reflect the value that we deliver to our customers. We get an innovation premium for our products. And also, we have very, very long-life products in our portfolio. And customers pay us to keep security of supply for the long term. And that's an approach that we intend to keep in perpetuity.
I think also, pricing for us is more structural than cyclical. I think the last couple of years have really brought semiconductors from the background into the foreground and shown the importance of semiconductors to the modern digital economy. And I think customers understand the value in a more meaningful way.
So I think, as Prashanth said, cost inflation, we're in the post-Moore's Law era, cost inflation, I think, is going to be a long-term facet of the economic dynamic of the semiconductor business. So I expect that cost increases will moderate, but there will be inflation, I think, for the medium to long term here.
So I think when you put it all together, the industry is in a better place to capture more of the value that it's been generating over these many, many decades. And then I think we will benefit from that as a company based on the quality of our innovation, but also the new dynamics in the industry."

And to the extent that the price environment seems to be structurally changing, are there any parameters you can give us? Historically, pricing did X, and now we think it's going to do sort of X plus. And because -- and the reason why I asked the question is we look at your relative growth rates to some of the end markets that you participate in, and you're clearly growing significantly faster. And there is a content side of things. But that relative growth does kind of make people concerned about inventory levels. And so we look at inventory and revenue, we probably should be looking at it on units. I'm just kind of curious how we should try to factor in that pricing dynamic."

We had to ship more units to keep up with the annual price reductions. I would say we were asymptoting towards 0 price reduction on the average, adding more ASPs to our products for the innovation that we're creating. And then I think that for the long term is going to be a better way to gauge ADI's pricing methodology. So we're pricing for value. And we're injecting significant amounts of R&D into the company to make sure that we keep ahead of our customers' needs. So that will be, I think, the primary dynamic for value capture for ADI for the years ahead."

I've talked with a lot of automotive companies over the last 6 months or so. And my sense is that everything that we're shipping has been used and I don't see any stockpiling. So content in vehicles is increasing every year. The value generation activity in the auto sector now is -- it's driven by semiconductors and software. So we're seeing content growth of 5% to 10% per year. And I think that will continue for the foreseeable future.
We're seeing -- I think, the shift towards EVs. I've been surprised by the speed of the shift myself in the 2021 period. And that our customers are tilting the content, the semiconductor content towards premium models. So that accelerates the content growth story versus history. And then long term, we expect to be able to grow our business in the automotive sector as a multiple of SAAR. We see tremendous opportunity to continue to drive our share and growth story of EVs.
In cabin connectivity, where we've got a very, very strong signal processing franchise, to which we've connected our A2B connectivity, road noise cancellations, a new value creator in the cabin. And we're very excited by the GMSL, the connectivity portfolio, the high-speed connectivity portfolio that we have inherited from legacy Maxim. And we have aggressive plans to continue to build that out, both in terms of product development as well as our manufacturing footprint.
And last but not least, power. We're underrepresented in general in power management, I'd say, across the industry, and particularly in automotive and industrial. So I think the combined portfolio of ADI-Maxim gives us a tremendous opportunity to tap in to what is actually the largest sector. Power is the largest sector of the analog market, and it's growing at a compounded rate there. So that gives you a sense for our automotive thinking."

And then higher unit volume, because we are up on a unit basis double-digits, and utilization, and then pricing also fits into that. So they are all elements of that.
In terms of how to think about the gross margin on a go-forward basis, we'll share the new operating model or the financial model for the company in April. But I will preview to say that our focus continues to be on how do we drive the best revenue growth balancing that gross margin.
So as we've met with investors, there's pretty uniform agreement that what they'd like to see is higher revenue growth and make the trades that are necessary on margin to be able to deliver higher revenue growth.

We also had a little bit of finished goods up, but that was purely timing on when the quarter ended versus where the goods were in the transit process. So I wouldn't read anything into our increase in finished goods, except to say it's just -- it happened to be when the drawbridge closed for the quarter."

Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI delivered another quarter of record revenue, profitability and earnings, driven by continued insatiable demand for our products, strong operational execution and accelerated synergy capture. Moreover, amidst a dynamic macro environment, we're operating from a position of remarkable strength, supported by our record backlog, robust bookings and ongoing capacity expansions, which position us favorably as we enter the second half.
Now moving to a summary of our results. Revenue was $2.97 billion, above the high end of our outlook and up 28% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Strength was broad-based with all segments up double digits year-over-year. Impressively, adjusted gross margin expanded to 74% and operating margin to 50%. Adjusted EPS was $2.40, exceeding the high end of outlook and increasing over 50% from the year ago period. 
Overall, I'm very excited with our performance and our team's outstanding execution. Today, I'd like to reinforce what we shared at our Investor Day around how our markets are evolving and how we're investing to solve more of our customers' problems while also improving on our business model that's both rich with growth opportunities and, indeed, resiliency. 
The next wave in the evolution of the ICT sector is the nascent Intelligent Edge revolution. It will be characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale computing and pervasive connectivity, pushing processing and intelligence closer to the edge. Semiconductors are the bedrock enabling this next wave. And ADI, where data is born, is at the center of this revolution. 
At our core, we're an innovation-driven enterprise over the last decade through both robust organic investments and strategic M&A. We've built the industry's broadest and highest performance analog, mixed signal and power portfolio. Our offerings span from microwave to bits, nanowatts to kilowatts, sensor to cloud and increasingly from components to subsystems. Our vast arsenal of technologies, along with the deep level of engagement and support we provide our customers, has earned us the #1 positions in analog, mixed signal, RF and high-performance power. This, coupled with our focus on customer success, awards ADI with an innovation premium that is reflected in our ASPs that are more than 3x the industry average and also industry-leading gross margins. 
The growing scope of our customers' products is dramatically expanding in complexity and pressuring their product development teams and innovation cycles. To meet these challenges and deliver the next wave of disruptive innovations, we're investing over $1.6 billion in R&D annually. These investments strengthen our broad market franchise and enable us to expand our SAM and vertical applications where more complete solutions are necessary. We achieved this by integrating our core analog technologies with increasing levels of digital algorithms and software. 
Now let's look at how our technology is intersecting with our markets. Industries like transportation, energy, telecoms, manufacturing and health care are prioritizing digitalization. This is driving new generations of applications and fueling a host of concurrent secular growth trends, and I'd like to touch on just a few now. 
Starting with automotive. Here, ADI is the market leader in battery management systems, for example, for EVs. Our battery management systems, or BMS, solutions offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, reliability, safety and security. Our wireless BMS solution offers all the benefits of wired but also enables rapid battery pack configurability and cost-effective scaling of our customers' EV fleets. This innovative solution continues to gain traction in the market and adds to our content per system by up to 2x. 
Moving to communications, where ADI is the market leader in radio signal chains for 5G with a majority share across the ecosystem. Our latest generation transceiver includes a fully integrated digital front end and grows our SAM by 2x. This innovative radio architecture reduces system cost and waste and improves power efficiency. Further, the flexibility of these software-defined solutions allows them to be used across traditional 5G networks as well as an emerging Open RAN and LEO satellite networks. 
Lastly, health care. We have a #1 position with dominant share in medical imaging, for example. Subsystems like our photons to bits module are used by the top CT players in the world. Our solution delivers the highest-fidelity images while decreasing radiation dosage. And in the process, it allows us to capture 4x the SAM compared to offering just components alone. 
In addition to expanding our innovation edge across these secular trends to amplify growth, the Maxim combination creates a $1 billion revenue synergy opportunity for us over the next 5 years. The first opportunity arises from customer cross-selling, leveraging our complementary relationships to pull through our extended portfolio. Second is fusing together the new product road maps of these 2 premier Analog portfolios to push the boundaries of what's possible. And third is power management. Here, the combination with Maxim increases our breadth of power capabilities, creates a more cost competitive portfolio and adds to our engineering talent pool. As a result, we unlocked $4 billion of additional power SAM and look to double our power revenue in the years ahead. 
The proliferation of the Intelligent Edge and our revenue synergy opportunity gives me great confidence that we can bend the growth curve upwards, moving from our historical mid-single-digit growth rate to our new model of 7% to 10%. 
Now I'd like to speak a little to the unique resiliency of our business. The diversity of our portfolio is a source of great strength. We shipped 75,000 product SKUs, which support thousands of applications to over 125,000 customers. Notably, 80% of our revenue is derived from products that individually contribute no more than 0.1% of total revenue. And the longevity of our products is unmatched. On average, our products have life spans of a decade or more, effectively delivering recurring revenue streams for decades. It's these characteristics that create a high barrier to entry and an enduring business model. 
Finally, we utilize a geographically diverse 
[Audio Gap]
to best manage our operations through economic cycles. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we're investing in our internal manufacturing operations to build a more robust and cost-effective model. To that end, we're doubling the capacity of our internal factories and adding significant capital to our product test operations. These investments will grow our output this year and into 2023 and increase our swing capacity across our network to over 70% of revenue. 
So in closing, ADI is a leader in innovating at the edge, and I believe that our best days are still ahead of us as we drive increased value for our customers, shareholders and society. And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financial detail."

Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. It was great to see and hear from so many of you at our Investor Day last month, and it was also exciting to welcome so many of our customers to demonstrate our technologies in action.
As usual, my comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We printed another very impressive quarter with record revenue, profitability and earnings. These strong results reflect increasing demand for our highly differentiated products aligned to multiple secular trends as well as our ability to leverage our hybrid manufacturing model, offset inflation and accelerate synergy capture. 
Second quarter revenue of $2.97 billion finished above the high end of our outlook, with every B2B end market exceeding initial expectations. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue and our ninth straight sequential growth period. 
So let's look at the performance by end market. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, represented 51% of revenue and hit another all-time high. We experienced broad-based growth with digital health care, automation, instrumentation and test leading the way, underscoring increasing content and our strong position in these secular markets. Industrial has now grown more than 20% year-over-year for 6 straight quarters. 
Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, also achieved another record with all applications growing double digits year-over-year. In BMS, where we hold the #1 position, our quarterly revenue eclipsed $100 million for the first time. We expect strong growth to persist, given the momentum in the market and our continued design wins. Additionally, our A2B and GMSL solutions, which together make up roughly 20% of automotive, continued on their secular growth path fueled by the digitalization of the automobile. 
Communications represented 16% of revenue with robust broad-based growth. In wireless, we experienced growing demand across our RF portfolio as 5G deployments, particularly in North America, gained momentum. ADI's latest generation transceiver, which Vince spoke to, is ideally positioned to capitalize on the virtualization trend. In wireline, demand for our optical and power products remained strong as carriers and hyperscalers invest to meet the ever-growing demand for bandwidth. And lastly, the consumer represented 12% of revenue and has now grown year-over-year for 6 straight quarters. This consistent growth is a function of our product and customer breadth, which better insulates us from the typical fluctuations associated with PCs and portable devices. 
Now on to the P&L. Gross margin was a record 74.2%, increasing 230 basis points sequentially and 330 basis points year-over-year. Favorable product mix, high utilization and revenue growth and synergy fall-through were key drivers of the increase. OpEx in the quarter was $710 million, better than anticipated, owing to faster synergy execution. Record operating margins of 50.3% grew 450 basis points sequentially and 860 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, we've realized over $250 million of cost synergies. We look to quickly achieve the remaining synergies and hit our recently increased target of $400 million in savings exiting fiscal '23. Non-op expenses were $41 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. All told, adjusted EPS came in at a record $2.40, up more than 50% versus the second quarter 2021. 
And now on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Days of inventory increased sequentially to 122 and channel inventory remains below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target. If we look at cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $119 million and $447 million over the trailing 12 months or 5% of revenue. To support our accelerated 7% to 10% long-term revenue growth outlook, we are strategically investing to expand internal capacity while enhancing the resiliency of our hybrid model. To that end, as we stated at Investor Day, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be in the high single digits during fiscal '22 and '23 before reverting back to 4% to 6% over the long term. 
And over the trailing 12 months, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue. Included in our free cash flow are onetime transaction-related costs amounting to about 3% of revenue. Given the recent market weakness, we accelerated our repo activity to $776 million during the second quarter. This brings our total share repurchase to approximately $3.5 billion since the close of Maxim. And we look to maintain this accelerated buyback pace this quarter and achieve our $5 billion commitment by the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We will allocate 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to support a 10% dividend CAGR throughout the cycle, with the remaining cash used for buybacks to reduce share count annually. 
And now on to the outlook for third quarter. Revenue is expected to be $3.05 billion, plus or minus $100 million. We expect all end markets to grow sequentially. Given our higher-than-normal annual merit increase, operating margin is expected to be 49.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. And our tax rate is expected to be between 13% and 14%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.42, plus or minus $0.10. While we are very mindful of the current economic trends, our demand indicators remain very strong and our customer conversations remain upbeat, giving us confidence for continued growth for the remainder of 2022 and likely into 2023. 
Importantly, as a result of our vast diversification, leadership in numerous secular growth markets, additional synergies and our resilient hybrid manufacturing model, we believe ADI has never been better positioned to transcend cyclical downturns and accelerate long-term growth. Let me now give it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

So as you know, we, along with the rest of the industry, has been passing along the higher costs. We have been very focused on not using this environment to take advantage of our customers but to really maintain our gross margins. So in '21, we had some headwind from the timing of inflation versus when we were able to enact the pricing. This has really abated in '22. So really, the gross margin percentage and the growth in gross margin percentage that you see is really being driven, as I mentioned, by the synergies, great utilization at the internal fabs and some mix benefits. I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about industrial hitting 51% of the overall revenue mix. 
So for the forward look, we updated our model just a couple of weeks back, and we feel very comfortable that in a typical cycle trough, we are going to be able to maintain a 70% floor. Beyond that, we will continue to make the right trade-offs with opportunities to expand the top line and -- at some trade-off on gross margin. So really the focus for the team is deliver the revenue growth and let that leverage drive all the way down through cash flow. So I wouldn't encourage folks to look for significant margin expansion. These are already pretty incredible numbers."

So first and foremost, it's a highly diversified industrial business that we've been diligently investing in from an R&D perspective, from a customer engagement perspective over the last decade or 12 years with a renewed focus. We've been gaining share very, very clearly. I think our portfolio, particularly combined with the power activity as well from the LTC and Maxim acquisitions puts us in even better stead to capture more  SAM essentially. 
And to your question on growth, I would say that we -- during the Investor Day, we said that the new model is 7% to 10%. So I think industrial is going to be right in there somewhere over time. And we feel more confident now, I think, about our industrial growth than we've ever done, just given the strength of the portfolio, the customer engagements and so on. 
And in terms of the signals we watch, obviously, we have a lot of conversations with our customers. I personally have had a stream of conversations with many of our largest industrial customers over the last quarter. And I think what they're all trying to convey to us is that things are different. We're moving into a new industrial cycle, Industry 4.0, 5.0, IoT, or I beg your pardon, IT and OT, if you like, colliding in a new partnership for the future, driving a lot of new technologies. So that's one, obviously 1 stream of input we get. The other signals we look at, obviously, are the PMIs, the machine to builders indexes and so on and so forth. Well, I think the greatest source of insight for us is our own knowledge of the end applications coupled with our customers' insights."

So you'll see that continue to play out over the course of the year, which is why I mentioned in the prepared remarks, look for us to continue to grow sequentially through this year and likely at least into the early part of next year. 
We talked about pricing that has been a little bit incremental to the revenue growth. So that's certainly a piece of it. And the demand has just been very broad-based. And again, I said it in my remarks but to be clear, we are seeing demand across all end markets and all geographies. It's very evenly spread and strength across all end applications. So we do feel, to Vince's remarks here, we do feel very well positioned and our technology is really starting to hit the sweet spot across all of our customers.

So we have so many vectors of growth now, for example, in industrial, where we're basically playing on all the high-end applications. And as I said, we've been tuning the R&D continuously, the customer engagement.
And if I just pick out health care as an example, that's beginning to get on to a $1 billion run rate now. It's been growing consistently for the last 7, 8 years in the -- at the double-digit level. Aerospace and defense, we see that actually, no matter what the cycle will be over the next few years, this is going to be an area of great strength for us. 
And in the communications area, great position in 5G. But interestingly, our wireline and data center business now is on a par with the wireless sector in terms of revenue contribution. So it's kind of half-and-half. So we see that again as a source of strength, buttressed also by a lot of the technologies that Maxim are bringing to that wireline area. 
Automotive, we have a great story on the in-cabin experience with A2B, cancellation, premium sign systems being more and more deployed, electrification. We're on a [ 100 ] a quarter run rate now, revenue run rate. And we have design-ins at virtually all the electric car companies at this point in time. So we see that on a trajectory to $1 billion-plus in the foreseeable future. So that's just some of the examples to complement what Prashanth has narrated as well in terms of the vectors of growth and prosperity for the company."

Two good questions, and thanks for giving me the opportunity to clarify. So first, on synergies. We had talked, when we did the Maxim closed that we had some great learnings from LTC on how to get to synergies and that was to move fast and hard, and you're seeing us execute against that strategy. So we captured basically the entire $275 million that we originally committed to as we exited our second quarter. And that at Investor Day, we said we're raising that target to $400 million, and we'll hit that number coming out of -- or as we exit 2023. 
That first $275 million was a little more tilted towards cost of goods, and the following piece will sort of be balanced between cost of goods and OpEx. So as you look forward, that's how to think about the balance of that. To your question on the comments I made, thank you for giving me a chance to clarify. We have used our pricing opportunities to maintain gross margin. So to be clear, we're not looking at pricing as an opportunity to expand gross margin but really as a way to offset. So when I said abate inflation, I meant versus the historical inflation that we had experienced in 2021. It took us a little bit longer to get those pricing actions in place. So now we have neutralized them and you see that benefit in the current year. And of course, if we do continue to see price increases -- sorry, cost increases in the coming quarters, expect us, like the rest of the industry, to respond by pushing those through."

And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince?"

Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI delivered another quarter of record revenue, profitability and earnings, driven by continued insatiable demand for our products, strong operational execution and accelerated synergy capture. Moreover, amidst a dynamic macro environment, we're operating from a position of remarkable strength, supported by our record backlog, robust bookings and ongoing capacity expansions, which position us favorably as we enter the second half. 
Now moving to a summary of our results. Revenue was $2.97 billion, above the high end of our outlook and up 28% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Strength was broad-based with all segments up double digits year-over-year. Impressively, adjusted gross margin expanded to 74% and operating margin to 50%. Adjusted EPS was $2.40, exceeding the high end of outlook and increasing over 50% from the year ago period.  
Overall, I'm very excited with our performance and our team's outstanding execution. Today, I'd like to reinforce what we shared at our Investor Day around how our markets are evolving and how we're investing to solve more of our customers' problems while also improving on our business model that's both rich with growth opportunities and, indeed, resiliency.  
The next wave in the evolution of the ICT sector is the nascent intelligent edge revolution. It will be characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale computing and pervasive connectivity, pushing processing and intelligence closer to the edge. Semiconductors are the bedrock enabling this next wave. And ADI, where data is born, is at the center of this revolution.  
At our core, we're an innovation-driven enterprise. Over the last decade, through both robust organic investments and strategic M&A, we've built the industry's broadest and highest performance analog, mixed signal and power portfolio. Our offerings span from microwave to bits, nanowatts to kilowatts, sensor to cloud and increasingly, from components to subsystems. Our vast arsenal of technologies, along with the deep level of engagement and support we provide our customers, has earned us the #1 positions in analog, mixed signal, RF and high-performance power.  
This, coupled with our focus on customer success, awards ADI with an innovation premium that is reflected in our ASPs that are more than 3x the industry average and also industry-leading gross margins. The growing scope of our customers' products is dramatically expanding in complexity and pressuring their product development teams and innovation cycles. To meet these challenges and deliver the next wave of disruptive innovations, we're investing over $1.6 billion in R&D annually. These investments strengthen our broad market franchise and enable us to expand our SAM and vertical applications where more complete solutions are necessary. We achieve this by integrating our core analog technologies with increasing levels of digital algorithms and software.  
Now let's look at how our technology is intersecting with our markets. Industries like transportation, energy, telecoms, manufacturing and health care are prioritizing digitalization. This is driving new generations of applications and fueling a host of concurrent secular growth trends, and I'd like to touch on just a few now.  
Starting with automotive. Here, ADI is the market leader in battery management systems, for example, for EVs. Our battery management systems, or BMS, solutions offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, reliability, safety and security. Our wireless BMS solution offers all the benefits of wired but also enables rapid battery pack configurability and cost-effective scaling of our customers' EV fleets. This innovative solution continues to gain traction in the market and adds to our content per system by up to 2x.  
Moving to communications, where ADI is the market leader in radio signal chains for 5G with a majority share across the ecosystem. Our latest generation transceiver includes a fully integrated digital front end and grows our SAM by 2x. This innovative radio architecture reduces system cost and waste and improves power efficiency. Further, the flexibility of these software-defined solutions allows them to be used across traditional 5G networks as well as in emerging Open RAN and LEO satellite networks.  
Lastly, health care. We have a #1 position with dominant share in medical imaging, for example. Subsystems like our photons-to-bits module are used by the top CT players in the world. Our solution delivers the highest-fidelity images while decreasing radiation dosage. And in the process, it allows us to capture 4x the SAM compared to offering just components alone.  
In addition to expanding our innovation edge across these secular trends to amplify growth, the Maxim combination creates a $1 billion revenue synergy opportunity for us over the next 5 years. The first opportunity arises from customer cross-selling, leveraging our complementary relationships to pull through our extended portfolio. Second is fusing together the new product road maps of these 2 premier Analog portfolios to push the boundaries of what's possible. And third is power management. Here, the combination with Maxim increases our breadth of power capabilities, creates a more cost competitive portfolio and adds to our engineering talent pool. As a result, we unlocked $4 billion of additional power SAM and look to double our power revenue in the years ahead.  
The proliferation of the intelligent edge and our revenue synergy opportunity gives me great confidence that we can bend the growth curve upwards, moving from our historical mid-single-digit growth rate to our new model of 7% to 10%.  
Now I'd like to speak a little to the unique resiliency of our business. The diversity of our portfolio is a source of great strength. We ship 75,000 product SKUs, which support thousands of applications to over 125,000 customers. Notably, 80% of our revenue is derived from products that individually contribute no more than 0.1% of total revenue. And the longevity of our products is unmatched. On average, our products have life spans of a decade or more, effectively delivering recurring revenue streams for decades. It's these characteristics that create a high barrier to entry and an enduring business model.  
Finally, we utilize a geographically diverse hybrid manufacturing strategy to tame the complexity and fragmentation of the analog market. This strategy provides us with a broad array of technology and packaging necessary to create innovative solutions from 7 nanometers to 7 micrometers. At the same time, this model creates a diverse network of internal and external partners to best manage our operations through economic cycles. 
As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we're investing in our internal manufacturing operations to build a more robust and cost-effective model. To that end, we're doubling the capacity of our internal factories and adding significant capital to our product test operations. These investments will grow our output this year and into 2023 and increase our swing capacity across our network to over 70% of revenue.  
So in closing, ADI is a leader in innovating at the edge, and I believe that our best days are still ahead of us as we drive increased value for our customers, shareholders and society. And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financial detail."
251411,1780684499,2572988,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, May 18, 2022",2022-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince.

Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. It was great to see and hear from so many of you at our Investor Day last month, and it was also exciting to welcome so many of our customers to demonstrate our technologies in action. 
As usual, my comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We printed another very impressive quarter with record revenue, profitability and earnings. These strong results reflect increasing demand for our highly differentiated products aligned to multiple secular trends as well as our ability to leverage our hybrid manufacturing model, offset inflation and accelerate synergy capture.  
Second quarter revenue of $2.97 billion finished above the high end of our outlook, with every B2B end market exceeding initial expectations. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue and our ninth straight sequential growth period.  
So let's look at the performance by end market. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, represented 51% of revenue and hit another all-time high. We experienced broad-based growth with digital health care, automation, instrumentation and test leading the way, underscoring increasing content and our strong position in these secular markets. Industrial has now grown more than 20% year-over-year for 6 straight quarters.  
Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, also achieved another record with all applications growing double digits year-over-year. In BMS, where we hold the #1 position, our quarterly revenue eclipsed $100 million for the first time. We expect strong growth to persist, given the momentum in the market and our continued design wins. Additionally, our A2B and GMSL solutions, which together make up roughly 20% of automotive, continued on their secular growth path fueled by the digitalization of the automobile.  
Communications represented 16% of revenue with robust broad-based growth. In wireless, we experienced growing demand across our RF portfolio as 5G deployments, particularly in North America, gained momentum. ADI's latest generation transceiver, which Vince spoke to, is ideally positioned to capitalize on the virtualization trend. In wireline, demand for our optical and power products remained strong as carriers and hyperscalers invest to meet the ever-growing demand for bandwidth. And lastly, consumer represented 12% of revenue and has now grown year-over-year for 6 straight quarters. This consistent growth is a function of our product and customer breadth, which better insulates us from the typical fluctuations associated with PCs and portable devices.  
Now on to the P&L. Gross margin was a record 74.2%, increasing 230 basis points sequentially and 330 basis points year-over-year. Favorable product mix, high utilization and revenue growth and synergy fall-through were key drivers of the increase. OpEx in the quarter was $710 million, better than anticipated, owing to faster synergy execution. Record operating margins of 50.3% grew 450 basis points sequentially and 860 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, we've realized over $250 million of cost synergies. We look to quickly achieve the remaining synergies and hit our recently increased target of $400 million in savings exiting fiscal '23.  
Non-op expenses were $41 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. All told, adjusted EPS came in at a record $2.40, up more than 50% versus the second quarter 2021.  
And now on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Days of inventory increased sequentially to 122 and channel inventory remains below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target. If we look at cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $119 million and $447 million over the trailing 12 months or 5% of revenue. To support our accelerated 7% to 10% long-term revenue growth outlook, we are strategically investing to expand internal capacity while enhancing the resiliency of our hybrid model. To that end, as we stated at Investor Day, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be in the high single digits during fiscal '22 and '23 before reverting back to 4% to 6% over the long term.  
And over the trailing 12 months, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue. Included in our free cash flow are onetime transaction-related costs amounting to about 3% of revenue. Given the recent market weakness, we accelerated our repo activity to $776 million during the second quarter. This brings our total share repurchase to approximately $3.5 billion since the close of Maxim. And we look to maintain this accelerated buyback pace this quarter and achieve our $5 billion commitment by the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We will allocate 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to support a 10% dividend CAGR throughout the cycle, with the remaining cash used for buybacks to reduce share count annually.  
And now on to the outlook for third quarter. Revenue is expected to be $3.05 billion, plus or minus $100 million. We expect all end markets to grow sequentially. Given our higher-than-normal annual merit increase, operating margin is expected to be 49.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. And our tax rate is expected to be between 13% and 14%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.42, plus or minus $0.10. While we are very mindful of the current economic trends, our demand indicators remain very strong and our customer conversations remain upbeat, giving us confidence for continued growth for the remainder of 2022 and likely into 2023.  
Importantly, as a result of our vast diversification, leadership in numerous secular growth markets, additional synergies and our resilient hybrid manufacturing model, we believe ADI has never been better positioned to transcend cyclical downturns and accelerate long-term growth. Let me now give it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

So as you know, we, along with the rest of the industry, has been passing along the higher costs. We have been very focused on not using this environment to take advantage of our customers but to really maintain our gross margins. So in '21, we had some headwind from the timing of inflation versus when we were able to enact the pricings. This has really abated in '22. So really, the gross margin percentage and the growth in gross margin percentage that you see is really being driven, as I mentioned, by the synergies, great utilization at the internal fabs and some mix benefits. I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about industrial hitting 51% of the overall revenue mix.  
So for the forward look, we updated our model just a couple of weeks back, and we feel very comfortable that in a typical cycle trough, we are going to be able to maintain a 70% floor. Beyond that, we will continue to make the right trade-offs with opportunities to expand the top line and -- at some trade-off on gross margin. So really, the focus for the team is deliver the revenue growth and let that leverage drive all the way down through cash flow. So I wouldn't encourage folks to look for significant margin expansion. These are already pretty incredible numbers."

So first and foremost, it's a highly diversified industrial business that we've been diligently investing in from an R&D perspective, from a customer engagement perspective over the last decade or 12 years with a renewed focus. We've been gaining share very, very clearly. I think our portfolio, particularly combined with the power activity as well from the LTC and Maxim acquisitions puts us in even better stead to capture more SAM essentially.  
And to your question on growth, I would say that we -- during the Investor Day, we said that the new model is 7% to 10%. So I think industrial is going to be right in there somewhere over time. And we feel more confident now, I think, about our industrial growth than we've ever done, just given the strength of the portfolio, the customer engagements and so on. 
And in terms of the signals we watch, obviously, we have a lot of conversations with our customers. I personally have had a stream of conversations with many of our largest industrial customers over the last quarter. And I think what they're all trying to convey to us is that things are different. We're moving into a new industrial cycle, Industry 4.0, 5.0, IoT, or -- I beg your pardon, IT and OT, if you like, colliding in a new partnership for the future, driving a lot of new technologies. So that's one, obviously one stream of input we get. The other signals we look at, obviously, are the PMIs, the machine tool builders indexes and so on and so forth. So and I think the greatest source of insight for us is our own knowledge of the end applications coupled with our customers' insights."

And if I just pick out health care as an example, that's beginning to get on to a $1 billion run rate now. It's been growing consistently for the last 7, 8 years in the -- at the double-digit level. Aerospace and defense, we see that actually, no matter what the cycle will be over the next few years, this is going to be an area of great strength for us. 
And in the communications area, great position in 5G. But interestingly, our wireline and data center business now is on a par with the wireless sector in terms of revenue contribution. So it's kind of half-and-half. So we see that again as a source of strength, buttressed also by a lot of the technologies that Maxim are bringing to that wireline area. 
Automotive, we have a great story on the in-cabin experience with A2B, road noise cancellation, premium sound systems being more and more deployed, electrification. We're on a [ $100 million ] a quarter run rate now, revenue run rate. And we have design-ins at virtually all the electric car companies at this point in time. So we see that on a trajectory to $1 billion-plus in the foreseeable future.

Did I catch that right? Because inflation, the headline numbers seem to be -- they haven't -- maybe they have peaked but definitely higher than where they were last year. So would love some color on that comment as well."

Two good questions, and thanks for giving me the opportunity to clarify. So first, on synergies. We had talked, when we did the Maxim close, that we had some great learnings from LTC on how to get to synergies and that was to move fast and hard, and you're seeing us execute against that strategy. So we captured basically the entire $275 million that we originally committed to as we exited our second quarter. And that at Investor Day, we said we're raising that target to $400 million, and we'll hit that number coming out of -- or as we exit 2023. 
That first $275 million was a little more tilted towards cost of goods, and the following piece will sort of be balanced between cost of goods and OpEx. So as you look forward, that's how to think about the balance of that. To your question on the comments I made, thank you for giving me a chance to clarify. We have used our pricing opportunities to maintain gross margin. So to be clear, we're not looking at pricing as an opportunity to expand gross margin but really as a way to offset. So when I said abate inflation, I meant versus the historical inflation that we had experienced in 2021. It took us a little bit longer to get those pricing actions in place. So now we have neutralized them and you see that benefit in the current year. And of course, if we do continue to see price increases -- sorry, cost increases in the coming quarters, expect us, like the rest of the industry, to respond by pushing those through."

Well, I'm pleased to share that we executed very well amidst a dynamic macro backdrop. We delivered another quarter of record results, driven by continued operational excellence, strong financial discipline and resilient demand for our diverse portfolio of innovation-rich products. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year on a combined basis and above the midpoint of our outlook. Strength was broad-based with double-digit growth in every end market.
Our third quarter profitability reflects ADI's innovation premium and strong operating leverage with gross and operating margins of 74% and 50%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.52 finished at the high end of our outlook, marking another new high. I'm exceptionally pleased with our results, and I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to our success, and importantly, to the success of our customers. 
At ADI, innovation is ingrained in our culture, fueled by an unwavering commitment to robust R&D investments. Over the last 12 months, we've invested over $1.7 billion in R&D. A key facet to our innovation-driven success is our dedication to extensive and deep customer engagements, which enables us to collaborate with them in solving their toughest problems. 
Now I'd like to share some recent customer highlights. In automotive, we reinforced our market-leading position in BMS with wins at 2 premium European auto manufacturers. One of these wins was with our wireless BMS solution. This marks the fourth OEM to adopt wireless BMS as customer interest continues to build for this unique technology. In sustainable energy, we announced a design win with Enel Group on the Quantum Edge device used to digitally monitor electric grids. ADI's unmatched precision measurement capabilities are critical to creating a more resilient and flexible grid to help advance efficient electrification globally. 
In health care, the recently released wireless hospital monitoring system by GE Healthcare in Europe uses ADI solutions across signal chain, power, RF MCUs and sensors. This wearable system enables wireless continuous monitoring to detect patient deterioration earlier, helping to improve outcomes. 
Today, I'd like to profile our $1.5 billion-plus consumer franchise, a business that plays an important role in our long-term profitable growth strategy. Given the recent negative data points surrounding the consumer end market, one may wonder why highlight this market now. But that's just the reason our consumer business is built differently. In the third quarter, we posted our seventh consecutive growth quarter. And while we are not immune to macro slowdown, we have aligned this business to the high end of the market where performance really matters and into applications where our differentiation is truly valued. 
The composition of our consumer franchise is indeed unique. Approximately 30% of our revenue comes from long life cycle prosumer applications, including next-generation conferencing systems, professional audio/video and home theater. The remaining revenue in consumer relates to portables, including fast-growing wearables and hearables as well as premium smartphones. 
Taking a step back, over the last 5 years-plus, we have reconfigured our consumer business to increase diversity across customers, products and applications to better drive growth and limit volatility while enhancing profitability. The addition of Maxim further enhances our diversity and expanded our portfolio. Over this time, we've increased our product SKUs to just over 10,000 and expanded our customer count to more than 3,000. Importantly, the composition of this business is quite similar to our B2B markets, with no single product contributing more than a couple of percentage points to total ADI sales. 
The velocity of innovation in the consumer market is appealing. It allows us to accelerate technology development and commercialize solutions quickly at scale. Over time, we take these breakthrough solutions into other markets to create new waves of growth and drive strong profitability and cash flow. For example, we have leveraged our consumer audio expertise into the automotive market. This capability was demonstrated at our Investor Day where we showcased an electric vehicle with Dolby Atmos that uses our SHARC DSP and software that was first proven in the consumer business. 
Additionally, we've also leveraged R&D investments from our core franchises into the consumer market. To that end, our high-precision converters and industrial instrumentation, for example, have been repurposed to solve similar challenges for stabilization in smartphone compass and pressure sensing in wearables. Not only have we created a highly diverse and profitable business but also one that is aimed at key growth drivers that position us to grow at a high single-digit rate over the long term. 
For example, our prosumer growth has been revitalized as companies implement future of work plans that encompass more immersive enterprise video conferencing. Here, the breadth of our portfolio across DSP, analog, mixed signal and power management enables us to solve the entire customer challenge from high-bandwidth connectivity to video resolution and sound quality. 
And turning now a moment to the portables market. In hearables, we shift into the majority of premium wireless stereo earbuds. Our newest offerings include software-augmented hearing algorithms and optimized power that reduces size and improves audio fidelity while increasing our value per system by over 3x. In wearables, we're a leader in personal wellness products with our sensing solutions designed into over 50% of products today. There is a convergence of these personal wellness products and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring solutions that could unlock new opportunities for ADI. And in premium smartphones, we're expanding our share and content at key customers, which is providing us additional diversification and stimulating new growth vectors. 
An emerging opportunity is the metaverse. ADI's breadth of hardware, software algorithms and domain expertise gives us an ability to provide complete subsystem solutions. While we're still in the early days, of course, momentum is building, and we have design wins in multiple next-generation AR/VR headsets. Across all these consumer applications, power management is becoming ever more critical. Customers are adding more features into smaller spaces, while consumers are demanding longer battery life. Maxim doubled the size of our low-power portfolio and increased our consumer power SAM by over $1 billion. We're already beginning to see the cross-sell benefits of our complementary customer bases and synergistic portfolios with wins in both wearables and conferencing systems. 
So in summary, I'm very encouraged with the strides we've taken to reignite growth in our consumer business, and with a record opportunity pipeline and significant synergy potential, I believe we're in a position to deliver consistent growth over the long term. 
Now before passing over to Prashanth, I'd like to make some comments on the current business environment. Obviously, the macro backdrop is dynamic and it's clear that we're at an inflection point. Economic conditions are beginning to impact demand with orders showing -- orders slowing later in the quarter and cancellations increasing slightly. Prashanth will provide additional details on these dynamics in his remarks. ADI successfully navigated macro challenges many, many times before in our 57-year history. We've created a premier analog franchise with an unmatched diversity of products, customers and applications. And we've invested in a hybrid manufacturing model that better adapts to demand fluctuations. These characteristics instill a resiliency into our business to mitigate market weaknesses, sustain profitability and enable investment in our business through economic cycles to focus on playing our long game. And with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."

Third quarter revenue of $3.1 billi",886,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Third quarter revenue of $3.1 billion finished above the midpoint of our outlook and marked our sixth consecutive quarterly record. If we look at third quarter end market performance, industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, hit another all-time high and represented 50% of growth -- excuse me, 50% of revenue.
Growth was broad-based with each of our major applications increasing sequentially. Industrial revenue has now grown more than 20% year-over-year for 7 straight quarters, underscoring ADI's strong position and secular content growth across applications. Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, achieved another record, increasing 28% year-over-year. The better mix of higher-content premium vehicles, combined with our growth engines of BMS, GMSL, A2B and better value capture is driving our outsized growth versus SAAR. 
Communications, which represented 16% of revenue, achieved a quarterly record, with strong year-over-year growth in both wireless and wireline. Sequentially, wireline outpaced wireless with growing demand for our optical and power portfolios as carriers and hyperscalers invest to meet the ever-growing demand for data. And lastly, consumer represented 13% of revenue and has now grown year-over-year for 7 consecutive quarters. As Vince highlighted, the diversity and growing design momentum across portables and prosumer is enabling us to grow despite the consumer market slowdown. 
Now on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 74.1%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher utilization, favorable mix and synergy capture. OpEx in the quarter was $747 million, which reflects a full quarter of higher-than-normal merit increases. Operating margin increased 650 basis points year-over-year, finishing at 50.1% toward the high end of our outlook. Non-op was $48 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. All told, EPS came in at a record $2.52, up 47% versus the third quarter of 2021. 
On balance sheet, we ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Days of inventory increased to 129, while channel inventory remains below the low end of our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. For cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $165 million and $526 million over the trailing 12 months, just under 5% of revenue. We continue to expect elevated CapEx investments through 2023 to support the strategic expansion of our hybrid manufacturing model. And these investments will strengthen our resiliency and support our long-term growth outlook of 7% to 10% CAGR. 
Over the trailing 12 months, we generated over $3.7 billion of free cash flow or 34% of revenue. Included in our free cash flow are onetime deal-related costs which amount to about 3% of revenue. With the intra-quarter volatility, we opportunistically increased repo activity to $906 million. And after approximately 1 year post the close of Maxim, we've repurchased $4.4 billion worth of shares, putting us on track to exceed our $5 billion commitment by the end of fiscal '22. Including dividend payments, we've returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders over the last 12 months or more than 6% of our market cap. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We target to allocate 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to support a 10% dividend CAGR through the cycle, with the remaining cash used for share count reduction. 
Now before we move to the outlook, I want to provide some additional details around demand. In third quarter, our order book remained strong and backlog increased to a new record, stretching well into mid-2023. However, orders moderated later in the quarter, and as a result, book-to-bill was down from a quarter ago but still well above 1. By market, we are seeing strength persist in both industrial and automotive, which together represent over 2/3 of our sales, while consumer and comms were a bit softer. We also saw a modest increase in cancellations and was not specific to any end market or geography. 
Given these dynamics, coupled with the macro backdrop, we believe it's prudent to take a more cautious stance. As such, we are only forecasting slight sequential revenue growth to $3.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million, despite bookings, backlog and higher supply that would all suggest stronger growth. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to grow quarter-over-quarter. Op margin is expected to be 50.3%, plus or minus 70 bps. Our tax rate is expected to be 13% to 14%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.57, plus or minus $0.10. 
More broadly, while the macro backdrop is dynamic, our business has several aspects that position us quite well to manage further headwinds. These include our diverse end market exposure, coupled with strong secular drivers that will help buffer our top line. The flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model gives us confidence in maintaining our 70% gross margin floor. And we also have several OpEx layers to support our industry-leading margins and maintain a solid return of cash to our investors. So in closing, my confidence to our path of $15 of EPS in the next 5 years remains high. Let me now give it back to Mike for the Q&A."

Let me take the first part of that, and then maybe I'll let Vince speak to the pricing. So we've been talking for a couple of quarters now that we were expecting a more meaningful increase in our ability to supply in the fourth quarter, and we have been building that with the installations of equipment that we've been having over the course of this year. So our supply -- our ability to supply is in excess of the guide that we put out there.
In addition, our backlog actually increased sequentially from -- into the third quarter to a new all-time record. And given kind of the strength in the backlog, the book-to-bill was still above 1 and increased supply, it's very logical we could print a bigger number. Having said that, we are very aware of the macro environment and a bit more softening in order activity that we saw towards the tail end of the quarter. So that's why we kind of held back a little bit on the guide to ensure that if this order softness does continue, we're not disappointing. Vince, you want to address the pricing question?"

I don't expect to see any downward pressure on prices even in a recessionary environment. I think first and foremost, our products reflect an innovation premium for the kind of value that we deliver to our customers. Now we're never the long pull in the pricing tent either in the customer's bill of material.
The other thing I would say, particularly in the high-performance analog space, the substitution costs are very, very high. So the disruption to a customer system design way, way outweighs considerations for price reduction. So where we obviously compete most intensively on a price basis is to get the original socket, but we have long life cycle products with tremendous stability, very, very high substitution costs. So my sense is that pricing will remain very, very steady through the cycle."

Let me maybe talk about kind of the bookings momentum in a couple of different pieces. So first, third quarter results, where we're clearly broad-based strength, all end markets were up quarter-over-quarter and double digits year-over-year, so our sixth consecutive record. The only geography/market that was down year-over-year was China consumer. But that's a very small exposure for ADI, low -- very low single digits as a percentage of revenue.
From a bookings health standpoint for the third quarter, orders were up. Again, as I mentioned, strongest trends were industrial and auto, which represent about 70% of the business. Comms and consumer weaker, but again, we increased our backlog to another record, another new all-time high, and that covers us well into '23. Where we saw that change in demand was really cancellations ticked modestly higher, and I do say modestly. It is -- we want to be fully transparent on this call, so we're calling out but I wouldn't really put too much focus on the cancellation number. But again, in the spirit of transparency, we want to share that we did see that change in the demand profile. 
And we also saw that the channel sell-through began to moderate towards later in the quarter. So that is the sell-through from the channel or POS began to soften a bit versus what we were originally expecting. Overall, the book-to-bill was still above parity but it was definitely lower than it was a quarter ago. 
So as we set that guide for fourth quarter, given the uncertainty, changing trends in our business, we thought it's prudent to take a more cautious stance and therefore, we're guiding up only slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis despite, as I mentioned in answering Vivek's question, despite having very strong backlog coverage, good bookings and better supply, which would all suggest higher growth."

And so if you could please help us understand kind of what are the underlying assumptions behind that as it relates to utilization inventory. And then more importantly, what are you assuming for revenues to go down to hit that level?"

So maybe let's start with a reminder that this company is structurally more profitable than we ever have been. The addition of Maxim gives us the benefit of scale, and we have the benefit of that hybrid manufacturing model, which really gives us that flexibility to manage our production utilizations by being able to notify our supply chain partners in the event we need to, with essentially a quarter's notice, to bring the outside supply number down and focus on keeping internal utilizations higher.
As a result of that, we feel very confident that kind of through the downturn of a cycle, we can maintain that 70% gross margin floor, which from an investor model standpoint, is a unique metric that we put out there to give a floor. In thinking about a downturn scenario, and again, I want to emphasize, this is a projection to help investors model what it could be, not in any way a forecast of what we think is coming at us. But from a revenue standpoint, we have this great diversification, 75,000 products, 125,000 customers and thousands and thousands of applications, which are aligned to numerous secular growth markets. We have exposure to much stronger markets in a down cycle like aerospace and defense and health care, which are not going to be as cyclical. 
On the gross margin side, I mentioned this flexible manufacturing model that allows us to really help manage utilizations. And then we have a very accordion-driven variable compensation program, which allows us to moderate OpEx. So if we were to think about a downside scenario that was in a 15% down revenue market, we believe op margins would still have a [ 4 ] handle on them, probably be in the low 40s and gross margins would probably be, again, above [ 70 ], but probably in the low 70s."

And it could be, as I mentioned, from the channel standpoint, if the channel looks like inventory in the channel is building at a level that we don't think is healthy for the business. And we choose to keep that inventory on our books to give us more flexibility to make sure that we can match customer demand better."

So I think we've talked through some of that, Tore, but from at least certainly utilization levels, we're going to continue to see relatively good utilization levels across our internal factories for a few reasons: one is the benefit of the hybrid model is that we can bring more production in-house; second is that die bank levels are at very low levels, and we do need to get those die bank levels back to a healthy point. Die bank is an extremely cost-efficient place for us to hold inventory, particularly when you have 75,000 SKUs. You can hold it sort of think of it as $0.10 on the dollar. So it is very economically efficient and allows us to improve customer satisfaction later on.
From an OpEx standpoint, as you've seen in the past, we have a very accordion-driven variable compensation program, which automatically unwinds if the financial performance of the company drives it to. And I think what's unique to ADI versus perhaps some of our peers is we have the cost synergies from Maxim, which are independent of the economic environment.
From a CapEx standpoint, expect us to be -- it is business as usual. We had committed at the Investor Day to a higher level of CapEx in '22 and '23, which is necessary to add the supply needed to hit our long-term model of 7% to 10% growth, which we are very much committed to, and that is on track. Capital spend for the current quarter -- sorry, for the current year, maybe a bit below what we expected. That's a consequence of revenue coming in stronger, so bigger denominator and also just a little bit of delay in the receiving some of that equipment, but all of that will drive through in 2023."

Three months ago, you had talked about significant tightness, whether it be your internal supply or external foundry supply. I'm just curious if you're starting to see signs of supply easing. I guess test was a big bottleneck for internal supply 3, 6 months ago. Any changes there?
And in terms of foundry wafer supply, again, any signs of easing? And kind of related to that, there have been some headlines about foundry wafer pricing increasing again in late '22 going into '23. Is that sort of the indication you're getting from your suppliers? And if so, are you comfortable that you'd be able to pass those through to your customers?"

Well, I'm pleased to share that we executed very well amidst a dynamic macro backdrop. We delivered another quarter of record results, driven by continued operational excellence, strong financial discipline and resilient demand for our diverse portfolio of innovation-rich products. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year on a combined basis and above the midpoint of our outlook. Strength was broad-based with double-digit growth in every end market.
Our third quarter profitability reflects ADI's innovation premium and strong operating leverage with gross and operating margins of 74% and 50%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.52 finished at the high end of our outlook, marking another new high. I'm exceptionally pleased with our results, and I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to our success, and importantly, to the success of our customers. 
At ADI, innovation is ingrained in our culture, fueled by an unwavering commitment to robust R&D investments. Over the last 12 months, we've invested over $1.7 billion in R&D. A key facet to our innovation-driven success is our dedication to extensive and deep customer engagements, which enables us to collaborate with them in solving their toughest problems. 
Now I'd like to share some recent customer highlights. In Automotive, we reinforced our market-leading position in BMS with wins at 2 premium European auto manufacturers. One of these wins was with our wireless BMS solution. This marks the fourth OEM to adopt wireless BMS as customer interest continues to build for this unique technology. In sustainable energy, we announced a design win with Enel Group on the quantum edge device used to digitally monitor electric grids. ADI's unmatched precision measurement capabilities are critical to creating a more resilient and flexible grid to help advance efficient electrification globally. 
In health care, the recently released wireless hospital monitoring system by GE Healthcare in Europe uses ADI solutions across signal chain, power, RF MCUs and sensors. This wearable system enables wireless continuous monitoring to detect patient deterioration earlier, helping to improve outcomes. 
Today, I'd like to profile our $1.5 billion-plus consumer franchise, a business that plays an important role in our long-term profitable growth strategy. Given the recent negative data points surrounding the consumer end market, one may wonder why highlight this market now. But that's just the reason our consumer business is built differently. In the third quarter, we posted our seventh consecutive growth quarter. And while we are not immune to macro slowdown, we have aligned this business to the high end of the market where performance really matters and into applications where our differentiation is truly valued. 
The composition of our consumer franchise is indeed unique. Approximately 30% of our revenue comes from long life cycle prosumer applications, including next-generation conferencing systems, professional audio/video and home theater. The remaining revenue in consumer relates to portables, including fast-growing wearables and hearables as well as premium smartphones. 
Taking a step back, over the last 5 years-plus, we have reconfigured our consumer business to increase diversity across customers, products and applications to better drive growth and limit volatility while enhancing profitability. The addition of Maxim further enhances our diversity and expanded our portfolio. Over this time, we've increased our product SKUs to just over 10,000 and expanded our customer count to more than 3,000. Importantly, the composition of this business is quite similar to our B2B markets, with no single product contributing more than a couple of percentage points to total ADI sales. 
The velocity of innovation in the consumer market is appealing. It allows us to accelerate technology development and commercialize solutions quickly at scale. Over time, we take these breakthrough solutions into other markets to create new waves of growth and drive strong profitability and cash flow. For example, we have leveraged our consumer audio expertise into the automotive market. This capability was demonstrated at our Investor Day where we showcased an electric vehicle with Dolby Atmos that uses our SHARC DSP and software that was first proven in the consumer business. 
Additionally, we've also leveraged R&D investments from our core franchises into the consumer market. To that end, our high-precision converters and industrial instrumentation, for example, have been repurposed to solve similar challenges for stabilization in smartphone compass and pressure sensing in wearables. Not only have we created a highly diverse and profitable business but also one that is aimed at key growth drivers that position us to grow at a high single-digit rate over the long-term. 
For example, our prosumer growth has been revitalized as companies implement future of work plans that encompass more immersive enterprise video conferencing. Here, the breadth of our portfolio across DSP, analog, mixed-signal and power management enables us to solve the entire customer challenge from high-bandwidth connectivity to video resolution and sound quality. 
And turning now a moment to the portables market. In hearables, we shift into the majority of premium wireless stereo earbuds. Our newest offerings include software-augmented hearing algorithms and optimized power that reduces size and improves audio fidelity while increasing our value per system by over 3x. In wearables, we're a leader in personal wellness products with our sensing solutions designed into over 50% of products today. There is a convergence of these personal wellness products and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring solutions that could unlock new opportunities for ADI. And in premium smartphones, we're expanding our share and content at key customers, which is providing us additional diversification and stimulating new growth vectors. 
An emerging opportunity is the Metaverse. ADI's breadth of hardware, software algorithms and domain expertise gives us an ability to provide complete sub-system solutions. While we're still in the early days, of course, momentum is building, and we have design wins in multiple next-generation AR/VR headsets. Across all these consumer applications, power management is becoming ever more critical. Customers are adding more features into smaller spaces, while consumers are demanding longer battery life. Maxim doubled the size of our low-power portfolio and increased our consumer power SAM by over $1 billion. We're already beginning to see the cross-sell benefits of our complementary customer bases and synergistic portfolios with wins in both wearables and conferencing systems. 
So in summary, I'm very encouraged with the strides we've taken to reignite growth in our consumer business, and with a record opportunity pipeline and significant synergy potential, I believe we're in a position to deliver consistent growth over the long-term. 
Now before passing over to Prashanth, I'd like to make some comments on the current business environment. Obviously, the macro backdrop is dynamic and it's clear that we're at an inflection point. Economic conditions are beginning to impact demand with orders showing -- orders slowing later in the quarter and cancellations increasing slightly. Prashanth will provide additional details on these dynamics in his remarks. 
ADI successfully navigated macro challenges many, many times before in our 57-year history. We've created a premier analog franchise with an unmatched diversity of products, customers and applications. And we've invested in a hybrid manufacturing model that better adapts to demand fluctuations. These characteristics instill a resiliency into our business to mitigate market weaknesses, sustain profitability and enable investment in our business through economic cycles to focus on playing our long game. And with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."
251411,1793404359,2633676,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2022",2022-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Third quarter revenue of $3.1 billi",887,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Third quarter revenue of $3.1 billion finished above the midpoint of our outlook and marked our sixth consecutive quarterly record. If we look at third quarter end market performance, industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, hit another all-time high and represented 50% of growth -- excuse me, 50% of revenue.
Growth was broad-based with each of our major applications increasing sequentially. Industrial revenue has now grown more than 20% year-over-year for 7 straight quarters, underscoring ADI's strong position and secular content growth across applications. Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, achieved another record, increasing 28% year-over-year. The better mix of higher-content premium vehicles, combined with our growth engines of BMS, GMSL, A2B and better value capture is driving our outsized growth versus SAAR. 
Communications, which represented 16% of revenue, achieved a quarterly record, with strong year-over-year growth in both wireless and wireline. Sequentially, wireline outpaced wireless with growing demand for our optical and power portfolios as carriers and hyperscalers invest to meet the ever-growing demand for data. And lastly, Consumer represented 13% of revenue and has now grown year-over-year for 7 consecutive quarters. As Vince highlighted, the diversity and growing design momentum across portables and prosumer is enabling us to grow despite the consumer market slowdown. 
Now on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 74.1%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher utilization, favorable mix and synergy capture. OpEx in the quarter was $747 million, which reflects a full quarter of higher-than-normal merit increases. Operating margin increased 650 basis points year-over-year, finishing at 50.1% toward the high end of our outlook. Non-Op was $48 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. All told, EPS came in at a record $2.52, up 47% versus the third quarter of 2021. 
On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Days of inventory increased to 129, while channel inventory remains below the low end of our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. For cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $165 million and $526 million over the trailing 12 months, just under 5% of revenue. We continue to expect elevated CapEx investments through 2023 to support the strategic expansion of our hybrid manufacturing model. And these investments will strengthen our resiliency and support our long-term growth outlook of 7% to 10% CAGR. 
Over the trailing 12 months, we generated over $3.7 billion of free cash flow or 34% of revenue. Included in our free cash flow are onetime deal-related costs which amount to about 3% of revenue. With the intra-quarter volatility, we opportunistically increased repo activity to $906 million. And after approximately 1 year post the close of Maxim, we've repurchased $4.4 billion worth of shares, putting us on track to exceed our $5 billion commitment by the end of fiscal '22. 
Including dividend payments, we've returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders over the last 12 months or more than 6% of our market cap. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We target to allocate 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to support a 10% dividend CAGR through the cycle, with the remaining cash used for share count reduction. 
Now before we move to the outlook, I want to provide some additional details around demand. In third quarter, our order book remained strong and backlog increased to a new record, stretching well into mid-2023. However, orders moderated later in the quarter, and as a result, book-to-bill was down from a quarter ago but still well above 1. By market, we are seeing strength persist in both Industrial and Automotive, which together represent over 2/3 of our sales, while Consumer and comms were a bit softer. We also saw a modest increase in cancellations and was not specific to any end market or geography. 
Given these dynamics, coupled with the macro backdrop, we believe it's prudent to take a more cautious stance. As such, we are only forecasting slight sequential revenue growth to $3.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million, despite bookings, backlog and higher supply that would all suggest stronger growth. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to grow quarter-over-quarter. Op margin is expected to be 50.3%, plus or minus 70 bps. Our tax rate is expected to be 13% to 14%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.57, plus or minus $0.10. 
More broadly, while the macro backdrop is dynamic, our business has several aspects that position us quite well to manage further headwinds. These include our diverse end market exposure, coupled with strong secular drivers that will help buffer our top line. The flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model gives us confidence in maintaining our 70% gross margin floor. And we also have several OpEx layers to support our industry-leading margins and maintain a solid return of cash to our investors. So in closing, my confidence to our path of $15 of EPS in the next 5 years remains high. Let me now give it back to Mike for the Q&A."

So our supply -- our ability to supply is in excess of the guide that we put out there.
In addition, our backlog actually increased sequentially from -- into the third quarter to a new all-time record. And given kind of the strength in the backlog, the book-to-bill was still above 1 and increased supply, it's very logical we could print a bigger number. Having said that, we are very aware of the macro environment and a bit more softening in order activity that we saw towards the tail end of the quarter.

I think first and foremost, our products reflect an innovation premium for the kind of value that we deliver to our customers. Now we're never the long pull in the pricing [ tent ] either in the customer's bill of material.
The other thing I would say, particularly in the high-performance analog space, the substitution costs are very, very high. So the disruption to a customer system design way, way outweighs considerations for price reduction. So where we obviously compete most intensively on a price basis is to get the original socket, but we have long life cycle products with tremendous stability, very, very high substitution costs. So my sense is that pricing will remain very, very steady through the cycle."

Let me maybe talk about kind of the bookings momentum in a couple of different pieces. So first, third quarter results, where we're clearly broad-based strength, all end markets were up quarter-over-quarter and double digits year-over-year, so our sixth consecutive record. The only geography/market that was down year-over-year was China consumer. But that's a very small exposure for ADI, low -- very low single digits as a percentage of revenue.
From a bookings health standpoint for the third quarter, orders were up. Again, as I mentioned, strongest trends were Industrial and Auto, which represent about 70% of the business. Comms and Consumer weaker, but again, we increased our backlog to another record, another new all-time high, and that covers us well into '23. Where we saw that change in demand was really cancellations ticked modestly higher, and I do say modestly. It is -- we want to be fully transparent on this call, so we're calling out but I wouldn't really put too much focus on the cancellation number. But again, in the spirit of transparency, we want to share that we did see that change in the demand profile. 
And we also saw that the channel sell-through began to moderate towards later in the quarter. So that is the sell-through from the channel or POS began to soften a bit versus what we were originally expecting. Overall, the book-to-bill was still above parity but it was definitely lower than it was a quarter ago. 
So as we set that guide for fourth quarter, given the uncertainty, changing trends in our business, we thought it's prudent to take a more cautious stance and therefore, we're guiding up only slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis despite, as I mentioned in answering Vivek's question, despite having very strong backlog coverage, good bookings and better supply, which would all suggest higher growth. Go to next question."

So maybe let's start with a reminder that this company is structurally more profitable than we ever have been. The addition of Maxim gives us the benefit of scale, and we have the benefit of that hybrid manufacturing model, which really gives us that flexibility to manage our production utilizations by being able to notify our supply chain partners in the event we need to, with essentially a quarter's notice, to bring the outside supply number down and focus on keeping internal utilizations higher.
As a result of that, we feel very confident that kind of through the downturn of a cycle, we can maintain that 70% gross margin floor, which from an investor model standpoint, is a unique metric that we put out there to give a floor. In thinking about a downturn scenario, and again, I want to emphasize, this is a projection to help investors model what it could be, not in any way a forecast of what we think is coming at us. But from a revenue standpoint, we have this great diversification, 75,000 products, 125,000 customers and thousands and thousands of applications, which are aligned to numerous secular growth markets. We have exposure to much stronger markets in a down cycle like aerospace and defense and health care, which are not going to be as cyclical. 
On the gross margin side, I mentioned this flexible manufacturing model that allows us to really help manage utilizations. And then we have a very accordion-driven variable compensation program, which allows us to moderate OpEx. So if we were to think about a downside scenario that was in a 15% down revenue market, we believe op margins would still have a [ 4 ] handle on them, probably be in the low 40s and gross margins would probably be, again, above 70%, but probably in the low 70s."

So I think we've talked through some of that, Tore, but from at least certainly utilization levels, we're going to continue to see relatively good utilization levels across our internal factories for a few reasons: one is the benefit of the hybrid model is that we can bring more production in-house; second is that die bank levels are at very low levels, and we do need to get those die bank levels back to a healthy point. Die bank is an extremely cost-efficient place for us to hold inventory, particularly when you have 75,000 SKUs. You can hold it sort of think of it as $0.10 on the dollar. So it is very economically efficient and allows us to improve customer satisfaction later on.
From an OpEx standpoint, as you've seen in the past, we have a very accordion-driven variable compensation program, which automatically unwinds if the financial performance of the company drives it to. And I think what's unique to ADI versus perhaps some of our peers is we have the cost synergies from Maxim, which are independent of the economic environment.
From a CapEx standpoint, expect us to be -- it is business as usual. We had committed at the Investor Day to a higher level of CapEx in '22 and '23, which is necessary to add the supply needed to hit our long-term model of 7% to 10% growth, which we are very much committed to, and that is on track. Capital spend for the current quarter -- sorry, for the current year, maybe a bit below what we expected.

I've had a lot of conversations, Ross, over the last couple of years with CEOs of the biggest enterprises in the world of information. And what I can tell you for sure is that everybody wants to get closer to their key suppliers when it comes to aligning product road maps for the long-term, particularly companies that are perceived as being critical to their innovation processes. So I can tell you that continues.
And the other side of the equation is everybody wants to understand at the customer side of things, what do they need to do to secure supply for the long term? And what kind of arrangements that they need to put in place? What kind of information flows? What kind of models that we develop between each other? So that continues. I think it has been firmly established now that semiconductors are the bedrock of the modern -- of modern socioeconomic life. So the conversations continue intensively, I would say, and I expect that to continue well into the future."

Well, I'm really extremely pleased to share that we delivered another record quarter, capping off what was a better year for ADI.

Well, I'm really extremely pleased to share that we delivered another record quarter, capping off what was a better year for ADI. Our fourth quarter revenue was $3.25 billion, and adjusted EPS was $2.73, and both at the high end of our outlook. 
For the fiscal year, revenue was $12 billion, up an impressive 26% year-over-year on a combined basis. Our Industrial, Automotive and Communications markets delivered all-time high revenues, and our consumer business continued to grow despite industry-wide weakness. Adjusted EPS increased by nearly 50% to $9.57. 
We also delivered on our commitment to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in '22, returning $4.6 billion through share repurchases and dividends. These results not only exemplify the strength of our portfolio, but also our deep customer focus and the hard work of our employees to fortify ADI's brand. To that end, in my recent conversations with customers, the message has been very clear. 
While we're not immune to supply disruptions, ADI service, quality and support throughout this challenging time continues to be outstanding. Importantly, this sentiment is shared by customers of all sizes and across all markets. As a result, our customers are calling upon ADI to engage in longer term, more strategic collaborations to develop solutions that further empower the intelligent edge. 
So to ensure we remain at the forefront of technological advancements and customer service, we invested $1.7 billion in R&D and $700 million in CapEx in FY'22. Now let me start with R&D. Our investments are targeted at strengthening our foundational high-performance analog franchises as well as moving up the stack to create more complete solutions for our customers. A prime example is our Apollo platform, which we previewed at our Investor Day in April. 
Apollo is a flexible high-speed signal processing platform with unmatched levels of functionality, integration and performance, making it ubiquitous for all customers, but especially appealing to those in the broad market. During the quarter, we began sampling this innovative platform with our aerospace, communications and instrumentation customers and their feedback has been extremely positive. 
Turning now to the operations side. Over the last year, we invested a record amount of CapEx to increase our manufacturing output. And in 2023, we are, once again, investing aggressively in our U.S. and European factories to significantly expand our capacity. These investments will create a more flexible and cost-effective hybrid manufacturing model by increasing our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years.
Our R&D and supply chain investments are essential to support our design win pipeline, which expanded by more than 10% in '22. This growth was led by our automotive energy systems and digital health care businesses. Notably, our growth in automotive was underpinned by battery management systems, or BMS, which now has an opportunity pipeline nearing $4 billion. This year, 8 new manufacturers designed in our BMS solutions, including two that plan to utilize our wireless platform. 
Our strong leadership position, combined with increasing EV penetration globally gives me great confidence in our future growth prospects. Looking now at some selected design activity in the quarter. In Industrial Automation, we were designed into an advanced diagnostic system that matters machine health as a global supplier for energy exploration. Our system solution approach enables an approximate 50% reduction in size and lowers wiring costs meaningfully. In aerospace and defense, we won RF module programs at multiple defense prime contractors. 
Our modules integrate hundreds of components to simplify the design process for our customers while increasing our content from hundreds to thousands of dollars per system. In Industrial Instrumentation, we secured wins at two market leaders of next-generation high-voltage testers for electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. The combination of our high-voltage processes and precision technology enables us to deliver accurate, reliable and efficient testing required to scale the manufacturing of these systems. 
And lastly, in communications, we expanded our leadership in 5G radio systems with our transceiver portfolio, winning additional share at key suppliers. These new wins position us even better as 5G networks roll out globally, especially in India and O-RAN begins to proliferate. Importantly, our design pipeline is beginning to benefit from cross-selling our ADI and Maxim portfolios. This puts us on a path to achieve our target $1 billion in revenue synergies.
For example, at a European auto manufacturer, we built upon our strong audio connectivity position to cross-sell our high-speed GMSL technology, connecting their advanced driver systems. We're also capturing new opportunities with GMSL in the industrial market. Last quarter, for example, our technology was designed into autonomous order fulfillment systems at one of the largest e-commerce companies. We're also making great inroads with our broader power portfolio, where our opportunity pipeline increased by double digits last year. 
Our increased breadth is helping us to better match customers' performance and power trade-offs across more applications, expanding our Power Sun to nearly $10 billion. For example, at a leading European industrial customer, our position in mid-voltage power for distributed I/O control systems enabled us to pull through additional power content and precision signal chain sockets, thereby doubling our content per system.
Our expanding pipeline and significant revenue synergy opportunities instill greater diversity and resilience into our business while adding new growth vectors. And taken together, I'm confident in our ability to bend the growth curve and move from our historical mid-single-digit growth rate to our long-term model of 7% to 10%. 
So in summary, while the macro crosscurrents are creating an abundance of uncertainty, ADI has successfully navigated many slowdowns over the course of our 57-year history. The strength of our franchise allows us to invest through business cycles, ensuring we continue to deliver breakthrough innovation, deepen our relevance to our customers and capture the emerging secular opportunities at the intelligent edge. And so with that, I'll pass you over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.

My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We closed fiscal 2022 as our second consecutive year of record revenue and profits. 
We delivered sequential growth each quarter, achieving a new all-time high of $12 billion in revenue, gross margins of 73.6% increased 270 basis points due to favorable product mix, stronger utilization and cost synergies. Operating margin of 49.4% increased 700 basis points, reflecting strong execution on OpEx synergies, and adjusted EPS increased nearly 50% to $9.57. 
For the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.25 billion, finishing at the high end of our outlook. As I cover the performance by end market, both for the quarter and full year, my growth comments are on an adjusted combined basis where applicable. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, hit another all-time high and represented 51% of quarterly revenue. Growth was broad-based with each major application increasing sequentially and year-over-year. 
For the year, Industrial expanded 29% with growth in each business. Notably, digital health care was up over 30% and has now achieved seven straight record years. This consistent success in health care underscores the breadth of our ICs and subsystem solutions in a key secular growth market where such performance is critical. 
Automotive, which represented 21% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record year, growing both sequentially and year-over-year. For the year, auto was up 31%, a favorable mix of premium vehicles, our growing BMS, GMSL, A2B and Functional Safe Power franchises, combined with enhanced value capture drove significant growth compared to SAAR. Together, these franchises of BMS, GMSL, A2B and Functional Safe Power represent over $1 billion of automotive revenue. 
Communications, which represented 15% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record quarter with strong sequential growth in wireline, while our wireless business was about flat. For the year, comms grew 27%. In wireless, our strong position in radio signal chains is enabling the 5G rollout globally. And in wireline, our optical and power portfolios benefited from the continued demand for bandwidth. 
Lastly, consumer represented 13% of quarterly revenue and was up modestly sequentially and flat year-over-year. Despite a challenging year for the broader industry, consumer finished up 8%. This growth is a testament to how we have diversified our consumer business and the innovation premium our products command. Today, approximately 30% of revenue is derived from long life cycle prosumer applications, including next-gen conferencing systems, professional AV and home theater, while the remaining revenue in consumer relates to the faster-growing wearables and hearables as well as premium smartphones. 
Now I'll move down the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 74%, up 310 basis points year-over-year driven by favorable product mix and synergy capture. OpEx was $744 million down slightly sequentially due to the realization of additional synergies. And operating margin increased 800 basis points year-over-year, finishing at a record 51.1% as we exited the year with roughly $350 million of synergies realized across OpEx and cost of goods in our run rate. 
This incredible pace of synergy capture would not have been possible without the dedication of our integration office and the cross-functional teams that supported them. On op expenses, were $57 million, and the tax rate was 12.2%. All told, adjusted EPS came in at $2.73, up 58% year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents and our net leverage ratio continues to remain below 1. 
Days of inventory increased to 140 while channel inventory was once again below our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. Let me provide some additional details on our inventory. But first, during these uncertain times, we believe it is prudent to temporarily hold more finished goods on our balance sheet instead of shipping into the channel. This provides us with enhanced flexibility to better align supply with end customer demand across regions and markets. 
Second, raw material and WIP are increasing as we begin to rebuild our die bank. Over the last couple of years, our die bank was drastically reduced. And in some cases, fits 50% below optimal levels. Die bank inventory is highly cost efficient and it's critical for customer service as it can be used for different markets and customers. We believe higher inventory is crucial to reducing lead times as we look to return to our 4- to 8-week target service level over time. Given these actions, we expect inventory to increase in the near term before trending back down as we balance die bank rebuild with finished goods depletion. 
Moving to cash flow items. CapEx was $305 million for the quarter, and $699 million for the year or 6% of revenue. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we expect elevated CapEx through 2023 at around high single digits as a percentage of revenue. For fiscal 2022, we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow or 31% of revenue. This is lower than normal given our higher capital intensity and onetime transaction and restructuring costs. 
These near-term headwinds were not unexpected when we outlined our long-term free cash flow target at our Investor Day, and we remain committed to growing free cash flow to 40% of revenue. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We aim to grow our dividend at a 10% CAGR through the cycle with the remaining cash used for share count reduction. 
And during the year, we returned more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. We repurchased $3.1 billion in shares, reducing share count by nearly 4%, while paying $1.5 billion of dividends. So let me close with a brief update on the current operating backdrop. As we noted last quarter, the uncertain and slowing macroeconomic environment has had some impact on demand. 
However, after a couple of months of slowing orders, we saw bookings stabilize during the quarter at what we'd consider relatively normal levels for entering our first quarter. Not surprisingly, bookings remain the strongest in the industrial and auto, while communications and consumer are weaker. We're guiding first quarter revenue to $3.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Given this environment, we thought it might be helpful to be a little more prescriptive in our outlook by market. 
So in the first quarter, we expect auto to be up slightly sequentially; industrial about flat; comps to decline by mid-single digits; and consumer to be down double digits sequentially. At the midpoint of our outlook, revenue will be up high teens year-over-year and our B2B markets increasing over 20%. Op margins are expected to be 50% plus or minus 70 bps. Tax rate is expected to be between 12% to 14%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS should be $2.60 plus or minus $0.10. 
So stepping back, we are well positioned in the near term, but the environment remains highly variable and dynamic. ADI like the rest of the industry is not immune to a softer macro environment and thus, we remain cautious, yet optimistic. Longer term, we have over a year of backlog and continued momentum in our pipeline. We also have high flexibility with our hybrid manufacturing model and several OpEx levers in our toolkit to support our industry-leading margins and maintain robust cash returns to shareholders. So let me now pass it back to Mike for the Q&A."

And so essentially, what we've done is we've taken that complexity into ADI. We get to the other side of that complexity with the quality of our innovations and our ability to be able to couple many, many different facets of our portfolio together in areas like power management. We're building these 3D stacked module systems, sometimes with ASPs of hundreds of dollars. If you look at our 5G radio systems, same thing, we combine microwave, we combine data conversion, power, digital algorithms and so on and so forth. So we have -- within the company, we believe in diversity of technologies, solutions customers and that choice of business model try at the end of the day and how we execute it gives us the richer ASPs when compared with our competitors."

So there was bookings our strongest in industrial and auto, not surprising and weaker in comms and consumer, which I reflected in the guide. From a geo standpoint, we'd say that not surprising. We're seeing weakness in Asia, especially China, but North America and Europe are holding up well. So given the combination of orders stabilizing and the backlog coverage that we have out, we feel pretty good about the near term.

I think some of our customers are experiencing some soft cancellations in their business. But if you look at what's happening, we're going to see the life sciences transformed. We're in the early stages of small batch processing in life sciences for manufacturing, for example. The energy sector is another area where, particularly the American, the U.S.-based automation customers, a lot of their businesses are -- they have a very large portion in the energy sector, oil and gas, for example, and that is likely to remain strong. So if that's a bedrock -- I think that will remain strong for for several years to come. We are seeing onshoring, reshoring. We're seeing movement of manufacturing, for example, into India for the first time in a serious way. So my sense is, the industry won't outrun the macroeconomic conditions. But overall, I think the lending in terms of where demand will be softer than probably normal."

Maybe, Vivek, just -- first, just to emphasize something that we said in the prepared remarks, all subsegments in industrial grew in the fourth quarter, and we feel pretty good about where we are. From a strength in industrial versus the other markets, I'd look at it two ways. First, from a supply standpoint as we were seeing demand softening in other markets. We have the ability to use our hybrid model to get more wafers from our external partners, and we are biasing this additional supply into the industrial market, which has remained resilient and strong. At the same time, recall, we made a decision early in the supply disruption to make sure that we were taking care of our broad market and our smaller customers who tend to be more on the industrial side. From a demand standpoint, the strength and resilience in the industrial kind of speaks to where we play. We have extremely high share in those markets. And maybe to note versus our peers, some of our peers have cited weakness in -- I think they're calling it consumer industrial. We, on the other hand, put that business into our consumer. We call it the prosumer business, professional audio, video, et cetera. So when comparing us to peers, you'll see that our industrial might -- may be more pure industrial."

Balance sheet days are up to about 140 and the channel is flattish, and it's still below our desired 7 to 8 target. So the growth in inventory that you're seeing in our balance sheet is coming from a couple of different drivers. Certainly, inflation for our cost of goods, sales growth, which requires us to have more coverage of inventory and then the strategic decisions we made in the prepared remarks. So I do just want to go through that one more time here. So we are temporarily going to hold more finished goods versus putting it into the channel. Because we believe that gives us the flexibility to align the supply with end customer demand across regions and markets. A bad outcome for us would be to give product to a particular distributor who doesn't have an end customer demand for that product, where someone else in a different market or geography is in need. Second, the die bank has really been dried out over the last couple of years. And I think I said at some level, it's below 50% of where we want it. So die bank, for us and for folks who may be less familiar with it, this is a product that has finished the front end, but before it goes to assembly and test. This allows us to get it through the back end in roughly four weeks. So it's quick turn, and it gives us maximum flexibility to put it across different markets. So investing in the die bank will help us get our service levels, which are critical for us given the focus we have on customer service, critical for us to get those levels back up. So the result is expect higher days in the first half, and then it will trend back down as finished goods burn out and the die bank comes to where we would like it to be. So our goal for the inventory is to get our lead times down to our old target, which was roughly 90% of our goods can be shipped within 4 to 8 weeks. And given the long life of our products, we always carry a pretty minimal risk of obsolescence."

And Prashanth, thanks for clarifying the prosumer versus other companies calling it legacy industrial. But is there a seasonal aspect to it as well that orders stabilize because it's very contrary to what we seeing hearing from other companies report, including many industrial companies. Because last time, you had said that you expected -- although order cancellations were very small, you expected them to climb in the current quarter. So I would love to get a little bit more color on that. And then a real quick tactical one on lead times. Where are the lead times now?"

So we provided cancellations as a metric that we watch in the third quarter because we wanted to give everyone some context that we saw an inflection happening with orders. So it was in the spirit of transparency. However, I don't want to get into a pattern of reporting cancellation data every quarter. So if it was something meaningful, we would have called it out, which we didn't. So you can read that for what it is. I would say that unlike others in the industry, we are proactively analyzing our backlog and working with customers to remove orders that they no longer want given the rapidly changing environment. So this strategy for us is to seek out cancellation, it helps us align our backlog with current demand, and it really gives us better visibility into where the supply needs and what we need to build. So that has increased our confidence in the quality of the backlog we have. It is still -- the coverage is out still over a year, but it is down sequentially. And so while we're always mindful that there can be some continued noise in that backlog, we feel pretty good about both the guide and as we mentioned, the near term."

To that end, in my recent conversations with customers, the message has been very clear.
While we're not immune to supply disruptions, ADI's service, quality and support throughout this challenging time continues to be outstanding. Importantly, this sentiment is shared by customers of all sizes and across all markets. As a result, our customers are calling upon ADI to engage in longer term, more strategic collaborations to develop solutions that further empower the intelligent edge.
So to ensure we remain at the forefront of technological advancements and customer service, we invested $1.7 billion in R&D and $700 million in CapEx in FY'22. Now let me start with R&D. Our investments are targeted at strengthening our foundational high-performance analog franchises as well as moving up the stack to create more complete solutions for our customers. A prime example is our Apollo platform, which we previewed at our Investor Day in April.
Apollo is a flexible high-speed signal processing platform with unmatched levels of functionality, integration and performance, making it ubiquitous for all customers, but especially appealing to those in the broad market. During the quarter, we began sampling this innovative platform with our aerospace, communications and instrumentation customers, and their feedback has been extremely positive.
Turning now to the operations side. Over the last year, we invested a record amount of CapEx to increase our manufacturing output. And in 2023, we are, once again, investing aggressively in our U.S. and European factories to significantly expand our capacity. These investments will create a more flexible and cost-effective hybrid manufacturing model by increasing our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years. 
Our R&D and supply chain investments are essential to support our design win pipeline, which expanded by more than 10% in '22. This growth was led by our automotive energy systems and digital health care businesses. Notably, our growth in automotive was underpinned by battery management systems, or BMS, which now has an opportunity pipeline nearing $4 billion. This year, 8 new manufacturers designed in our BMS solutions, including two that plan to utilize our wireless platform. Our strong leadership position, combined with increasing EV penetration globally gives me great confidence in our future growth prospects. 
Looking now at some selected design activity in the quarter. In Industrial Automation, we were designed into an advanced diagnostic system that measures machine health at a global supplier for energy exploration. Our system solution approach enables an approximate 50% reduction in size and lowers wiring costs meaningfully. In aerospace and defense, we won RF module programs at multiple defense prime contractors. Our modules integrate hundreds of components to simplify the design process for our customers while increasing our content from hundreds to thousands of dollars per system. 
In Industrial Instrumentation, we secured wins at two market leaders of next-generation high-voltage testers for electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. The combination of our high-voltage processes and precision technology enables us to deliver accurate, reliable and efficient testing required to scale the manufacturing of these systems. 
And lastly, in communications, we expanded our leadership in 5G radio systems with our transceiver portfolio, winning additional share at key suppliers. These new wins position us even better as 5G networks roll out globally, especially in India, and O-RAN begins to proliferate. Importantly, our design pipeline is beginning to benefit from cross-selling our ADI and Maxim portfolios. This puts us on a path to achieve our target $1 billion in revenue synergies.
For example, at an European auto manufacturer, we built upon our strong audio connectivity position to cross-sell our high-speed GMSL technology, connecting their advanced driver systems. We're also capturing new opportunities with GMSL in the industrial market. Last quarter, for example, our technology was designed into autonomous order fulfillment systems at one of the largest e-commerce companies. We're also making great inroads with our broader power portfolio, where our opportunity pipeline increased by double digits last year.  
Our increased breadth is helping us to better match customers' performance and power trade-offs across more applications, expanding our power SAM to nearly $10 billion. For example, at a leading European industrial customer, our position in mid-voltage power for distributed I/O control systems enabled us to pull through additional power content and precision signal chain sockets, thereby, doubling our content per system.
Our expanding pipeline and significant revenue synergy opportunities instills greater diversity and resilience into our business while adding new growth vectors. And taken together, I'm confident in our ability to bend the growth curve and move from our historical mid-single-digit growth rate to our long-term model of 7% to 10%. 
So in summary, while the macro crosscurrents are creating an abundance of uncertainty, ADI has successfully navigated many slowdowns over the course of our 57-year history. The strength of our franchise allows us to invest through business cycles, ensuring we continue to deliver breakthrough innovation, deepen our relevance to our customers and capture the emerging secular opportunities at the intelligent edge. 
And so with that, I'll pass you over to Prashanth."

My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We closed fiscal 2022 as our secon",1246,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We closed fiscal 2022 as our second consecutive year of record revenue and profits. We delivered sequential growth each quarter, achieving a new all-time high of $12 billion in revenue, gross margins of 73.6% increased 270 basis points due to favorable product mix, stronger utilization and cost synergies. Operating margin of 49.4% increased 700 basis points, reflecting strong execution on OpEx synergies, and adjusted EPS increased nearly 50% to $9.57.
For the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.25 billion, finishing at the high end of our outlook. As I cover the performance by end market, both for the quarter and full year, my growth comments are on an adjusted combined basis where applicable. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, hit another all-time high and represented 51% of quarterly revenue. Growth was broad-based with each major application increasing sequentially and year-over-year. For the year, Industrial expanded 29% with growth in each business. Notably, digital health care was up over 30% and has now achieved seven straight record years. This consistent success in health care underscores the breadth of our ICs and subsystem solutions in a key secular growth market where such performance is critical. 
Automotive, which represented 21% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record year, growing both sequentially and year-over-year. For the year, auto was up 31%, a favorable mix of premium vehicles, our growing BMS, GMSL, A2B and functional safe power franchises, combined with enhanced value capture, drove significant growth compared to SAAR. Together, these franchises of BMS, GMSL, A2B and functional safe power represent over $1 billion of automotive revenue.
Communications, which represented 15% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record quarter with strong sequential growth in wireline, while our wireless business was about flat. For the year, comms grew 27%. In wireless, our strong position in radio signal chains is enabling the 5G rollout globally. And in wireline, our optical and power portfolios benefited from the continued demand for bandwidth.
Lastly, consumer represented 13% of quarterly revenue and was up modestly sequentially and flat year-over-year. Despite a challenging year for the broader industry, consumer finished up 8%. This growth is a testament to how we have diversified our consumer business and the innovation premium our products command. Today, approximately 30% of revenue is derived from long life cycle prosumer applications, including next-gen conferencing systems, professional AV and home theater, while the remaining revenue in consumer relates to the faster-growing wearables and hearables as well as premium smartphones.  
Now I'll move down the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 74%, up 310 basis points year-over-year, driven by favorable product mix and synergy capture. OpEx was $744 million, down slightly sequentially due to the realization of additional synergies. And operating margin increased 800 basis points year-over-year, finishing at a record 51.1% as we exited the year with roughly $350 million of synergies realized across OpEx and cost of goods in our run rate. This incredible pace of synergy capture would not have been possible without the dedication of our integration office and the cross-functional teams that supported them. Non-Op expenses were $57 million, and the tax rate was 12.2%. All told, adjusted EPS came in at $2.73, up 58% year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents and our net leverage ratio continues to remain below 1. Days of inventory increased to 140 while channel inventory was once again below our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. Let me provide some additional details on our inventory. But first, during these uncertain times, we believe it is prudent to temporarily hold more finished goods on our balance sheet instead of shipping into the channel. This provides us with enhanced flexibility to better align supply with end customer demand across regions and markets.  
Second, raw material and WIP are increasing as we begin to rebuild our die bank. Over the last couple of years, our die bank was drastically reduced, and in some cases, fits 50% below optimal levels. Die bank inventory is highly cost efficient and it's critical for customer service as it can be used for different markets and customers. We believe higher inventory is crucial to reducing lead times as we look to return to our 4- to 8-week target service level over time. Given these actions, we expect inventory to increase in the near term before trending back down as we balance die bank rebuild with finished goods depletion.  
Moving to cash flow items. CapEx was $305 million for the quarter and $699 million for the year or 6% of revenue. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we expect elevated CapEx through 2023 at around high single digits as a percentage of revenue. For fiscal 2022, we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow or 31% of revenue. This is lower than normal given our higher capital intensity and onetime transaction and restructuring costs. These near-term headwinds were not unexpected when we outlined our long-term free cash flow target at our Investor Day, and we remain committed to growing free cash flow to 40% of revenue. 
As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We aim to grow our dividend at a 10% CAGR through the cycle with the remaining cash used for share count reduction. And during the year, we returned more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. We repurchased $3.1 billion in shares, reducing share count by nearly 4%, while paying $1.5 billion of dividends. 
So let me close with a brief update on the current operating backdrop. As we noted last quarter, the uncertain and slowing macroeconomic environment has had some impact on demand. However, after a couple of months of slowing orders, we saw bookings stabilize during the quarter at what we'd consider relatively normal levels for entering our first quarter. Not surprisingly, bookings remain the strongest in the industrial and auto, while communications and consumer are weaker. We're guiding first quarter revenue to $3.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million. 
Given this environment, we thought it might be helpful to be a little more prescriptive in our outlook by market.  So in the first quarter, we expect auto to be up slightly sequentially; industrial about flat; comps to decline by mid-single digits; and consumer to be down double digits sequentially. At the midpoint of our outlook, revenue will be up high teens year-over-year and our B2B markets increasing over 20%. Op margins are expected to be 50%, plus or minus 70 bps. Tax rate is expected to be between 12% to 14%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS should be $2.60, plus or minus $0.10. 
So stepping back, we are well positioned in the near term, but the environment remains highly variable and dynamic. ADI, like the rest of the industry, is not immune to a softer macro environment, and thus, we remain cautious, yet optimistic. Longer term, we have over a year of backlog and continued momentum in our pipeline. We also have high flexibility with our hybrid manufacturing model and several OpEx levers in our toolkit to support our industry-leading margins and maintain robust cash returns to shareholders. 
So let me now pass it back to Mike for the Q&A."

So we decided quite a while ago that across the markets and the applications that we really cared about that what was really important for us to do was boil down the increasing complexity that our customers are dealing with in their product development systems and activities. 
And so essentially, what we've done is, we've taken that complexity into ADI. We get to the other side of that complexity with the quality of our innovations and our ability to be able to couple many, many different facets of our portfolio together in areas like power management. We're building these 3D-stacked module systems, sometimes with ASPs of hundreds of dollars. 
If you look at our 5G radio systems, same thing, we combine microwave, we combine data conversion, power, digital algorithms and so on and so forth.

However, we saw orders start to stabilize about midway through the fourth quarter and into the first couple of weeks here of the first quarter. So those bookings are strongest in industrial and auto, not surprising, and weaker in comms and consumer, which I reflected in the guide. .
From a geo standpoint, we'd say that not surprising we're seeing weakness in Asia, especially China, but North America and Europe are holding up well. So given the combination of orders stabilizing and the backlog coverage that we have out, we feel pretty good about the near term. There is uncertainty out there and things could change fast, but that sort of what's driving our sort of cautious optimism."

But if you look at what's happening, we're going to see life sciences transformed. We're in the early stages of small batch processing in life sciences for manufacturing, for example. The energy sector is another area where, particularly the American, the U.S.-based automation customers, a lot of their businesses are -- they have a very large portion in the energy sector, oil and gas, for example, and that is likely to remain strong. So if that's a bedrock -- I think that will remain strong for several years to come. We are seeing onshoring, reshoring. We're seeing movement of manufacturing, for example, into India for the first time in a serious way. So my sense is, the industry won't outrun the macroeconomic conditions. But overall, I think the lending, in terms of where demand will be, will be softer than probably normal."

Maybe, Vivek, just -- first, just to emphasize something that we said in the prepared remarks, all subsegments in industrial grew in the fourth quarter, and we feel pretty good about where we are. From a strength in industrial versus the other markets, I'd look at it 2 ways. First, from a supply standpoint as we were seeing demand softening in other markets, we have the ability to use our hybrid model to get more wafers from our external partners, and we are biasing this additional supply into the industrial market, which has remained resilient and strong. 
At the same time, recall, we made a decision early in the supply disruption to make sure that we were taking care of our broad market and our smaller customers who tend to be more on the industrial side. From a demand standpoint, the strength and resilience in the industrial kind of speaks to where we play. We have extremely high share in those markets. And maybe to note versus our peers, some of our peers have cited weakness in, I think they're calling it, consumer industrial. We, on the other hand, put that business into our consumer. We call it the prosumer business, professional audio, video, et cetera. So when comparing us to peers, you'll see that our industrial might maybe more pure industrial."

Balance sheet days are up to about 140 and the channel is flattish, and it's still below our desired 7 to 8 week target. So the growth in inventory that you're seeing in our balance sheet is coming from a couple of different drivers. Certainly, inflation for our cost of goods, sales growth, which requires us to have more coverage of inventory and then the strategic decisions we made in the prepared remarks. So I do just want to go through that one more time here. So we are temporarily going to hold more finished goods versus putting it into the channel. Because we believe that gives us the flexibility to align the supply with end customer demand across regions and markets. A bad outcome for us would be to give product to a particular distributor who doesn't have an end customer demand for that product where someone else in a different market or geography is in need. 
Second, the die bank has really been dried out over the last couple of years. And I think I said at some level, it's below 50% of where we want it. So die bank, for us and for folks who may be less familiar with it, this is a product that has finished the front end but before it goes to assembly and test. This allows us to get it through the back end in roughly 4 weeks. So it's quick turn, and it gives us maximum flexibility to put it across different markets. So investing in the die bank will help us get our service levels, which are critical for us, given the focus we have on customer service, critical for us to get those levels back up. 
So the result is, expect higher days in the first half and then it will trend back down as finished goods burn out and the die bank comes to where we would like it to be. So our goal for the inventory is to get our lead times down to our old target, which was roughly 90% of our goods can be shipped within 4 to 8 weeks. And given the long life of our products, we always carry a pretty minimal risk of obsolescence."

So we provided cancellations as a metric that we watch in the third quarter because we wanted to give everyone some context that we saw an inflection happening with orders. So it was in the spirit of transparency. However, I don't want to get into a pattern of reporting cancellation data every quarter. So if it was something meaningful, we would have called it out, which we didn't. So you can read that for what it is. 
I would say that unlike others in the industry, we are proactively analyzing our backlog and working with customers to remove orders that they no longer want given the rapidly changing environment. So this strategy, for us, is to seek out cancellation. It helps us align our backlog with current demand, and it really gives us better visibility into where the supply needs and what we need to build. So that has increased our confidence in the quality of the backlog we have. It is still -- the coverage is out still over a year, but it is down sequentially. And so while we're always mindful that there can be some continued noise in that backlog, we feel pretty good about both the guide, and as we mentioned, the near term."

We're winning share in the power management market, in that sector of our portfolio. And I think if you look at where we are in the Automotive sector, we're getting a very strong tailwind from the electrification of the vehicle. In fact, we're gaining a lot of share in general, I think, with in-cabin and the electric vehicle. So I think we've got some tailwinds that are transcending the macro cycle here as well. The only part of the business, I would say, that has a cyclical timber to it now is the consumer area, where we have seen kind of the normal pattern there at the -- which happens at the tail end of the year."

And I think your question really is on the downturn scenario analysis. I'll just -- I'll restate that, Stacy. We've covered that a few times, but we put our gross margin floor out there at 70%, and we did that because we have confidence that we have the levers given the flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model and the resiliency of our business that it's unlikely that we're going to pass through that. 
So we tested that at a down 15%. And what we've shared with folks in the past is that a down 15% is quite comfortable that we can stay north of that 70% and the OpEx levers for us would be the -- about 80% of our OpEx is fixed or less variable in nature, which leaves us about 20% on the levers that we can work with to ensure that we keep operating margins north of 40%. 
I will say that for 2023, our commitment is, and as Vince often says, we run this company for the long term. So we are committed to continuing to invest throughout the course of '23. We'll, obviously, be mindful of the environment. And if we see a change that warrants us to take action, you can count on us to take action. But we, at least for the next quarter or 2, expect us to continue to make the right decisions for the long-term health of the business."

You've done a very straightforward, good job of explaining to us what's going on in your own inventory. And it sounds like distribution is still below your target even though on their balance sheets, across all their suppliers, it looks like they're elevated. But we've seen other parts of the supply chain, in particular, the manufacturing services companies, which I imagine are a big percentage of sort of your counterparty sales on transactions.

I think there is still some unserved demand that customers are trying to fulfill. So -- but we're working very closely with our customers. 
As we've said, we take our signals from sell-through, and we're working with our customers diligently across all 125,000 of them, big and small, to make sure that we get the best match between what they need and what we're able to deliver. And what I'm hearing in general is that, yes, we haven't serviced all the demands that all the customers have needed, but in general, we've been very transparent. Our customers are very pleased with our customer service. And I think it positions us very, very well coming out of the supply crunch to be able to deepen our engagements with our customers, both on the R&D side as well as the supply chain side.

And then my broader question is probably for Vince. As you think about the full year '23, based on your backlog, based on your design wins and customer conversations, which end markets or applications are you most excited about in terms of contribution to growth? I realize you run a diverse business, and that's the beauty of ADI. But if you were to single out a couple, where your expectations are the highest, which ones would they be?

And we're winning a lot of share in the in-cabin electronics as well; the new display systems, which are very, very complex. The dashboard displays need a lot of very, very clever power electronics. So we're well positioned. 
From an Industrial perspective as well, digital health care has been growing in the company in double digits for the last 7 years or thereabouts. We expect to see that continue. Also, aerospace and defense, that's likely to be a very brisk business. It's performing well for ADI now, and I believe, at least for the next 5 years, we will see stellar growth in that area. And energy, our energy and sustainability businesses are also beginning to really go on the uptick. So where am I concerned? I'm not really concerned about the business in general, given the diversity that we have, diversity of customers, products, applications. 5G perhaps we'll see what is likely to be weakness in Europe, offset by growth in India, growth in O-RAN, steadiness in the U.S., and that kind of summarizes how we think about things."
