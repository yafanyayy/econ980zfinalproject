Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings discussion. I hope you've had a chance to review our posted slides as well as our news release and performance data, which were made available on our website yesterday. I will provide some additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session.
Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in 2021 with total EBITDA for the year of $3.6 billion, our highest total since Mosaic listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Adjusted earnings per share was $5.04, the highest since 2011. Our results were a reflection of strong performance across all of our segments.
Phosphate segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion, over 200% higher than the segment's total in 2020, reflecting strong pricing and growth in MicroEssentials, which more than offset the production impacts of Hurricane Ida. Potash segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion, up 78% from the prior year as pricing, increased output from K3 and the restart of Colonsay largely mitigated the closure of K1 and K2.
In Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated adjusted EBITDA of $821 million, up 74% from the prior year as the team capitalized on strong demand, a trend that we expected and drove our decision to acquire Fertilizantes 4 years ago. In 2021, Mosaic Fertilizantes was able to achieve its $200 million transformational EBITDA improvement target, over a year ahead of schedule.
These results highlight the decisions we've made over the last decade that have strengthened the business. Most significant has been the construction of K3, which at full capacity will be one of the largest, most efficient and automated potash mines in the world. Assuming a net investment consistent with what we discussed at our 2019 Analyst Day, at today's prices, K3's payback period can be measured in months rather than years.
Also in potash, we successfully restarted Colonsay and reached our targeted annual run rate of 1 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. Colonsay's fourth quarter cash cost averaged $85 per tonne, well below our pre-idle cost of $100 a tonne despite higher price-driven taxes and royalties.
In Brazil, our acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes in 2018 followed by the team's transformational work to improve margins has driven significant shareholder value. At the time of the transaction, pro forma EBITDA was less than $70 million. Our 2021 results show that we've been able to optimize that business through integration and transformational share gains and co-product sales.
In our phosphate business, performance products, primarily higher-margin MicroEssentials, now account for more than 40% of the segment's finished product sales volumes. All of these decisions, combined with strong execution, put us in a position to benefit from 2021's favorable market backdrop and improve Mosaic's financial position. In 2021, Mosaic retired $450 million of long-term debt, raised the annual dividend by 50% and repurchased nearly $0.5 billion in shares.
Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending through 2022. Global demand for grain and oilseeds remains high, while stock-to-use ratios are at the lowest point in more than a decade. Food security concerns and rising biofuel consumption are driving demand for corn and soybean as well as rice, wheat, coffee, palm oil and other agricultural commodities. These dynamics are sustaining agricultural commodity prices.
It's the strength in crop markets, combined with global industry supply constraints, that have pushed fertilizer prices higher. Global supply disruptions from 2021 are expected to continue impacting the global market in 2022. In potash, sanctions against Belarus are beginning to have a profound impact on supply. Global buyers are beginning to acknowledge this, including India and China, which both signed contracts with Canpotex at $590 per tonne to ensure they have adequate supply for 2022.
In phosphates, the secular shift of Chinese supply away from exports towards domestic agriculture and industrial consumption is expected to outlast the short-term export ban currently in place. Over time, we believe domestic demand will drive China's phosphate exports lower as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side from chemicals and electric vehicles, lithium-ion phosphate batteries. Globally, strong demand over the last 18 months resulted in many producers delaying maintenance downtime to meet customer needs, which will have to be addressed at some point.
On the demand side, farmer economics in most global growing regions remains constructive. Inflation and input costs are impacting profitability, but recent increases in crop prices are improving farmer economics for 2022, even if that estimated profitability remains below the 2021 record levels.
As we head into North American spring planting season, we are seeing normal buyer behavior as demand continues to reflect strong underlying crop prices. In Brazil, fertilizer shipments in 2022 appears set to equal last year's record-setting total. Grower economics are improving, thanks to rising crop prices, credit availability and a favorable exchange rate.
In India, while farmer demand remains very strong, availability is still lagging. This month, the Indian government released its initial budget for nutrient subsidies, highlighting the Indian government's willingness to respond to market condition with revisions. Given depleted Indian inventories, we see India as a source of pent-up demand, which should see phosphate and potash consumption growth in 2022.
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain very optimistic. In potash, K3's ramp-up is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter, meaning it will reach full capacity, under budget and 2 years ahead of schedule. When combined with Belle Plaine and a full year of production from Colonsay, we expect higher production in 2022 with production costs trending lower as the year progresses.
In the first quarter, we expect sales volume of 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes with average realized FOB prices more than $125 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter. In phosphates, we also expect a recovery in volume in 2022 following last year's production curtailments related to sulfur shortage in the second quarter and Hurricane Ida in the third and fourth quarters. We expect to see input cost inflation in 2022, especially related to our open-market purchases of sulfur and ammonia. But in ammonia, we continue to benefit from 2/3 of our needs being met by internal production and our supply agreement with CF Industries.
In the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes. Our expected sales volumes reflect supply chain constraints as well as low inventories at the start of the year because of Hurricane Ida. Average realized FOB prices are expected to be more than $60 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter, somewhat offset by higher input costs.
For Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformation efforts in 2022. Sustained grower demand and improved market positioning should continue to drive results. We are seeing inflation affect our cost structure but believe our transformation initiatives should offset much of the impact.
Given the direction of our business, we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022. With that in mind, it is imperative that we allocate capital wisely across our 3 strategic focus areas of capital return to shareholders, balance sheet strength and investing in the business.
Returning capital to shareholders will be a key focus in 2022. Over the coming year, we anticipate returning most of our free cash flow, up to 75% to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. At today's price, we believe our shares represent compelling value given the dynamics we're seeing. To underscore this point, we will be initiating a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the coming days. After the ASR, we will have repurchased approximately $830 million against our $1 billion authorization established last August. We plan to exhaust the remaining portion of that authorization through open-market purchases.
As a result, Mosaic's Board has approved a new $1 billion repurchase authorization, which goes into effect after the current program is completed. The ASR and our new authorization together represent about 8% of our market capitalization. Combining both authorizations represents approximately 12% of our current market cap.
In addition to share repurchases, Mosaic's Board has also approved raising the regular annual dividend from $0.45 to $0.60 per share beginning in the second quarter. This is the third regular dividend hike in the last 12 months and reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the business.
In the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Last year, we retired $450 million, which will use $550 million left towards our ultimate goal. This coincides with $550 million of long-term debt that matures later this year.
It is also important to note that our working capital needs tend to grow as our end markets strengthen. Because of this, we have expanded our working capital lending facilities by $375 million to help us more efficiently manage our liquidity.
Given our outlook for the year, we expect we'll also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business, even as we return the majority of our capital to shareholders. Over the last 5 years, the value created by key investments, like accelerated construction of K3, the acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes and the development and growth of MicroEssentials, speaks for itself.
Looking forward, we will continue to seek out high-returning investments, but our focus is not on large-scale greenfield projects. Rather, we believe better return, expansion of MicroEssentials and investment in soil health and biologics.
In the last area, we are seeing very promising results. Field trials of a first-generation nitrogen fixing formulation for corn has shown promising results that we believe are as good as anything available in the market today. And we believe further development can result in a best-in-class nitrogen solution for growers in the next 2 years. We will have exclusive rights to that product when it comes to market in the Americas, China and India, key growing regions that want to reduce their nitrogen cost. This is just one example of many partnerships as we continue to explore grower solutions across biologicals and soil health. And we continue to do this through small, efficient investments that establish exclusive rights partnerships, like with BioConsortia; or give us access to entire product portfolios as is the case with our recent investment in Plant Response, a small ag technology company that develops and commercializes plant and soil health products.
In total, we've invested approximately $50 million over the last 2 years to build the foundation for an exciting future portfolio of value-add products that our customers are asking for. We anticipate having more to share on these investments over time. These moves emphasize our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. We will remain flexible in our approach, continuing to evaluate compelling opportunities that strengthen our business over the long term, optimize our balance sheet and return significant capital to shareholders.
Finally, a discussion of the future of our business would be incomplete without including an update on some of the initiatives we've taken to make sure we continue to operate sustainably. Over the last year, we've made significant progress towards our ESG performance targets originally set in 2020, so much so that we've set even higher targets. In the area of carbon emissions, Mosaic has set a target of being net zero at its Florida operations by 2030 and globally by 2040. For diversity and inclusion, we set new goals for 2030 around the issues of race, gender and community support. Our global goals ensure that our actions are purposeful, sustainable and measurable as we seek to operate our business while also helping to build a more inclusive culture where all of our employees can thrive.
With that, let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

Our first question is on the issue of the potash market in Belarus. How should investors think about the impact of sanctions on the global market?"

First, the potash market was already tight before any sanctions came into place. Higher crop prices, higher demand for fertilizer globally has led to a tightness in this market that was driving higher prices before the Belarusian sanctions. The Belarusian sanctions have simply exacerbated and made the tightness more serious.
In terms of the length of the sanctions, we really don't know, and there's no obvious immediate resolution to that issue right now. Short of maybe a regime change, I can't see how that issue is going to be resolved.
In terms of the shortfall, we believe it could be anywhere from a few million tonnes in the best-case scenario to as much as 8 million tonnes if the sanctions remain all through the year. Our base case we're working on right now is that there will be about a 4 million-tonne deficit this year.
Now the best evidence for this from our perspective is not what we see but what our buyers are saying. Our buyers are signaling that this issue could be longer-lasting than some of our producers have suggested. India and China both signed 2022 contracts of $590 for longer durations than the previous 6-month contracts. And we are hearing similar sentiment from our other global customers. They cannot get the tonnage. And if they can, there is no method to pay for with U.S. banks.
So it's fair to assume that every producer is likely already evaluating every economic tonne that they can get out to the market, including us. But remember, in addition to maximizing and increasing tonnage, we cannot forget about the supply chain constraints. To substantially increase our logistics capability, producers will need more railcars or port capacity, and all of this takes time and capital to overcome."

Before the sanctions, Mosaic's targeted run rate by the end of the first quarter was about 10.5 million tonnes. And let me just quickly give you the breakup of that. Esterhazy in its existing form, we believe, can run a consistent, sustainable 5.5 million tonnes; Belle Plaine, around 3 million tonnes. Colonsay before the shutdown was running somewhere around 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes, and we will find the right spot for that this year. That gives us an MLP tonnage of around 9.5 million to 10 million tonnes available today. And then K-Mag at just a little over 700,000 tonnes takes our total to about 10.5 million tonnes of sustainable production capability.
So as we look forward, what can we do to push our capabilities? We know we have some latent capacity at Colonsay, and we're looking right now on how we can do a little extra development to put some mining panels into place that were shut down a few years ago.
In terms of K3, the run rate of 5.5 million tonnes, we think we could run a little more than that, and that will play out as we start getting more and more mining areas running and we get the 11th miner in position. The other issue at Esterhazy, we think, we think there's some pretty good debottlenecking projects that we're already studying, and we believe some of those will lead to a little better tonnage coming out of Esterhazy. In terms of Belle Plaine, we believe it's running pretty much at its maximum right now.
So the easy tonnages will come from debottlenecking, Colonsay getting more miners into higher-production panels and then pushing K3 and doing the small debottlenecking projects that come at the end of a long capital project."

And we have to expect that at today's prices, it wouldn't be surprising to see China's producers try to benefit from that high-price environment.
But we do think that annual exports are going to continue to trend lower over time. Secular domestic demand in China will pull increasingly large amounts of phosphates away from the export market. And we cannot ignore industrial uses. Battery growth and domestic fertilizers will take precedence over exports, and we expect the Chinese government will continue to force suppliers to prioritize domestic demand."

And in India, we expect the government is going to do, again, readjust their subsidy level in order to support their farmers' demand to phosphate and potash as they did last year.
If there's any threat to the consumption of demand, it is probably because of lack of availability across both phosphate and potash. And the global demand is there if the tonnes are available."

In terms of our expected volumes for quarter 1, I think there's really 2 big issues we have to consider when we look at our sales volume. The first of all is actually quarter 4, where Hurricane Ida and subsequent repair events impacted at the beginning of the fourth quarter and left us with very, very low inventories entering this year, which, of course, tends to contribute to first quarter sales.
In terms of the other issue from our perspective, it's really the logistics. COVID and winter weather are having a major impact on the supply chain, including rail, ocean freight, ports and trucking logistics. The industry is seeing delays throughout the system, and that's contributing to the lower-than-historical sales volume guidance.
Just as an example, rail alone this year, we're seeing about a 20% to 30% increase in cycle time for our trains. And you can expect that to have a big impact on rev rec at the very end of the quarter. That said, we expect our annual sales to be in line with historic norms for phosphates. Delayed shipments due to supply chain issues will resolve themselves as we come out of the winter weather and we get through this last wave of COVID. So we will see those come in the next quarter or 2.
The thing I would emphasize is we're seeing normal buyer behavior. Yes, nutrient prices are up. The crop prices more than offset that and point to a very good year for grower profitability, even if it's a small step back from the 2021 levels. We expect crop prices to continue to incentivize farmers to apply fertilizer as they normally would."

So I think, as everyone knows, our business is highly seasonal, and we can experience pretty significant working capital changes throughout the year. And over the last couple of years, we have put in new working capital facilities to help us manage through some of that seasonal dynamic. And in the current pricing environment and the environment that we've been in and the rate of change that we've seen, that just amplifies those seasonal working capital moves.
And so more recently, we've upsized some of our working capital lines to better align our options and our tools to the needs of the business. Just to give you a sense, as we look at the second half of last year, our core working capital needs were up well over $1 billion, and majority of that was in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to 2022, I think any incremental working capital needs are likely to be dictated by the pricing environment that we see. To the extent that the pricing environment moderates and the rate of change moderates, then I think the working capital incremental needs will moderate. But if we do see a continuation of what we've seen in the last 6 months, I think we could expect to see increasing working capital requirements."

So yes, we may pick up a little bit, but I don't think it will be because of the blend opportunity versus others. I think it will just be because of people trying to get hold of potash."

But right now, market ammonia is probably in the range of, Jenny, $1,100. So that adds about $200 plus per tonne to the cost of making phosphates.
Now recognize our costs are significantly lower than that because 2/3 of ours is on a natural gas basis. So for our competitors, call it, $250 per tonne. For us, probably more than half of that range would be the right number.
In terms of sulfur, sulfur 40%. So if sulfur price is $300, then your cost in making DAP is probably $120-ish per tonne. So you could look at that for our competitors being a total cost of up to $300 extra tonne and for us, probably $220 or something, in that range."

The majority of the co-product sales is likely the sale of gypsum, but there's a number of co-products whether they be produced from some of our wastewater streams or whatever. But we sold last year, I think, over $400 million of co-products with pretty healthy margin because the cost of these, of course, is very low. So we feel that's a a pretty attractive place.
And of course, when you sell gypsum, that's chips actually you don't have to make in the future. So again, a big piece of the long-term business improvement will be those sales of co-products and particularly the sale of gypsum.
In terms of moving this business forward, you're right, there's a number of opportunities. I think there is a number of new opportunities for co-products and particularly when you look at titanium, niobium and whatnot that is naturally in our ore and is made by our neighbors, at least our neighbors at Catalao.
The other area is distribution. And distribution, particularly as you go to the Northwest part of the country, so Northwest part of Montegrosso and heading into what we call the Montapito states, which are the northern states south of the Amazon but in the western side of the country. We believe the distribution opportunity there is high. We are looking very seriously about how we can get a bigger piece of that, how we can participate more in that. So distribution, one area; co-products, new products.

And with the crop prices rallied in Brazil, over the last few weeks, we saw the Brazilian buyers also stepped into the market. After yesterday, the gap between Brazil in phosphate to India are very close. So we saw the price of MAP in Brazil already reached over to $900 per tonne.
And similarly to NOLA, we saw some seasonal price lows. And over the last 2 weeks, that price has rebounded, and we saw the shrinking of price gap between NOLA in India as well. Overall, we see a pretty much strong demand supported by the farmer economics and also pent-up demand in India in the case of China as well.

So our expectation is that India will continue to tread that -- or walk that tight rope as best they can.
So they will have to respond to global pricing. They will have to make sure they get the fertilizer they need. And we're seeing that right now. I mean with the fast settlement of their potash and the -- at $590. They were the first to settle with Canpotex quite early, and I think that reflects the pent-up demand that they need to make sure it gets out to their farmers.
And then we just talked about their willingness to pay $930 or $920 for phosphates. So we're seeing the buyer response.

Let me start with Fertilizantes and the cost structure of Fertilizantes. There's a lot of factors, I think, that are impacting Fertilizantes right now. I mean the first of it, as you mentioned, is inflation. And if you look at U.S. dollars, it's probably easier to see where that's been not as severe as what it might look like.
But Brazil is probably seeing in industrial inflation, somewhere in that 15% to 20% this year. And that's having a real day-to-day impact on cost structures. The other thing that has hurt Brazil in the last while, of course, is COVID. It has made it a lot more difficult to do mechanical or maintenance turnarounds. It's made getting supply chain people in place, et cetera, et cetera. So there's maintenance that takes longer, just a lot of little niggly things that come with the people problems and the COVID problems. And then there's, of course, supply chain issues, getting materials and when you get materials are more expensive.
So all of those things are impacting. We think that long-term U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar to Brazilian reais will be offset with the inflation rates. So in other words, if the inflation keeps higher than U.S., it will probably be equalized by exchange rates. And the other issues should go away with COVID and whatnot as things sort of return to more normal."

And as we look forward from that, assuming the market continues to grow at the normal rates, we don't have any big projects coming forward that we think are going to fill that gap. So we see it tight this year. And assuming our Chinese estimates are correct, continuing tight for the next 4 or 5 years even.
And then as we look at the evolution of industrial uses for phosphates -- and we talked about lithium iron phosphate batteries in particular. But as we move into those other uses for phosphates, particularly in China, we do expect long term that the Chinese exports will continue to decline and that new projects that are -- haven't been called yet and take 4 or 5 years will have to fill that gap. Jenny, anything else? Okay. So Jenny is fine.
Okay. Look, with that, I will conclude our call here by reiterating some of our key messages. Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in 2021 driven by very strong agricultural and fertilizer markets and by leveraging the value we have created through major investments and cost restructuring. We look forward to returning much of that value that we created to our shareholders through the accelerated share repurchase, our new repurchase authorization and an increased dividend target. And with continued high levels of global fertilizer demand and ongoing tight supplies in both potash and phosphates, we expect another year of very strong value creation in 2022.
Thank you for your call -- for the call, and have a great day."

Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings discussion. I hope you've had a chance to review our posted slides as well as our news release and performance data, which were made available on our website yesterday. I will provide some additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in 2021 with total EBITDA for the year of $3.6 billion, our highest total since Mosaic listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Adjusted earnings per share was $5.04, the highest since 2011. Our results were a reflection of strong performance across all of our segments.
Phosphate segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion, over 200% higher than the segment's total in 2020, reflecting strong pricing and growth in MicroEssentials, which more than offset the production impacts of Hurricane Ida. Potash segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion, up 78% from the prior year as pricing, increased output from K3 and the restart of Colonsay largely mitigated the closure of K1 and K2.
In Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated adjusted EBITDA of $821 million, up 74% from the prior year as the team capitalized on strong demand, a trend that we expected and drove our decision to acquire Fertilizantes 4 years ago. In 2021, Mosaic Fertilizantes was able to achieve its $200 million transformational EBITDA improvement target, over a year ahead of schedule.
These results highlight the decisions we've made over the last decade that have strengthened the business. Most significant has been the construction of K3, which at full capacity will be one of the largest, most efficient and automated potash mines in the world. Assuming a net investment consistent with what we discussed at our 2019 Analyst Day, at today's prices, K3's payback period can be measured in months rather than years.
Also in potash, we successfully restarted Colonsay and reached our targeted annual run rate of 1 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. Colonsay's fourth quarter cash cost averaged $85 per tonne, well below our pre-idle cost of $100 a tonne despite higher price-driven taxes and royalties.
In Brazil, our acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes in 2018 followed by the team's transformational work to improve margins has driven significant shareholder value. At the time of the transaction, pro forma EBITDA was less than $70 million. Our 2021 results show that we've been able to optimize that business through integration and transformational share gains and co-product sales.
In our phosphate business, performance products, primarily higher-margin MicroEssentials, now account for more than 40% of the segment's finished product sales volumes. All of these decisions, combined with strong execution, put us in a position to benefit from 2021's favorable market backdrop and improve Mosaic's financial position. In 2021, Mosaic retired $450 million of long-term debt, raised the annual dividend by 50% and repurchased nearly $0.5 billion in shares. 
Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending through 2022. Global demand for grain and oilseeds remains high, while stock-to-use ratios are at the lowest point in more than a decade. Food security concerns and rising biofuel consumption are driving demand for corn and soybean as well as rice, wheat, coffee, palm oil and other agricultural commodities. These dynamics are sustaining agricultural commodity prices. 
It's the strength in crop markets, combined with global industry supply constraints, that have pushed fertilizer prices higher. Global supply disruptions from 2021 are expected to continue impacting the global market in 2022. In potash, sanctions against Belarus are beginning to have a profound impact on supply. Global buyers are beginning to acknowledge this, including India and China, which both signed contracts with Canpotex at $590 per tonne to ensure they have adequate supply for 2022.
In phosphates, the secular shift of Chinese supply away from exports towards domestic agriculture and industrial consumption is expected to outlast the short-term export ban currently in place. Over time, we believe domestic demand will drive China's phosphate exports lower as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side from chemicals and electric vehicles, lithium iron phosphate batteries.
Globally, strong demand over the last 18 months resulted in many producers delaying maintenance downtime to meet customer needs, which will have to be addressed at some point. 
On the demand side, farmer economics in most global growing regions remains constructive. Inflation and input costs are impacting profitability, but recent increases in crop prices are improving farmer economics for 2022, even if that estimated profitability remains below the 2021 record levels.
As we head into North American spring planting season, we are seeing normal buyer behavior as demand continues to reflect strong underlying crop prices. In Brazil, fertilizer shipments in 2022 appears set to equal last year's record-setting total. Grower economics are improving, thanks to rising crop prices, credit availability and a favorable exchange rate.
In India, while farmer demand remains very strong, availability is still lagging. This month, the Indian government released its initial budget for nutrient subsidies, highlighting the Indian government's willingness to respond to market condition with revisions. Given depleted Indian inventories, we see India as a source of pent-up demand, which should see phosphate and potash consumption growth in 2022.
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain very optimistic. In potash, K3's ramp-up is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter, meaning it will reach full capacity, under budget and 2 years ahead of schedule. When combined with Belle Plaine and a full year of production from Colonsay, we expect higher production in 2022 with production costs trending lower as the year progresses.
In the first quarter, we expect sales volume of 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes with average realized FOB prices more than $125 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter. In phosphates, we also expect a recovery in volume in 2022 following last year's production curtailments related to sulfur shortage in the second quarter and Hurricane Ida in the third and fourth quarters. We expect to see input cost inflation in 2022, especially related to our open-market purchases of sulfur and ammonia. But in ammonia, we continue to benefit from 2/3 of our needs being met by internal production and our supply agreement with CF Industries. 
In the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes up 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes. Our expected sales volumes reflect supply chain constraints as well as low inventories at the start of the year because of Hurricane Ida. Average realized FOB prices are expected to be more than $60 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter, somewhat offset by higher input costs.
For Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformation efforts in 2022. Sustained grower demand and improved market positioning should continue to drive results. We are seeing inflation effect our cost structure but believe our transformation initiatives should offset much of the impact.
Given the direction of our business, we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022. With that in mind, it is imperative that we allocate capital wisely across our 3 strategic focus areas of capital return to shareholders, balance sheet strength and investing in the business.
Returning capital to shareholders will be a key focus in 2022. Over the coming year, we anticipate returning most of our free cash flow up to 75% to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. At today's price, we believe our shares represent compelling value given the dynamics we're seeing.
To underscore this point, we will be initiating a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the coming days. After the ASR, we have repurchased approximately $830 million against our $1 billion authorization established last August. We plan to exhaust the remaining portion of that authorization through open-market purchases. 
As a result, Mosaic's Board has approved a new $1 billion repurchase authorization, which goes into effect after the current program is completed. The ASR and our new authorization together represent about 8% of our market capitalization. Combining both authorizations represents approximately 12% of our current market cap. 
In addition to share repurchases, Mosaic's Board has also approved raising the regular annual dividend from $0.45 to $0.60 per share beginning in the second quarter. This is the third regular dividend hike in the last 12 months and reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the business.
In the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Last year, we retired $450 million, which leaves $550 million left towards our ultimate goal. This coincides with $550 million of long-term debt that matures later this year.
It is also important to note that our working capital needs tend to grow as our end markets strengthen. Because of this, we have expanded our working capital lending facilities by $375 million to help us more efficiently manage our liquidity.
Given our outlook for the year, we expect we'll also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business, even as we return the majority of our capital to shareholders. Over the last 5 years, the value created by key investments, like accelerated construction of K3, the acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes and the development and growth of MicroEssentials, speaks for itself.
Looking forward, we will continue to seek out high-returning investments, but our focus is not on large-scale greenfield projects. Rather, we believe better return, expansion of MicroEssentials and investment in soil health and biologics.
In the last area, we are seeing very promising results. Field trials of a first-generation nitrogen fixing formulation for corn has shown promising results that we believe are as good as anything available in the market today. And we believe further development can result in a best-in-class nitrogen solution for growers in the next 2 years. We will have exclusive rights to that product when it comes to market in the Americas, China and India, key growing regions that want to reduce their nitrogen cost. This is just one example of many partnerships as we continue to explore grower solutions across biologicals and soil health. 
And we continue to do this through small, efficient investments that establish exclusive rights partnerships like with BioConsortia or give us access to entire product portfolios as is the case with our recent investment in Plant Response, a small ag technology company that develops and commercializes plant and soil health products. 
In total, we've invested approximately $50 million over the last 2 years to build the foundation for an exciting future portfolio of value-add products that our customers are asking for. We anticipate having more to share on these investments over time. These moves emphasize our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. We will remain flexible in our approach, continuing to evaluate compelling opportunities that strengthen our business over the long term, optimize our balance sheet and return significant capital to shareholders. 
Finally, a discussion of the future of our business would be incomplete without including an update on some of the initiatives we've taken to make sure we continue to operate sustainably. Over the last year, we've made significant progress towards our ESG performance targets originally set in 2020, so much so that we've set even higher targets. In the area of carbon emissions, Mosaic has set a target of being net zero at its Florida operations by 2030 and globally by 2040. For diversity and inclusion, we set new goals for 2030 around the issues of race, gender and community support. Our global goals ensure that our actions are purposeful, sustainable and measurable as we seek to operate our business while also helping to build a more inclusive culture where all of our employees can thrive.
With that, let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

First, the potash market was already tight before any sanctions came into place. Higher crop prices, higher demand for fertilizer globally has led to a tightness in this market that was driving higher prices before the Belarusian sanctions. The Belarusian sanctions have simply exacerbated and made the tightness more serious.
In terms of the length of the sanctions, we really don't know, and there's no obvious immediate resolution to that issue right now. Part of maybe a regime change, I can't see how that issue is going to be resolved. 
In terms of the shortfall, we believe it could be anywhere from a few million tonnes in the best-case scenario to as much as 8 million tonnes if the sanctions remain all through the year. Our base case we're working on right now is that there will be about a 4 million-tonne deficit this year.
Now the best evidence for this from our perspective is not what we see but what our buyers are saying. Our buyers are signaling that this issue could be longer-lasting than some of our producers have suggested. India and China both signed 2022 contracts of $590 for longer durations than the previous 6-month contracts. And we are hearing similar sentiment from our other global customers. They cannot get the tonnage. And if they can, there is no method to pay for with U.S. banks.
So it's fair to assume that every producer is likely already evaluating every economic tonne that they can get out to the market, including us. But remember, in addition to maximizing and increasing tonnage, we cannot forget about the supply chain constraints. To substantially increase our logistics capability, producers will need more railcars or port capacity, and all of this takes time and capital to overcome."

Before the sanctions, Mosaic's targeted run rate by the end of the first quarter was about 10.5 million tonnes. And let me just quickly give you the breakup of that. Esterhazy in its existing form, we believe, can run a consistent, sustainable 5.5 million tonnes; Belle Plaine, around 3 million tonnes. Colonsay before the shutdown was running somewhere around 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes, and we will find the right spot for that this year. That gives us an MLP tonnage of around 9.5 million to 10 million tonnes available today. And then K-Mag at just a little over 700,000 tonnes takes our total to about 10.5 million tonnes of sustainable production capability.
So as we look forward, what can we do to push our capabilities? We know we have some latent capacity at Colonsay, and we're looking right now on how we can do a little extra development to put some mining panels into place that were shut down a few years ago. 
In terms of K3, the run rate of 5.5 million tonnes, we think we could run a little more than that, and that will play out as we start getting more and more mining areas running and we get the 11th miner in position. The other issue at Esterhazy, we think, we think there's some pretty good debottlenecking projects that we're already studying, and we believe some of those will lead to a little better tonnage coming out of Esterhazy. In terms of Belle Plaine, we believe it's running pretty much at its maximum right now. 
So the easy tonnages will come from debottlenecking, Colonsay getting more miners into higher-production panels and then pushing K3 and doing the small debottlenecking projects that come at the end of a long capital project."

And we have to expect that at today's prices, it wouldn't be surprising to see China's producers try to benefit from that high-price environment. 
But we do think that annual exports are going to continue to trend lower over time. Secular domestic demand in China will pull increasingly large amounts of phosphates away from the export market. And we cannot ignore industrial uses. Battery growth and domestic fertilizers will take precedence over exports, and we expect the Chinese government will continue to force suppliers to prioritize domestic demand."

In terms of our expected volumes for quarter 1, I think there's really 2 big issues we have to consider when we look at our sales volume. The first of all is actually quarter 4, where Hurricane Ida and subsequent repair events impacted at the beginning of the fourth quarter and left us with very, very low inventories entering this year, which, of course, tends to contribute to first quarter sales.
In terms of the other issue from our perspective, it's really the logistics. COVID and winter weather are having a major impact on the supply chain, including rail, ocean freight, ports and trucking logistics. The industry is seeing delays throughout the system, and that's contributing to the lower-than-historical sales volume guidance.
Just as an example, rail alone this year, we're seeing about a 20% to 30% increase in cycle time for our trains. And you can expect that to have a big impact on rev rec at the very end of the quarter. That said, we expect our annual sales to be in line with historic norms for phosphates. Delayed shipments due to supply chain issues will resolve themselves as we come out of the winter weather and we get through this last wave of COVID. So we will see those come in the next quarter or 2. 
The thing I would emphasize is we're seeing normal buyer behavior. Yes, nutrient prices are up. The crop prices more than offset that and point to a very good year for grower profitability, even if it's a small step back from the 2021 levels. We expect crop prices to continue to incentivize farmers to apply fertilizer as they normally would."

And over the last couple of years, we have put in new working capital facilities to help us manage through some of that seasonal dynamic. And in the current pricing environment and the environment that we've been in and the rate of change that we've seen, that just amplifies those seasonal working capital moves.
And so more recently, we've upsized some of our working capital lines to better align our options and our tools to the needs of the business. Just to give you a sense, as we look at the second half of last year, our core working capital needs were up well over $1 billion, and majority of that was in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to 2022, I think any incremental working capital needs are likely to be dictated by the pricing environment that we see to the extent that the pricing environment moderates and the rate of change moderates, then I think the working capital incremental needs will moderate. But if we do see a continuation of what we've seen in the last 6 months, I think we could expect to see increasing working capital requirements."

As we look forward to the balance of 2022, we expect to generate a significant amount of earnings and cash flow.

But we think we can do those things and return a significant amount of capital to shareholders this year within the construct that we've outlined.
Today, we announced an increase in our dividend for this year and going forward as well as a buyback using an ASR tool. As we go through the balance of the year, we intend to remain disciplined and nimble and look at different ways of returning capital to our shareholders.
But our current priority is on buybacks. We look at our share price, where it is, and we think that it is compelling given the environment that we see. So that's our priority today. But again, we intend to remain flexible as we go through the year."

But right now, market ammonia is probably in the range of, Jenny, $1,100. So that adds about $200 plus per tonne to the cost of making phosphates.
Now recognize our costs are significantly lower than that because 2/3 of ours is on a natural gas basis. So for our competitors, call it, $250 per tonne. For us, probably more than half of that range would be the right number.
In terms of sulfur, sulfur 40%. So if sulfur price is $300, then your cost in making DAP is probably $120-ish per tonne. So you could look at that for our competitors being a total cost of up to $300 extra tonne and for us, probably $220 or something, in that range."

The majority of the co-product sales is likely the sale of gypsum, but there's a number of co-products whether they be produced from some of our wastewater streams or whatever.

And of course, when you sell gypsum, that's gyps tax you don't have to make in the future. So again, a big piece of the long-term business improvement will be those sales of co-products and particularly the sale of gypsum.
In terms of moving this business forward, you're right, there's a number of opportunities. I think there is a number of new opportunities for co-products and particularly when you look at titanium, niobium and whatnot that is naturally in our ore and is made by our neighbors, at least our neighbors at Catalao.
The other area is distribution. And distribution, particularly as you go to the Northwest part of the country, so Northwest part of Montegrosso and heading into what we call the Montapito states, which are the northern states south of the Amazon but in the western side of the country. We believe the distribution opportunity there is high. We are looking very seriously about how we can get a bigger piece of that, how we can participate more in that.

And similarly to NOLA, we saw some seasonal price lows. And over the last 2 weeks, that price has rebounded, and we saw the shrinking of price gap between NOLA in India as well.

They were the first to settle with Canpotex quite early, and I think that reflects the pent-up demand that they need to make sure it gets out to their farmers.

Let me start with Fertilizantes and the cost structure of Fertilizantes. There's a lot of factors, I think, that are impacting Fertilizantes right now. I mean the first of it, as you mentioned, is inflation. And if you look at U.S. dollars, it's probably easier to see where that's been not as severe as what it might look like.
But Brazil is probably seeing in industrial inflation, somewhere in that 15% to 20% this year. And that's having a real day-to-day impact on cost structures. The other thing that has hurt Brazil in the last while, of course, is COVID. It has made it a lot more difficult to do mechanical or maintenance turnarounds. It's made getting supply chain people in place, et cetera, et cetera. So there's maintenance that takes longer, just a lot of little niggly things that come with the people problems and the COVID problems. And then there's, of course, supply chain issues, getting materials and when you get materials are more expensive.
So all of those things are impacting. We think that long-term U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar to Brazilian reais will be offset with the inflation rates. So in other words, if the inflation keeps higher than U.S., it will probably be equalized by exchange rates.

And then as we look at the evolution of industrial uses for phosphates -- and we talked about lithium iron phosphate batteries in particular.

Okay. Look, with that, I will conclude our call here by reiterating some of our key messages. Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in 2021 driven by very strong agricultural and fertilizer markets and by leveraging the value we have created through major investments and cost restructuring. We look forward to returning much of that value that we created to our shareholders through the accelerated share repurchase, our new repurchase authorization and an increased dividend target. And with continued high levels of global fertilizer demand and ongoing tight supplies in both potash and phosphates, we expect another year of very strong value creation in 2022.

Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings discussion. I hope you've had a chance to review our posted slides as well as our news release and performance data, which were made available on our website yesterday. I will provide some additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in 2021 with total EBITDA for the year of $3.6 billion, our highest total since Mosaic listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Adjusted earnings per share was $5.04, the highest since 2011. Our results were a reflection of strong performance across all of our segments.
Phosphate segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion, over 200% higher than the segment's total in 2020, reflecting strong pricing and growth in MicroEssentials, which more than offset the production impacts of Hurricane Ida. Potash segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion, up 78% from the prior year, as pricing, increased output from K3 and the restart of Colonsay largely mitigated the closure at K1 and K2.
In Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated adjusted EBITDA of $821 million, up 74% from the prior year as the team capitalized on strong demand, a trend that we expected and drove our decision to acquire Fertilizantes 4 years ago. In 2021 Mosaic Fertilizantes was able to achieve its $200 million transformational EBITDA improvement target, over a year ahead of schedule.
These results highlight the decisions we've made over the last decade that have strengthened the business. Most significant has been the construction of K3, which at full capacity will be one of the largest, most efficient and automated potash mines in the world. Assuming a net investment consistent with what we discussed at our 2019 Analyst Day, at today's prices K3's payback period can be measured in months rather than years.
Also in Potash, we successfully restarted Colonsay and reached our targeted annual run rate of 1 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. Colonsay's fourth quarter cash cost averaged $85 per tonne, well below our pre-idle cost of $100 a tonne despite higher price-driven taxes and royalties.
In Brazil, our acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes in 2018 followed by the team's transformational work to improve margins has driven significant shareholder value. At the time of the transaction, pro forma EBITDA was less than $70 million. Our 2021 results show that we've been able to optimize that business through integration and transformational share gains and co-product sales.
In our Phosphate business, performance products, primarily higher-margin MicroEssentials, now account for more than 40% of the segment's finished product sales volumes. All of these decisions, combined with strong execution, put us in a position to benefit from 2021's favorable market backdrop and improve Mosaic's financial position. In 2021, Mosaic retired $450 million of long-term debt, raised the annual dividend by 50% and repurchased nearly $0.5 billion in shares. 
Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending through 2022. Global demand for grain and oilseeds remains high, while stock-to-use ratios are at the lowest point in more than a decade. Food security concerns and rising biofuel consumption are driving demand for corn and soybean as well as rice, wheat, coffee, palm oil and other agricultural commodities. These dynamics are sustaining agricultural commodity prices. 
It's the strength in crop markets combined with global industry supply constraints that have pushed fertilizer prices higher. Global supply disruptions from 2021 are expected to continue impacting the global market in 2022. In potash, sanctions against Belarus are beginning to have a profound impact on supply. Global buyers are beginning to acknowledge this, including India and China, which both signed contracts with Canpotex at $590 per tonne to ensure they have adequate supply for 2022.
In phosphates, the secular shift of China's supply away from exports towards domestic agriculture and industrial consumption is expected to outlast the short-term export ban currently in place. Over time, we believe domestic demand will drive China's phosphate exports lower as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side from chemicals and electric vehicles' lithium iron phosphate batteries.
Globally, strong demand over the last 18 months resulted in many producers delaying maintenance downtime to meet customer needs, which will have to be addressed at some point. 
On the demand side, farmer economics in most global growing regions remains constructive. Inflation and input costs are impacting profitability, but recent increases in crop prices are improving farmer economics for 2022, even if that estimated profitability remains below the 2021 record levels.
As we head into North American spring planting season, we are seeing normal buyer behavior as demand continues to reflect strong underlying crop prices. In Brazil, fertilizer shipments in 2022 appear set to equal last year's record-setting total. Grower economics are improving, thanks to rising crop prices, credit availability and a favorable exchange rate.
In India, while farmer demand remains very strong, availability is still lagging. This month, the Indian government released its initial budget for nutrient subsidies, highlighting the Indian government's willingness to respond to market condition with revisions. Given depleted Indian inventories, we see India as a source of pent-up demand, which should see phosphate and potash consumption grow in 2022.
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain very optimistic. In Potash, K3's ramp-up is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter, meaning it will reach full capacity, under budget and 2 years ahead of schedule. When combined with Belle Plaine and a full year of production from Colonsay, we expect higher production in 2022 with production costs trending lower as the year progresses.
In the first quarter, we expect sales volume of 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes, with average realized FOB prices more than $125 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter. In Phosphates, we also expect a recovery in volume in 2022 following last year's production curtailments related to sulfur shortage in the second quarter and Hurricane Ida in the third and fourth quarters. We expect to see input cost inflation in 2022, especially related to our open-market purchases of sulfur and ammonia. But in ammonia, we continue to benefit from 2/3 of our needs being met by internal production and our supply agreement with CF Industries. 
In the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes up 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes. Our expected sales volumes reflect supply chain constraints as well as low inventories at the start of the year because of Hurricane Ida. Average realized FOB prices are expected to be more than $60 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter, somewhat offset by higher input costs.
For Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformation efforts in 2022. Sustained grower demand and improved market positioning should continue to drive results. We are seeing inflation affect our cost structure but believe our transformation initiatives should offset much of the impact.
Given the direction of our business, we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022. With that in mind, it is imperative that we allocate capital wisely across our 3 strategic focus areas of capital return to shareholders, balance sheet strength, and investing in the business.
Returning capital to shareholders will be a key focus in 2022. Over the coming year, we anticipate returning most of our free cash flow, up to 75%, to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. At today's price, we believe our shares represent compelling value given the dynamics we're seeing.
To underscore this point, we will be initiating a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the coming days. After the ASR, we will have repurchased approximately $830 million against our $1 billion authorization established last August. We plan to exhaust the remaining portion of that authorization through open-market purchases. 
As a result, Mosaic's Board has approved a new $1 billion repurchase authorization, which goes into effect after the current program is completed. The ASR and our new authorization together represent about 8% of our market capitalization. Combining both authorizations represents approximately 12% of our current market cap. 
In addition to share repurchases, Mosaic's Board has also approved raising the regular annual dividend from $0.45 to $0.60 per share beginning in the second quarter. This is the third regular dividend hike in the last 12 months and reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the business.
In the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Last year, we retired $450 million, which leaves $550 million left towards our ultimate goal. This coincides with $550 million of long-term debt that matures later this year.
It is also important to note that our working capital needs tend to grow as our end markets strengthen. Because of this, we have expanded our working capital lending facilities by $375 million to help us more efficiently manage our liquidity.
Given our outlook for the year, we expect we'll also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business, even as we return the majority of our capital to shareholders. Over the last 5 years, the value created by key investments, like accelerated construction of K3, the acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes and the development and growth of MicroEssentials, speaks for itself.
Looking forward, we will continue to seek out high-returning investments, but our focus is not on large-scale greenfield projects. Rather, we believe better return can be realized in areas like enlarging our footprint in Brazil, expansion of MicroEssentials and investment in soil health and biologics.
In the last area, we are seeing very promising results. As an example, through our partnership with BioConsortia, field trials of a first-generation nitrogen fixing formulation for corn have shown promising results that we believe are as good as anything available in the market today. And we believe further development can result in a best-in-class nitrogen solution for growers in the next 2 years. We will have exclusive rights to that product when it comes to market in the Americas, China and India, key growing regions that want to reduce their nitrogen cost. This is just one example of many partnerships as we continue to explore grower solutions across biologicals and soil health. 
And we continue to do this through small, efficient investments that establish exclusive rights partnerships like with BioConsortia or give us access to entire product portfolios, as is the case with our recent investment in Plant Response, a small ag technology company that develops and commercializes plant and soil health products. 
In total, we've invested approximately $50 million over the last 2 years to build the foundation for an exciting future portfolio of value-add products that our customers are asking for. We anticipate having more to share on these investments over time. These moves emphasize our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. We will remain flexible in our approach, continuing to evaluate compelling opportunities that strengthen our business over the long term, optimize our balance sheet and return significant capital to shareholders. 
Finally, a discussion of the future of our business would be incomplete without including an update on some of the initiatives we've taken to make sure we continue to operate sustainably. Over the last year, we've made significant progress towards our ESG performance targets originally set in 2020, so much so that we've set even higher targets. In the area of carbon emissions, Mosaic has set a target of being net zero at its Florida operations by 2030 and globally by 2040. For diversity and inclusion, we've set new goals for 2030 around the issues of race, gender and community support. Our global goals ensure that our actions are purposeful, sustainable and measurable as we seek to operate our business while also helping to build a more inclusive culture where all of our employees can thrive.
With that, let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

First, the potash market was already tight before any sanctions came into place. Higher crop prices, higher demand for fertilizer globally has led to a tightness in this market that was driving higher prices before the Belarusian sanctions. The Belarusian sanctions have simply exacerbated and made the tightness more serious.
In terms of the length of the sanctions, we really don't know, and there's no obvious immediate resolution to that issue right now. Short of maybe a regime change, I can't see how that issue is going to be resolved. 
In terms of the shortfall, we believe it could be anywhere from a few million tonnes in the best-case scenario to as much as 8 million tonnes if the sanctions remain all through the year. Our base case we're working on right now is that there will be about a 4 million tonne deficit this year.
Now the best evidence for this from our perspective is not what we see, but what our buyers are saying. Our buyers are signaling that this issue could be longer-lasting than some of our producers have suggested. India and China both signed 2022 contracts at $590 for longer durations than the previous 6-month contracts. And we are hearing similar sentiment from our other global customers. They cannot get the tonnage. And if they can, there is no method to pay for it with U.S. banks.
So it's fair to assume that every producer is likely already evaluating every economic tonne that they can get out to the market, including us. But remember, in addition to maximizing and increasing tonnage, we cannot forget about the supply chain constraints. To substantially increase our logistics capability, producers will need more railcars or port capacity, and all of this takes time and capital to overcome."

Before the sanctions, Mosaic's targeted run rate by the end of the first quarter was about 10.5 million tonnes. And let me just quickly give you the breakup of that. Esterhazy in its existing form, we believe, can run a consistent, sustainable 5.5 million tonnes; Belle Plaine, around 3 million tonnes. Colonsay, before the shutdown, was running somewhere around 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes, and we will find the right spot for that this year. That gives us an MLP tonnage of around 9.5 million to 10 million tonnes available today. And then K-Mag, at just a little over 700,000 tonnes, takes our total to about 10.5 million tonnes of sustainable production capability.
So as we look forward, what can we do to push our capabilities? We know we have some latent capacity at Colonsay, and we're looking right now on how we can do a little extra development to put some mining panels into place that were shut down a few years ago. 
In terms of K3, the run rate of 5.5 million tonnes, we think we could run a little more than that, and that will play out as we start getting more and more mining areas running and we get the 11th miner in position. The other issue at Esterhazy, we think, we think there's some pretty good debottlenecking projects that we're already studying, and we believe some of those will lead to a little better tonnage coming out of Esterhazy. In terms of Belle Plaine, we believe it's running pretty much at its maximum right now. 
So the easy tonnages will come from debottlenecking Colonsay, getting more miners into higher-production panels, and then pushing K3 and doing the small debottlenecking projects that come at the end of a long capital project."

But we do think that annual exports are going to continue to trend lower over time. Secular domestic demand in China will pull increasingly large amounts of phosphates away from the export market. And we cannot ignore industrial uses. Battery growth and domestic fertilizers will take precedence over exports, and we expect the Chinese government will continue to force suppliers to prioritize domestic demand."

In North America, we are seeing customers and farmers behavior are as normal as the pre-spring season. In Brazil, especially over the last few weeks as the sodium price rise, we are seeing very strong customer buying happening in the country. And in India, we expect the government is going to do, again, readjust their subsidy level in order to support their farmers' demands to phosphate and potash as they did last year. 
If there's any threat to the consumption or demand, it is probably because of lack of availability across both phosphate and potash. And the global demand is there if the tonnes are available."

In terms of our expected volumes for quarter 1, I think there's really 2 big issues we have to consider when we look at our sales volume. The first of all is actually quarter 4, where Hurricane Ida and subsequent repair events impacted at the beginning of the fourth quarter and left us with very, very low inventories entering this year, which, of course, tends to contribute to first quarter sales.
In terms of the other issue from our perspective, it's really the logistics. COVID and winter weather are having a major impact on the supply chain, including rail, ocean freight, ports and trucking logistics. The industry is seeing delays throughout the system, and that's contributing to the lower-than-historical sales volume guidance.
Just as an example, rail alone this year, we're seeing about a 20% to 30% increase in cycle time for our trains. And you can expect that to have a big impact on rev rec at the very end of the quarter. That said, we expect our annual sales to be in line with historic norms for Phosphates. Delayed shipments due to supply chain issues will resolve themselves as we come out of the winter weather and we get through this last wave of COVID. So we will see those come in the next quarter or two. 
The thing I would emphasize is we're seeing normal buyer behavior. Yes, nutrient prices are up. The crop prices more than offset that and point to a very good year for grower profitability, even if it's a small step back from the 2021 levels. We expect crop prices to continue to incentivize farmers to apply fertilizer as they normally would."

So I think, as everyone knows, our business is highly seasonal, and we can experience pretty significant working capital changes throughout the year. And over the last couple of years, we have put in new working capital facilities to help us manage through some of that seasonal dynamic. And in the current pricing environment and the environment that we've been in and the rate of change that we've seen, that just amplifies those seasonal working capital moves.
And so more recently, we've upsized some of our working capital lines to better align our options and our tools to the needs of the business. Just to give you a sense, as we look at the second half of last year, our core working capital needs were up well over $1 billion, and majority of that was in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to 2022, I think any incremental working capital needs are likely to be dictated by the pricing environment that we see. To the extent that the pricing environment moderates and the rate of change moderates, then I think the working capital incremental needs will moderate. But if we do see a continuation of what we've seen in the last 6 months, I think we could expect to see increasing working capital requirements."

Now recognize our costs are significantly lower than that because 2/3 of ours is on a natural gas basis. So for our competitors, call it, $250 per tonne. For us, probably more in half that range would be the right number.
In terms of sulfur, sulfur 40%. So if sulfur price is $300, then your cost in making DAP is probably $120-ish per tonne. So you could look at that for our competitors being a total cost of up to $300 extra a tonne and for us, probably $220 or something, in that range."

And of course, when you sell gypsum, that's gyps tax you don't have to make in the future. So again, a big piece of the long-term business improvement will be those sales of co-products and particularly the sale of gypsum.
In terms of moving this business forward, you're right, there's a number of opportunities. I think there is a number of new opportunities for co-products and particularly when you look at titanium, niobium and whatnot, that is naturally in our ore and is made by our neighbors, at least our neighbors at Catalao.
The other area is distribution. And distribution, particularly as you go to the Northwest part of the country, so Northwest part of Mato Grosso and heading into what we call the [ Mato Pito ] states, which are the northern states south of the Amazon but in the western side of the country. We believe the distribution opportunity there is high. We are looking very seriously about how we can get a bigger piece of that, how we can participate more in that.

And similarly to NOLA, we saw some seasonal price lows. And over the last 2 weeks, that price has rebounded, and we saw the shrinking of the price gap between NOLA in India as well.

So they will have to respond to global pricing. They will have to make sure they get the fertilizer they need. And we're seeing that right now. I mean with the fast settlement of their potash and the -- at $590. They were the first to settle with Canpotex quite early, and I think that reflects the pent-up demand that they need to make sure it gets out to their farmers.
And then we just talked about their willingness to pay $930 or $920 for phosphates. So we're seeing the buyer response. We know the government will have to either help with food subsidies or with fertilizer subsidies to keep that balance. And I know when it comes down to food securities, they're going to do what they have to do to make sure that works. And that's long term and short term."

And then maybe a second question, probably more for Clint. Mosaic is a very complicated business. It's across multiple geographies and product lines. And I mean it can be difficult sometimes to model out some of the variabilities around the quarters and even maybe for the year. Is there any thought on providing some more specific guidance, such as maybe including Fertilizantes in the kind of quarterly outlook guidance or maybe even cutting to like a specific EBITDA line?"

Let me start with Fertilizantes and the cost structure at Fertilizantes. There's a lot of factors, I think, that are impacting Fertilizantes right now. I mean the first of it, as you mentioned, is inflation. And if you look at U.S. dollars, it's probably easier to see where that's been not as severe as what it might look like.
But Brazil is probably seeing, in industrial inflation, somewhere in that 15% to 20% this year. And that's having a real day-to-day impact on cost structures. The other thing that has hurt Brazil in the last while, of course, is COVID. It has made it a lot more difficult to do mechanical or maintenance turnarounds. It's made getting supply chain people in place, et cetera, et cetera. So there's maintenance that takes longer, just a lot of little niggly things that come with the people problems and the COVID problems. And then there's, of course, supply chain issues getting materials, and when you get materials, they're more expensive.
So all of those things are impacting. We think that long-term U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar to Brazilian reals will be offset with the inflation rates. So in other words, if the inflation keeps higher than U.S., it will probably be equalized by exchange rates. And the other issues should go away with COVID and whatnot as things sort of return to more normal."

We look forward to returning much of that value that we created to our shareholders through the accelerated share repurchase, our new repurchase authorization and an increased dividend target. And with continued high levels of global fertilizer demand and ongoing tight supplies in both potash and phosphates, we expect another year of very strong value creation in 2022.

Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings discussion. I hope you've had a chance to review our posted slides as well as our news release and performance data, which were made available on our website yesterday. I will provide some additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in 2021 with total EBITDA for the year of $3.6 billion, our highest total since Mosaic listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Adjusted earnings per share was $5.04, the highest since 2011. Our results were a reflection of strong performance across all of our segments.
Phosphate segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion, over 200% higher than the segment's total in 2020, reflecting strong pricing and growth in MicroEssentials, which more than offset the production impacts of Hurricane Ida. Potash segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion, up 78% from the prior year, as pricing, increased output from K3 and the restart of Colonsay largely mitigated the closure at K1 and K2.
In Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated adjusted EBITDA of $821 million, up 74% from the prior year as the team capitalized on strong demand, a trend that we expected and drove our decision to acquire Fertilizantes 4 years ago. In 2021 Mosaic Fertilizantes was able to achieve its $200 million transformational EBITDA improvement target, over a year ahead of schedule.
These results highlight the decisions we've made over the last decade that have strengthened the business. Most significant has been the construction of K3, which at full capacity will be one of the largest, most efficient and automated potash mines in the world. Assuming a net investment consistent with what we discussed at our 2019 Analyst Day, at today's prices K3's payback period can be measured in months rather than years.
Also in Potash, we successfully restarted Colonsay and reached our targeted annual run rate of 1 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. Colonsay's fourth quarter cash cost averaged $85 per tonne, well below our pre-idle cost of $100 a tonne despite higher price-driven taxes and royalties.
In Brazil, our acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes in 2018 followed by the team's transformational work to improve margins has driven significant shareholder value. At the time of the transaction, pro forma EBITDA was less than $70 million. Our 2021 results show that we've been able to optimize that business through integration and transformational share gains and co-product sales.
In our Phosphate business, performance products, primarily higher-margin MicroEssentials, now account for more than 40% of the segment's finished product sales volumes. All of these decisions, combined with strong execution, put us in a position to benefit from 2021's favorable market backdrop and improve Mosaic's financial position. In 2021, Mosaic retired $450 million of long-term debt, raised the annual dividend by 50% and repurchased nearly $0.5 billion in shares. 
Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending through 2022. Global demand for grain and oilseeds remains high, while stock-to-use ratios are at the lowest point in more than a decade. Food security concerns and rising biofuel consumption are driving demand for corn and soybean as well as rice, wheat, coffee, palm oil and other agricultural commodities. These dynamics are sustaining agricultural commodity prices. 
It's the strength in crop markets combined with global industry supply constraints that have pushed fertilizer prices higher. Global supply disruptions from 2021 are expected to continue impacting the global market in 2022. In potash, sanctions against Belarus are beginning to have a profound impact on supply. Global buyers are beginning to acknowledge this, including India and China, which both signed contracts with Canpotex at $590 per tonne to ensure they have adequate supply for 2022.
In phosphates, the secular shift of China's supply away from exports towards domestic agriculture and industrial consumption is expected to outlast the short-term export ban currently in place. Over time, we believe domestic demand will drive China's phosphate exports lower as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side from chemicals and electric vehicles' lithium iron phosphate batteries.
Globally, strong demand over the last 18 months resulted in many producers delaying maintenance downtime to meet customer needs, which will have to be addressed at some point. 
On the demand side, farmer economics in most global growing regions remains constructive. Inflation and input costs are impacting profitability, but recent increases in crop prices are improving farmer economics for 2022, even if that estimated profitability remains below the 2021 record levels.
As we head into North American spring planting season, we are seeing normal buyer behavior as demand continues to reflect strong underlying crop prices. In Brazil, fertilizer shipments in 2022 appear set to equal last year's record-setting total. Grower economics are improving, thanks to rising crop prices, credit availability and a favorable exchange rate.
In India, while farmer demand remains very strong, availability is still lagging. This month, the Indian government released its initial budget for nutrient subsidies, highlighting the Indian government's willingness to respond to market condition with revisions. Given depleted Indian inventories, we see India as a source of pent-up demand, which should see phosphate and potash consumption grow in 2022.
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain very optimistic. In Potash, K3's ramp-up is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter, meaning it will reach full capacity, under budget and 2 years ahead of schedule. When combined with Belle Plaine and a full year of production from Colonsay, we expect higher production in 2022 with production costs trending lower as the year progresses.
In the first quarter, we expect sales volume of 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes, with average realized FOB prices more than $125 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter. In Phosphates, we also expect a recovery in volume in 2022 following last year's production curtailments related to sulfur shortage in the second quarter and Hurricane Ida in the third and fourth quarters. We expect to see input cost inflation in 2022, especially related to our open-market purchases of sulfur and ammonia. But in ammonia, we continue to benefit from 2/3 of our needs being met by internal production and our supply agreement with CF Industries. 
In the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes up 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes. Our expected sales volumes reflect supply chain constraints as well as low inventories at the start of the year because of Hurricane Ida. Average realized FOB prices are expected to be more than $60 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter, somewhat offset by higher input costs.
For Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformation efforts in 2022. Sustained grower demand and improved market positioning should continue to drive results. We are seeing inflation affect our cost structure but believe our transformation initiatives should offset much of the impact.
Given the direction of our business, we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022. With that in mind, it is imperative that we allocate capital wisely across our 3 strategic focus areas of capital return to shareholders, balance sheet strength, and investing in the business.
Returning capital to shareholders will be a key focus in 2022. Over the coming year, we anticipate returning most of our free cash flow, up to 75%, to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. At today's price, we believe our shares represent compelling value given the dynamics we're seeing.
To underscore this point, we will be initiating a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the coming days. After the ASR, we will have repurchased approximately $830 million against our $1 billion authorization established last August. We plan to exhaust the remaining portion of that authorization through open-market purchases. 
As a result, Mosaic's Board has approved a new $1 billion repurchase authorization, which goes into effect after the current program is completed. The ASR and our new authorization together represent about 8% of our market capitalization. Combining both authorizations represents approximately 12% of our current market cap. 
In addition to share repurchases, Mosaic's Board has also approved raising the regular annual dividend from $0.45 to $0.60 per share beginning in the second quarter. This is the third regular dividend hike in the last 12 months and reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the business.
In the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Last year, we retired $450 million, which leaves $550 million left towards our ultimate goal. This coincides with $550 million of long-term debt that matures later this year.
It is also important to note that our working capital needs tend to grow as our end markets strengthen. Because of this, we have expanded our working capital lending facilities by $375 million to help us more efficiently manage our liquidity.
Given our outlook for the year, we expect we'll also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business, even as we return the majority of our capital to shareholders. Over the last 5 years, the value created by key investments, like accelerated construction of K3, the acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes and the development and growth of MicroEssentials, speaks for itself.
Looking forward, we will continue to seek out high-returning investments, but our focus is not on large-scale greenfield projects. Rather, we believe better return can be realized in areas like enlarging our footprint in Brazil, expansion of MicroEssentials and investment in soil health and biologics.
In the last area, we are seeing very promising results. As an example, through our partnership with BioConsortia, field trials of a first-generation nitrogen fixing formulation for corn have shown promising results that we believe are as good as anything available in the market today. And we believe further development can result in a best-in-class nitrogen solution for growers in the next 2 years. We will have exclusive rights to that product when it comes to market in the Americas, China and India, key growing regions that want to reduce their nitrogen cost. This is just one example of many partnerships as we continue to explore grower solutions across biologicals and soil health. 
And we continue to do this through small, efficient investments that establish exclusive rights partnerships like with BioConsortia or give us access to entire product portfolios, as is the case with our recent investment in Plant Response, a small ag technology company that develops and commercializes plant and soil health products. 
In total, we've invested approximately $50 million over the last 2 years to build the foundation for an exciting future portfolio of value-add products that our customers are asking for. We anticipate having more to share on these investments over time. These moves emphasize our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. We will remain flexible in our approach, continuing to evaluate compelling opportunities that strengthen our business over the long term, optimize our balance sheet and return significant capital to shareholders. 
Finally, a discussion of the future of our business would be incomplete without including an update on some of the initiatives we've taken to make sure we continue to operate sustainably. Over the last year, we've made significant progress towards our ESG performance targets originally set in 2020, so much so that we've set even higher targets. In the area of carbon emissions, Mosaic has set a target of being net zero at its Florida operations by 2030 and globally by 2040. For diversity and inclusion, we've set new goals for 2030 around the issues of race, gender and community support. Our global goals ensure that our actions are purposeful, sustainable and measurable as we seek to operate our business while also helping to build a more inclusive culture where all of our employees can thrive.
With that, let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

First, the potash market was already tight before any sanctions came into place. Higher crop prices, higher demand for fertilizer globally has led to a tightness in this market that was driving higher prices before the Belarusian sanctions. The Belarusian sanctions have simply exacerbated and made the tightness more serious.
In terms of the length of the sanctions, we really don't know, and there's no obvious immediate resolution to that issue right now. Short of maybe a regime change, I can't see how that issue is going to be resolved. 
In terms of the shortfall, we believe it could be anywhere from a few million tonnes in the best-case scenario to as much as 8 million tonnes if the sanctions remain all through the year. Our base case we're working on right now is that there will be about a 4 million tonne deficit this year.
Now the best evidence for this from our perspective is not what we see, but what our buyers are saying. Our buyers are signaling that this issue could be longer-lasting than some of our producers have suggested. India and China both signed 2022 contracts at $590 for longer durations than the previous 6-month contracts. And we are hearing similar sentiment from our other global customers. They cannot get the tonnage. And if they can, there is no method to pay for it with U.S. banks.
So it's fair to assume that every producer is likely already evaluating every economic tonne that they can get out to the market, including us. But remember, in addition to maximizing and increasing tonnage, we cannot forget about the supply chain constraints. To substantially increase our logistics capability, producers will need more railcars or port capacity, and all of this takes time and capital to overcome."

Colonsay, before the shutdown, was running somewhere around 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes, and we will find the right spot for that this year. That gives us an MLP tonnage of around 9.5 million to 10 million tonnes available today. And then K-Mag, at just a little over 700,000 tonnes, takes our total to about 10.5 million tonnes of sustainable production capability.
So as we look forward, what can we do to push our capabilities? We know we have some latent capacity at Colonsay, and we're looking right now on how we can do a little extra development to put some mining panels into place that were shut down a few years ago. 
In terms of K3, the run rate of 5.5 million tonnes, we think we could run a little more than that, and that will play out as we start getting more and more mining areas running and we get the 11th miner in position. The other issue at Esterhazy, we think, we think there's some pretty good debottlenecking projects that we're already studying, and we believe some of those will lead to a little better tonnage coming out of Esterhazy. In terms of Belle Plaine, we believe it's running pretty much at its maximum right now. 
So the easy tonnages will come from debottlenecking Colonsay, getting more miners into higher-production panels, and then pushing K3 and doing the small debottlenecking projects that come at the end of a long capital project."

And we have to expect that at today's prices, it wouldn't be surprising to see China's producers try to benefit from that high-price environment. 
But we do think that annual exports are going to continue to trend lower over time. Secular domestic demand in China will pull increasingly large amounts of phosphates away from the export market. And we cannot ignore industrial uses. Battery growth and domestic fertilizers will take precedence over exports, and we expect the Chinese government will continue to force suppliers to prioritize domestic demand."

In Brazil, especially over the last few weeks as the sodium price rise, we are seeing very strong customer buying happening in the country. And in India, we expect the government is going to do, again, readjust their subsidy level in order to support their farmers' demands to phosphate and potash as they did last year. 
If there's any threat to the consumption or demand, it is probably because of lack of availability across both phosphate and potash. And the global demand is there if the tonnes are available."

In terms of our expected volumes for quarter 1, I think there's really 2 big issues we have to consider when we look at our sales volume. The first of all is actually quarter 4, where Hurricane Ida and subsequent repair events impacted at the beginning of the fourth quarter and left us with very, very low inventories entering this year, which, of course, tends to contribute to first quarter sales.
In terms of the other issue from our perspective, it's really the logistics. COVID and winter weather are having a major impact on the supply chain, including rail, ocean freight, ports and trucking logistics. The industry is seeing delays throughout the system, and that's contributing to the lower-than-historical sales volume guidance.
Just as an example, rail alone this year, we're seeing about a 20% to 30% increase in cycle time for our trains. And you can expect that to have a big impact on rev rec at the very end of the quarter. That said, we expect our annual sales to be in line with historic norms for Phosphates. Delayed shipments due to supply chain issues will resolve themselves as we come out of the winter weather and we get through this last wave of COVID. So we will see those come in the next quarter or 2. 
The thing I would emphasize is we're seeing normal buyer behavior. Yes, nutrient prices are up. The crop prices more than offset that and point to a very good year for grower profitability, even if it's a small step back from the 2021 levels. We expect crop prices to continue to incentivize farmers to apply fertilizer as they normally would."

So I think, as everyone knows, our business is highly seasonal, and we can experience pretty significant working capital changes throughout the year. And over the last couple of years, we have put in new working capital facilities to help us manage through some of that seasonal dynamic. And in the current pricing environment and the environment that we've been in and the rate of change that we've seen, that just amplifies those seasonal working capital moves.
And so more recently, we've upsized some of our working capital lines to better align our options and our tools to the needs of the business. Just to give you a sense, as we look at the second half of last year, our core working capital needs were up well over $1 billion, and majority of that was in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to 2022, I think any incremental working capital needs are likely to be dictated by the pricing environment that we see. To the extent that the pricing environment moderates and the rate of change moderates, then I think the working capital incremental needs will moderate. But if we do see a continuation of what we've seen in the last 6 months, I think we could expect to see increasing working capital requirements."

In terms of sulfur, sulfur 40%. So if sulfur price is $300, then your cost in making DAP is probably $120-ish per tonne. So you could look at that for our competitors being a total cost of up to $300 extra a tonne and for us, probably $220 or something, in that range."

And of course, when you sell gypsum, that's gyps tax you don't have to make in the future. So again, a big piece of the long-term business improvement will be those sales of co-products and particularly the sale of gypsum.
In terms of moving this business forward, you're right, there's a number of opportunities. I think there is a number of new opportunities for co-products and particularly when you look at titanium, niobium and whatnot, that is naturally in our ore and is made by our neighbors, at least our neighbors at Catalao.
The other area is distribution. And distribution, particularly as you go to the Northwest part of the country, so Northwest part of Mato Grosso and heading into what we call the [ Mato Pito ] states, which are the northern states south of the Amazon but in the western side of the country. We believe the distribution opportunity there is high. We are looking very seriously about how we can get a bigger piece of that, how we can participate more in that.

Vincent, I think you referred to the gap between India and the rest of the world.
And with the crop prices rallied in Brazil, over the last few weeks, we saw the Brazilian players also stepped into the market. After yesterday, the gap between Brazil on phosphate to India are very close. So we saw the price of MAP in Brazil already reach over to $900 per tonne.
And similarly to NOLA, we saw some seasonal price lows. And over the last 2 weeks, that price has rebounded, and we saw the shrinking of the price gap between NOLA in India as well. Overall, we see a pretty much strong demand supported by the farm economics and also pent-up demand in India, and in the case of China as well. We see the fundamental of the phosphate market is going to continue to be tight, and the price level is going to stay at an elevated level."

Look, I think India -- this becomes more than a simple problem for a country like India with 700 [ million ] people living in basic poverty and relying on the agricultural economy. The Modi government needs to be responsive to those people. So they have a tight balance to keep food security and food affordability for their population and also keep their farmers able to be profitable so that they keep farming. So our expectation is that India will continue to thread that -- or walk that tight rope as best they can.
So they will have to respond to global pricing. They will have to make sure they get the fertilizer they need. And we're seeing that right now. I mean with the fast settlement of their potash and the -- at $590. They were the first to settle with Canpotex quite early, and I think that reflects the pent-up demand that they need to make sure it gets out to their farmers.
And then we just talked about their willingness to pay $930 or $920 for phosphates. So we're seeing the buyer response. We know the government will have to either help with food subsidies or with fertilizer subsidies to keep that balance. And I know when it comes down to food securities, they're going to do what they have to do to make sure that works. And that's long term and short term."

And then maybe a second question, probably more for Clint. Mosaic is a very complicated business. It's across multiple geographies and product lines. And I mean it can be difficult sometimes to model out some of the variabilities around the quarters and even maybe for the year. Is there any thought on providing some more specific guidance, such as maybe including Fertilizantes in the kind of quarterly outlook guidance or maybe even cutting to like a specific EBITDA line?"

Let me start with Fertilizantes and the cost structure at Fertilizantes. There's a lot of factors, I think, that are impacting Fertilizantes right now. I mean the first of it, as you mentioned, is inflation. And if you look at U.S. dollars, it's probably easier to see where that's been not as severe as what it might look like.
But Brazil is probably seeing, in industrial inflation, somewhere in that 15% to 20% this year. And that's having a real day-to-day impact on cost structures. The other thing that has hurt Brazil in the last while, of course, is COVID. It has made it a lot more difficult to do mechanical or maintenance turnarounds. It's made getting supply chain people in place, et cetera, et cetera. So there's maintenance that takes longer, just a lot of little niggly things that come with the people problems and the COVID problems. And then there's, of course, supply chain issues getting materials, and when you get materials, they're more expensive.
So all of those things are impacting. We think that long-term U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar to Brazilian reals will be offset with the inflation rates. So in other words, if the inflation keeps higher than U.S., it will probably be equalized by exchange rates. And the other issues should go away with COVID and whatnot as things sort of return to more normal."

And with continued high levels of global fertilizer demand and ongoing tight supplies in both potash and phosphates, we expect another year of very strong value creation in 2022.

Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings discussion.

I will provide some additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in 2021 with total EBITDA for the year of $3.6 billion, our highest total since Mosaic listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Adjusted earnings per share was $5.04, the highest since 2011. Our results were a reflection of strong performance across all of our segments.
Phosphate segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion, over 200% higher than the segment's total in 2020, reflecting strong pricing and growth in MicroEssentials, which more than offset the production impacts of Hurricane Ida. Potash segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion, up 78% from the prior year, as pricing, increased output from K3 and the restart of Colonsay largely mitigated the closure at K1 and K2.
In Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated adjusted EBITDA of $821 million, up 74% from the prior year as the team capitalized on strong demand, a trend that we expected and drove our decision to acquire Fertilizantes 4 years ago. In 2021 Mosaic Fertilizantes was able to achieve its $200 million transformational EBITDA improvement target, over a year ahead of schedule.
These results highlight the decisions we've made over the last decade that have strengthened the business. Most significant has been the construction of K3, which at full capacity will be one of the largest, most efficient and automated potash mines in the world. Assuming a net investment consistent with what we discussed at our 2019 Analyst Day, at today's prices K3's payback period can be measured in months rather than years.
Also in Potash, we successfully restarted Colonsay and reached our targeted annual run rate of 1 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. Colonsay's fourth quarter cash cost averaged $85 per tonne, well below our pre-idle cost of $100 a tonne despite higher price-driven taxes and royalties.
In Brazil, our acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes in 2018 followed by the team's transformational work to improve margins has driven significant shareholder value. At the time of the transaction, pro forma EBITDA was less than $70 million. Our 2021 results show that we've been able to optimize that business through integration and transformational share gains and co-product sales.
In our Phosphate business, performance products, primarily higher-margin MicroEssentials, now account for more than 40% of the segment's finished product sales volumes. All of these decisions, combined with strong execution, put us in a position to benefit from 2021's favorable market backdrop and improve Mosaic's financial position. In 2021, Mosaic retired $450 million of long-term debt, raised the annual dividend by 50% and repurchased nearly $0.5 billion in shares. 
Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending through 2022. Global demand for grain and oilseeds remains high, while stock-to-use ratios are at the lowest point in more than a decade. Food security concerns and rising biofuel consumption are driving demand for corn and soybean as well as rice, wheat, coffee, palm oil and other agricultural commodities. These dynamics are sustaining agricultural commodity prices. 
It's the strength in crop markets combined with global industry supply constraints that have pushed fertilizer prices higher. Global supply disruptions from 2021 are expected to continue impacting the global market in 2022. In potash, sanctions against Belarus are beginning to have a profound impact on supply. Global buyers are beginning to acknowledge this, including India and China, which both signed contracts with Canpotex at $590 per tonne to ensure they have adequate supply for 2022.
In phosphates, the secular shift of China's supply away from exports towards domestic agriculture and industrial consumption is expected to outlast the short-term export ban currently in place. Over time, we believe domestic demand will drive China's phosphate exports lower as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side from chemicals and electric vehicles' lithium iron phosphate batteries.
Globally, strong demand over the last 18 months resulted in many producers delaying maintenance downtime to meet customer needs, which will have to be addressed at some point. 
On the demand side, farmer economics in most global growing regions remains constructive. Inflation and input costs are impacting profitability, but recent increases in crop prices are improving farmer economics for 2022, even if that estimated profitability remains below the 2021 record levels.
As we head into North American spring planting season, we are seeing normal buyer behavior as demand continues to reflect strong underlying crop prices. In Brazil, fertilizer shipments in 2022 appear set to equal last year's record-setting total. Grower economics are improving, thanks to rising crop prices, credit availability and a favorable exchange rate.
In India, while farmer demand remains very strong, availability is still lagging. This month, the Indian government released its initial budget for nutrient subsidies, highlighting the Indian government's willingness to respond to market condition with revisions. Given depleted Indian inventories, we see India as a source of pent-up demand, which should see phosphate and potash consumption grow in 2022.
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain very optimistic. In Potash, K3's ramp-up is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter, meaning it will reach full capacity, under budget and 2 years ahead of schedule. When combined with Belle Plaine and a full year of production from Colonsay, we expect higher production in 2022 with production costs trending lower as the year progresses.
In the first quarter, we expect sales volume of 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes, with average realized FOB prices more than $125 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter. In Phosphates, we also expect a recovery in volume in 2022 following last year's production curtailments related to sulfur shortage in the second quarter and Hurricane Ida in the third and fourth quarters. We expect to see input cost inflation in 2022, especially related to our open-market purchases of sulfur and ammonia. But in ammonia, we continue to benefit from 2/3 of our needs being met by internal production and our supply agreement with CF Industries. 
In the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes up 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes. Our expected sales volumes reflect supply chain constraints as well as low inventories at the start of the year because of Hurricane Ida. Average realized FOB prices are expected to be more than $60 per tonne higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter, somewhat offset by higher input costs.
For Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformation efforts in 2022. Sustained grower demand and improved market positioning should continue to drive results. We are seeing inflation affect our cost structure but believe our transformation initiatives should offset much of the impact.
Given the direction of our business, we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022. With that in mind, it is imperative that we allocate capital wisely across our 3 strategic focus areas of capital return to shareholders, balance sheet strength, and investing in the business.
Returning capital to shareholders will be a key focus in 2022. Over the coming year, we anticipate returning most of our free cash flow, up to 75%, to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. At today's price, we believe our shares represent compelling value given the dynamics we're seeing.
To underscore this point, we will be initiating a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the coming days. After the ASR, we will have repurchased approximately $830 million against our $1 billion authorization established last August. We plan to exhaust the remaining portion of that authorization through open-market purchases. 
As a result, Mosaic's Board has approved a new $1 billion repurchase authorization, which goes into effect after the current program is completed. The ASR and our new authorization together represent about 8% of our market capitalization. Combining both authorizations represents approximately 12% of our current market cap. 
In addition to share repurchases, Mosaic's Board has also approved raising the regular annual dividend from $0.45 to $0.60 per share beginning in the second quarter. This is the third regular dividend hike in the last 12 months and reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the business.
In the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Last year, we retired $450 million, which leaves $550 million left towards our ultimate goal. This coincides with $550 million of long-term debt that matures later this year.
It is also important to note that our working capital needs tend to grow as our end markets strengthen. Because of this, we have expanded our working capital lending facilities by $375 million to help us more efficiently manage our liquidity.
Given our outlook for the year, we expect we'll also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business, even as we return the majority of our capital to shareholders. Over the last 5 years, the value created by key investments, like accelerated construction of K3, the acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes and the development and growth of MicroEssentials, speaks for itself.
Looking forward, we will continue to seek out high-returning investments, but our focus is not on large-scale greenfield projects. Rather, we believe better return can be realized in areas like enlarging our footprint in Brazil, expansion of MicroEssentials and investment in soil health and biologics.
In the last area, we are seeing very promising results. As an example, through our partnership with BioConsortia, field trials of a first-generation nitrogen fixing formulation for corn have shown promising results that we believe are as good as anything available in the market today. And we believe further development can result in a best-in-class nitrogen solution for growers in the next 2 years. We will have exclusive rights to that product when it comes to market in the Americas, China and India, key growing regions that want to reduce their nitrogen cost. This is just one example of many partnerships as we continue to explore grower solutions across biologicals and soil health. 
And we continue to do this through small, efficient investments that establish exclusive rights partnerships like with BioConsortia or give us access to entire product portfolios, as is the case with our recent investment in Plant Response, a small ag technology company that develops and commercializes plant and soil health products. 
In total, we've invested approximately $50 million over the last 2 years to build the foundation for an exciting future portfolio of value-add products that our customers are asking for. We anticipate having more to share on these investments over time. These moves emphasize our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. We will remain flexible in our approach, continuing to evaluate compelling opportunities that strengthen our business over the long term, optimize our balance sheet and return significant capital to shareholders. 
Finally, a discussion of the future of our business would be incomplete without including an update on some of the initiatives we've taken to make sure we continue to operate sustainably. Over the last year, we've made significant progress towards our ESG performance targets originally set in 2020, so much so that we've set even higher targets. In the area of carbon emissions, Mosaic has set a target of being net zero at its Florida operations by 2030 and globally by 2040.

Before we open the lines for the live Q&A, we're going to address some of the most common questions we received last night after our materials were released.

Our first question is on the issue of the potash market in Belarus. How should investors think about the impact of sanctions on the global market?"
890498,1771396810,2511983,"The Mosaic Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2022",2022-02-23,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thank you.

First, the potash market was already tight before any sanctions came into place. Higher crop prices, higher demand for fertilizer globally has led to a tightness in this market that was driving higher prices before the Belarusian sanctions. The Belarusian sanctions have simply exacerbated and made the tightness more serious.
In terms of the length of the sanctions, we really don't know, and there's no obvious immediate resolution to that issue right now. Short of maybe a regime change, I can't see how that issue is going to be resolved. 
In terms of the shortfall, we believe it could be anywhere from a few million tonnes in the best-case scenario to as much as 8 million tonnes if the sanctions remain all through the year. Our base case we're working on right now is that there will be about a 4 million tonne deficit this year.
Now the best evidence for this from our perspective is not what we see, but what our buyers are saying. Our buyers are signaling that this issue could be longer-lasting than some of our producers have suggested. India and China both signed 2022 contracts at $590 for longer durations than the previous 6-month contracts. And we are hearing similar sentiment from our other global customers. They cannot get the tonnage. And if they can, there is no method to pay for it with U.S. banks.
So it's fair to assume that every producer is likely already evaluating every economic tonne that they can get out to the market, including us. But remember, in addition to maximizing and increasing tonnage, we cannot forget about the supply chain constraints. To substantially increase our logistics capability, producers will need more railcars or port capacity, and all of this takes time and capital to overcome."

Before the sanctions, Mosaic's targeted run rate by the end of the first quarter was about 10.5 million tonnes. And let me just quickly give you the breakup of that. Esterhazy in its existing form, we believe, can run a consistent, sustainable 5.5 million tonnes; Belle Plaine, around 3 million tonnes. Colonsay, before the shutdown, was running somewhere around 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes, and we will find the right spot for that this year. That gives us an MLP tonnage of around 9.5 million to 10 million tonnes available today. And then K-Mag, at just a little over 700,000 tonnes, takes our total to about 10.5 million tonnes of sustainable production capability.
So as we look forward, what can we do to push our capabilities? We know we have some latent capacity at Colonsay, and we're looking right now on how we can do a little extra development to put some mining panels into place that were shut down a few years ago. 
In terms of K3, the run rate of 5.5 million tonnes, we think we could run a little more than that, and that will play out as we start getting more and more mining areas running and we get the 11th miner in position. The other issue at Esterhazy, we think, we think there's some pretty good debottlenecking projects that we're already studying, and we believe some of those will lead to a little better tonnage coming out of Esterhazy. In terms of Belle Plaine, we believe it's running pretty much at its maximum right now. 
So the easy tonnages will come from debottlenecking Colonsay, getting more miners into higher-production panels, and then pushing K3 and doing the small debottlenecking projects that come at the end of a long capital project."

And we have to expect that at today's prices, it wouldn't be surprising to see China's producers try to benefit from that high-price environment. 
But we do think that annual exports are going to continue to trend lower over time. Secular domestic demand in China will pull increasingly large amounts of phosphates away from the export market. And we cannot ignore industrial uses. Battery growth and domestic fertilizers will take precedence over exports, and we expect the Chinese government will continue to force suppliers to prioritize domestic demand."

And in India, we expect the government is going to do, again, readjust their subsidy level in order to support their farmers' demands to phosphate and potash as they did last year. 
If there's any threat to the consumption or demand, it is probably because of lack of availability across both phosphate and potash. And the global demand is there if the tonnes are available."

In terms of our expected volumes for quarter 1, I think there's really 2 big issues we have to consider when we look at our sales volume. The first of all is actually quarter 4, where Hurricane Ida and subsequent repair events impacted at the beginning of the fourth quarter and left us with very, very low inventories entering this year, which, of course, tends to contribute to first quarter sales.
In terms of the other issue from our perspective, it's really the logistics. COVID and winter weather are having a major impact on the supply chain, including rail, ocean freight, ports and trucking logistics. The industry is seeing delays throughout the system, and that's contributing to the lower-than-historical sales volume guidance.
Just as an example, rail alone this year, we're seeing about a 20% to 30% increase in cycle time for our trains. And you can expect that to have a big impact on rev rec at the very end of the quarter. That said, we expect our annual sales to be in line with historic norms for Phosphates. Delayed shipments due to supply chain issues will resolve themselves as we come out of the winter weather and we get through this last wave of COVID. So we will see those come in the next quarter or 2. 
The thing I would emphasize is we're seeing normal buyer behavior. Yes, nutrient prices are up. The crop prices more than offset that and point to a very good year for grower profitability, even if it's a small step back from the 2021 levels. We expect crop prices to continue to incentivize farmers to apply fertilizer as they normally would."

So I think, as everyone knows, our business is highly seasonal, and we can experience pretty significant working capital changes throughout the year. And over the last couple of years, we have put in new working capital facilities to help us manage through some of that seasonal dynamic. And in the current pricing environment and the environment that we've been in and the rate of change that we've seen, that just amplifies those seasonal working capital moves.
And so more recently, we've upsized some of our working capital lines to better align our options and our tools to the needs of the business. Just to give you a sense, as we look at the second half of last year, our core working capital needs were up well over $1 billion, and majority of that was in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to 2022, I think any incremental working capital needs are likely to be dictated by the pricing environment that we see. To the extent that the pricing environment moderates and the rate of change moderates, then I think the working capital incremental needs will moderate. But if we do see a continuation of what we've seen in the last 6 months, I think we could expect to see increasing working capital requirements."

Now recognize our costs are significantly lower than that because 2/3 of ours is on a natural gas basis. So for our competitors, call it, $250 per tonne. For us, probably more in half that range would be the right number.
In terms of sulfur, sulfur 40%. So if sulfur price is $300, then your cost in making DAP is probably $120-ish per tonne. So you could look at that for our competitors being a total cost of up to $300 extra a tonne and for us, probably $220 or something, in that range."

And then maybe a higher-level question on Fertilizantes is where do you think you can take that business from here? Is the opportunity in expanding your domestic production there? Or being able to increase more imports with port expansions? Where do you see the most opportunity in Fertilizantes?"

The majority of the co-product sales is likely the sale of gypsum, but there's a number of co-products, whether they be produced from some of our wastewater streams or whatever. But we sold last year, I think, over $400 million of co-products, with pretty healthy margin because the cost of these, of course, is very low. So we feel that's a pretty attractive place.
And of course, when you sell gypsum, that's gyps tax you don't have to make in the future. So again, a big piece of the long-term business improvement will be those sales of co-products and particularly the sale of gypsum.
In terms of moving this business forward, you're right, there's a number of opportunities. I think there is a number of new opportunities for co-products and particularly when you look at titanium, niobium and whatnot, that is naturally in our ore and is made by our neighbors, at least our neighbors at Catalao.
The other area is distribution. And distribution, particularly as you go to the Northwest part of the country, so Northwest part of Mato Grosso and heading into what we call the [ Mato Pito ] states, which are the northern states south of the Amazon but in the western side of the country. We believe the distribution opportunity there is high. We are looking very seriously about how we can get a bigger piece of that, how we can participate more in that. So distribution, one area; co-products, new products; and of course, if we can debottleneck or improve our existing operations, that's another great area for taking advantage of what is a great market."

And with the crop prices rallied in Brazil, over the last few weeks, we saw the Brazilian players also stepped into the market. After yesterday, the gap between Brazil on phosphate to India are very close. So we saw the price of MAP in Brazil already reach over to $900 per tonne.
And similarly to NOLA, we saw some seasonal price lows. And over the last 2 weeks, that price has rebounded, and we saw the shrinking of the price gap between NOLA in India as well. Overall, we see a pretty much strong demand supported by the farm economics and also pent-up demand in India, and in the case of China as well.

Look, I think India -- this becomes more than a simple problem for a country like India with 700 [ million ] people living in basic poverty and relying on the agricultural economy. The Modi government needs to be responsive to those people. So they have a tight balance to keep food security and food affordability for their population and also keep their farmers able to be profitable so that they keep farming. So our expectation is that India will continue to thread that -- or walk that tight rope as best they can.
So they will have to respond to global pricing. They will have to make sure they get the fertilizer they need. And we're seeing that right now. I mean with the fast settlement of their potash and the -- at $590. They were the first to settle with Canpotex quite early, and I think that reflects the pent-up demand that they need to make sure it gets out to their farmers.
And then we just talked about their willingness to pay $930 or $920 for phosphates. So we're seeing the buyer response. We know the government will have to either help with food subsidies or with fertilizer subsidies to keep that balance. And I know when it comes down to food securities, they're going to do what they have to do to make sure that works. And that's long term and short term."

Let me start with Fertilizantes and the cost structure at Fertilizantes. There's a lot of factors, I think, that are impacting Fertilizantes right now. I mean the first of it, as you mentioned, is inflation. And if you look at U.S. dollars, it's probably easier to see where that's been not as severe as what it might look like.
But Brazil is probably seeing, in industrial inflation, somewhere in that 15% to 20% this year. And that's having a real day-to-day impact on cost structures. The other thing that has hurt Brazil in the last while, of course, is COVID. It has made it a lot more difficult to do mechanical or maintenance turnarounds. It's made getting supply chain people in place, et cetera, et cetera. So there's maintenance that takes longer, just a lot of little niggly things that come with the people problems and the COVID problems. And then there's, of course, supply chain issues getting materials, and when you get materials, they're more expensive.
So all of those things are impacting. We think that long-term U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar to Brazilian reals will be offset with the inflation rates. So in other words, if the inflation keeps higher than U.S., it will probably be equalized by exchange rates. And the other issues should go away with COVID and whatnot as things sort of return to more normal."

And with continued high levels of global fertilizer demand and ongoing tight supplies in both potash and phosphates, we expect another year of very strong value creation in 2022.

Mosaic delivered first quarter net income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $3.19, adjusted EPS was $2.41, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion. Our results continue to highlight the positive evolution of our business, which reflect the contribution from Brazil, the additional production from the restart of Colonsay and the transition to K3, one of the largest and most efficient potash mines in the world. 
Phosphates segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $632 million, reflecting the impact of strong pricing, which more than offset higher input costs. Potash also benefited from higher prices as well as the transition to Esterhazy K3 and the elimination of brine inflow management costs. As a result, segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $651 million. 
In Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $233 million, as the team capitalized on a strong market environment and its inventory position, particularly towards the end of the quarter as seasonal demand began to pick up. Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength, extending well beyond 2022. The year began with a tight agricultural market and elevated prices, reflecting a 20-year low in global grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios. 
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has exacerbated the situation and push soft commodity prices even higher. Together, these 2 countries account for 16% of global grain and oilseed export market with Ukraine's planting season now at risk in the coming year, and Russian crop export potentially also being constrained. The market is grappling with the potential of reduced supply of a number of key crops, which includes wheat and corn, but also oil seeds like soybeans, sunflowers and their respective oil. 
This situation has amplified food security concerns and is resulting in protectionist government policies that will likely drive commodity prices even higher. As an example, last week, Indonesia placed a temporary ban on exports of palm oil, 1 of the most commonly used cooking oils in the world to ensure domestic supply. All of this suggests elevated crop prices are likely to persist for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. 
The strength in crop prices, combined with global fertilizer industry supply constraints have pushed nutrient prices higher. In potash, sanctions against Belarus and uncertainty over Russian exports are having an impact on supply. Global prices have pushed higher as buyers look to secure adequate volumes. The global phosphate market has also priced in uncertainty around Russian supply of both finished products and inputs like ammonia and sulfur, though we are seeing some movement of Russian phosphates today. 
In addition, China's export restrictions remain in place. While we expect an easing of China's restrictions, we believe phosphate exports will drift lower over time as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side, from chemicals and electric vehicle lithium iron phosphate batteries. 
On the demand side, we expect global shipments of potash and phosphates to be down from 2021 but the cause of this is availability, not affordability. Consumption will be forced to adjust to available supply. [
In North America, weather is indicating the possibility of a compressed application season. but growers remain incentivized to maximize yield. Today's crop prices more than offset input cost, which suggests that farmer profitability in 2022 will be at the second highest level in more than a decade. 
Similarly, grower economics have also improved in Brazil, thanks to rising soybean prices. In India,  farmer demand

Logistical constraints and winter weather impacted first quarter shipments and production, but these issues appear to be largely behind us. In addition, [indiscernible], which was down in March as rail constraints forced temporary curtailment is now back online and operating at an expanded run rate of 1.3 million tonnes over our initial target of 1 million tonnes. In the second quarter, we expect sales volumes of 2.4 million to 2.6 million tonnes. Realized prices in the second quarter are expected to be $40 to $60 per tonne, higher than realized prices in the first quarter. 
In phosphates, we expect a recovery in volumes in 2022. Raw material costs have escalated, but we are well supplied to meet our production targets. In ammonia, we continue to benefit from a significant cost advantage, thanks to our internal production at Faustina, and our supply agreement with CF Industries. In the first quarter, 80% of our ammonia needs were met by tonnes linked directly to Henry Hub [indiscernible] and shielded from the price swings in the global ammonia market. As a result, our first quarter ammonia costs were roughly half of the benchmark prices. 
In the second quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes of 1.9 million to 2.1 million tonnes. Our expected sales volumes reflect an improvement in logistics delays, somewhat offset by inventories well below historic levels. Second quarter phosphate prices on an FOB basis are expected to be $140 to $160 per tonne higher than first quarter prices. Price increases in the quarter are expected to significantly outpace the impact of higher raw material prices on our cost structure. 
For Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformational efforts over the last 2 years. Seasonal demand began picking up late in the first quarter and should continue through the softer season. We expect to benefit as potash inventories, which were built during the fourth quarter begin shipping to customers. We are seeing inflation affect our cost structure but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact. 
Given the direction of our business, we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022. Returning capital to shareholders remains a key part of our strategy. We continue to expect returning up to 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, including the $463 million returned in the first quarter of 2022. We completed the $400 million accelerated share repurchase program announced last quarter and continue to repurchase shares through our existing authorization. As a reminder, last quarter, our Board also approved a new $1 billion authorization. 
In the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Part of that target was met with the retirement of $450 million last year, and we expect to reach the finish line later this year when another $550 million of long-term debt reaches maturity. Given our outlook for the year, we expect we'll also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business. We seek out high-returning, modest investments in areas like enlarging our footprint in Brazil, expansion of MicroEssentials and investments in soil health and biologics. 
With recent disruptions to global fertilizer supply, a situation we believe could extend for some time, we are also actively exploring debottlenecking opportunities to increase our fertilizer production as quickly as possible. In potash, we've already raised Colonsay's annual run rate to 1.3 million tonnes, up from our initial restart target of 1 million tonnes, and we see a path to reach 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes in the second half of 2023 through the restart of Colonsay's second mill. 
At Esterhazy, we are exploring the debottlenecking of the mills, which could add several hundred thousand tonnes by the second half of next year. In total, these initiatives could add roughly 1.5 million tonnes of potash production by the end of 2023. The cost for all these projects is expected to be less than $100 million. 
In North American phosphates, we expect production to be roughly 1 million tonnes higher than the 2021 production total of 7.3 million tonnes. As headwinds experienced last year are addressed and our assets run at more normal rates. In Brazil, we are pushing for improved recovery from our phosphate mines and we're exploring the expansion of our quarry mine that increases production and extends its life. 
In total, when one considers our footprint in North America, our production in Brazil and our allocation of Ma'aden's finished product. By the end of 2023, we have the potential to see operating rates close to 25 million tonnes of total finished product well above our 2021 production total of 19.7 million tonnes. 
We take our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs very seriously. We believe the geopolitical issues that have impacted global supply during the first quarter will not be reversed anytime soon. As a result, we are pulling every lever we have to efficiently raise our production rates to help offset the supply shortages from other sources in ways that also creates value for shareholders. 
With that, let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

Their absence is nearly impossible to replace, and today's prices reflect that. Belarus remains sanctioned and our previous assumption of those tonnes coming back midyear appears optimistic as most or all of their exports will be curtailed due to logistics. 
Russia is another factor following the invasion of Ukraine. While some tonnes are making it to market, the Swiss system expulsion makes shipment and transactions difficult. We expect that some buyers, especially in Asia and South America will try to work around the hurdles, but they can't all be overcome. Remaining producers will struggle to make up those tonnes in the near term. That's why we're pushing ahead with our debottlenecking plans and expect others to do the same. We are expecting a tight potash market to extend well beyond 2022."

In Brazil, grower appetite for fertilizers is quite strong, especially with recent crop price moves and a slightly weakening Brazilian real. In India, a good monsoon is predicted, and the government has just raised importer subsidies last week. 
If there's a threat to consumption, it's the lack of supply across both P&K, but global demand is there if the tonnes are available."

This doesn't really impact us, of course, because of our very solid supply of ammonia. What I would also say, I guess, your second part of your question was, is this been a premium for DAP, I wouldn't really expect a premium, but it probably will mean that it will be the first to sell right now.

First of all, the summer fill program, we're already seeing probably good confidence in the potash market that our buyers are coming to the table and looking for a product for summer fill. I think there with the high level of uncertainty of supply through Belarussia and Russia that there really is an understanding that there will be a very strong demand and probably tough to get products. So we're seeing people come to the market quickly for that. 
In phosphates, I think there's a little more hesitation because there's a little more uncertainty whether the Russian tonnes will get to markets and whether we'll be able to supply all of their needs.

It actually moves through our working capital in a few different spots over kind of the evolution of buying raw materials through actually delivering and receiving payment from customers. So our raw materials globally, in total, when you look at our inventory balances, depending on price environment, it can be anywhere from $200 million to $400 million. 
I think it tends to be a little bit on the high end of that right now given the pricing environment that we're in. But then as we use those raw materials that will go into inventory, but it will go into inventory, finished product at cost. And so it will migrate, obviously, into that account. 
When we sell it, though, and that's again at cost. And so it's still a relatively small number, that will really be driven by volume of finished product. But once we sell and deliver it to customers, then it goes into our receivables. And that's where you see the full price of the finished goods. And that's where you will tend to see the receivables grow pretty materially because embedded in there is also our margin on top of the cost.

The Fort Meade reserves, I think you're referring to is our South Fort Meade Eastern extension and -- this is a normal part of the ongoing development of our phosphate business. So we're constantly buying new land, bringing in new reserves to our system. And what that does is that allows this business to run sustainably for a long, long time. I'd like to say we -- I came to the company and I think we had 35 to 40 years of reserves, and I have -- we have 35 to 40 years of reserves 15 years later. So you can see where every year, we're adding new reserves. So this is a big new area, but it's not expected to increase production per se, but to extend the life of our operations and our quality rock for many years to come. 
In terms of lithium iron phosphate batteries, Jenny is right up on the supply and demand and what China has been doing particularly on that front. So I'm going to hand it over to Jenny directly."

Yes, P.J., we started to talk about the LFP production in China last year in the background of increases of electrical vehicle and also the increases of the adoption of LFP in the EV battery. And this year, for the first quarter, we are saying more than doubled EV penetration to start with. The second thing, we are seeing more than doubled adoption of LFP battery in the EV adoption. Therefore, the total LFP production in the first quarter this year has been more than doubled than the same time of last year. And it is reaching to the half of the total production in 2021. So we are seeing significant increases of LFP production, which are taking away of [indiscernible] from the fertilizer MAP DAP production. 
And lastly, I want to say from the latest issued Chinese policy which was issued on the seventh of April, the government has strictly controlled the new addition of MAP, DAP and the yellow phosphorus production capacity. So with that new restriction, we are going to foresee further reduction of fertilizer MAP DAP with the shift of the PTO to other industrial use, especially on LFP."

So overall, if you took a 90% or 85% operating factor, you're probably in that 9 million to 9.5 million tonnes of potash capacity right now and looking to move up from there as we look at increasing the Colonsay capacity to almost 2 million tonnes and Esterhazy, probably from the 5.5 million up to the 6.5 million tonnes.

Or is that sort of completely dried up? And if it's in the process of drying up, is that kind of you think the volumes are going to kind of slow further there? 
And then just sort of as a second part in that. I was just trying to think about like what's your incentive to kind of push tonnes at the moment into China and India where the pricing sort of 5 50 versus the sort of much higher net back pricing you can get in Brazil or sort of in North America? So as you kind of get any more incremental tonnes available, is there anything you can do to kind of push that into the more profitable markets given the tight supply situation?

On the first part of your question, will those contracts dry up? 
If you've been muted, I'm going to assume that was your question, Lucas. Okay. So thank you, Lucas. On the first part of the question, which is are the contracts with Russia and China, India are likely to dry up. Certainly, in China, we have not seen the Chinese renew contracts with Belarussia or Russia. So other than the product coming by rail over the Euro mountain range, which is limited in volume to about 1.5 million tonness a year, we're not seeing Russian or Belarusian tonnage come to China. 
In terms of India, we have seen phosphates make its way to India from Russia. So one would assume that the Russians will also try to move potash to India if they're looking for places where they can sell that product. 
In terms of the second piece of your question, you really only need to look at last year when the price to China and India was significantly lower than the market. And what we did was exactly what you said. We made our -- we certainly made all of our commitments to those markets. But beyond our basic commitments to the markets, any extra tonnes we move to more profitable, higher priced markets. And there are significant opportunities for that this year. Last year, India actually renegotiated some of its pricing because of that. And you could see that happening again this year in both China and India, if the prices as they are persist."

Thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings discussion.

I will provide some additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered first quarter net income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $3.19. Adjusted EPS was $2.41, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion. Our results continue to highlight the positive evolution of our business, which reflect the contribution from Brazil, the additional production from the restart of Colonsay and the transition to K3, one of the largest and most efficient potash mines in the world. 
Phosphate segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $632 million, reflecting the impact of strong pricing, which more than offset higher input costs. Potash also benefited from higher prices as well as the transition to Esterhazy K3 and the elimination of brine inflow management costs. As a result, segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $651 million. 
In Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $233 million as the team capitalized on a strong market environment and its inventory position, particularly towards the end of the quarter as seasonal demand began to pick up. Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending well beyond 2022. The year began with a tight agricultural market and elevated prices, reflecting a 20-year low in global grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios. 
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has exacerbated the situation and pushed soft commodity prices even higher. Together, these 2 countries account for 16% of global grain and oilseed export market. With Ukraine's planting season now at risk in the coming year, and Russian crop export potentially also being constrained, the market is grappling with the potential of reduced supply of a number of key crops, which includes wheat and corn, but also oilseeds like soybeans, sunflowers and their respective oil. 
This situation has amplified food security concerns and is resulting in protectionist government policies that will likely drive commodity prices even higher. As an example, last week, Indonesia placed a temporary ban on exports of palm oil, one of the most commonly used cooking oils in the world, to ensure domestic supply. All of this suggests elevated crop prices are likely to persist for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. 
The strength in crop prices, combined with global fertilizer industry supply constraints, have pushed nutrient prices higher. In potash, sanctions against Belarus and uncertainty over Russian exports are having an impact on supply. Global prices have pushed higher as buyers look to secure adequate volumes. The global phosphate market has also priced in uncertainty around Russian supply of both finished products and inputs like ammonia and sulfur, though we are seeing some movement of Russian phosphates today. 
In addition, China's export restrictions remain in place. While we expect an easing of China's restrictions, we believe phosphate exports will drift lower over time as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side, from chemicals and electric vehicle lithium iron phosphate batteries. 
On the demand side, we expect global shipments of potash and phosphates to be down from 2021, but the cause of this is availability, not affordability. Consumption will be forced to adjust to available supply.
In North America, weather is indicating the possibility of a compressed application season, but growers remain incentivized to maximize yield. Today's crop prices more than offset input cost, which suggests that farmer profitability in 2022 will be at the second highest level in more than a decade. 
Similarly, grower economics have also improved in Brazil, thanks to rising soybean prices. In India,  farmer demand for nutrients remains very strong, thanks to another good monsoon season and strong global grain prices, but availability is still lagging. In response to stronger grower demand and historically low domestic inventories, last week, the government increased fertilizer subsidies. We see this as a positive development that should help to meet some, but likely not all of India's significant pent-up demand. 
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain very optimistic. In potash, K3's ramp-up to the initially targeted 5.5 million tonnes per year is now complete. Logistical constraints and winter weather impacted first quarter shipments and production, but these issues appear to be largely behind us. 
In addition, Colonsay, which was down in March as rail constraints forced temporary curtailment, is now back online and operating at an expanded run rate of 1.3 million tonnes over our initial target of 1 million tonnes. In the second quarter, we expect sales volumes of 2.4 million to 2.6 million tonnes. Realized prices in the second quarter are expected to be $40 to $60 per tonne, higher than realized prices in the first quarter. 
In phosphates, we expect a recovery in volumes in 2022. Raw material costs have escalated, but we are well supplied to meet our production targets. In ammonia, we continue to benefit from a significant cost advantage, thanks to our internal production at Faustina and our supply agreement with CF Industries. In the first quarter, 80% of our ammonia needs were met by tonnes linked directly to Henry Hub [indiscernible] and shielded from the price swings in the global ammonia market. As a result, our first quarter ammonia costs were roughly half of the benchmark prices. 
In the second quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes of 1.9 million to 2.1 million tonnes. Our expected sales volumes reflect an improvement in logistics delays, somewhat offset by inventories well below historic levels. Second quarter phosphate prices on an FOB basis are expected to be $140 to $160 per tonne higher than first quarter prices. Price increases in the quarter are expected to significantly outpace the impact of higher raw material prices on our cost structure. 
For Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformational efforts over the last 2 years. Seasonal demand began picking up late in the first quarter and should continue through the [indiscernible] season. We expect to benefit as potash inventories, which were built during the fourth quarter, begin shipping to customers. We are seeing inflation affect our cost structure but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact. 
Given the direction of our business, we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022. Returning capital to shareholders remains a key part of our strategy. We continue to expect returning up to 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, including the $463 million returned in the first quarter of 2022. We completed the $400 million accelerated share repurchase program announced last quarter and continue to repurchase shares through our existing authorization. As a reminder, last quarter, our Board also approved a new $1 billion authorization. 
In the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Part of that target was met with the retirement of $450 million last year, and we expect to reach the finish line later this year when another $550 million of long-term debt reaches maturity. Given our outlook for the year, we expect we'll also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business. We seek out high-returning, modest investments in areas like enlarging our footprint in Brazil, expansion of MicroEssentials and investments in soil health and biologics. 
With recent disruptions to global fertilizer supply, a situation we believe could extend for some time, we are also actively exploring debottlenecking opportunities to increase our fertilizer production as quickly as possible. In potash, we've already raised Colonsay's annual run rate to 1.3 million tonnes, up from our initial restart target of 1 million tonnes, and we see a path to reach 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes in the second half of 2023 through the restart of Colonsay's second mill. 
At Esterhazy, we are exploring the debottlenecking of the mills, which could add several hundred thousand tonnes by the second half of next year. In total, these initiatives could add roughly 1.5 million tonnes of potash production by the end of 2023. The cost for all these projects is expected to be less than $100 million. 
In North American phosphates, we expect production to be roughly 1 million tonnes higher than the 2021 production total of 7.3 million tonnes as headwinds experienced last year are addressed and our assets run at more normal rates. In Brazil, we are pushing for improved recovery from our phosphate mines and we're exploring the expansion of our quarry mine that increases production and extends its life. 
In total, when one considers our footprint in North America, our production in Brazil and our allocation of Ma'aden's finished product, by the end of 2023, we have the potential to see operating rates close to 25 million tonnes of total finished product well above our 2021 production total of 19.7 million tonnes. 
We take our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs very seriously. We believe the geopolitical issues that have impacted global supply during the first quarter will not be reversed anytime soon.

Their absence is nearly impossible to replace, and today's prices reflect that. Belarus remains sanctioned and our previous assumption of those tonnes coming back midyear appears optimistic as most or all of their exports will be curtailed due to logistics. Russia is another factor following the invasion of Ukraine. While some tonnes are making it to market, the Swiss system expulsion makes shipment and transactions difficult. .
We expect that some buyers, especially in Asia and South America, will try to work around the hurdles, but they can't all be overcome. Remaining producers will struggle to make up those tonnes in the near term. That's why we're pushing ahead with our debottlenecking plans and expect others to do the same. We are expecting a tight potash market to extend well beyond 2022."

In Brazil, grower appetite for fertilizers is quite strong, especially with recent crop price moves and a slightly weakening Brazilian real. In India, a good monsoon is predicted, and the government has just raised importer subsidies last week.

What I would also say, I guess, your second part of your question was, does this mean a premium for DAP, I wouldn't really expect a premium, but it probably will mean that it will be the first to sell right now. At this stage, any fertilizer is probably pretty easy to sell. So I suspect there will be a pretty good price for TSP right now as we've seen in the market."

So what -- as we look forward, we see a fairly large gap this year. I think we've talked about 8 million tonnes of exports being lost from Belarus and around 2 million tonnes from Russia. We think the Russians will find ways to get things out by probably next year. And so in 2023, we still expect Belarusian sanctions, but we think at least the Russians will find more ways to get their product to market.

First of all, the summer fill program, we're already seeing probably good confidence in the potash market that our buyers are coming to the table and looking for a product for summer fill. I think there with the high level of uncertainty of supply through Belorussia and Russia, that there really is an understanding that there will be a very strong demand and probably tough to get products. So we're seeing people come to the market quickly for that. 
In phosphates, I think there's a little more hesitation because there's a little more uncertainty whether the Russian tonnes will get to markets and whether we'll be able to supply all of their needs. But in general, we don't see a huge discounting coming through in the summer for either product. As a matter of fact, we expect that there will be pretty strong demand, and it will be pretty tight in the U.S. going into summer and then through into fall. Jenny, any comments from you?"

It actually moves through our working capital in a few different spots over kind of the evolution of buying raw materials through actually delivering and receiving payment from customers. So our raw materials globally, in total, when you look at our inventory balances, depending on price environment, it can be anywhere from $200 million to $400 million. 
I think it tends to be a little bit on the high end of that right now given the pricing environment that we're in. But then as we use those raw materials that will go into inventory -- but it will go into inventory, finished product at cost. And so it will migrate, obviously, into that account. 
When we sell it, though, and that's again at cost, and so it's still a relatively small number, that will really be driven by volume of finished product. But once we sell and deliver it to customers, then it goes into our receivables. And that's where you see the full price of the finished goods. And that's where you will tend to see the receivables grow pretty materially because embedded in there is also our margin on top of the cost.

Therefore, the total LFP production in the first quarter this year has been more than doubled than the same time of last year. And it is reaching to the half of the total production in 2021. So we are seeing significant increases of LFP production, which are taking away of P205 from the fertilizer MAP, DAP production. 
And lastly, I want to say from the latest issued Chinese policy, which was issued on the seventh of April, the government has strictly controlled the new addition of MAP, DAP and the yellow phosphorus production capacity. So with that new restriction, we are going to foresee further reduction of fertilizer MAP, DAP with the shift of the P205 to other industrial use, especially on LFP."

So as you kind of get any more incremental tonnes available, is there anything you can do to kind of push that into the more profitable markets given the tight supply situation?

Okay. So thank you, Lucas. On the first part of the question, which is are the contracts with Russia and China, India likely to dry up, certainly, in China, we have not seen the Chinese renew contracts with Belorussia or Russia. So other than the product coming by rail over the Euro mountain range, which is limited in volume to about 1.5 million tonnes a year, we're not seeing Russian or Belarusian tonnage come to China. 
In terms of India, we have seen phosphates make its way to India from Russia. So one would assume that the Russians will also try to move potash to India if they're looking for places where they can sell that product. 
In terms of the second piece of your question, you really only need to look at last year when the price to China and India was significantly lower than the market. And what we did was exactly what you said. We made our -- we certainly made all of our commitments to those markets. But beyond our basic commitments to the markets, any extra tonnes, we move to more profitable, higher priced markets. And there are significant opportunities for that this year. Last year, India actually renegotiated some of its pricing because of that. And you could see that happening again this year in both China and India if the prices, as they are, persist."

I will provide more additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session.
Mosaic delivered second quarter net income of $1 billion and earnings per share of $2.85. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.64, and adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion. Free cash flow totaled $794 million, allowing us to return $667 million to shareholders during the second quarter, including $612 million of share repurchases, bringing the year-to-date buyback total through June 30 to over $1 billion.
We've continued to buy back shares aggressively through July because we believe our portfolio positions us to continue driving strong results and generating significant cash flow through the rest of the year and into 2023. As such, Mosaic's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to begin once the current one is exhausted later this year.
Before digging deeper into our business, let's discuss the broader agricultural markets. There are several issues threatening global food security. The war in Ukraine continues to create uncertainty around food supply from one of the world's most important crop producers. In addition, Europe and U.S. have experienced very high temperatures, while Southern Brazil is showing signs of drought conditions. And all of this is happening at a time of lower overall nutrient applications because of constrained supply.
Each of these issues alone can have a material effect on global crop production. But together, the risk to food security is significant. This suggests global stock-to-use ratios, which are already near 20-year lows, will remain under pressure. Because of this, we see a tight supply and demand scenario for global grains and oilseeds continuing through 2022 and into 2023.
As we focus on the potash and phosphate fertilizer markets, the fundamentals remain quite strong. In potash, we continue to expect Belarusian exports to be down 8 million tonnes this year. Some of that will be mitigated by incremental supply from producers like Mosaic over the next 18 months. But that will not be enough to erase the deficit that we see lasting well into 2023 at least.
In phosphates, China has continued to restrict exports as it prioritizes domestic industrial and agricultural demand. We now believe full year phosphate exports from China could be down as much as 5 million tonnes from the prior year total of 11.5 million tonnes.
Shifting focus, we believe global fertilizer demand in the first half of 2022 was down about 10% from the same period last year, which aligns with the shortfall we've seen in supply. Grower sentiment has grown more cautious. But supply constraints are supporting global prices and margins well above historical levels, a situation we believe will continue at least through the rest of the year.
North America and Brazil have been well supplied thus far in '22, but much of the rest of the world is continuing to see unfilled demand of both phosphates and potash as a result of limited supply. In North America, a compressed planting season, macroeconomic headwinds and volatile crop prices impact spring season consumption. First half applications were down from the record year in 2021 but remained in line with historic levels. Looking forward, we expect normal demand leading up to fall application.
In Brazil, we saw first half demand in line with historic levels. Channel inventories were built in country by importers driven by concerns over supply availability stemming from geopolitical events. Significant customer prepays, though, indicate farmer demand will ramp up as the [ softer ] season gets underway.
In India, we've begun to see importers enter the market and take advantage of the recent price pullback in phosphate. India's phosphate inventories are low and concerns over availability persist. Farmer demand for nutrients remains very strong, and the government continues to indicate it will ensure adequate supply for domestic consumption.
In China, port inventories of potash sit below 2 million tonnes. And in Southeast Asia, shipments of potash appear below historic levels. We see these dynamics impacting demand beyond 2022 as reduced application this year will require a catch-up in future years when supply availability improves.
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain optimistic. The investments we've made over the last decade have positioned us well for today's environment. In Brazil, our 2018 acquisition of the Fertilizantes business has driven significant shareholder value. We've seen EBITDA grow from less than $70 million in pro forma 2017 to $1.2 billion over the last 12 months. And we've completely recapitalized the business, having now bought back all of the shares issued and repaid all of the borrowing to fund that deal.
Looking forward, Mosaic Fertilizantes will continue to benefit from its market position as the country's largest producer and second-largest distributor. We are seeing inflation in our cost structure but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact. In potash, we are realizing the benefits of K3, one of the world's most efficient potash mines, and we're actively working to optimize that asset. We've reached our initial operating run rate target of 5.5 million tonnes per year at the end of the first quarter and plan to continue our optimization of the complex with the addition of 3 new underground miners over the next year, resulting in an incremental 1 million tonnes of production capacity.
At Colonsay, we've begun the process of restarting the second mill, which should expand output to 2 million tonnes per year by the second half of 2023. In phosphates, we continue to benefit from our advantaged position in ammonia, and we're now seeing an improvement in sulfur costs that should begin to flow through to our production costs later this year. We've seen prices moderate down to levels we believe are sustainable for the rest of the year. As a result, we expect our stripping margins will remain well above historic levels.
Given the outlook for our business and the free cash flow we expect to generate, capital allocation remains a key focus for us. First, we continue to invest in our business. For 2022, total capital expenditures remain unchanged at $1.3 billion. We remain open to modest, high-returning projects and small bolt-on acquisitions, especially in Brazil, but we are not interested in large-scale greenfield projects. Second, we're committed to ensuring a strong balance sheet and plan to retire $550 million of long-term debt in the second half of 2022, after which, we see no need to further deleverage.
The third pillar of our strategy is returning capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we expect that pace to continue, if not accelerate, as the year progresses. In total, we expect to return essentially 100% of our free cash flow after the commitments to the business and the balance sheet we've discussed.
Because we're approaching the end of our current authorization, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization of $2 billion that begins once we've exhausted the current authorization. At today's valuation, buying back our own shares provides better economics than any other use of cash. So we expect to take advantage of this as long as the opportunity remains. We may also consider supplementing share repurchases with special dividends over time depending on market conditions. As we've said in the past, we will not build cash on the balance sheet just for the sake of it.
Before going into Q&A, allow me to summarize. Mosaic delivered very strong results in the second quarter, and we expect favorable dynamics as we continue through the year and into 2023. We're continuing to help the world grow the food it needs by ensuring customer demands are met, and we're returning significant capital to shareholders while still investing in the business and strengthening our balance sheet.
Now with that, I would like to move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

The Belarusian and Russian exports together we expect to be down by about 12 million tonnes this year due to the effect of sanctions. Now we do expect recovery from both Russian and Belarusian exports as we move into 2023, but the world is going to need those tonnes if demand snaps back in any way over the next year.
So where do we see Russia? Probably easier to come back. They're finding ways into the market. We're seeing their tonnes, particularly in countries like Brazil, India and Central America. Belarus has had very little comeback. They are probably moving 100,000 tonnes a month through to China by rail. But other than that, we're seeing very little of Belarusian product in the market. So we expect between the 2 of them, like I said at the start, 12 million tonnes.
In phosphates, the biggest player, of course, is China in terms of export restrictions, and those have been extended into the second half of the year. Our projection for Chinese exports this year is down to 7-ish million tonnes from 11.5 million tonnes. So we're seeing a good 5 million tonne reduction of exports. And again, because of the structural changes in China, we really don't expect them to come back in a big way even after the restrictions end. So in 2023, we expect domestic ag and industrial demand to continue to restrict Chinese exports."

And what we saw was that rationing of demand meant lower use in different areas, but specifically lack of supply in some areas. So it's very regional how this played out. In North America particularly, a compressed season because of weather in the spring led to very late and very limited ability to add fertilizer to ground. So this, combined with growers being willing to mine their soil because of the higher prices, probably led to lower use in the United States and Canada.
But remember, any of this missed or curtailed application will have to be made up in the next couple of seasons. So we do expect a very robust normal fall application. Now again, caveat there being it will be late because the planting was late, so the harvest will be late. So it could cross quarters from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. But if I look at the overall second half of the year, we expect it to be very much in line with a normal year here in the United States and in Canada."

As we discuss Brazil, we have to start by understanding that 85% of fertilizer into Brazil is imported. And at the start of the year, there was a huge concern with the constrained supply over whether or not the country could get the fertilizer it needed for its planting.
To put it to a point, the Minister of Agriculture and the President of the country both travel the world to ensure that imports would be available for Brazil. As such, Brazil led pricing in the first half of the year for around the world. Now because of that, imports were up about 30% year-over-year in the first half. So as we move into the second half of the year, inventories are high. And because inventories are high, farmers believe they can defer. But ultimately, solid economics for both soybeans and second crop corn are going to drive the farmer to apply fertilizer. And when they start applying, we believe the ramp-up of buying activity will consume the inventory, and we will end the year at a normal place.
The best evidence from our perspective of this is the high prepay that we have seen in the last quarter, which indicates that the farmers are getting ready to buy, the farmers are getting ready to apply. They are just waiting for the right time."

In North America, the late spring and late planting is going to lead to a late harvest. Now that means that the second half demand, while it should be in line with expectation, could come in the fourth quarter rather than the third quarter due to this delayed harvest.
So while we expect a very normal second half, where exactly it plays out in terms of the timing is yet to be seen. In Brazil, planting for the second crop corn or the soybeans won't happen until November, December. As such, there is time for them to delay their purchases until the last minute. Now again, in Brazil, just like North America, we expect normal application in the second half of the year.
But as always, with higher prices, people are deferring the purchase as late as they can. However, good economics will mean that in both cases, we believe normal application will occur. If you do note the high range for the phosphate guidance does align with more typical sales historically, but again, we could see those slipping into the fourth quarter."

As we look at working capital, there are a number of dynamics to keep in mind. First, the overall market pricing levels and seasonality that impact our income statement also impact our balance sheet, particularly around working capital. As we've seen the pricing levels and the overall market increase over the last couple of years, that has caused an increase in our core working capital accounts of receivables, inventories and payables. So those tend to follow directionally what's happening with the overall pricing environment. And again, over the last couple of years as a result of that, we've seen the overall working capital needs of the business increase.
Now in addition to the impact of the pricing environment that we're operating in, we also have the seasonality of our business that plays out. And so you see some meaningful changes from quarter-to-quarter based on which season we're either in or entering into. First quarter, we tend to see preparation for the spring season. So we typically see inventory builds. We typically see our accruals and payables from the previous year get paid out. And then as we move into the second quarter, we tend to see receivables build. We tend to see other impacts of -- on working capital. So we can see as we move through the seasons, it certainly will play out in our working capital accounts, particularly the seasons in North America and Brazil.
Two things, I think, are good to focus on or to recall, particularly as it relates to Brazil. One is our growing distribution business in Brazil does tend to hold quite a bit of inventory, particularly as it moves into the season, and then it tends to liquidate throughout the season. So that can be a driver of some of our overall working capital. The other element of the Brazil business is around prepayments. Prepayments tend to build in the first half of the year and then reverse out in the second half of the year.
Just to give you a sense of order of magnitude, first half of this year, we saw prepayments in Brazil increase by about $830 million. Again, that's another factor that's influenced by the overall pricing environment. But again, we would expect to see the vast majority of that, if not all of it, reverse out in the back half of the year. And specifically, in the third quarter, I would expect somewhere between 50% to 75% of that number to reverse out of working capital. So again, just keep in mind, as you look at our working capital, overall pricing environment impacts it, but also the seasonality of our underlying business."

Look, let me start by saying, probably as we look at Brazil, the Northwest or Northeast kind of section of Brazil, as you go towards but not into the Amazon, obviously, it seems to be the area that's growing the fastest. It's growing probably at 10%-plus per year. We have plans to build a hub that would allow us to be more participative in that region. So as that market grows, that's one area where we would expect to expand our distribution business.
And then in the areas of production, we've got plans for optimizing our existing operations. We're looking at plans to expand and extend the life of our potash facility down there because we think it's a niche area where it can supply. So there's a number of opportunities we're looking at down there that we think are going to have very quick paybacks and relatively limited capital requirements.
In terms of the margins, clearly, producer margins are better at this type of market than distribution margins. But on the other hand, the benefit of our distribution business is that the margins stay very constant year-on-year. Where we -- what I'll say, though, not to be too explicit about our actual margin split, is that our best margins are seen for things like MicroEssentials, where we pick up the production margin in the U.S. and then both the distribution and retail margin down in Brazil. So those margins are pretty fantastic.
And then the other place where the margins are really good is our production B2B business, where we sell it through our own distribution and we capture both of those margins. So -- but overall, I think our -- right now, our -- 2/3 of our earnings are probably being driven by the production business."

But I think our overall strategy of how we buy raw materials, including ammonia -- or sorry, UAN and others for our business, because we buy those fairly carefully, I think we're going to continue making -- being well positioned in that market.
In terms of mid-cycle, though, in our original prospectus to buy the business, we talked about a $350 million a year. And I would say between the benefits of our integration and then the benefits of our changes since then, I would argue that we've probably added at least $400 million to that business.

Thanks, Vincent. Yes. As we think about capital allocation, really, our thoughts on that have been reasonably consistent, which we've made a commitment a long time to go to pay the 5 50 down to make the $1 billion of payments. But once that's done, we believe that's done. We've got a very strong balance sheet. We're comfortable.
Obviously, we have to do our capital. And that brings us down to the question you're asking, which is how are we going to distribute the rest. And as I said just earlier, we expect to give that all back to shareholders. We don't see anything more enticing than our own business right now. So we expect that certainly at these types of share prices and our types of EBITDA-to-enterprise value ratios, we think our shares are very compelling, and we'll continue to buy those.
Now if that -- if the price of our shares changes or the business changes, then we may make a decision to move towards some level of special dividends. But recognize that just says that we originally intended to have more of a balance. The special dividend would support or be in favor of the long-term holders who don't intend to sell their shares. So in some respects, I want to serve all of our shareholders. And so that might be something they would like. So that would be the reason for that.
In terms of regular dividends, we've made the decision that we would look at the regular dividend basically annually. And so our thought was we would leave that till the end of the year. But look, our share count is lower, our debt level is lower. So we have less money going out for -- on a total on a dividend basis today than we had a year ago. And obviously, we have less debt repayment to make so -- or less interest payments to make. So I think all of that would go into our dividend increases on our regular dividend plus to make sure that we're paying out what we think is reasonable for the long-term shareholder."

I don't know if that would stop people from using or make people use less phosphate. I suspect you would still try to use the right amount of the fertilizers. I know that, obviously, the optimum ratio is best but -- I guess it's like vitamins. Not having enough vitamin D wouldn't mean you wouldn't want to have enough vitamin C, if you will. So it's probably beyond my agronomic understanding to know if that would have a thing. But we're not looking at any kind of restricted sales because of others.
The one thing I will acknowledge on that, though, is if the price of nitrogen gets so high that it takes up a lot of the budget, that has historically been a problem for the other nutrients in countries like India, where they tend to overapply nitrogen. And if it takes up a disproportionate amount of their budget, they could restrict the other uses."

Look, I saw that you had asked that question in your pre-stuff, and I was thinking about it a little bit. If I look back the last couple of years, we've had a freeze in Texas that restricted sulfur use, which actually restricted our ability to run. We had Hurricane Ida, which knocked out power in Louisiana for, I think, 3 or 4 weeks, et cetera. And if I look at -- and then first quarter of this year -- so we went into the first quarter this year with low inventory in phosphates. Then we had rail restrictions -- unbelievable rail restrictions. And so while we've built up inventory, it's been very difficult to move the product and hard to -- we've been low on sulfur. Now we're high on sulfur, but it's our turnaround quarter come -- that we've just gone through.
And so now as we get there, I am hoping that there's no external factors that continue to push against our southern U.S. location, if you will, and that should be what it takes to get us back to normal. There hasn't been any big internal things that have slowed us down. It's been more of this damage from the hurricane, damage from the ice storms and then -- or not damage, sorry, restrictions from the ice storms logistics. And actually earlier, at the start of the 18, 24 months you've talked about, actually constrained because of inventory. So we had to shut down plants. But we are looking to more normal as we go forward."

In terms of Ma'aden, our second quarter equity earnings were about $34 million. Sales attributed to the business was 413,000 tonnes. So while not quite up to what it is ultimately going to hit, it's actually making a positive contribution to us, which is good; and helping us supply our Indian customers, which is also a good thing. We want to see that going to our customers around the world. So overall, I mean, they continue to have a ramp-up plan. It's certainly been slower than we would have loved to see, but that is what it is.
Having said all that, though, Ma'aden continues -- in this market, particularly, Ma'aden continues to be highly advantaged with natural gas price and they're paying in the Kingdom of [indiscernible]. That represents an unbelievable sort of structural advantage to that operation. And then the other one is a very low sulfur cost. So one would expect that Ma'aden right now would have a very low actual cost per tonne compared to the rest of the world and probably is now taking its place as the low-cost producer.
In terms of ammonia availability, our ammonia availability, I think that was the second part of your question, has been actually unrestricted. We have basically 2/3 to 75% produced between ourselves and our contract with CF and then the rest that we're buying on the open market, which we have long-term agreements and contracts that tend to make that work quite well. And I think if I look back to it, our price for ammonia was in the high-$500 range compared to a $1,200-plus on the market. So we're not only getting the ammonia we need, but we're getting it at a very advantaged price."

And again, these things take time to play out. But we had to delay and minimize a number of turnarounds, and particularly the plants that were impacted the most were probably our Shaw plant, where we had a couple of failures of equipment that was -- we had the parts sitting there, but because of restrictions that the communities put on us and others, we put off the shutdown too. I think it was supposed to be the third quarter of this year. And then we've had breakdowns of that equipment.
And in Tapira, we had a couple of issues with respect to the conveying systems and stuff. And it's just been harder to get them fixed and longer to get them fixed, particularly in Brazil. And so there's been a bit of a hangover there in Brazil from that. But again, we look like we're all ready for a strong third quarter.

And so I think that's what you're seeing in the corporate segment. We do that so that as the results of the individual segments come together for the consolidated number, we need that offset to get all the numbers right. So I think what you're seeing is an internal shipment that occurred in June. And again, that should clear out as Fertilizantes makes that sale."

Yes, Jeff, I think what you're seeing are some of the entries associated with some of the short-term financings that we have, not only inventory financing facilities that we use seasonally to finance some of our working capital, but I think some of the other entries that you may be seeing are related to some of the account receivable securitization facilities. And those are some of our working capital funding mechanisms that we use, again, through the seasons.
And one of the things, in particular, in the second quarter, is as we look at the increase in customer prepayments, particularly down in Brazil, year-to-date, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, year-to-date, that's up about $830 million. And when we look at that, that is a source of working capital financing to us. And so as that cash comes in -- and that typically lands in your cash from operations line. We use that cash to actually replace other sources of working capital financing, like our inventory financing and our AR financing.
And so as we use that basically cost -- the interest-free working capital financing from customer prepays to pay off some of those lines that were drawn earlier in the year, what you'll see is a disconnect because the prepayments are in cash from operations. Paying down some of those short-term lines are down in financing. And so what you'll see also though in the back half of the year, as those prepayments reverse out, I think you'll probably start to see a draw up of some of those lines and probably see a reversal of what you're seeing through the second quarter.
So happy to spend some more time with you and go through that in more detail off-line. But I think that's what you're seeing is some of the -- replacing external third-party financing with customer prepays as those dollars come in and that I would expect kind of those dynamics to reverse out in the back half of the year."

And at this stage, I think we're only about 25% sold and priced for the quarter. So pretty early in the piece in terms of what we expect.
So I guess the way you could look at it is prices have retreated from where we were in the second quarter slightly and moderated. And I think we're now at a stable range. So you can almost look at today's price -- if you take the cost of freight from today's published price, you'd be pretty close to where we're -- what we're going to see for orders. So I think that would be the easiest way to look at it. Certainly, I think pricing has come down a bit from quarter 2, moderated a little bit, but we expect it to stabilize about where we are and probably stay at about where spot is right now for the quarter."

I mean, I think we just put in a new reformer in Louisiana for the ammonia plant. Those over time will make a big difference in terms of the reliability, capacity of that plant.
We mentioned in Colonsay, we're going to start up the second mill, which has been idled for a couple of years. But these are all $50 million projects. I think in potash, we've got a -- well, as part of our K3 -- the final part of our K3, we'll be building a -- finishing off a compaction unit for that plant, which aligns the production with the needs for compacted product. But beyond that -- so that's sort of where our needs have stayed basically constant despite the K3 number coming down is because we are taking the opportunity to do some of these high-return projects, particularly when at these kind of margins, the payback is so short.
So whether you look at the CTV project where we're going to extend the life of the -- or intending to extend the life and increase the production of our potash unit down there or increasing production at Colonsay, improving reliability at Louisiana, all of those things we're doing, but we expect with these prices, they'll have a very good payback, and it doesn't compromise our intention to give back 100% of what remains to the shareholders."

So the appeal has gone to the U.S. Court of International Trade, and then that goes back to the International Trade Commission to say was their original ruling -- was there any -- they have to have an actual error and the ruling or something like that. And so they might refer back to the ITC to look -- we actually think that the ruling in ours was fairly substantive, and there's not that much question that the -- there was damage to our industry.
So from our perspective, we still think there's not too much risk in that -- in the whole thing. And we'll have to see, but our expectation that might get referred back to the ITC in the next 2 to 4 months, let's say. And then from what I've understood is the ITC takes quite a while to even look at that. So we won't really know any more on that for a number of months. But our belief is that the facts of each case is quite different. The timing is also quite different.

I will provide more additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered second quarter net income of $1 billion and earnings per share of $2.85. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.64, and adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion. Free cash flow totaled $794 million, allowing us to return $667 million to shareholders during the second quarter, including $612 million of share repurchases, bringing the year-to-date buyback total through June 30 to over $1 billion. 
We've continued to buy back shares aggressively through July because we believe our portfolio positions us to continue driving strong results and generating significant cash flow through the rest of the year and into 2023. As such, Mosaic's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to begin once the current one is exhausted later this year. 
Before digging deeper into our business, let's discuss the broader agricultural markets. There are several issues threatening global food security. The war in Ukraine continues to create uncertainty around food supply from one of the world's most important crop producers. In addition, Europe and U.S. have experienced very high temperatures, while Southern Brazil is showing signs of drought conditions. And all of this is happening at a time of lower overall nutrient applications because of constrained supply. 
Each of these issues alone can have a material effect on global crop production. But together, the risk to food security is significant. This suggests global stock-to-use ratios, which are already near 20-year lows, will remain under pressure. Because of this, we see a tight supply and demand scenario for global grains and oilseeds continuing through 2022 and into 2023. 
As we focus on the potash and phosphate fertilizer markets, the fundamentals remain quite strong. In potash, we continue to expect Belarusian exports to be down 8 million tonnes this year. Some of that will be mitigated by incremental supply from producers like Mosaic over the next 18 months. But that will not be enough to erase the deficit that we see lasting well into 2023 at least. 
In phosphates, China has continued to restrict exports as it prioritizes domestic industrial and agricultural demand. We now believe full year phosphate exports from China could be down as much as 5 million tonnes from the prior year total of 11.5 million tonnes. 
Shifting focus, we believe global fertilizer demand in the first half of 2022 was down about 10% from the same period last year, which aligns with the shortfall we've seen in supply. Grower sentiment has grown more cautious. But supply constraints are supporting global prices and margins well above historical levels, a situation we believe will continue at least through the rest of the year. 
North America and Brazil have been well supplied thus far in '22, but much of the rest of the world is continuing to see unfilled demand of both phosphates and potash as a result of limited supply. In North America, a compressed planting season, macroeconomic headwinds and volatile crop prices impact spring season consumption. First half applications were down from the record year in 2021 but remained in line with historic levels. Looking forward, we expect normal demand leading up to fall application. 
In Brazil, we saw first half demand in line with historic levels. Channel inventories were built in country by importers driven by concerns over supply availabilities stemming from geopolitical events. Significant customer prepays, though, indicate farmer demand will ramp up as the [ softer ] season gets underway. 
In India, we've begun to see importers enter the market and take advantage of the recent price pullback in phosphates. India's phosphate inventories are low and concerns over availability persist. Farmer demand for nutrients remains very strong, and the government continues to indicate it will ensure adequate supply for domestic consumption. 
In China, port inventories of potash sit below 2 million tonnes. And in Southeast Asia, shipments of potash appear below historic levels. We see these dynamics impacting demand beyond 2022 as reduced application this year will require a catch-up in future years when supply availability improves. 
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain optimistic. The investments we've made over the last decade have positioned us well for today's environment. In Brazil, our 2018 acquisition of the Fertilizantes business has driven significant shareholder value. We've seen EBITDA grow from less than $70 million in pro forma 2017 to $1.2 billion over the last 12 months. And we've completely recapitalized the business, having now bought back all of the shares issued and repaid all of the borrowing to fund that deal. 
Looking forward, Mosaic Fertilizantes will continue to benefit from its market position as the country's largest producer and second-largest distributor. We are seeing inflation in our cost structure but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact. In potash, we are realizing the benefits of K3, one of the world's most efficient potash mines, and we're actively working to optimize that asset. We've reached our initial operating run rate target of 5.5 million tonnes per year at the end of the first quarter and plan to continue our optimization of the complex with the addition of 3 new underground miners over the next year, resulting in an incremental 1 million tonnes of production capacity. 
At Colonsay, we've begun the process of restarting the second mill, which should expand output to 2 million tonnes per year by the second half of 2023. In phosphates, we continue to benefit from our advantaged position in ammonia, and we're now seeing an improvement in sulfur costs that should begin to flow through to our production costs later this year. We've seen prices moderate down to levels we believe are sustainable for the rest of the year. As a result, we expect our stripping margins will remain well above historic levels. 
Given the outlook for our business and the free cash flow we expect to generate, capital allocation remains a key focus for us. First, we continue to invest in our business. For 2022, total capital expenditures remain unchanged at $1.3 billion. We remain open to modest, high-returning projects and small bolt-on acquisitions, especially in Brazil, but we are not interested in large-scale greenfield projects. Second, we're committed to ensuring a strong balance sheet and plan to retire $550 million of long-term debt in the second half of 2022, after which, we see no need to further deleverage. 
The third pillar of our strategy is returning capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we expect that pace to continue, if not accelerate, as the year progresses. In total, we expect to return essentially 100% of our free cash flow after the commitments to the business and the balance sheet we've discussed. 
Because we're approaching the end of our current authorization, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization of $2 billion that begins once we've exhausted the current authorization. At today's valuation, buying back our own shares provides better economics than any other use of cash. So we expect to take advantage of this as long as the opportunity remains. We may also consider supplementing share repurchases with special dividends over time depending on market conditions. As we've said in the past, we will not build cash on the balance sheet just for the sake of it. 
Before going into Q&A, allow me to summarize. Mosaic delivered very strong results in the second quarter, and we expect favorable dynamics as we continue through the year and into 2023. We're continuing to help the world grow the food it needs by ensuring customer demands are met, and we're returning significant capital to shareholders while still investing in the business and strengthening our balance sheet. Now with that, I would like to move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

The Belarusian and Russian exports together we expect to be down by about 12 million tonnes this year due to the effect of sanctions. Now we do expect recovery from both Russian and Belarusian exports as we move into 2023, but the world is going to need those tonnes if demand snaps back in any way over the next year. 
So where do we see Russia? Probably easier to come back. They're finding ways into the market. We're seeing their tonnes, particularly in countries like Brazil, India and Central America. Belarus has had very little comeback. They are probably moving 100,000 tonnes a month through to China by rail. But other than that, we're seeing very little of Belarusian product in the market. So we expect between the 2 of them, like I said at the start, 12 million tonnes.
In phosphates, the biggest player, of course, is China in terms of export restrictions, and those have been extended into the second half of the year. Our projection for Chinese exports this year is down to 7-ish million tonnes from 11.5 million tonnes. So we're seeing a good 5 million tonne reduction of exports. And again, because of the structural changes in China, we really don't expect them to come back in a big way even after the restrictions end.
So in 2023, we expect domestic ag and industrial demand to continue to restrict Chinese exports."

And what we saw was that rationing of demand meant lower use in different areas, but specifically lack of supply in some areas. So it's very regional how this played out. In North America particularly, a compressed season because of weather in the spring led to very late and very limited ability to add fertilizer to ground. So this, combined with growers being willing to mine their soil because of the higher prices, probably led to lower use in the United States and Canada. 
But remember, any of this missed or curtailed application will have to be made up in the next couple of seasons. So we do expect a very robust normal fall application. Now again, caveat there being it will be late because the planting was late, so the harvest will be late. So it could cross quarters from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. But if I look at the overall second half of the year, we expect it to be very much in line with a normal year here in the United States and in Canada."

And at the start of the year, there was a huge concern with the constrained supply over whether or not the country could get the fertilizer it needed for its planting. 
To put it to a point, the Minister of Agriculture and the President of the country both travel the world to ensure that imports would be available for Brazil. As such, Brazil led pricing in the first half of the year for around the world. Now because of that, imports were up about 30% year-over-year in the first half. So as we move into the second half of the year, inventories are high. 
And because inventories are high, farmers believe they can defer. But ultimately, solid economics for both soybeans and second crop corn are going to drive the farmer to apply fertilizer. And when they start applying, we believe the ramp-up of buying activity will consume the inventory, and we will end the year at a normal place. 
The best evidence from our perspective of this is the high prepay that we have seen in the last quarter, which indicates that the farmers are getting ready to buy, the farmers are getting ready to apply. They are just waiting for the right time."

In North America, the late spring and late planting is going to lead to a late harvest. Now that means that the second half demand, while it should be in line with expectation, could come in the fourth quarter rather than the third quarter due to this delayed harvest. 
So while we expect a very normal second half, where exactly it plays out in terms of the timing is yet to be seen. In Brazil, planting for the second crop corn or the soybeans won't happen until November, December. As such, there is time for them to delay their purchases until the last minute. Now again, in Brazil, just like North America, we expect normal application in the second half of the year. But as always, with higher prices, people are deferring the purchase as late as they can. However, good economics will mean that in both cases, we believe normal application will occur. If you do note the high range for the phosphate guidance does align with more typical sales historically, but again, we could see those slipping into the fourth quarter."

As we look at working capital, there are a number of dynamics to keep in mind. First, the overall market pricing levels and seasonality that impact our income statement also impact our balance sheet, particularly around working capital. As we've seen the pricing levels and the overall market increase over the last couple of years, that has caused an increase in our core working capital accounts of receivables, inventories and payables. So those tend to follow directionally what's happening with the overall pricing environment. And again, over the last couple of years as a result of that, we've seen the overall working capital needs of the business increase. 
Now in addition to the impact of the pricing environment that we're operating in, we also have the seasonality of our business that plays out. And so you see some meaningful changes from quarter-to-quarter based on which season we're either in or entering into. First quarter, we tend to see preparation for the spring season. So we typically see inventory builds, we typically see our accruals and payables from the previous year get paid out. And then as we move into the second quarter, we tend to see receivables build, we tend to see other impacts of -- on working capital. So we can see as we move through the seasons, it certainly will play out in our working capital accounts, particularly the seasons in North America and Brazil. 
Two things, I think, are good to focus on or to recall, particularly as it relates to Brazil. One is our growing distribution business in Brazil does tend to hold quite a bit of inventory, particularly as it moves into the season, and then it tends to liquidate throughout the season. So that can be a driver of some of our overall working capital. The other element of the Brazil business is around prepayments. Prepayments tend to build in the first half of the year and then reverse out in the second half of the year. 
Just to give you a sense of order of magnitude, first half of this year, we saw prepayments in Brazil increase by about $830 million. Again, that's another factor that's influenced by the overall pricing environment. But again, we would expect to see the vast majority of that, if not all of it, reverse out in the back half of the year. And specifically, in the third quarter, I would expect somewhere between 50% to 75% of that number to reverse out of working capital. 
So again, just keep in mind, as you look at our working capital, overall pricing environment impacts it, but also the seasonality of our underlying business."

Look, let me start by saying, probably as we look at Brazil, the Northwest or Northeast kind of section of Brazil, as you go towards but not into the Amazon, obviously, it seems to be the area that's growing the fastest. It's growing probably at 10%-plus per year. We have plans to build a hub that would allow us to be more participative in that region. So as that market grows, that's one area where we would expect to expand our distribution business. 
And then in the areas of production, we've got plans for optimizing our existing operations. We're looking at plans to expand and extend the life of our potash facility down there because we think it's a niche area where it can supply. So there's a number of opportunities we're looking at down there that we think are going to have very quick paybacks and relatively limited capital requirements. 
In terms of the margins, clearly, producer margins are better at this type of market than distribution margins. But on the other hand, the benefit of our distribution business is that the margins stay very constant year-on-year. Where we -- what I'll say, though, not to be too explicit about our actual margin split, is that our best margins are seen for things like MicroEssentials, where we pick up the production margin in the U.S. and then both the distribution and retail margin down in Brazil. So those margins are pretty fantastic. 
And then the other place where the margins are really good is our production B2B business, where we sell it through our own distribution and we capture both of those margins. So -- but overall, I think our -- right now, our -- 2/3 of our earnings are probably being driven by the production business."

Obviously, we've had some positioning gains that have helped us. But -- and those come and go a little bit. But I think our overall strategy of how we buy raw materials, including ammonia -- or sorry, UAN and others for our business, because we buy those fairly carefully, I think we're going to continue making -- being well positioned in that market. 
In terms of mid-cycle, though, in our original prospectus to buy the business, we talked about a $350 million a year. And I would say between the benefits of our integration and then the benefits of our changes since then, I would argue that we've probably added at least $400 million to that business. And we would be likely more likely in the $700 million to $800 million per year range mid-cycle."

Thanks, Vincent. Yes.

But once that's done, we believe that's done. We've got a very strong balance sheet. We're comfortable. 
Obviously, we have to do our capital. And that brings us down to the question you're asking, which is how are we going to distribute the rest. And as I said just earlier, we expect to give that all back to shareholders. We don't see anything more enticing than our own business right now. So we expect that certainly at these types of share prices and our types of EBITDA-to-enterprise value ratios, we think our shares are very compelling, and we'll continue to buy those. 
Now if that -- if the price of our shares changes or the business changes, then we may make a decision to move towards some level of special dividends. But recognize that just says that we originally intended to have more of a balance. The special dividend would support or be in favor of the long-term holders who don't intend to sell their shares. So in some respects, I want to serve all of our shareholders. And so that might be something they would like. So that would be the reason for that. 
In terms of regular dividends, we've made the decision that we would look at the regular dividend basically annually. And so our thought was we would leave that till the end of the year. But look, our share count is lower, our debt level is lower. So we have less money going out for -- on a total on a dividend basis today than we had a year ago. And obviously, we have less debt repayment to make so -- or less interest payments to make. So I think all of that would go into our dividend increases on our regular dividend plus to make sure that we're paying out what we think is reasonable for the long-term shareholder."

Okay, I think I got your question. Yes. So I think there's no question there will be a big deficit in some markets, particularly like you say, potash will be underutilized in a lot of markets, including Asia, West Africa, Europe, probably, et cetera. And likewise, so will nitrogen. 
I don't know if that would stop people from using or make people use less phosphate. I suspect you would still try to use the right amount of the fertilizers. I know that, obviously, the optimum ratio is best but -- I guess it's like vitamins. Not having enough vitamin D wouldn't mean you wouldn't want to have enough vitamin C, if you will. So it's probably beyond my agronomic understanding to know if that would have a thing. But we're not looking at any kind of restricted sales because of others. 
The one thing I will acknowledge on that, though, is if the price of nitrogen gets so high that it takes up a lot of the budget, that has historically been a problem for the other nutrients in countries like India, where they tend to overapply nitrogen. And if it takes up a disproportionate amount of their budget, they could restrict the other uses."

We had , which knocked out power in Louisiana for, I think, 3 or 4 weeks, et cetera. And if I look at -- and then first quarter of this year -- so we went into the first quarter this year with low inventory in phosphates. Then we had rail restrictions -- unbelievable rail restrictions. And so while we've built up inventory, it's been very difficult to move the product and hard to -- we've been low on sulfur. Now we're high on sulfur, but it's our turnaround quarter come that we've just gone through. 
And so now as we get there, I am hoping that there's no external factors that continue to push against our southern U.S. location, if you will, and that should be what it takes to get us back to normal. There hasn't been any big internal things that have slowed us down. It's been more of this damage from the hurricane, damage from the ice storms and then -- or not damage, sorry, restrictions from the ice storms, logistics. And actually earlier, at the start of the 18, 24 months you've talked about, actually constrained because of inventory. So we had to shut down plants.

In terms of Ma'aden, our second quarter equity earnings were about $34 million. Sales attributed to the business was 413,000 tonnes. So while not quite up to what it is ultimately going to hit, it's actually making a positive contribution to us, which is good; and helping us supply our Indian customers, which is also a good thing. We want to see that going to our customers around the world. 
So overall, I mean, they continue to have a ramp-up plan. It's certainly been slower than we would have loved to see, but that is what it is. 
Having said all that, though, Ma'aden continues -- in this market, particularly, Ma'aden continues to be highly advantaged with natural gas price and they're paying in the Kingdom of the dollar [indiscernible] that represents an unbelievable sort of structural advantage to that operation. And then the other one is a very low sulfur cost. So one would expect that Ma'aden right now would have a very low actual cost per tonne compared to the rest of the world and probably is now taking its place as the low-cost producer. 
In terms of ammonia availability, our ammonia availability, I think that was the second part of your question, has been actually unrestricted. We have basically 2/3 to 75% produced between ourselves and our contract with CF and then the rest that we're buying on the open market, which we have long-term agreements and contracts that tend to make that work quite well. And I think if I look back to it, our price for ammonia was in the high-$500 range compared to a $1,200-plus on the market. So we're not only getting the ammonia we need, but we're getting it at a very advantaged price."

And again, these things take time to play out. But we had to delay and minimize a number of turnarounds, and particularly the plants that were impacted the most were probably our [shell] plant, where we had a couple of failures of equipment that was -- we had the parts sitting there, but because of restrictions that the communities put on us and others, we put off the shutdown too. I think it was supposed to be the third quarter of this year. And then we've had breakdowns of that equipment. 
And in Tapira, we had a couple of issues with respect to the conveying systems and stuff. And it's just been harder to get them fixed and longer to get them fixed, particularly in Brazil. And so there's been a bit of a hangover there in Brazil from that. But again, we look like we're all ready for a strong third quarter.

And so I think that's what you're seeing in the corporate segment.

We have not only inventory financing facilities that we use seasonally to finance some of our working capital, but I think some of the other entries that you may be seeing are related to some of the account receivable securitization facilities. And those are some of our working capital funding mechanisms that we use, again, through the seasons.
And one of the things, in particular, in the second quarter, is as we look at the increase in customer prepayments, particularly down in Brazil, year-to-date, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, year-to-date, that's up about $830 million. And when we look at that, that is a source of working capital financing to us. And so as that cash comes in -- and that typically lands in your cash from operations line. We use that cash to actually replace other sources of working capital financing, like our inventory financing and our AR financing.
And so as we use that basically cost -- the interest-free working capital financing from customer prepays to pay off some of those lines that were drawn earlier in the year, what you'll see is a disconnect because the prepayments are in cash from operations. Paying down some of those short-term lines are down in financing. And so what you'll see also though in the back half of the year, as those prepayments reverse out, I think you'll probably start to see a draw up of some of those lines and probably see a reversal of what you're seeing through the second quarter.
So happy to spend some more time with you and go through that in more detail off-line. But I think that's what you're seeing is some of the -- replacing external third-party financing with customer prepays as those dollars come in and that I would expect kind of those dynamics to reverse out in the back half of the year."

And we didn't mean to confuse in any way. I think the challenge is, again, same thing. It depends a little bit on when sales come in. And at this stage, I think we're only about 25% sold and priced for the quarter. So pretty early in the piece in terms of what we expect.
So I guess the way you could look at it is prices have retreated from where we were in the second quarter slightly and moderated. And I think we're now at a stable range. So you can almost look at today's price -- if you take the cost of freight from today's published price, you'd be pretty close to where we're -- what we're going to see for orders. So I think that would be the easiest way to look at it. Certainly, I think pricing has come down a bit from quarter 2, moderated a little bit, but we expect it to stabilize about where we are and probably stay at about where spot is right now for the quarter."

I mean, I think we just put in a new reformer in Louisiana for the ammonia plant. Those over time will make a big difference in terms of the reliability, capacity of that plant.
We mentioned in Colonsay, we're going to start up the second mill, which has been idled for a couple of years. But these are all $50 million projects. I think in potash, we've got a -- well, as part of our K3 -- the final part of our K3, we'll be building a -- finishing off a compaction unit for that plant, which aligns the production with the needs for compacted product. But beyond that -- so that's sort of where our needs have stayed basically constant despite the K3 number coming down is because we are taking the opportunity to do some of these high-return projects, particularly when at these kind of margins, the payback is so short.
So whether you look at the CTV project where we're going to extend the life of the -- or intending to extend the life and increase the production of our potash unit down there or increasing production at Colonsay, improving reliability at Louisiana, all of those things we're doing, but we expect with these prices, they'll have a very good payback, and it doesn't compromise our intention to give back 100% of what remains to the shareholders."

So the appeal has gone to the U.S. Court of International Trade, and then that goes back to the International Trade Commission to say was their original ruling -- was there any -- they have to have an actual error and the ruling or something like that. And so they might refer back to the ITC to look -- we actually think that the ruling in ours was fairly substantive, and there's not that much question that the -- there was damage to our industry.

Thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 earnings discussion. I hope you've had a chance to review our posted slides as well as our news release and performance data, which were made available on our website yesterday. I will provide more additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered second quarter net income of $1 billion and earnings per share of $2.85. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.64 and adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion. Free cash flow totaled $794 million, allowing us to return $667 million to shareholders during the second quarter, including $612 million of share repurchases, bringing the year-to-date buyback total through June 30 to over $1 billion. We've continued to buy back shares aggressively through July because we believe our portfolio positions us to continue driving strong results and generating significant cash flow through the rest of the year and into 2023. As such, Mosaic's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to begin once the current one is exhausted later this year. 
Before digging deeper into our business, let's discuss the broader agricultural markets. There are several issues threatening global food security. The war in Ukraine continues to create uncertainty around food supply from one of the world's most important crop producers. In addition, Europe and U.S. have experienced very high temperatures, while Southern Brazil is showing signs of drought conditions. And all of this is happening at a time of lower overall nutrient applications because of constrained supply. Each of these issues alone can have a material effect on global crop production. But together, the risk to food security is significant. This suggests global stock-to-use ratios, which are already near 20-year lows, will remain under pressure. Because of this, we see a tight supply and demand scenario for global grains and oilseeds continuing through 2022 and into 2023. 
As we focus on the potash and phosphate fertilizer markets, the fundamentals remain quite strong. In potash, we continue to expect Belarusian exports to be down 8 million tonnes this year. Some of that will be mitigated by incremental supply from producers like Mosaic over the next 18 months. But that will not be enough to erase the deficit that we see lasting well into 2023 at least. In phosphates, China has continued to restrict exports as it prioritizes domestic industrial and agricultural demand. We now believe full year phosphate exports from China could be down as much as 5 million tonnes from the prior year total of 11.5 million tonnes. 
Shifting focus, we believe global fertilizer demand in the first half of 2022 was down about 10% from the same period last year, which aligns with the shortfall we've seen in supply. Grower sentiment has grown more cautious. But supply constraints are supporting global prices and margins well above historical levels, a situation we believe will continue at least through the rest of the year. North America and Brazil have been well supplied thus far in '22, but much of the rest of the world is continuing to see unfilled demand of both phosphates and potash as a result of limited supply. 
In North America, a compressed planting season, macroeconomic headwinds and volatile crop prices impact spring season consumption. First half applications were down from the record year in 2021 but remained in line with historic levels. Looking forward, we expect normal demand leading up to fall application. In Brazil, we saw first half demand in line with historic levels. Channel inventories were built in country by importers driven by concerns over supply availabilities stemming from geopolitical events. Significant customer prepays, though, indicate farmer demand will ramp up as the softer season gets underway. 
In India, we've begun to see importers enter the market and take advantage of the recent price pullback in phosphates. India's phosphate inventories are low and concerns over availability persist. Farmer demand for nutrients remains very strong, and the government continues to indicate it will ensure adequate supply for domestic consumption. In China, port inventories of potash sit below 2 million tonnes. And in Southeast Asia, shipments of potash appear below historic levels. We see these dynamics impacting demand beyond 2022 as reduced application this year will require a catch-up in future years when supply availability improves. 
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain optimistic. The investments we've made over the last decade have positioned us well for today's environment. In Brazil, our 2018 acquisition of the Fertilizantes business has driven significant shareholder value. We've seen EBITDA grow from less than $70 million in pro forma 2017 to $1.2 billion over the last 12 months. And we've completely recapitalized the business, having now bought back all of the shares issued and repaid all of the borrowing to fund that deal. 
Looking forward, Mosaic Fertilizantes will continue to benefit from its market position as the country's largest producer and second-largest distributor. We are seeing inflation in our cost structure but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact. In potash, we are realizing the benefits of K3, one of the world's most efficient potash mines, and we're actively working to optimize that asset. We've reached our initial operating run rate target of 5.5 million tonnes per year at the end of the first quarter and plan to continue our optimization of the complex with the addition of 3 new underground miners over the next year, resulting in an incremental 1 million tonnes of production capacity. 
At Colonsay, we've begun the process of restarting the second mill, which should expand output to 2 million tonnes per year by the second half of 2023. In phosphates, we continue to benefit from our advantaged position in ammonia, and we're now seeing an improvement in sulfur costs that should begin to flow through to our production costs later this year. We've seen prices moderate down to levels we believe are sustainable for the rest of the year. As a result, we expect our stripping margins will remain well above historic levels. 
Given the outlook for our business and the free cash flow we expect to generate, capital allocation remains a key focus for us. First, we continue to invest in our business. For 2022, total capital expenditures remain unchanged at $1.3 billion. We remain open to modest, high-returning projects and small bolt-on acquisitions, especially in Brazil, but we are not interested in large-scale greenfield projects. Second, we're committed to ensuring a strong balance sheet and plan to retire $550 million of long-term debt in the second half of 2022, after which, we see no need to further deleverage. 
The third pillar of our strategy is returning capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we expect that pace to continue, if not accelerate, as the year progresses. In total, we expect to return essentially 100% of our free cash flow after the commitments to the business and the balance sheet we've discussed. 
Because we're approaching the end of our current authorization, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization of $2 billion that begins once we've exhausted the current authorization. At today's valuation, buying back our own shares provides better economics than any other use of cash. So we expect to take advantage of this as long as the opportunity remains. We may also consider supplementing share repurchases with special dividends over time depending on market conditions. As we've said in the past, we will not build cash on the balance sheet just for the sake of it. 
Before going into Q&A, allow me to summarize. Mosaic delivered very strong results in the second quarter, and we expect favorable dynamics as we continue through the year and into 2023. We're continuing to help the world grow the food it needs by ensuring customer demands are met, and we're returning significant capital to shareholders while still investing in the business and strengthening our balance sheet. 
Now with that, I would like to move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

The Belarusian and Russian exports together we expect to be down by about 12 million tonnes this year due to the effect of sanctions. Now we do expect recovery from both Russian and Belarusian exports as we move into 2023, but the world is going to need those tonnes if demand snaps back in any way over the next year. So where do we see Russia? Probably easier to come back. They're finding ways into the market. We're seeing their tonnes, particularly in countries like Brazil, India and Central America. Belarus has had very little comeback. They are probably moving 100,000 tonnes a month through to China by rail. But other than that, we're seeing very little of Belarusian product in the market. So we expect between the 2 of them, like I said at the start, 12 million tonnes.
In phosphates, the biggest player, of course, is China in terms of export restrictions, and those have been extended into the second half of the year. Our projection for Chinese exports this year is down to 7-ish million tonnes from 11.5 million tonnes. So we're seeing a good 5 million tonne reduction of exports. And again, because of the structural changes in China, we really don't expect them to come back in a big way, even after the restrictions end. So in 2023, we expect domestic ag and industrial demand to continue to restrict Chinese exports."

And what we saw was that rationing of demand meant lower use in different areas, but specifically lack of supply in some areas. So it's very regional how this played out. In North America particularly, a compressed season because of weather in the spring, led to very late and very limited ability to add fertilizer to ground. So this, combined with growers being willing to mine their soil because of the higher prices, probably led to lower use in the United States and Canada. 
But remember, any of this missed or curtailed application will have to be made up in the next couple seasons. So we do expect a very robust normal fall application. Now again, caveat there being it will be late because the planting was late, so the harvest will be late. So it could cross quarters from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. But if I look at the overall second half of the year, we expect it to be very much in line with a normal year here in the United States and in Canada."

As we discuss Brazil, we have to start by understanding that 85% of fertilizer into Brazil is imported. And at the start of the year, there was a huge concern with the constrained supply over whether or not the country could get the fertilizer it needed for its planting. To put it to a point, the Minister of Agriculture and the President of the country both traveled the world to ensure that imports would be available for Brazil. As such, Brazil led pricing in the first half of the year for around the world. Now because of that, imports were up about 30% year-over-year in the first half. 
So as we move into the second half of the year, inventories are high. And because inventories are high, farmers believe they can defer. But ultimately, solid economics for both soybeans and second crop corn are going to drive the farmer to apply fertilizer. And when they start applying, we believe the ramp-up of buying activity will consume the inventory, and we will end the year at a normal place. The best evidence from our perspective of this is the high prepay that we have seen in the last quarter, which indicates that the farmers are getting ready to buy. The farmers are getting ready to apply. They are just waiting for the right time."

In North America, the late spring and late planting is going to lead to a late harvest. Now that means that the second half demand, while it should be in line with expectation, could come in the fourth quarter rather than the third quarter due to this delayed harvest. So while we expect a very normal second half, where exactly it plays out in terms of the timing is yet to be seen. In Brazil, planting for the second crop corn or the soybeans won't happen until November, December. As such, there is time for them to delay their purchases until the last minute. Now again, in Brazil, just like North America, we expect normal application in the second half of the year. But as always, with higher prices, people are deferring the purchase as late as they can. However, good economics will mean that in both cases we believe normal application will occur. If you do note the high range for the phosphate guidance does align with more typical sales historically, but again, we could see those slipping into the fourth quarter."

As we look at working capital, there are a number of dynamics to keep in mind. First, the overall market pricing levels and seasonality that impact our income statement also impact our balance sheet, particularly around working capital. As we've seen the pricing levels and the overall market increase over the last couple of years, that has caused an increase in our core working capital accounts of receivables, inventories and payables. So those tend to follow directionally what's happening with the overall pricing environment. And again, over the last couple of years as a result of that, we've seen the overall working capital needs of the business increase. 
Now in addition to the impact of the pricing environment that we're operating in, we also have the seasonality of our business that plays out. And so you see some meaningful changes from quarter-to-quarter based on which season we're either in or entering into. First quarter, we tend to see preparation for the spring season. So we typically see inventory builds. We typically see our accruals and payables from the previous year get paid out. And then as we move into the second quarter, we tend to see receivables build. We tend to see other impacts of -- on working capital. So we can see as we move through the seasons, it certainly will play out in our working capital accounts, particularly the seasons in North America and Brazil. 
Two things, I think, are good to focus on or to recall, particularly as it relates to Brazil. One is our growing distribution business in Brazil does tend to hold quite a bit of inventory, particularly as it moves into the season, and then it tends to liquidate throughout the season. So that can be a driver of some of our overall working capital. The other element of the Brazil business is around prepayments. Prepayments tend to build in the first half of the year and then reverse out in the second half of the year. 
Just to give you a sense of order of magnitude, first half of this year, we saw prepayments in Brazil increase by about $830 million. Again, that's another factor that's influenced by the overall pricing environment. But again, we would expect to see the vast majority of that, if not all of it, reverse out in the back half of the year. And specifically in the third quarter, I would expect somewhere between 50% to 75% of that number to reverse out of working capital. So again, just keep in mind, as you look at our working capital, overall pricing environment impacts it, but also the seasonality of our underlying business."

Look, let me start by saying, probably as we look at Brazil, the Northwest or Northeast kind of section of Brazil, as you go towards but not into the Amazon, obviously, it seems to be the area that's growing the fastest. It's growing probably at 10%-plus per year. We have plans to build a hub that would allow us to be more participative in that region. So as that market grows, that's one area where we would expect to expand our distribution business. And then in the areas of production, we've got plans for optimizing our existing operations. We're looking at plans to expand and extend the life of our potash facility down there because we think it's a niche area where it can supply. So there's a number of opportunities we're looking at down there that we think are going to have very quick paybacks and relatively limited capital requirements. 
In terms of the margins, clearly, producer margins are better at this type of market than distribution margins. But on the other hand, the benefit of our distribution business is that the margins stay very constant year-on-year. Where we -- what I'll say, though, not to be too explicit about our actual margin split, is that our best margins are seen for things like MicroEssentials, where we pick up the production margin in the U.S. and then both the distribution and retail margin down in Brazil. So those margins are pretty fantastic. And then the other place where the margins are really good is our production B2B business, where we sell it through our own distribution and we capture both of those margins. So -- but overall, I think, our -- right now, our -- 2/3 of our earnings are probably being driven by the production business."

Obviously, we've had some positioning gains that have helped us. But -- and those come and go a little bit. 
But I think our overall strategy of how we buy raw materials, including ammonia -- or sorry, UAN and others for our business, because we buy those fairly carefully, I think we're going to continue being well positioned in that market. In terms of mid-cycle, though, in our original prospectus to buy the business, we talked about a $350 million a year. And I would say between the benefits of our integration and then the benefits of our changes since then, I would argue that we've probably added at least $400 million to that business.

As we think about capital allocation, really, our thoughts on that have been reasonably consistent, which we've made a commitment a long time ago to pay the $550 million down to make the $1 billion of payments. But once that's done, we believe that's done. We've got a very strong balance sheet. We're comfortable. Obviously, we have to do our capital. And that brings us down to the question you're asking, which is how are we going to distribute the rest? And I said just earlier, we expect to give that all back to shareholders. We don't see anything more enticing than our own business right now. So we expect that certainly at these types of share prices and our types of EBITDA-to-enterprise value ratios, we think our shares are very compelling, and we'll continue to buy those.
Now if that -- if the price of our shares changes or the business changes, then we may make a decision to move towards some level of special dividends. But recognize that just says that we originally intended to have more of a balance. The special dividend would support or be in favor of the long-term holders who don't intend to sell their shares. So in some respects, I want to serve all of our shareholders. And so that might be something they would like. So that would be the reason for that. 
In terms of regular dividends, we've made the decision that we would look at the regular dividend basically annually. And so our thought was we would leave that till the end of the year. But look, our share count is lower. Our debt level is lower. So we have less money going out for -- on a total on a dividend basis today than we had a year ago. And obviously, we have less debt repayment to make so -- or less interest payments to make. So I think all of that would go into our dividend increases on our regular dividend plus to make sure that we're paying out what we think is reasonable for the long-term shareholder."

I don't know if that would stop people from using or make people use less phosphate. I suspect you would still try to use the right amount of the fertilizers. I know that, obviously, the optimum ratio is best, but I guess it's like vitamins. Not having enough vitamin D wouldn't mean you wouldn't want to have enough vitamin C, if you will. 
So it's probably beyond my agronomic understanding to know if that would have a thing. But we're not looking at any kind of restricted sales because of others. The one thing I will acknowledge on that, though, is if the price of nitrogen gets so high that it takes up a lot of the budget, that has historically been a problem for the other nutrients in countries like India, where they tend to overapply nitrogen. And if it takes up a disproportionate amount of their budget, they could restrict other uses."

Look, I saw that you had asked that question in your pre-stuff, and I was thinking about it a little bit.

We had Hurricane Ida, which knocked out power in Louisiana for, I think, 3 or 4 weeks, et cetera. And if I look at -- and then first quarter of this year -- so we went into the first quarter this year with low inventory in phosphates. Then we had rail restrictions -- unbelievable rail restrictions. And so while we've built up inventory, it's been very difficult to move the product and hard to -- we've been low on sulfur. Now we're high on sulfur, but it's our turnaround quarter come that we've just gone through. 
And so now as we get there, I am hoping that there's no external factors that continue to push against our Southern U.S. location, if you will, and that should be what it takes to get us back to normal. There hasn't been any big internal things that have slowed us down. It's been more of this damage from the hurricane, damage from the ice storms and then -- or not damage, sorry, restrictions from the ice storms, logistics.

So while not quite up to what it is ultimately going to hit, it's actually making a positive contribution to us, which is good; and helping us supply our Indian customers, which is also a good thing. We want to see that going to our customers around the world. So overall, I mean, they continue to have a ramp-up plan. It's certainly been slower than we would have loved to see, but that is what it is. 
Having said all that, though, Ma'aden continues -- in this market, particularly, Ma'aden continues to be highly advantaged with natural gas price and they're paying in the Kingdom of the [ $1 per MMBtu ] that represents an unbelievable sort of structural advantage to that operation. And then the other one is a very low sulfur cost. So one would expect that Ma'aden right now would have a very low actual cost per tonne compared to the rest of the world and probably is now taking its place as the low-cost producer. 
In terms of ammonia availability, our ammonia availability, I think, that was the second part of your question, has been actually unrestricted. We have basically 2/3 to 75% produced between ourselves and our contract with CF and then the rest that we're buying on the open market, which we have long-term agreements and contracts that tend to make that work quite well. And I think if I look back to it, our price for ammonia was in the high-$500 range compared to a $1,200-plus on the market. So we're not only getting the ammonia we need, but we're getting it at a very advantaged price."

But we had to delay and minimize a number of turnarounds and particularly the plants that were impacted the most were probably our [ São ] plant, where we had a couple of failures of equipment that was -- we had the parts sitting there, but because of restrictions that the communities put on us and others, we put off the shutdown too. I think it was supposed to be the third quarter of this year. And then we've had breakdowns of that equipment. 
And in Tapira, we had a couple of issues with respect to the conveying systems and stuff. And it's just been harder to get them fixed and longer to get them fixed, particularly in Brazil.

We have not only inventory financing facilities that we use seasonally to finance some of our working capital, but I think some of the other entries that you may be seeing are related to some of the account receivable securitization facilities. And those are some of our working capital funding mechanisms that we use, again, through the seasons.
And one of the things, in particular, in the second quarter, is as we look at the increase in customer prepayments, particularly down in Brazil, year-to-date, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, year-to-date, that's up about $830 million. And when we look at that, that is a source of working capital financing to us. And so as that cash comes in -- and that typically lands in your cash from operations line. We use that cash to actually replace other sources of working capital financing, like our inventory financing and our AR financing. And so as we use that basically cost -- the interest-free working capital financing from customer prepays to pay off some of those lines that were drawn earlier in the year, what you'll see is a disconnect because the prepayments are in cash from operations. 
Paying down some of those short-term lines are down in financing. And so what you'll see also though in the back half of the year, as those prepayments reverse out, I think you'll probably start to see a draw up of some of those lines and probably see a reversal of what you're seeing through the second quarter. So happy to spend some more time with you and go through that in more detail offline. But I think that's what you're seeing is some of the -- replacing external third-party financing with customer prepays as those dollars come in and that I would expect kind of those dynamics to reverse out in the back half of the year."

So I guess the way you could look at it is prices have retreated from where we were in the second quarter slightly and moderated. And I think we're now at a stable range. So you can almost look at today's price. If you take the cost of freight from today's published price, you'd be pretty close to where we're -- what we're going to see for the quarter. So I think that would be the easiest way to look at it. Certainly, I think pricing has come down a bit from quarter 2, moderated a little bit, but we expect it to stabilize about where we are and probably stay at about where spot is right now for the quarter."

I think in potash, we've got a -- well, as part of our K3 -- the final part of our K3, we'll be building a -- finishing off a compaction unit for that plant, which aligns the production with the needs for compacted product. 
But beyond that -- so that's sort of where our needs have stayed basically constant despite the K3 number coming down is because we are taking the opportunity to do some of these high-return projects, particularly when at these kind of margins the payback is so short. So whether you look at the CTV project where we're going to extend the life of the -- or intending to extend the life and increase the production of our potash unit down there or increasing production at Colonsay, improving reliability at Louisiana, all of those things we're doing, but we expect with these prices they'll have a very good payback, and it doesn't compromise our intention to give back 100% of what remains to the shareholders."

We have had a -- the -- have had a second hearing or another hearing from the -- a judge on this case. And we'll probably know in a month or so if he will refer that back to the ITC. But one has to look at this from the perspective of what are the difference. So the appeal has gone to the U.S. Court of International Trade, and then that goes back to the International Trade Commission to say was their original ruling -- was there any -- they have to have an actual error in the ruling or something like that. And so they might refer back to the ITC to look. We actually think that the ruling in ours was fairly substantive, and there's not that much question that the -- there was damage to our industry.
So from our perspective, we still think there's not too much risk in that -- in the whole thing. And we'll have to see, but our expectation that might get referred back to the ITC in the next 2 to 4 months, let's say. And then from what I've understood is the ITC takes quite a while to even look at that. So we won't really know any more on that for a number of months. But our belief is that the facts of each case is quite different. The timing is also quite different. If you remember, we were in 2019, which was very, very -- they pushed the phosphate industry to the brink of negative margins. So a very different case, if you will. So we're quite confident."

I will provide more additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered second quarter net income of $1 billion and earnings per share of $2.85. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.64 and adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion. Free cash flow totaled $794 million, allowing us to return $667 million to shareholders during the second quarter, including $612 million of share repurchases, bringing the year-to-date buyback total through June 30 to over $1 billion. We've continued to buy back shares aggressively through July because we believe our portfolio positions us to continue driving strong results and generating significant cash flow through the rest of the year and into 2023. As such, Mosaic's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to begin once the current one is exhausted later this year. 
Before digging deeper into our business, let's discuss the broader agricultural markets. There are several issues threatening global food security. The war in Ukraine continues to create uncertainty around food supply from one of the world's most important crop producers. In addition, Europe and U.S. have experienced very high temperatures, while Southern Brazil is showing signs of drought conditions. And all of this is happening at a time of lower overall nutrient applications because of constrained supply. Each of these issues alone can have a material effect on global crop production. But together, the risk to food security is significant. This suggests global stock-to-use ratios, which are already near 20-year lows, will remain under pressure. Because of this, we see a tight supply and demand scenario for global grains and oilseeds continuing through 2022 and into 2023. 
As we focus on the potash and phosphate fertilizer markets, the fundamentals remain quite strong. In potash, we continue to expect Belarusian exports to be down 8 million tonnes this year. Some of that will be mitigated by incremental supply from producers like Mosaic over the next 18 months. But that will not be enough to erase the deficit that we see lasting well into 2023 at least. In phosphates, China has continued to restrict exports as it prioritizes domestic industrial and agricultural demand. We now believe full year phosphate exports from China could be down as much as 5 million tonnes from the prior year total of 11.5 million tonnes. 
Shifting focus, we believe global fertilizer demand in the first half of 2022 was down about 10% from the same period last year, which aligns with the shortfall we've seen in supply. Grower sentiment has grown more cautious. But supply constraints are supporting global prices and margins well above historical levels, a situation we believe will continue at least through the rest of the year. North America and Brazil have been well supplied thus far in '22, but much of the rest of the world is continuing to see unfilled demand of both phosphates and potash as a result of limited supply. 
In North America, a compressed planting season, macroeconomic headwinds and volatile crop prices impact spring season consumption. First half applications were down from the record year in 2021 but remained in line with historic levels. Looking forward, we expect normal demand leading up to fall application. In Brazil, we saw first half demand in line with historic levels. Channel inventories were built in country by importers driven by concerns over supply availabilities stemming from geopolitical events. Significant customer prepays, though, indicate farmer demand will ramp up as the softer season gets underway. 
In India, we've begun to see importers enter the market and take advantage of the recent price pullback in phosphates. India's phosphate inventories are low and concerns over availability persist. Farmer demand for nutrients remains very strong, and the government continues to indicate it will ensure adequate supply for domestic consumption. In China, port inventories of potash sit below 2 million tonnes. And in Southeast Asia, shipments of potash appear below historic levels. We see these dynamics impacting demand beyond 2022 as reduced application this year will require a catch-up in future years when supply availability improves. 
As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain optimistic. The investments we've made over the last decade have positioned us well for today's environment. In Brazil, our 2018 acquisition of the Fertilizantes business has driven significant shareholder value. We've seen EBITDA grow from less than $70 million in pro forma 2017 to $1.2 billion over the last 12 months. And we've completely recapitalized the business, having now bought back all of the shares issued and repaid all of the borrowing to fund that deal. 
Looking forward, Mosaic Fertilizantes will continue to benefit from its market position as the country's largest producer and second-largest distributor. We are seeing inflation in our cost structure but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact. In potash, we are realizing the benefits of K3, one of the world's most efficient potash mines, and we're actively working to optimize that asset. We've reached our initial operating run rate target of 5.5 million tonnes per year at the end of the first quarter and plan to continue our optimization of the complex with the addition of 3 new underground miners over the next year, resulting in an incremental 1 million tonnes of production capacity. 
At Colonsay, we've begun the process of restarting the second mill, which should expand output to 2 million tonnes per year by the second half of 2023. In phosphates, we continue to benefit from our advantaged position in ammonia, and we're now seeing an improvement in sulfur costs that should begin to flow through to our production costs later this year. We've seen prices moderate down to levels we believe are sustainable for the rest of the year. As a result, we expect our stripping margins will remain well above historic levels. 
Given the outlook for our business and the free cash flow we expect to generate, capital allocation remains a key focus for us. First, we continue to invest in our business. For 2022, total capital expenditures remain unchanged at $1.3 billion. We remain open to modest, high-returning projects and small bolt-on acquisitions, especially in Brazil, but we are not interested in large-scale greenfield projects. Second, we're committed to ensuring a strong balance sheet and plan to retire $550 million of long-term debt in the second half of 2022, after which, we see no need to further deleverage. 
The third pillar of our strategy is returning capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we expect that pace to continue, if not accelerate, as the year progresses. In total, we expect to return essentially 100% of our free cash flow after the commitments to the business and the balance sheet we've discussed. 
Because we're approaching the end of our current authorization, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization of $2 billion that begins once we've exhausted the current authorization. At today's valuation, buying back our own shares provides better economics than any other use of cash. So we expect to take advantage of this as long as the opportunity remains. We may also consider supplementing share repurchases with special dividends over time depending on market conditions. As we've said in the past, we will not build cash on the balance sheet just for the sake of it. 
Before going into Q&A, allow me to summarize. Mosaic delivered very strong results in the second quarter, and we expect favorable dynamics as we continue through the year and into 2023. We're continuing to help the world grow the food it needs by ensuring customer demands are met, and we're returning significant capital to shareholders while still investing in the business and strengthening our balance sheet. 
Now with that, I would like to move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

The Belarusian and Russian exports together we expect to be down by about 12 million tonnes this year due to the effect of sanctions. Now we do expect recovery from both Russian and Belarusian exports as we move into 2023, but the world is going to need those tonnes if demand snaps back in any way over the next year. So where do we see Russia? Probably easier to come back. They're finding ways into the market. We're seeing their tonnes, particularly in countries like Brazil, India and Central America. Belarus has had very little comeback. They are probably moving 100,000 tonnes a month through to China by rail. But other than that, we're seeing very little of Belarusian product in the market. So we expect between the 2 of them, like I said at the start, 12 million tonnes.
In phosphates, the biggest player, of course, is China in terms of export restrictions, and those have been extended into the second half of the year. Our projection for Chinese exports this year is down to 7-ish million tonnes from 11.5 million tonnes. So we're seeing a good 5 million tonne reduction of exports. And again, because of the structural changes in China, we really don't expect them to come back in a big way, even after the restrictions end. So in 2023, we expect domestic ag and industrial demand to continue to restrict Chinese exports."

And what we saw was that rationing of demand meant lower use in different areas, but specifically lack of supply in some areas. So it's very regional how this played out. In North America particularly, a compressed season because of weather in the spring, led to very late and very limited ability to add fertilizer to ground. So this, combined with growers being willing to mine their soil because of the higher prices, probably led to lower use in the United States and Canada. 
But remember, any of this missed or curtailed application will have to be made up in the next couple seasons. So we do expect a very robust normal fall application. Now again, caveat there being it will be late because the planting was late, so the harvest will be late. So it could cross quarters from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. But if I look at the overall second half of the year, we expect it to be very much in line with a normal year here in the United States and in Canada."

As we discuss Brazil, we have to start by understanding that 85% of fertilizer into Brazil is imported. And at the start of the year, there was a huge concern with the constrained supply over whether or not the country could get the fertilizer it needed for its planting. To put it to a point, the Minister of Agriculture and the President of the country both traveled the world to ensure that imports would be available for Brazil. As such, Brazil led pricing in the first half of the year for around the world. Now because of that, imports were up about 30% year-over-year in the first half. 
So as we move into the second half of the year, inventories are high. And because inventories are high, farmers believe they can defer. But ultimately, solid economics for both soybeans and second crop corn are going to drive the farmer to apply fertilizer. And when they start applying, we believe the ramp-up of buying activity will consume the inventory, and we will end the year at a normal place. The best evidence from our perspective of this is the high prepay that we have seen in the last quarter, which indicates that the farmers are getting ready to buy. The farmers are getting ready to apply. They are just waiting for the right time."

In North America, the late spring and late planting is going to lead to a late harvest. Now that means that the second half demand, while it should be in line with expectation, could come in the fourth quarter rather than the third quarter due to this delayed harvest. So while we expect a very normal second half, where exactly it plays out in terms of the timing is yet to be seen. In Brazil, planting for the second crop corn or the soybeans won't happen until November, December. As such, there is time for them to delay their purchases until the last minute. Now again, in Brazil, just like North America, we expect normal application in the second half of the year. But as always, with higher prices, people are deferring the purchase as late as they can. However, good economics will mean that in both cases we believe normal application will occur. If you do note the high range for the phosphate guidance does align with more typical sales historically, but again, we could see those slipping into the fourth quarter."

As we look at working capital, there are a number of dynamics to keep in mind. First, the overall market pricing levels and seasonality that impact our income statement also impact our balance sheet, particularly around working capital. As we've seen the pricing levels and the overall market increase over the last couple of years, that has caused an increase in our core working capital accounts of receivables, inventories and payables. So those tend to follow directionally what's happening with the overall pricing environment. And again, over the last couple of years as a result of that, we've seen the overall working capital needs of the business increase. 
Now in addition to the impact of the pricing environment that we're operating in, we also have the seasonality of our business that plays out. And so you see some meaningful changes from quarter-to-quarter based on which season we're either in or entering into. First quarter, we tend to see preparation for the spring season. So we typically see inventory builds. We typically see our accruals and payables from the previous year get paid out. And then as we move into the second quarter, we tend to see receivables build. We tend to see other impacts of -- on working capital. So we can see as we move through the seasons, it certainly will play out in our working capital accounts, particularly the seasons in North America and Brazil. 
Two things, I think, are good to focus on or to recall, particularly as it relates to Brazil. One is our growing distribution business in Brazil does tend to hold quite a bit of inventory, particularly as it moves into the season, and then it tends to liquidate throughout the season. So that can be a driver of some of our overall working capital. The other element of the Brazil business is around prepayments. Prepayments tend to build in the first half of the year and then reverse out in the second half of the year. 
Just to give you a sense of order of magnitude, first half of this year, we saw prepayments in Brazil increase by about $830 million. Again, that's another factor that's influenced by the overall pricing environment. But again, we would expect to see the vast majority of that, if not all of it, reverse out in the back half of the year. And specifically in the third quarter, I would expect somewhere between 50% to 75% of that number to reverse out of working capital. So again, just keep in mind, as you look at our working capital, overall pricing environment impacts it, but also the seasonality of our underlying business."

Look, let me start by saying, probably as we look at Brazil, the Northwest or Northeast kind of section of Brazil, as you go towards but not into the Amazon, obviously, it seems to be the area that's growing the fastest. It's growing probably at 10%-plus per year. We have plans to build a hub that would allow us to be more participative in that region. So as that market grows, that's one area where we would expect to expand our distribution business. And then in the areas of production, we've got plans for optimizing our existing operations. We're looking at plans to expand and extend the life of our potash facility down there because we think it's a niche area where it can supply. So there's a number of opportunities we're looking at down there that we think are going to have very quick paybacks and relatively limited capital requirements. 
In terms of the margins, clearly, producer margins are better at this type of market than distribution margins. But on the other hand, the benefit of our distribution business is that the margins stay very constant year-on-year. Where we -- what I'll say, though, not to be too explicit about our actual margin split, is that our best margins are seen for things like MicroEssentials, where we pick up the production margin in the U.S. and then both the distribution and retail margin down in Brazil. So those margins are pretty fantastic.

And again, without getting into too many details of exactly where those sit, but I don't think those are going to change mid-cycle a whole lot from where they are today. Obviously, we've had some positioning gains that have helped us. But -- and those come and go a little bit. 
But I think our overall strategy of how we buy raw materials, including ammonia -- or sorry, UAN and others for our business, because we buy those fairly carefully, I think we're going to continue being well positioned in that market. In terms of mid-cycle, though, in our original prospectus to buy the business, we talked about a $350 million a year. And I would say between the benefits of our integration and then the benefits of our changes since then, I would argue that we've probably added at least $400 million to that business. And we would be likely -- more likely in the $700 million to $800 million per year range mid-cycle."

I guess I got my mic backwards. Thanks, Vincent. Yes. As we think about capital allocation, really, our thoughts on that have been reasonably consistent, which we've made a commitment a long time ago to pay the $550 million down to make the $1 billion of payments. But once that's done, we believe that's done. We've got a very strong balance sheet. We're comfortable. Obviously, we have to do our capital. And that brings us down to the question you're asking, which is how are we going to distribute the rest? And I said just earlier, we expect to give that all back to shareholders. We don't see anything more enticing than our own business right now. So we expect that certainly at these types of share prices and our types of EBITDA-to-enterprise value ratios, we think our shares are very compelling, and we'll continue to buy those.
Now if that -- if the price of our shares changes or the business changes, then we may make a decision to move towards some level of special dividends. But recognize that just says that we originally intended to have more of a balance. The special dividend would support or be in favor of the long-term holders who don't intend to sell their shares. So in some respects, I want to serve all of our shareholders. And so that might be something they would like. So that would be the reason for that. 
In terms of regular dividends, we've made the decision that we would look at the regular dividend basically annually. And so our thought was we would leave that till the end of the year. But look, our share count is lower. Our debt level is lower. So we have less money going out for -- on a total on a dividend basis today than we had a year ago. And obviously, we have less debt repayment to make so -- or less interest payments to make. So I think all of that would go into our dividend increases on our regular dividend plus to make sure that we're paying out what we think is reasonable for the long-term shareholder."

I don't know if that would stop people from using or make people use less phosphate. I suspect you would still try to use the right amount of the fertilizers. I know that, obviously, the optimum ratio is best, but I guess it's like vitamins. Not having enough vitamin D wouldn't mean you wouldn't want to have enough vitamin C, if you will. 
So it's probably beyond my agronomic understanding to know if that would have a thing. But we're not looking at any kind of restricted sales because of others. The one thing I will acknowledge on that, though, is if the price of nitrogen gets so high that it takes up a lot of the budget, that has historically been a problem for the other nutrients in countries like India, where they tend to overapply nitrogen. And if it takes up a disproportionate amount of their budget, they could restrict other uses."

Then we had rail restrictions -- unbelievable rail restrictions. And so while we've built up inventory, it's been very difficult to move the product and hard to -- we've been low on sulfur. Now we're high on sulfur, but it's our turnaround quarter come that we've just gone through. 
And so now as we get there, I am hoping that there's no external factors that continue to push against our Southern U.S. location, if you will, and that should be what it takes to get us back to normal.

We want to see that going to our customers around the world. So overall, I mean, they continue to have a ramp-up plan. It's certainly been slower than we would have loved to see, but that is what it is. 
Having said all that, though, Ma'aden continues -- in this market, particularly, Ma'aden continues to be highly advantaged with natural gas price and they're paying in the Kingdom of the [ $1 per MMBtu ] that represents an unbelievable sort of structural advantage to that operation. And then the other one is a very low sulfur cost. So one would expect that Ma'aden right now would have a very low actual cost per tonne compared to the rest of the world and probably is now taking its place as the low-cost producer. 
In terms of ammonia availability, our ammonia availability, I think, that was the second part of your question, has been actually unrestricted. We have basically 2/3 to 75% produced between ourselves and our contract with CF and then the rest that we're buying on the open market, which we have long-term agreements and contracts that tend to make that work quite well.

I think it was supposed to be the third quarter of this year. And then we've had breakdowns of that equipment. 
And in Tapira, we had a couple of issues with respect to the conveying systems and stuff. And it's just been harder to get them fixed and longer to get them fixed, particularly in Brazil.

And so as we use that basically cost -- the interest-free working capital financing from customer prepays to pay off some of those lines that were drawn earlier in the year, what you'll see is a disconnect because the prepayments are in cash from operations. 
Paying down some of those short-term lines are down in financing. And so what you'll see also though in the back half of the year, as those prepayments reverse out, I think you'll probably start to see a draw up of some of those lines and probably see a reversal of what you're seeing through the second quarter. So happy to spend some more time with you and go through that in more detail offline. But I think that's what you're seeing is some of the -- replacing external third-party financing with customer prepays as those dollars come in and that I would expect kind of those dynamics to reverse out in the back half of the year."

And we didn't mean to confuse in any way. I think the challenge is, again, same thing. It depends a little bit on when sales come in. And at this stage, I think we're only about 25% sold and priced for the quarter. So pretty early in the piece in terms of what we expect.
So I guess the way you could look at it is prices have retreated from where we were in the second quarter slightly and moderated. And I think we're now at a stable range. So you can almost look at today's price. If you take the cost of freight from today's published price, you'd be pretty close to where we're -- what we're going to see for the quarter. So I think that would be the easiest way to look at it. Certainly, I think pricing has come down a bit from quarter 2, moderated a little bit, but we expect it to stabilize about where we are and probably stay at about where spot is right now for the quarter."

I mean, I think we just put in a new reformer in Louisiana for the ammonia plant. Those over time will make a big difference in terms of the reliability, capacity of that plant. We mentioned in Colonsay we're going to start up the second mill, which has been idled for a couple of years. But these are all $50 million projects. I think in potash, we've got a -- well, as part of our K3 -- the final part of our K3, we'll be building a -- finishing off a compaction unit for that plant, which aligns the production with the needs for compacted product. 
But beyond that -- so that's sort of where our needs have stayed basically constant despite the K3 number coming down is because we are taking the opportunity to do some of these high-return projects, particularly when at these kind of margins the payback is so short. So whether you look at the CTV project where we're going to extend the life of the -- or intending to extend the life and increase the production of our potash unit down there or increasing production at Colonsay, improving reliability at Louisiana, all of those things we're doing, but we expect with these prices they'll have a very good payback, and it doesn't compromise our intention to give back 100% of what remains to the shareholders."

And so they might refer back to the ITC to look. We actually think that the ruling in ours was fairly substantive, and there's not that much question that the -- there was damage to our industry.
So from our perspective, we still think there's not too much risk in that -- in the whole thing. And we'll have to see, but our expectation that might get referred back to the ITC in the next 2 to 4 months, let's say. And then from what I've understood is the ITC takes quite a while to even look at that. So we won't really know any more on that for a number of months. But our belief is that the facts of each case is quite different. The timing is also quite different.

Thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. Mosaic delivered record third quarter revenues of $5.3 billion, which resulted in net income of $842 million or earnings per share of $2.42. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22, a",1521,"Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. Mosaic delivered record third quarter revenues of $5.3 billion, which resulted in net income of $842 million or earnings per share of $2.42. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.7 billion.
These results are driving significant cash flow generation, which is allowing us to return significant capital to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the business and strengthen the balance sheet. During the quarter, we returned roughly $670 million to shareholders, including $600 million of share buybacks.
Now before diving into our operations, I'd like to address current market dynamics. Food security remains a concern around the world. Global grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios remain at 20-year lows, and early data continues to suggest there may be further downside to total production once the fall harvest is complete.
It is important to remember that the market was tight when the year began, well before the start of the war, and issues over the last several months have further exacerbated the situation. Ukraine's production shortfall is significant, but weather issues like high temperatures and drought conditions in other major growing regions are having an even bigger impact on an already tight market.
In the U.S., weather delayed spring planting, and the compressed planting window reduced nutrient applications. The growing season was further impacted by high temperatures and drought in some areas. Weather tends to be a significant factor in yield, but under-fertilization doesn't help, and you can only mine the soil for so long. Both are contributing to an expectation of weaker-than-normal North American harvest. And this was reflected in the most recent USDA yield forecast.
In Brazil, fertilizer shipments appear poised to have dropped around 10% year-over-year. And La Niña remains a threat despite the market counting on record-breaking corn and soybean production. Beyond grains and oilseeds, we're seeing food security issues play out in other crops as well. Staples like rice are also seeing significant production shortages, driving some countries like India to restrict exports.
Because of this, we see a tight market for global grains and oilseeds continuing into 2023 and beyond. The global fertilizer market remains tight with supply constraints in both potash and phosphate still unresolved. Global potash supply remains impacted by the significant reduction in Belarusian exports, which we think will be down 8 million tonnes in 2022. Of the 4 million tonnes they will export this year, we estimate about 2 million tonnes were shipped in the first quarter before the sanctions and Lithuania's decision to prevent Belarus from using its ports.
Belarus exports are down significantly from the first quarter, and we do not expect much recovery through the rest of the year or for most of 2023. This means the market will continue to be short of potash in 2023. The phosphate market is also impacted by supply constraints. China production is down because of environmental concerns, and exports are being restricted to ensure domestic availability and affordability.
This year, we expect China's phosphate exports will be down by up to 5 million tonnes. Those restrictions could extend through at least the first half of 2023 and possibly beyond as China prioritizes securing domestic food supply and meeting growing industrial demand.
While global channel inventories of phosphate and potash remain below historic norms, certain regions, especially in the areas where we do most of our business, saw inventories build in the first half of the year. But prices have retreated back to levels low enough to entice growers to step back into the market. We expect inventories to continue working lower through the end of the year and into early 2023.
U.S. fall application has been trending back towards normal levels. We believe we could end the season with inventory significantly depleted, especially for phosphates. The U.S. is also experiencing low water levels on the Mississippi River, which is delaying supply coming through New Orleans.
In Brazil, the higher-priced inventory built during the first half of the year has slowed third quarter shipments. But sentiment is improving. Prices have retreated enough to encourage sales, and we expect inventories will end the year much the same as where they started. The barter ratio suggests we're approaching a much more constructive environment for demand.
In India, importers are taking advantage of the price pullback in phosphates. India's phosphates inventory is still low, while farmer demand remains strong. Government subsidies remain at a level that is supportive of phosphate imports but are likely to leave the country short of adequate supply of potash.
To summarize, the strength of crop prices and more affordable fertilizer prices suggest nutrient demand will recover from the summer lull we experienced during the third quarter. Given the constructive ag backdrop, we believe our business is well positioned to benefit.
In our phosphates business, Hurricane Ian forced us to shut down operations late in the third quarter, which delayed shipments at the end of September. Our team performed admirably and was able to get our Florida operations back up and running quickly following the hurricane. We estimate the shortfall in production to be in the range of 200,000 tonnes.
Looking forward, we now expect fourth quarter sales to be in the range of 1.7 million to 2 million tonnes. Our phosphate business is expected to benefit from lower raw material prices in the fourth quarter, particularly as low sulfur prices start flowing through our costs. We expect a fourth quarter benefit of $40 to $45 per tonne from lower raw materials in our North American phosphate business over the cost in the third quarter.
In our potash business, we are realizing the benefits of improved volumes from Esterhazy and from the addition of Colonsay. 11 of the 13 planned miners are now running at Esterhazy, and improved operating rates at Colonsay together are driving higher volumes. We anticipate some turnarounds during the fourth quarter that will impact total production but expect sales volumes to be 2 million to 2.2 million tonnes.
Mosaic Fertilizantes continues to be a very good business, having earned $1.2 billion in EBITDA over the last 12 months. High inventories built during the second quarter led to slower than initially expected demand during the third quarter as shipments typically seen during quarter 3 didn't materialize. But pricing trends towards the end of the third quarter reached a level that is beginning to drive shipments, and we've begun seeing that in our business. Some of the third quarter buyer hesitancy is impacting the fourth quarter, but we expect trends to begin normalizing as we finish out the year.
Before moving on, I'd like to address the next iteration of our transformation process. Over the last 3 years, we've extracted significant cost efficiencies in Brazil, lowered our cost profile in the potash business with transition to Esterhazy K3 and benefited from the combination of support functions across North America.
Our next area of focus is the realization of efficiencies through a digital transformation of how we manage our business. In our release last night, we introduced our global digital acceleration project, an initiative that will transform how we use data to manage a complex business across our global footprint. This effort will upgrade our core systems and allow for more seamless integration across sales, production, supply chain and global support functions.
Over the next several years, the total cost will be about $200 million to $250 million, split roughly evenly between SG&A and capital expenditures. As a result of this transformation, we expect to realize significant benefits in our sales and production planning and our cost and capital management. Similar to our early transformation efforts, this initiative will continue the trend of adding shareholder value. We expect this investment will have a payback in the range of 3 to 4 years.
Finally, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. Later this month, we expect to retire the remaining $550 million of long-term debt that completes our goal of $1 billion of long-term debt reduction. Our CapEx expenditures expectation this year remains unchanged at $1.3 billion, and all remaining free cash flow after these commitments will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
During the quarter, we returned roughly $670 million to shareholders, which included $600 million of share repurchases. Over the last year, we have reduced our share count from approximately 380 million shares to 340 million shares. Putting all of this together, our outlook is quite strong. The global agriculture market continues to point to tight supply and demand for grains and oilseeds.
We strengthened our balance sheet. Our team has recovered from Hurricane in Florida. Our potash business continues to benefit from our low-cost position at Esterhazy and the flexibility gained from restarting Colonsay. Our Brazil distribution business has a significant and growing footprint in an important agricultural market. We have positioned ourselves to maximize value across our business, and this has allowed us to return significant capital to shareholders.
With that, let's move on to the fireside chat portion of our call. Paul?"

And as of today, we are still saying products are going to hit ground. This improved farm economics and affordability has encouraged farmers to put down their phosphate and potash in the fall.
In fact, we started to get customers' inquiries and the request for the spring season demand. We sold a block of phosphate to one of our major customers yesterday as their customers, the farmers, have come to the table to buy product with the concern of the potential logistic issues for the spring supply and very strong cash flow the farmers are having to manage before end of the year. So a good and normal fall applications are setting a good stage for the inventory drawdown in North America and set good stage for spring season in 2023.
Moving over to Brazil. The barter ratios have improved significantly with the moderation of fertilizer prices and elevated at commodity prices. We are saying the Brazilian customers are reengaging in the purchases in order to prepare the coming safrinha seasons, and the inventories are coming down.
Moving over to India. The farm economics have been very strong this year with the support from their government. The monsoon has also been helpful as we see demand increases, especially for phosphate. The recently announced subsidy program from the Indian government has been very supportive to their phosphate input and also consumption. We are seeing steady buy-ins from Indian customers on DAP recently at $750 per tonne level.
With the strong demand in Q4 and getting into 2023, we continue to see the supply constraints for both phosphate and potash. On phosphate, we expect that Chinese export control will continue as we get into 2023 as the Chinese government to ensure that domestic supply availability and their farmers to be able to get fertilizers for their food production. And there's very little new capacities coming online in phosphate production in 2023.
Similarly to potash, we envision Belarus and Russia's supply will remain constrained in 2023. And the alternatives as well will not be able to ramp up quickly to offset the continued constraints from that part of the world. To summarize, as you mentioned, Joc, we are very positive to both phosphate and potash as we move into 2023."

In some of the regions like in Europe, the inventory level is really, really low given the supply situation in 2022. I probably want to provide some color on the inventory situation in North America and Brazil, where we believe most of the question is about.
In North America, for both phosphate and potash, the current channel inventory are about average relative to historical norm at the same time of this year. As of yesterday, our upper country warehouse capacity for phosphate has come down to 30% used. And for potash, that has come down to 50% used. This level of the inventory are right at the same level as we see historically at this point of time.
As we are seeing good norm fall application, the channel inventories are expected to come down further. I also want to remind ourself, logistics remain very challenging in North America, particularly on the river, which highlights the unique strength of Mosaic's assets, which can serve North America by both rail and barges.
Move over to Brazil. Since the war started in the first quarter, a lot of Brazilian customers rushed to buy products from all around the world in order to ensure their supply. As a result of this rush buying, we are seeing a very high inventory building at a port in Brazil started in July. That inventory at port has gradually fall down over the last few months. By end of October, we are saying that inventory export has come down by 35% versus the peak in end of July.
The other thing that I want to mention is the import shipment to Brazil. In the mid of the year, the vessels coming to Brazil had to wait for over 8 weeks to unload product because the ports warehouses are so full. Now the waiting time has come down to less than 2 weeks. That's a signal. And in the meantime, we are seeing reexport vessels for both potash and phosphate. With that, we believe the market reached to the bottom in Brazil."

And let me start by talking about Esterhazy. Esterhazy has been a 10-year plan. And in that plan, we not only brought out a new mine at K3 but fully intended to bring on an extra 1 million tonnes of production, which was aligned with the capacity of the K1 and K2 mills.
So as we talk about that, we've always looked at Esterhazy as being our most efficient, lowest-cost operations. So yes, we absolutely will expand the capacity of Esterhazy's K3 mine to meet the capacity of the mill. In terms of Colonsay, we see an immediate need for those tonnes as the gap in supply from Belarus has meant there's been an opportunity for us and through Canpotex exporting more product. That near-term need, we expect, will continue into 2023. So we certainly see a need for Colonsay in the near term.
Bringing that production on has been relatively inexpensive, likely in the range of $50 per capacity tonne. So on that basis, that's paid off over a matter of months. So how will we look at it as we go forward? We will always be focused on working towards value, not volume. And as such, we will meet the needs of the market and no more."

For distribution business, due to the timing of purchases, a step down in gross margin per tonne is expected. However, even with that, we are still seeing gross margins above our historic norms.

Certainly, as prices are declining, nobody wants to step into a market. There's necessary caution. I would argue, probably when the prices were higher, there was also a psychological or sentimental response. The economics of planting and using fertilizer never went negative. So it isn't a matter of the fundamentals. It was a matter of the sentiment, I would think, at some point.
And then as the prices declined, as you suggest, the buyers take a step back and wait. If they think the price is going to be lower tomorrow, they'll wait and start buying when they absolutely need to. I think the indication now is the price has in fact stabilized. It's stabilized at a price where they can see easy value, if you will. And so they're stepping back in. And absolutely, we expect there will be a pretty steady buying.
Remember, at least in North America, though, we are in the fall season. So they are taking a price risk for next spring. So there might be a little more caution in terms of coming all in. But we're seeing good movement, and that indicates that they believe that this is good value and that will continue."

Thanks, Adam. If I think about 2023, starting with potash, and we've been saying this, and with the lack of -- or the lack of sales coming out of Belarus, we do see that the market is going to have to ration supply, which does, as you mentioned, bring up an opportunity for us to potentially move more product. I will say that North America, we expect to stay relatively flat. It's not a high-growth market. So this is all an export opportunity, if you will.
The challenge there are twofold. One is, do we get to the right markets that really need it? And then the other question is, can we even move it? So those are the first points. The supply chain is at its limit right now, and we struggle to get the tonnes out, particularly, say, in the first quarter, which I think everyone sees problems getting product out of Canada in the first quarter with winter and all the rest.
And then it comes down to what's the production capacity. We have, I think, developed real great flexibility there with Esterhazy now reaching what I would call its full capacity, bringing on Colonsay to augment that capacity and give us some flexibility so that we can hit the seasonality as well as the increased demand. So I think we're well positioned there.
I can't give you a specific number at this stage of what we think the year is going to bring for demand. But I mean we're looking at a global market of 64 million tonnes next year in potash, up probably a little bit off this year. I think this year, we might have been as low as 62 million tonnes. So we do see an improvement in the market. We see the rush of tonnes that came in the first quarter from Russia and Belarus are probably not coming, though a good opportunity for us in that first and second quarter, certainly of next year and then throughout the year.
In terms of phosphates, we're probably a little more production-limited in phosphates. I mean we're running those assets. But between the limitations of the resource base, whatnot, we don't have an expansion opportunity really there. So we expect that to stay similar in that sort of maybe 8 million to maybe 8.5 million, 9 million tonnes of capacity. How well we utilize those will depend on the market.
And so our expectation is our utilization will be quite high next year. And in both those cases, we're looking forward to being very well sold, if you will, and having high utilization of all our assets. And that would include our production assets in Brazil, of course, as well."

If I think about prices, I think there's really, at this stage, it's going to be sentiment that will really -- sentiment and fundamentals that are really going to be the limitation to prices. I would argue that what we saw, particularly in Brazil when the price of potash went to, say, $1,200, the economics was still okay, but it was starting to get pretty difficult for the Brazilian farmer.
And the one that they probably work off more is their barter ratio, which became quite elevated. So in other words, it was costing them a lot more of their production to buy the inputs than it had in previous years. So I think there's a risk if you go to high-end price that you will actually start really destroying demand.
So look, I think there is a great opportunity for a -- at the same reasonable barter ratios as we've had with elevated crop prices that we can have very good margins and that the market should be able to move up from here. I don't believe it's going to move to $1,200, but I think there's probably some good room to move from where we are today."

But that's 5 million-ish tonnes on a 70-something million-tonne market, where in potash, you're talking about a 8 million-tonne decline on a 70 million-tonne market. So as you think about it from that perspective, the problems in Belarus in terms of exports are, a, less likely to be resolved; and b, more significant to the overall market.

The other",339,"Chris, so if I'm thinking about potash -- I'll just hit potash real quick because I think you've touched on that. In potash, it's 2 things that matter. One is where the product comes from. So obviously, running Colonsay at a little higher cost. The other thing that we have to take into account is Belle Plaine is highly dependent on the price of natural gas. It uses arguably some 30 million MMBtus per year of natural gas.
So if you add a couple of dollars to the natural gas price, it has a pretty big impact on that operation. So other than that, though, as you mentioned, the potash pricing or the potash cost is pretty stable.
If we then look at phosphates -- and quite frankly, we are seeing some inflation in both mining costs and processing mining. The distances are getting longer. The grades probably over the years is declining slightly. So you've got some costs in there that come up. But they pale in comparison to when you look at the raw materials. If we think about $1,000 ammonia, that represents $200 on the cost of a tonne of phosphates.
If you think about a $400 sulfur, that represents about $180 cost on top. So you could have -- at the peak, there was probably $420 a tonne in our -- or sorry, $380 a tonne in our phosphate cost just on those 2 raw materials. Now they've retracted back to $100 for sulfur and our average -- I think our average ammonia cost is now in the range of $600 if you take into account our own production and all the rest. So that's stable.
And I think we talked about a $40 or $50 decline in raw materials costs, and that will fall straight to the margin. So assuming flat prices, you could expect the margin to increase by about $40 to $50. And so we'll see where the price goes in the next quarter, but that's kind of how that plays out."

So far, we have definitely focused on the share buybacks, and one of the reasons for that is -- or one of the main reasons for that is exactly as you say. And we believe our shares offer as good a value as anything we can think of. And so that's a good place to return money to shareholders.
At the same time, we have to consider all of our shareholders. Some of the long-term shareholders would like to see income. I would say, as a shareholder myself, I don't mind the idea of seeing some of it come back as stable income. And quite frankly, if I decide, as I think I would, that the value of that meant I could buy more shares, I'm free to do that as well.
So I don't think the idea of a combination is bad. We certainly have focused more on share buybacks. But I think we want to make sure we look at all of our shareholders. And if a small portion of our return to shareholders is through a special dividend when we're doing well, I think that's fair, too. And obviously, on a yearly basis, we'll look at our overall dividend and make sure that we give a fair but affordable dividend there, too.
So second question, p rock, I'm not sure I 100% understood the question, Jeff. But there's no question from -- in general, that phosphate rock mining in China has been restricted greatly because of its proximity to the Yangtze River. And so for environmental reasons, they've done a lot of restrictions on mining in China. So if anything, I would argue that China is probably somewhat resource-constrained from a phosphate rock process. And so we don't expect expansion there.
And what we've seen as well in terms of finished fertilizers is they have dropped their capacity significantly and shut down plants, particularly again along the Yangtze River, and have not rebuilt them. So I think their capacity is down about 25% now. And in terms of their exports, 2 things are going on there. More product is going to industrial and particularly purified phosphoric acid.
I can't help but mention the -- again, the growth of lithium-ion phosphate batteries in China is just incredible. And it seems like that may well be the future of batteries is the more economic lithium-ion phosphate rather than nickel iron -- or nickel lithium cobalt.
So putting all that together, we see Chinese government needing to make sure fertilizers stays affordable in China, and they're doing that by restricting exports. And so we think that will continue. I hope that answers the question you were asking. If you're asking about potash, I think what we've seen is Qinghai Lake has actually decreased in capacity over time. And I suspect that's just the quality of the resource and what they can extract on a year-by-year basis."

In terms of is LFP battery a significant use of phosphates, what we're seeing today, I think, is -- I think we've gone from 100,000 tonnes of purified phosphoric acid, this is China alone, moving up in a couple of years to about 400,000 tonnes of purified phosphoric acid. And even year-to-date, the LFP has gone up to 670,000. And we expect 2022 will be 1 million tonnes total.

In terms of going forward, again, there's just a high level of uncertainty of where that market is going to be. And I would argue that, that pertains both to Canpotex and to the North American market. In the North American market, we expect a decent fall season. If we do better than that, hey, all the better. But the expectation is a decent or normal fall season, and that's exactly what we're seeing.
We expect to see the inventory work its way down throughout the season, which is good. I think Jenny said earlier, we're down to 50% of our in-market inventory. So that's been run down significantly to a normal level for middle of November. So we're seeing a very normal sort of play out, and that is what we would expect. Now we had a summer fill program.

Let me try and hit these one at a time. First of all, phosphate production, I guess, we have, over the last couple of years, up and down a little bit on phosphate production. Some of that, obviously, is from time to time,",403,"Okay. Okay. That's a brain full. Let me try and hit these one at a time. First of all, phosphate production, I guess, we have, over the last couple of years, up and down a little bit on phosphate production. Some of that, obviously, is from time to time, reliability; from time to time moving in different areas of mining, et cetera, which will happen.
But the other piece is the market started moving pretty slow, and we ran into where our sales out of production haven't really been up to where we might have loved them. And as such, you got to match your production to your sales. We've had a situation, particularly if you look at single super phosphate, SSP, where we're actually pretty loaded up on our inventory. And so continuing to run against a full inventory doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
So -- and from a cost perspective, that hurts your unit cost. So there's a couple of things in play there. In terms of our -- when I was talking about margin, I just want to highlight we take positions. And normally, we try and keep our positions fairly balanced, but you tend to take a position as much as a couple of months ahead of when you sell.
So if you are in a declining market and you buy in July and you sell in September, you tend to take that price risk for those 2 months. If the prices are going up, you have extraordinary or you have gains in that positioning. And if it's -- if the prices are going down, you have losses in that positioning.
So if we look at Brazil right now, you are seeing that. We had very good margins in quarter 2 that reversed to some extent in quarter 3. Although as I said in the earlier comments, the margins are still looking pretty strong. And I think I would credit that with our product management teams not only globally, but in Brazil, specifically, who are able to understand the market dynamic, decide how far ahead or how late they want to address the pricing and how much inventory they're holding.
So I mean, there's a great art to that as a production company. However, there's limitations on how much of that you can really do. So I think that answers most of what you asked there, Andrew."

And then you said that demand would be 64 million tonnes next year based on your preliminary guess, up only a couple of million from 2022, assuming Bina has a little bit more cables, assuming is really chemical a little bit more, assuming ICLs a little bit more, assuming Belarus maybe a little bit out more. Who knows what happens with EuroChem. It would seem that Nutrien can't place all those tonnes.
So I guess I'm trying to figure out, you know if I have an answer, but how do you think about all this? And if Colonsay is a swing mine, are you cautious to want to run it at the beginning of the year full out if it looks like, based on your own numbers, it may not be needed?"

I'm sure EuroChem seems to be reasonably effective in getting to market.
I will say that OurCali seems to be not as active in the market this year as previous, and there's been a couple of rumors and whatnot about why. But I can't tell you that. That would be, again, a question for them. What -- and the Belarusians, as long as they can get product through the Lithuanian ports, they're going to be restricted to either a long-rail haul to St. Petersburg, assuming they can get port capacity there; or a long and complicated rail haul to China, which they have done relatively successfully. I think they've probably been able to move 1.5 million-ish tonnes to China through that rail link.
So -- but with all of that together, we see a supply side -- even with extra tonnes from Canpotex, we see a supply side of -- in the range of 64 million tonnes. And from our perspective, if -- the market will have to find a way to be at that 64 million tonnes. So in other words, we think there's good need -- or there's need for all the Colonsay tonnes next year.
What happens beyond that? Who knows? Again, I will emphasize with Colonsay: it cost us virtually a couple of months production to restart it. So we're making a good margin at Colonsay right now, and the downside risk of restarting it was virtually 0, and the upside opportunity was large. So to us, that's a perfect value-adding decision."

Thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. Mosaic delivered record third quarter revenues of $5.3 billion, which resulted in net income of $842 million or earnings per share of $2.42. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22, a",1522,"Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. Mosaic delivered record third quarter revenues of $5.3 billion, which resulted in net income of $842 million or earnings per share of $2.42. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.7 billion.
These results are driving significant cash flow generation, which is allowing us to return significant capital to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the business and strengthen the balance sheet. During the quarter, we returned roughly $670 million to shareholders, including $600 million of share buybacks.
Now before diving into our operations, I'd like to address current market dynamics. Food security remains a concern around the world. Global grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios remain at 20-year lows, and early data continues to suggest there may be further downside to total production once the fall harvest is complete.
It is important to remember that the market was tight when the year began, well before the start of the war, and issues over the last several months have further exacerbated the situation. Ukraine's production shortfall is significant, but weather issues like high temperatures and drought conditions in other major growing regions are having an even bigger impact on an already tight market.
In the U.S., weather delayed spring planting, and the compressed planting window reduced nutrient applications. The growing season was further impacted by high temperatures and drought in some areas. Weather tends to be a significant factor in yield, but under-fertilization doesn't help, and you can only mine the soil for so long. Both are contributing to an expectation of weaker-than-normal North American harvest. And this was reflected in the most recent USDA yield forecast.
In Brazil, fertilizer shipments appear poised to have dropped around 10% year-over-year. And La Niña remains a threat despite the market counting on record-breaking corn and soybean production. Beyond grains and oilseeds, we're seeing food security issues play out in other crops as well. Staples like rice are also seeing significant production shortages, driving some countries like India to restrict exports.
Because of this, we see a tight market for global grains and oilseeds continuing into 2023 and beyond. The global fertilizer market remains tight with supply constraints in both potash and phosphate still unresolved. Global potash supply remains impacted by the significant reduction in Belarusian exports, which we think will be down 8 million tonnes in 2022. Of the 4 million tonnes they will export this year, we estimate about 2 million tonnes were shipped in the first quarter before the sanctions and Lithuania's decision to prevent Belarus from using its ports.
Belarus exports are down significantly from the first quarter, and we do not expect much recovery through the rest of the year or for most of 2023. This means the market will continue to be short of potash in 2023. The phosphate market is also impacted by supply constraints. China production is down because of environmental concerns, and exports are being restricted to ensure domestic availability and affordability.
This year, we expect China's phosphate exports will be down by up to 5 million tonnes. Those restrictions could extend through at least the first half of 2023 and possibly beyond as China prioritizes securing domestic food supply and meeting growing industrial demand.
While global channel inventories of phosphate and potash remain below historic norms, certain regions, especially in the areas where we do most of our business, saw inventories build in the first half of the year. But prices have retreated back to levels low enough to entice growers to step back into the market. We expect inventories to continue working lower through the end of the year and into early 2023.
U.S. fall application has been trending back towards normal levels. We believe we could end the season with inventory significantly depleted, especially for phosphates. The U.S. is also experiencing low water levels on the Mississippi River, which is delaying supply coming through New Orleans.
In Brazil, the higher-priced inventory built during the first half of the year has slowed third quarter shipments. But sentiment is improving. Prices have retreated enough to encourage sales, and we expect inventories will end the year much the same as where they started. The barter ratio suggests we're approaching a much more constructive environment for demand.
In India, importers are taking advantage of the price pullback in phosphates. India's phosphates inventory is still low, while farmer demand remains strong. Government subsidies remain at a level that is supportive of phosphate imports but are likely to leave the country short of adequate supply of potash.
To summarize, the strength of crop prices and more affordable fertilizer prices suggest nutrient demand will recover from the summer lull we experienced during the third quarter. Given the constructive ag backdrop, we believe our business is well positioned to benefit.
In our phosphates business, Hurricane Ian forced us to shut down operations late in the third quarter, which delayed shipments at the end of September. Our team performed admirably and was able to get our Florida operations back up and running quickly following the hurricane. We estimate the shortfall in production to be in the range of 200,000 tonnes.
Looking forward, we now expect fourth quarter sales to be in the range of 1.7 million to 2 million tonnes. Our phosphate business is expected to benefit from lower raw material prices in the fourth quarter, particularly as low sulfur prices start flowing through our costs. We expect a fourth quarter benefit of $40 to $45 per tonne from lower raw materials in our North American phosphate business over the cost in the third quarter.
In our potash business, we are realizing the benefits of improved volumes from Esterhazy and from the addition of Colonsay. 11 of the 13 planned miners are now running at Esterhazy, and improved operating rates at Colonsay together are driving higher volumes. We anticipate some turnarounds during the fourth quarter that will impact total production but expect sales volumes to be 2 million to 2.2 million tonnes.
Mosaic Fertilizantes continues to be a very good business, having earned $1.2 billion in EBITDA over the last 12 months. High inventories built during the second quarter led to slower than initially expected demand during the third quarter as shipments typically seen during quarter 3 didn't materialize. But pricing trends towards the end of the third quarter reached a level that is beginning to drive shipments, and we've begun seeing that in our business. Some of the third quarter buyer hesitancy is impacting the fourth quarter, but we expect trends to begin normalizing as we finish out the year.
Before moving on, I'd like to address the next iteration of our transformation process. Over the last 3 years, we've extracted significant cost efficiencies in Brazil, lowered our cost profile in the potash business with transition to Esterhazy K3 and benefited from the combination of support functions across North America.
Our next area of focus is the realization of efficiencies through a digital transformation of how we manage our business. In our release last night, we introduced our global digital acceleration project, an initiative that will transform how we use data to manage a complex business across our global footprint. This effort will upgrade our core systems and allow for more seamless integration across sales, production, supply chain and global support functions.
Over the next several years, the total cost will be about $200 million to $250 million, split roughly evenly between SG&A and capital expenditures. As a result of this transformation, we expect to realize significant benefits in our sales and production planning and our cost and capital management. Similar to our early transformation efforts, this initiative will continue the trend of adding shareholder value. We expect this investment will have a payback in the range of 3 to 4 years.
Finally, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. Later this month, we expect to retire the remaining $550 million of long-term debt that completes our goal of $1 billion of long-term debt reduction. Our CapEx expenditures expectation this year remains unchanged at $1.3 billion, and all remaining free cash flow after these commitments will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
During the quarter, we returned roughly $670 million to shareholders, which included $600 million of share repurchases. Over the last year, we have reduced our share count from approximately 380 million shares to 340 million shares. Putting all of this together, our outlook is quite strong. The global agriculture market continues to point to tight supply and demand for grains and oilseeds.
We strengthened our balance sheet. Our team has recovered from Hurricane Ian in Florida. Our potash business continues to benefit from our low-cost position at Esterhazy and the flexibility gained from restarting Colonsay. Our Brazil distribution business has a significant and growing footprint in an important agricultural market. We have positioned ourselves to maximize value across our business, and this has allowed us to return significant capital to shareholders.

And as of today, we are still saying products are going to hit ground. This improved farm economics and affordability has encouraged farmers to put down their phosphate and potash in the fall.
In fact, we started to get customers' inquiries and the request for the spring season demand. We sold a block of phosphate to one of our major customers yesterday as their customers, the farmers, have come to the table to buy product with the concern of the potential logistic issues for the spring supply and very strong cash flow the farmers are having to manage before end of the year. So a good and normal fall applications are setting a good stage for the inventory drawdown in North America and set good stage for spring season in 2023.
Moving over to Brazil. The barter ratios have improved significantly with the moderation of fertilizer prices and elevated at commodity prices. We are saying the Brazilian customers are reengaging in the purchases in order to prepare the coming safrinha seasons, and the inventories are coming down.
Moving over to India. The farm economics have been very strong this year with the support from their government. The monsoon has also been helpful as we see demand increases, especially for phosphate. The recently announced subsidy program from the Indian government has been very supportive to their phosphate input and also consumption. We are seeing steady buy-ins from Indian customers on DAP recently at $750 per tonne level.
With the strong demand in Q4 and getting into 2023, we continue to see the supply constraints for both phosphate and potash. On phosphate, we expect that Chinese export control will continue as we get into 2023 as the Chinese government to ensure that domestic supply availability and their farmers to be able to get fertilizers for their food production. And there's very little new capacities coming online in phosphate production in 2023.
Similarly to potash, we envision Belarus and Russia's supply will remain constrained in 2023. And the alternatives as well will not be able to ramp up quickly to offset the continued constraints from that part of the world. To summarize, as you mentioned, Joc, we are very positive to both phosphate and potash as we move into 2023."

In some of the regions like in Europe, the inventory level is really, really low given the supply situation in 2022. I probably want to provide some color on the inventory situation in North America and Brazil, where we believe most of the question is about.
In North America, for both phosphate and potash, the current channel inventory are about average relative to historical norm at the same time of this year. As of yesterday, our upper country warehouse capacity for phosphate has come down to 30% used. And for potash, that has come down to 50% used. This level of the inventory are right at the same level as we see historically at this point of time.
As we are seeing good norm fall application, the channel inventories are expected to come down further. I also want to remind ourself, logistics remain very challenging in North America, particularly on the river, which highlights the unique strength of Mosaic's assets, which can serve North America by both rail and barges.
Move over to Brazil. Since the war started in the first quarter, a lot of Brazilian customers rushed to buy products from all around the world in order to ensure their supply. As a result of this rush buying, we are seeing a very high inventory building at a port in Brazil started in July. That inventory at port has gradually fell down over the last few months. By end of October, we are saying that inventory export has come down by 35% versus the peak in end of July.
The other thing that I want to mention is the import shipment to Brazil. In the mid of the year, the vessels coming to Brazil had to wait for over 8 weeks to unload product because the ports warehouses are so full. Now the waiting time has come down to less than 2 weeks.

And in that plan, we not only brought out a new mine at K3 but fully intended to bring on an extra 1 million tonnes of production, which was aligned with the capacity of the K1 and K2 mills.
So as we talk about that, we've always looked at Esterhazy as being our most efficient, lowest-cost operations. So yes, we absolutely will expand the capacity of Esterhazy's K3 mine to meet the capacity of the mill. In terms of Colonsay, we see an immediate need for those tonnes as the gap in supply from Belarus has meant there's been an opportunity for us and through Canpotex exporting more product. That near-term need, we expect, will continue into 2023. So we certainly see a need for Colonsay in the near term.
Bringing that production on has been relatively inexpensive, likely in the range of $50 per capacity tonne. So on that basis, that's paid off over a matter of months. So how will we look at it as we go forward? We will always be focused on working towards value, not volume. And as such, we will meet the needs of the market and no more."

Certainly, as prices are declining, nobody wants to step into a market. There's necessary caution. I would argue, probably when the prices were higher, there was also a psychological or sentimental response. The economics of planting and using fertilizer never went negative. So it isn't a matter of the fundamentals. It was a matter of the sentiment, I would think, at some point.
And then as the prices declined, as you suggest, the buyers take a step back and wait. If they think the price is going to be lower tomorrow, they'll wait and start buying when they absolutely need to. I think the indication now is the price has in fact stabilized. It's stabilized at a price where they can see easy value, if you will. And so they're stepping back in. And absolutely, we expect there will be a pretty steady buying.
Remember, at least in North America, though, we are in the fall season. So they are taking a price risk for next spring. So there might be a little more caution in terms of coming all in. But we're seeing good movement, and that indicates that they believe that this is good value and that will continue."

Thanks, Adam. If I think about 2023, starting with potash, and we've been saying this, and with the lack of -- or the lack of sales coming out of Belarus, we do see that the market is going to have to ration supply, which does, as you mentioned, bring up an opportunity for us to potentially move more product. I will say that North America, we expect to stay relatively flat. It's not a high-growth market. So this is all an export opportunity, if you will.
The challenge there are twofold. One is, do we get to the right markets that really need it? And then the other question is, can we even move it? So those are the first points. The supply chain is at its limit right now, and we struggle to get the tonnes out, particularly, say, in the first quarter, which I think everyone sees problems getting product out of Canada in the first quarter with winter and all the rest.
And then it comes down to what's the production capacity. We have, I think, developed real great flexibility there with Esterhazy now reaching what I would call its full capacity, bringing on Colonsay to augment that capacity and give us some flexibility so that we can hit the seasonality as well as the increased demand. So I think we're well positioned there.
I can't give you a specific number at this stage of what we think the year is going to bring for demand. But I mean we're looking at a global market of 64 million tonnes next year in potash, up probably a little bit off this year. I think this year, we might have been as low as 62 million tonnes. So we do see an improvement in the market. We see the rush of tonnes that came in the first quarter from Russia and Belarus are probably not coming, though a good opportunity for us in that first and second quarter, certainly of next year and then throughout the year.
In terms of phosphates, we're probably a little more production-limited in phosphates. I mean we're running those assets. But between the limitations of the resource base, whatnot, we don't have an expansion opportunity really there. So we expect that to stay similar in that sort of maybe 8 million to maybe 8.5 million, 9 million tonnes of capacity. How well we utilize those will depend on the market.
And so our expectation is our utilization will be quite high next year. And in both those cases, we're looking forward to being very well sold, if you will, and having high utilization of all our assets. And that would include our production assets in Brazil, of course, as well."

If I think about prices, I think there's really, at this stage, it's going to be sentiment that will really -- sentiment and fundamentals that are really going to be the limitation to prices. I would argue that what we saw, particularly in Brazil when the price of potash went to, say, $1,200, the economics was still okay, but it was starting to get pretty difficult for the Brazilian farmer.
And the one that they probably work off more is their barter ratio, which became quite elevated. So in other words, it was costing them a lot more of their production to buy the inputs than it had in previous years. So I think there's a risk if you go too high in price that you will actually start really destroying demand.
So look, I think there is a great opportunity for a -- at the same reasonable barter ratios as we've had with elevated crop prices that we can have very good margins and that the market should be able to move up from here. I don't believe it's going to move to $1,200, but I think there's probably some good room to move from where we are today."

But that's 5 million-ish tonnes on a 70-something million-tonne market, where in potash, you're talking about a 8 million-tonne decline on a 70 million-tonne market. So as you think about it from that perspective, the problems in Belarus in terms of exports are, a, less likely to be resolved; and b, more significant to the overall market.

One is where the product comes from. So obviously, running Colonsay at a little higher cost. The other thing that we have to take into account is Belle Plaine is highly dependent on the price of natural gas. It uses arguably some 30 million MMBtus per year of natural gas.
So if you add a couple of dollars to the natural gas price, it has a pretty big impact on that operation. So other than that, though, as you mentioned, the potash pricing or the potash cost is pretty stable.
If we then look at phosphates -- and quite frankly, we are seeing some inflation in both mining costs and processing. Mining, the distances are getting longer. The grades probably over the years is declining slightly. So you've got some costs in there that come up. But they pale in comparison to when you look at the raw materials. If we think about $1,000 ammonia, that represents $200 on the cost of a tonne of phosphates.
If you think about a $400 sulfur, that represents about $180 cost on top. So you could have -- at the peak, there was probably $420 a tonne in our -- or sorry, $380 a tonne in our phosphate cost just on those 2 raw materials. Now they've retracted back to $100 for sulfur and our average -- I think our average ammonia cost is now in the range of $600 if you take into account our own production and all the rest. So that's stable.
And I think we talked about a $40 or $50 decline in raw materials costs, and that will fall straight to the margin. So assuming flat prices, you could expect the margin to increase by about $40 to $50. And so we'll see where the price goes in the next quarter, but that's kind of how that plays out."

So far, we have definitely focused on the share buybacks, and one of the reasons for that is -- or one of the main reasons for that is exactly as you say. And we believe our shares offer as good a value as anything we can think of. And so that's a good place to return money to shareholders.
At the same time, we have to consider all of our shareholders. Some of the long-term shareholders would like to see income. I would say, as a shareholder myself, I don't mind the idea of seeing some of it come back as stable income. And quite frankly, if I decide, as I think I would, that the value of that meant I could buy more shares, I'm free to do that as well.
So I don't think the idea of a combination is bad. We certainly have focused more on share buybacks. But I think we want to make sure we look at all of our shareholders. And if a small portion of our return to shareholders is through a special dividend when we're doing well, I think that's fair, too. And obviously, on a yearly basis, we'll look at our overall dividend and make sure that we give a fair but affordable dividend there, too.
So second question, p rock, I'm not sure I 100% understood the question, Jeff. But there's no question from -- in general, that phosphate rock mining in China has been restricted greatly because of its proximity to the Yangtze River. And so for environmental reasons, they've done a lot of restrictions on mining in China. So if anything, I would argue that China is probably somewhat resource-constrained from a phosphate rock process. And so we don't expect expansion there.
And what we've seen as well in terms of finished fertilizers is they have dropped their capacity significantly and shut down plants, particularly again along the Yangtze River, and have not rebuilt them. So I think their capacity is down about 25% now. And in terms of their exports, 2 things are going on there. More product is going to industrial and particularly purified phosphoric acid.
I can't help but mention the -- again, the growth of lithium-ion phosphate batteries in China is just incredible. And it seems like that may well be the future of batteries is the more economic lithium-ion phosphate rather than nickel iron -- or nickel lithium cobalt.
So putting all that together, we see Chinese government needing to make sure fertilizers stays affordable in China, and they're doing that by restricting exports. And so we think that will continue. I hope that answers the question you were asking. If you're asking about potash, I think what we've seen is Qinghai Lake has actually decreased in capacity over time. And I suspect that's just the quality of the resource and what they can extract on a year-by-year basis."

In terms of is LFP battery a significant use of phosphates, what we're seeing today, I think, is -- I think we've gone from 100,000 tonnes of purified phosphoric acid, this is China alone, moving up in a couple of years to about 400,000 tonnes of purified phosphoric acid. And even year-to-date, the LFP has gone up to 670,000. And we expect 2022 will be 1 million tonnes total.

And I also don't know the differences in selling strategies or rev rec and all that, so making any kind of comparison. What I will say is what we saw in North America in the third quarter was a pretty good slowdown. What we did also see, though, was a reduction of imports. I mean imports year-to-date are probably down by 50% or close to 1 million tonnes.
I suspect we had a pretty good uptake of our summer fill program -- or considering how the markets played out, we had a pretty good uptake of our summer fill program. So we think our customers came to the table and again, saw good value and saw that they were willing to price. And that was a good thing. So we rev rec-ed what we think was reasonable considering the market.
In terms of going forward, again, there's just a high level of uncertainty of where that market is going to be. And I would argue that, that pertains both to Canpotex and to the North American market. In the North American market, we expect a decent fall season. If we do better than that, hey, all the better. But the expectation is a decent or normal fall season, and that's exactly what we're seeing.
We expect to see the inventory work its way down throughout the season, which is good. I think Jenny said earlier, we're down to 50% of our in-market inventory. So that's been run down significantly to a normal level for middle of November. So we're seeing a very normal sort of play out, and that is what we would expect. Now we had a summer fill program. It -- we didn't discount or anything. So I think that just says the fundamentals are there, and people are ready to buy."

First of all, phosphate production, I guess, we have, over the last couple of years, up and down a little bit on phosphate production. Some of that, obviously, is from time to time, reliability; from time to time moving in different areas of mining, et cetera, which will happen.
But the other piece is the market started moving pretty slow, and we ran into where our sales out of production haven't really been up to where we might have loved them. And as such, you got to match your production to your sales. We've had a situation, particularly if you look at single super phosphate, SSP, where we're actually pretty loaded up on our inventory. And so continuing to run against a full inventory doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
So -- and from a cost perspective, that hurts your unit cost. So there's a couple of things in play there. In terms of our -- when I was talking about margin, I just want to highlight we take positions. And normally, we try and keep our positions fairly balanced, but you tend to take a position as much as a couple of months ahead of when you sell.
So if you are in a declining market and you buy in July and you sell in September, you tend to take that price risk for those 2 months. If the prices are going up, you have extraordinary or you have gains in that positioning. And if it's -- if the prices are going down, you have losses in that positioning.
So if we look at Brazil right now, you are seeing that. We had very good margins in quarter 2, that reversed to some extent in quarter 3. Although as I said in the earlier comments, the margins are still looking pretty strong. And I think I would credit that with our product management teams not only globally, but in Brazil, specifically, who are able to understand the market dynamic, decide how far ahead or how late they want to address the pricing and how much inventory they're holding.
So I mean, there's a great art to that as a production company. However, there's limitations on how much of that you can really do. So I think that answers most of what you asked there, Andrew."

It's a tough one, but Joc, so -- so Nutrien is going to add some tonnes going forward here. And obviously, their CapEx allocation is set because that capacity, I assume, proving [indiscernible] is already done. So for them to place those extra tonnes has to be all in North America.
And then you said that demand would be 64 million tonnes next year based on your preliminary guess, up only a couple of million from 2022, assuming [indiscernible] has a little bit more [indiscernible] , assuming [indiscernible] chemical a little bit more, assuming ICL is a little bit more, assuming Belarusians maybe get a little bit out more. Who knows what happens with EuroChem. It would seem that Nutrien can't place all those tonnes.
So I guess I'm trying to figure out, you know if I have an answer, but how do you think about all this? And if Colonsay is a swing mine, are you cautious to want to run it at the beginning of the year full out if it looks like, based on your own numbers, it may not be needed?"

So as you actually mentioned, I can't and won't contemplate either my competitor or partner or whatever and what their plans are. I think you have to ask their new CEO. However, let me say how we view the market. Like I said, we see next year that, that 8 million tonnes won't come back, yes. I'm sure ICL will try and push out what they can. I'm sure EuroChem seems to be reasonably effective in getting to market.
I will say that Uralkali seems to be not as active in the market this year as previous, and there's been a couple of rumors and whatnot about why. But I can't tell you that. That would be, again, a question for them. What -- and the Belarusians, as long as they can get product through the Lithuanian ports, they're going to be restricted to either a long-rail haul to St. Petersburg, assuming they can get port capacity there or a long and complicated rail haul to China, which they have done relatively successfully. I think they've probably been able to move 1.5 million-ish tonnes to China through that rail link.
So -- but with all of that together, we see a supply side -- even with extra tonnes from Canpotex, we see a supply side of -- in the range of 64 million tonnes. And from our perspective, if -- the market will have to find a way to be at that 64 million tonnes. So in other words, we think there's good need -- or there's need for all the Colonsay tonnes next year.
What happens beyond that? Who knows? Again, I will emphasize with Colonsay: it cost us virtually a couple of months production to restart it. So we're making a good margin at Colonsay right now, and the downside risk of restarting it was virtually 0, and the upside opportunity was large. So to us, that's a perfect value-adding decision."
