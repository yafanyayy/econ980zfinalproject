867423,1761694054,2484111,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Al. Good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and full year, we, again, experienced elevated claims related to U.S. COVID deaths. Since the pandemic's onset, we have been providing important financial protection for our customers, bearing t",1696,"Thank you, Al. Good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and full year, we, again, experienced elevated claims related to U.S. COVID deaths. Since the pandemic's onset, we have been providing important financial protection for our customers, bearing the most serious global health crisis in over a century. Despite the magnitude of claims, our earnings have been strong enough to continue our share repurchase program, provide capital for new sales and maintain our overall financial strength. 
Looking through the significant COVID claims experienced in 2021, and adjusting out excess alternative income and notable items, we view underlying earnings power at about $10.50 per share, up 13% over 2020's comparable figure and representing a 14% underlying ROE on book value, excluding AOCI. We saw broad-based sales growth this year in most of our businesses, good expense management, significant share repurchases and an improved capital position. Looking forward, we expect EPS growth to meet or exceed our long-term expectations, also supported by our actions to increase sales, significant expense savings related to the Spark initiative and share buybacks. 
Turning to our earnings growth drivers. As interest rates dropped, we started a new product strategy to reprice our portfolio to achieve target returns, shift our emphasis to less capital-intensive products and add new solutions that expand our consumer value propositions. We have been executing against this strategy and achieving our objectives. During 2021, we introduced 13 new products, with more planned in early 2022. We continued our disciplined repricing across our portfolio, contributing to strong new business returns. By combining these actions with the power of our distribution, we achieved significant 2021 sales growth in most businesses and drove increased operating revenues across all our businesses. We continue to successfully manage expenses, while improving operational effectiveness and the customer and producer experience. Lincoln has a long history of successful cost savings initiatives, most recent of which is our Spark initiative, as announced last quarter. 
By improving efficiency, leveraging automation and upskilling our workers, we expect Spark to be very additive to our compound annual EPS growth rate from 2021 through 2024. Finally, share buybacks have been and are expected to remain an important element of our EPS growth. 
Now turning to the business segments. In Annuities, sales grew 20% compared to the prior year quarter and 4% for the full year. We expanded consumer choice within our already broad product portfolio and added new producers to our industry-leading distribution force. Full year sales growth was driven by sales of variable annuities without guaranteed living benefits. Our sales of VAs with living benefits are generating strong returns, helped by a favorable competitive environment, rising rates and the return-enhancing flow reinsurance deal we executed in the third quarter. The ongoing shift in sales mix towards products without living benefits started several years ago. We further advanced that effort by launching an index variable annuity in 2018. We supported the launch with increased shelf space and have since continued to innovate, adding new investment options to both our indexed VA and our traditional VA without living benefits. As a result, VAs without living benefits have risen to over 70% of VA sales more than twice their percentage in 2018. 
The strategic sales shift has also diversified our account value mix. VAs with living benefits now account for less than half of our in-force annuity account value. And based on our current sales mix, will continue to decline. We entered 2022 with solid footing in the annuities business, with strong coordination among manufacturing, risk management and distribution. In Retirement Plan Services, we are successfully capitalizing on the opportunities in the market, thanks to our innovative product portfolio, differentiated high-tech, high-touch service model and breadth and depth of distribution. 
Fourth quarter total deposits were up double digits, both sequentially and compared to the prior year quarter. Full year total deposits rose 8% to $10.8 billion, a record, with growth in both first year sales and recurring deposits, contributing to our seventh consecutive year of positive net flows. Retirement Plan Services enters 2022 in terrific shape with a robust sales pipeline and an expanded product portfolio. We are benefiting from the improved environment for retirement businesses as wage growth, contribution rates and increases in employer deposits are all serving as tailwinds for deposit growth. Finally, we remain well positioned competitively in our target markets of small and mid case 401(k), health care, government and not-for-profit as evidenced by our consistent multiyear track record of positive net flows and strong returns. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We entered 2021 with a well-positioned portfolio of solutions, repriced to ensure strong returns in a low interest rate environment. Throughout 2021, we launched new innovative risk-sharing solutions to help grow the top line. We introduced 7 new products, contributing to fourth quarter sales growth of 53% sequentially and 121% over the prior year quarter. This sales strength was broad-based with every major product category reporting double-digit growth, including record term life sales and substantial growth in executive benefits. 
Even more significantly, nearly 30% of our sales this quarter consisted of solutions and features that didn't exist before 2021. For instance, variable MoneyGuard represented 42% of total MoneyGuard sales. In 2021, we also continued to build on our distribution force, adding over 12,000 new producers who had never sold a Lincoln life policy before. An example of this growth was in our new partnership in the P&C channel. New producers across channels are finding our repositioned and expanded product portfolio attractive, demonstrating the synergies between our product innovation and distribution expansion. 
Finally, we continued to build on our digital capabilities. In 2021, our cost per life application continued to decline as our automated underwriting and digital processing capabilities are driving efficiencies, while improving the customer experience. In 2022, we will continue to innovate with product launches planned for the first half of the year, expand our distribution franchise and enhance our operations with digital investments. 
Now moving to Group Protection. Let me focus first on profitability. The group business is managing through a challenging environment as pandemic claims increased in the fourth quarter. Group's full year underlying margins normalized for above-target alternative income, pandemic claims and a notable item was slightly below our targeted 5% to 7% range. We expect to achieve ongoing margin improvement in group building to the high end of our target, with improvement coming from a 3-part strategic effort. First, is continued pricing discipline. We've strengthened pricing in 2020 and continue to make additional changes where necessary. Second is claims management, including our ongoing investment in claims staffing, combined with a more streamlined and effective approach to claims operations. Lastly, is cost efficiency aided by our recently announced Spark initiative. We expect these 3 efforts to drive approximately equal contributions to margin expansion.
Turning to the top line. We achieved 4% premium growth for the year and 6% for the quarter, which is a result of strong persistency, up over 2 percentage points for the full year to 89.2% and successful execution of ongoing rate increases. Sales declined 17% for the full year and 14% in the fourth quarter as we maintained our pricing discipline. Our focus on strategic market segments has resulted in an increase in employee paid products, which comprised 43% of total sales in 2021, up from 39% in 2020. And we are starting to see a shift towards supplemental health solutions, including our new hospital indemnity product. This shift is still in its early days, but we expect it will ultimately add to our earnings diversity and consumer value propositions. 
Although the pandemic is a challenging time, the group business remains a key contributor to Lincoln's diversified business portfolio, and we are confident in its earnings potential. 
A few words on 1 of our key competitive advantages, our powerful distribution force. As the industry continually evolves the strength of our distribution franchises remain a constant. We are known in the marketplace for a consistent distribution presence with broad reach across distribution channels. 
Over 90,000 active producers sell our products. And through strategic investments in technology and training, we are influencing where and how we engage with financial professionals leading with a virtual first model for the long term. as wholesalers and reps have begun to meet in person with their clients, they continue to leverage virtual tools, which improve the service we deliver, raise productivity and help lower costs. And our efforts are being recognized as we received 2 industry awards in 2021 for innovation in virtual training and digital marketing. Briefly on investments. The fourth quarter capped the year of outstanding results. We again reported excellent credit performance with another quarter of positive net ratings migration and negligible losses. In 2021, the portion of our fixed income assets rated investment grade or equivalent rose to 97%. We -- this quarter, we invested new money at 2.9%, a 20 basis point sequential increase as we continue to benefit from a multi-manager platform. During 2021, we invested 65% of new money in assets other than public corporates, yielding approximately 100 basis points more than comparably rated public corporates of similar duration. For full year 2021, our new money duration fell to about 7.5 years from 10 years, with the decline reflecting Lincoln's disciplined approach to asset liability management, and our shift to a less interest-rate-sensitive product mix. 
Finally, we reported a quarterly return on alternative investments of 4% compared to our targeted return of 2.5%. For the year, we generated an outstanding 29% return versus our 10% annual targeted return. 
In summary, the claims environment has been challenging, but full year 2021 underlying EPS grew substantially. We expect our top line momentum to continue. We expect the smart cost savings initiative, which will more than offset spread compression to add to our EPS growth over the next few years, enabled by our balance sheet and earnings strength, we continue to return capital to shareholders. In sum, our earnings power continues to grow, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve underlying EPS growth at or above the high end of our 10% target range. I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $286 million or $1.56 per share. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter.

There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's results were impacted by pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $197 million or $1.08 per share, while results benefited from alternative investment income, boosting earnings by $29 million or $0.16 per share above target. Additionally, we experienced some unfavorable nonpandemic impacts to mortality and morbidity that I will discuss further in the life and group protection commentary. 
Our underlying earnings power continues to be strong as we exit the quarter. Net income totaled $220 million or $1.20 per share. A strong performance from our credit portfolio was offset by hedge breakage and noneconomic variable annuity nonperformance risk. For the full year, net income EPS came in at 91% of adjusted operating EPS, with the difference primarily driven by noneconomic variable annuity nonperformance risk. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Average account values increased 10%. A continued focus on expense management led to a 10-basis-point improvement in our expense ratio. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% and stands at $78.05, an all-time high. 
Before turning to the segments, I want to provide an update on the Spark initiative as we close out the year. Last quarter, we provided details in Spark, which we expect will result in $260 million to $300 million pretax in run rate savings by the end of 2024, and this remains unchanged. Looking at 2022, we expect a net impact in a negative $25 million to $65 million range pretax as this year will be the peak investment year for the initiatives. This compares to an immaterial impact in 2021 as we were able to accelerate savings to offset the investments made. As a reminder, we will run the investment through the other operations segment, while the savings will be spread throughout the businesses. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $332 million compared to $289 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher account values, which were the result of growth in the equity markets and expense efficiency. Average account values of $171 billion increased 13% year-over-year, while revenue growth of 10% for the quarter resulted in a 110-basis-point improvement in the expense ratio. 
Return metrics remained excellent, with return on assets coming in at 78 basis points and return on equity at 25%. Risk metrics on our VA book once again demonstrate the quality of our in flows, with an at amount at risk at 53 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 34 basis points for death benefits. 2021 was another excellent year for the Annuity business, and we are well positioned for continued strong performance in 2022. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $57 million compared to $49 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase driven by higher fees and account values, positive full year net flows and continued expense efficiency. Favorable equity markets and the positive flows drove fourth quarter average account values up 17% to $98 billion. The expense ratio improved 40 basis points over the prior year quarter and 170 basis points for the year, driven by continued diligent expense management. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 2 basis points versus the prior year quarter and 7 basis points for the full year, better than our previously communicated 10- to 15-basis-point range, a result of continued management of crediting rates. Going forward, we expect spread decline to be in the 5- to 10-basis-point range. Overall, another excellent year for the Retirement business, capped off by a great quarter, positioning the business for continued success in 2022. 
Turning to Life Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $80 million versus $144 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's results were impacted by pandemic claims and unfavorable underlying mortality with some offset from alternative investment income. Elevated mortality related to the pandemic was $66 million in the quarter compared to $113 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's impact per 10,000 U.S. COVID deaths improved year-over-year and sequentially as expected. In addition to the impacts of the pandemic, underlying mortality was negatively impacted by $24 million. This was primarily driven by claims incurred during the third quarter, but not reported until the fourth. For full year 2021, excluding the impact of the pandemic, our actual to expected mortality ratio came in at 100%. 
While alternative investment income was less favorable than the prior year quarter, the current quarter did include $22 million of excess alternative investment income. Our recent block reinsurance transaction reduced life earnings by $10 million, in line with our expectations. And as a reminder, the results from the prior year quarter included a $20 million favorable onetime item. Key metrics impacted by the transaction include average account values, which would have been up 7%, excluding impacts from the deal and base spreads which were favorably impacted and should move back towards our expectation of a 5- to 10-basis-point decrease annually. While strong sales drove an increase in the quarterly expense ratio, we did see improvement in the full year results with the expense ratio declining 20 basis points. Though we continue to expect some impacts from the pandemic, growth in earnings drivers underlying long-term mortality results in line with expectations and continued expense discipline, keep us optimistic about the future of the business. 
Group Protection reported an operating loss of $115 million compared to an operating loss of $42 million in the prior year quarter, with the decrease primarily driven by $131 million of pandemic claims. Additionally, Group earnings were negatively impacted by other items during the quarter, including $25 million to $30 million of seasonally higher fourth quarter disability claims expenses and approximately $15 million of underlying disability results. We attribute the underlying disability results to a combination of normal quarterly volatility and and indirect influence of the pandemic. 
Like prior quarters, the pandemic impact was primarily mortality related, with $115 million of life claims and $16 million of disability claims. The life claim impact per 10,000 U.S. Coast declined from third quarter levels to $9.2 million as the percentage of working age tests declined somewhat. While the pandemic impact on group earnings will vary quarter-to-quarter, we remain confident that the fundamentals of the business are solid and the actions we are taking will, over time, get us to the high end of our targeted margin range. 
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.4 billion of statutory capital and estimate our RBC ratio at 428%. The NAIC's new C1 factors went into effect at year-end, which lowered our RBC ratio by approximately 20 percentage points this quarter. Cash at the holding company stands at $1.1 billion, above our $450 million target as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity and retained $400 million of proceeds from the life block sale for additional incremental share repurchases. these will commence shortly via an accelerated share repurchase program that should be completed by the end of the first quarter. 
We deployed $650 million towards buybacks in the fourth quarter, including $150 million of ongoing quarterly share repurchases and $500 million in incremental share repurchases with proceeds from the block reinsurance deal. As I mentioned last quarter, the timing of ongoing buyback may be influenced by the accelerated share repurchase program. 
To conclude, 2021 was certainly a year that continued to be challenged by the pandemic. But as we enter 2022, we feel confident in our ability to continue to tackle any challenges that lie ahead as we have positioned Lincoln to continue its track record of delivering for customers, employees and shareholders. 
In summary, we delivered on our promises to customers with nearly $650 million of pandemic-related earnings impacts, while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, ending the year with estimated RBC ratio of 428%, while absorbing the impact from the C1 factor changes. We continued to achieve organic growth with a portfolio, including new and innovative products, driving strong returns. We delivered powerful earnings growth, with reported operating EPS, excluding notable items, up 20%. We continued our strong track record of capital return with $1.4 billion of buybacks and dividends, and with the addition of the Spark initiative have positioned Lincoln to continue to grow EPS over the next 3 years at or above our long-term aspirations of 8% to 10%. With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

A number of factors that drove that outcome, which was in line with our expectations. We went back to the fourth quarter of last year first, we talked about, that was the point when all of our products have been repriced over shortly to be upward priced. And so we expected sales to be at a low point at that moment in time. So we're comparing to the low point from a life sales standpoint. And then in addition to all those repriced products, this year, we added, as Dennis mentioned, 7 new products. He used 1 example, MoneyGuard, a MoneyGuard product, variable MoneyGuard product, which did not exist in the fourth quarter of last year, but represented 42% of the sales in that particular product area. 
Dennis also mentioned some new distribution partners in the P&C channel, and that really drove some great results, especially in the term business. So it's a combination, Tom, of all of those new products, the fact that last year was as we communicated and expected low point. And then the third factor I would just mention, the fourth quarter is typically, in a normal year, the biggest quarter for life sales. It's been that way as long as I've been in the industry. So that's what I would say, Tom."

867423,1761694054,2484111,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Yes. Tom, thanks for the question. I think, from a starting point, you've got the pandemic, which, over the back half of 2021, started to hit group businesses, not just at Lincoln, across the industry in a more material way that was, we believe, as I've h",644,"Yes. Tom, thanks for the question. I think, from a starting point, you've got the pandemic, which, over the back half of 2021, started to hit group businesses, not just at Lincoln, across the industry in a more material way that was, we believe, as I've heard others talk about, had to do with the shift in who was dying from COVID, an approximate doubling of the working age population percentage of COVID-related deaths. That came down a little bit in the fourth quarter and went from 40% in the third quarter to 35% in the fourth quarter. And I think that was the driver of why our mortality impact came down a little bit. But, once again, group business, our group business across the industry, when I look at it, got hit in a similar way and that impact grew over the course of 2021. It culminated in the fourth quarter an impact of $131 million, $150 million of that for mortality. So that's that aspect. 
Now there are 2 other aspects about our quarter, and let me talk about those. The first is, I talked about in my prepared remarks, Tom, $15 million of underlying negative results in our disability business. You can really see that in the loss ratio. If you exclude the pandemic in our disability business, we had about an 87% loss ratio in the fourth quarter. That was a little over $83 million last year in the fourth quarter, so up about 4 points. And that's that $15 million of underlying negative results that I talked about. 
I think there's 2 factors in there. First, we saw a blip in severity. Severity is run at a pretty tight channel for an extended period of time, and we saw it jump up this quarter. We think that's sort of normal volatility, and I mentioned that in my script. The other factor that we see when we look at our results is incidents, which ticked up a little bit. We think that's more influenced by the pandemic. If you think about care across the United States health care system throughout the pandemic, I think there's been some deferred care, there are some other things that have caused a slight tick up in incidence. And I think that's going to take a little longer to work out. I think we're going to be working on that over the course of 2022. So that's the underlying component. Additionally, I talked about the seasonality, which we hear at Lincoln, have seen, for some time in the fourth quarter, $25 million to $30 million. That's made up of expenses, which typically go up a little bit in the fourth quarter and then on the disability results. When we think about why do we have seasonality in the fourth quarter in our disability results, there's really 3 things that we typically see. The first is on the incident side. 
We really have to do our biggest incurral quarter from an SPD standpoint is the second quarter, and so we can, in those roll, in the fourth quarter after a 6-month waiting period. The second factor we typically see is resolutions. Seasonally, they're lowest in the fourth quarter. We think that has a lot to do with holidays, et cetera, doctors' offices, it's just harder to get information. So we typically see -- we still have a good result, but seasonally, we typically see it at its lowest level in the fourth quarter, and we saw that again. And then last slide is, we typically also see seasonally our social security offset dropped in the fourth quarter. And once again, we saw that. So that's what we attribute the seasonal aspect. I would expect that to go back to what we've seen in the first quarter. So I hope that helps, Tom? That answers your question?"

The outflows are made up of both a little bit more on the fixed annuity side, which is a result of our repricing of that business.

On the VA side, I think what we're seeing -- I think what we're seeing is our ratio of -- so the ongoing surrenders and so forth is staying pretty consistent. But at the same time, account values are going up, and so you have a little bit more of a top value impact on the outflow rate. So we're confident of the annuity business to be growing over time. How the net flows work out is a function of a couple of different things, but good business. I would say, we're getting excellent returns on the capital that we're putting behind both the business with guaranteed living benefits as well as the business without guaranteeing benefits, including benefits. And I'll just come back to what we've been saying about this business for a long time by staying in the market consistently, in good times and bad times, we have produced 1 of the best quality in-force books of business in the industry, and we expect that to continue and to help drive earnings over the next couple of years."

Now in and of itself, the growth, I think it's -- once again, it's similar to the life story. The fourth quarter of last year was the lowest quarter we've ever had. It was a very low fourth quarter 2020. So I think some of that growth, if you look at more recent quarters, sequential quarters, a much more smooth pattern of growth, there's no specific strategy to, ""Hey, we're going to grow VA with living benefits or we're going to grow this."" Once again, we -- our strategy is to price the products appropriately, have a very diversified portfolio and let consumers choose among those products as their preferences shift. What we believe that's going to lead to over time is something similar to what you saw this year, right? About 1/4 of our sales over the course of 2021 were VAs with guarantees, about 75% were fixed or VAs witout guarantees. I think that's a reasonable expectation. And that mix, over time, should pull our overall account value mix towards that over time. And just as a reminder, Dennis said in his script, we've reached a point now where less than 50% of our account values are VA with guarantees. And the current sales mix is about 25%.

867423,1761694054,2484330,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Al. Good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and full year, we, again, experienced elevated claims related to U.S. COVID deaths.

In the fourth quarter and full year, we, again, experienced elevated claims related to U.S. COVID deaths. Since the pandemic's onset, we have been providing important financial protection for our customers, bearing the most serious global health crisis in over a century. Despite the magnitude of claims, our earnings have been strong enough to continue our share repurchase program, provide capital for new sales and maintain our overall financial strength.  
Looking through the significant COVID claims experienced in 2021, and adjusting out excess alternative income and notable items, we view underlying earnings power at about $10.50 per share, up 13% over 2020's comparable figure and representing 14% underlying ROE on book value, excluding AOCI. We saw broad-based sales growth this year in most of our businesses, good expense management, significant share repurchases and an improved capital position. Looking forward, we expect EPS growth to meet or exceed our long-term expectations, also supported by our actions to increase sales, significant expense savings related to the Spark Initiative and share buybacks.  
Turning to our earnings growth drivers. As interest rates dropped, we started a new product strategy to reprice our portfolio to achieve target returns, shift our emphasis to less capital-intensive products and add new solutions that expand our consumer value propositions. We have been executing against this strategy and achieving our objectives. During 2021, we introduced 13 new products, with more planned in early 2022. We continued our disciplined repricing across our portfolio, contributing to strong new business returns. 
By combining these actions with the power of our distribution, we achieved significant 2021 sales growth in most businesses and drove increased operating revenues across all our businesses. We continue to successfully manage expenses, while improving operational effectiveness and the customer and producer experience. Lincoln has a long history of successful cost savings initiatives, most recent of which is our Spark Initiative, as announced last quarter.  
By improving efficiency, leveraging automation and upskilling our workers, we expect Spark to be very additive to our compound annual EPS growth rate from 2021 through 2024. Finally, share buybacks have been and are expected to remain an important element of our EPS growth.  
Now turning to the business segments. In Annuities, sales grew 20% compared to the prior year quarter and 4% for the full year. We expanded consumer choice within our already broad product portfolio and added new producers to our industry-leading distribution force. Full year sales growth was driven by sales of variable annuities without guaranteed living benefits. Our sales of VAs with living benefits are generating strong returns, helped by a favorable competitive environment, rising rates and the return-enhancing flow reinsurance deal we executed in the third quarter. 
The ongoing shift in sales mix towards products without living benefits started several years ago. We further advanced that effort by launching an index variable annuity in 2018. We supported the launch with increased shelf space and have since continued to innovate, adding new investment options to both our indexed VA and our traditional VA without living benefits. As a result, VAs without living benefits have risen to over 70% of VA sales, more than twice their percentage in 2018.  
The strategic sales shift has also diversified our account value mix. VAs with living benefits now account for less than half of our in-force annuity account value. And based on our current sales mix, will continue to decline. We entered 2022 with solid footing in the annuities business, with strong coordination among manufacturing, risk management and distribution. In Retirement Plan Services, we are successfully capitalizing on the opportunities in the market, thanks to our innovative product portfolio, differentiated high-tech, high-touch service model and breadth and depth of distribution.  
Fourth quarter total deposits were up double digits, both sequentially and compared to the prior year quarter. Full year total deposits rose 8% to $10.8 billion, a record, with growth in both first year sales and recurring deposits, contributing to our seventh consecutive year of positive net flows. Retirement Plan Services enters 2022 in terrific shape with a robust sales pipeline and an expanded product portfolio. 
We are benefiting from the improved environment for retirement businesses as wage growth, contribution rates and increases in employer deposits are all serving as tailwinds for deposit growth. Finally, we remain well positioned competitively in our target markets of small and mid case 401(k), healthcare, government and not-for-profit as evidenced by our consistent multiyear track record of positive net flows and strong returns. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We entered 2021 with a well-positioned portfolio of solutions, repriced to ensure strong returns in a low interest rate environment. Throughout 2021, we launched new innovative risk-sharing solutions to help grow the top line. We introduced 7 new products, contributing to fourth quarter sales growth of 53% sequentially and 121% over the prior year quarter. This sales strength was broad-based with every major product category reporting double-digit growth, including record term life sales and substantial growth in executive benefits.  
Even more significantly, nearly 30% of our sales this quarter consisted of solutions and features that didn't exist before 2021. For instance, variable MoneyGuard represented 42% of total MoneyGuard sales. In 2021, we also continued to build on our distribution force, adding over 12,000 new producers who had never sold a Lincoln Life policy before. An example of this growth was in our new partnership in the P&C channel. New producers across channels are finding our repositioned and expanded product portfolio attractive, demonstrating the synergies between our product innovation and distribution expansion.  
Finally, we continued to build on our digital capabilities. In 2021, our cost per life application continued to decline as our automated underwriting and digital processing capabilities are driving efficiencies, while improving the customer experience. In 2022, we will continue to innovate with product launches planned for the first half of the year, expand our distribution franchise and enhance our operations with digital investments.  
Now moving to Group Protection. Let me focus first on profitability. The group business is managing through a challenging environment as pandemic claims increased in the fourth quarter. Group's full year underlying margins normalized for above-target alternative income, pandemic claims and a notable item was slightly below our targeted 5% to 7% range. We expect to achieve ongoing margin improvement in group building to the high end of our target, with improvement coming from a 3-part strategic effort. 
First, is continued pricing discipline. We've strengthened pricing in 2020 and continue to make additional changes where necessary. Second is claims management, including our ongoing investment in claims staffing, combined with a more streamlined and effective approach to claims operations. Lastly, is cost efficiency aided by our recently announced Spark Initiative. We expect these 3 efforts to drive approximately equal contributions to margin expansion. 
Turning to the top line. We achieved 4% premium growth for the year and 6% for the quarter, which is a result of strong persistency, up over 2 percentage points for the full year to 89.2% and successful execution of ongoing rate increases. Sales declined 17% for the full year and 14% in the fourth quarter as we maintained our pricing discipline. Our focus on strategic market segments has resulted in an increase in employee paid products, which comprised 43% of total sales in 2021, up from 39% in 2020. And we are starting to see a shift towards supplemental health solutions, including our new hospital indemnity product. This shift is still in its early days, but we expect it will ultimately add to our earnings diversity and consumer value propositions.  
Although the pandemic is a challenging time, the group business remains a key contributor to Lincoln's diversified business portfolio, and we are confident in its earnings potential. A few words on one of our key competitive advantages, our powerful distribution force. As the industry continually evolves, the strength of our distribution franchises remain a constant. We are known in the marketplace for a consistent distribution presence with broad reach across distribution channels. 
Over 90,000 active producers sell our products. And through strategic investments in technology and training, we are influencing where and how we engage with financial professionals leading with a virtual first model for the long term. As wholesalers and reps have begun to meet in person with their clients, they continue to leverage virtual tools, which improve the service we deliver, raise productivity and help lower costs. And our efforts are being recognized as we received 2 industry awards in 2021 for innovation in virtual training and digital marketing. 
Briefly on investments. The fourth quarter capped the year of outstanding results. We again reported excellent credit performance with another quarter of positive net ratings migration and negligible losses. In 2021, the portion of our fixed income assets rated investment grade or equivalent rose to 97%. This quarter, we invested new money at 2.9%, a 20 basis point sequential increase as we continue to benefit from a multi-manager platform. 
During 2021, we invested 65% of new money in assets other than public corporates, yielding approximately 100 basis points more than comparably rated public corporates of similar duration. For full year 2021, our new money duration fell to about 7.5 years from 10 years, with the decline reflecting Lincoln's disciplined approach to asset liability management, and our shift to a less interest-rate-sensitive product mix. 
Finally, we reported a quarterly return on alternative investments of 4%, compared to our targeted return of 2.5%. For the year, we generated an outstanding 29% return, versus our 10% annual targeted return. 
In summary, the claims environment has been challenging, but full year 2021 underlying EPS grew substantially. We expect our top line momentum to continue. We expect the smart cost savings initiative, which will more than offset spread compression to add to our EPS growth over the next few years, enabled by our balance sheet and earnings strength, we continue to return capital to shareholders. In sum, our earnings power continues to grow, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve underlying EPS growth at or above the high end of our 8% to 10% target range. I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $286 million or $1.56 per share. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter.

There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's results were impacted by pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $197 million or $1.08 per share, while results benefited from alternative investment income, boosting earnings by $29 million or $0.16 per share above target. Additionally, we experienced some unfavorable nonpandemic impacts to mortality and morbidity that I will discuss further in the life and Group Protection commentary. 
Our underlying earnings power continues to be strong as we exit the quarter. Net income totaled $220 million or $1.20 per share. A strong performance from our credit portfolio was offset by hedge breakage and noneconomic variable annuity nonperformance risk. For the full year, net income EPS came in at 91% of adjusted operating EPS, with the difference primarily driven by noneconomic variable annuity nonperformance risk. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Average account values increased 10%. A continued focus on expense management led to a 10-basis-point improvement in our expense ratio. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% and stands at $78.05, an all-time high. 
Before turning to the segments, I want to provide an update on the Spark Initiative as we close out the year. Last quarter, we provided details in Spark, which we expect will result in $260 million to $300 million pretax in run rate savings by the end of 2024, and this remains unchanged. Looking at 2022, we expect a net impact in a negative $25 million to $65 million range pretax as this year will be the peak investment year for the initiative. This compares to an immaterial impact in 2021 as we were able to accelerate savings to offset the investments made. As a reminder, we will run the investment through the other operations segment, while the savings will be spread throughout the businesses. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $332 million, compared to $289 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher account values, which were the result of growth in the equity markets and expense efficiency. Average account values of $171 billion increased 13% year-over-year, while revenue growth of 10% for the quarter resulted in a 110-basis-point improvement in the expense ratio. 
Return metrics remained excellent, with return on assets coming in at 78 basis points and return on equity at 25%. Risk metrics on our VA book once again demonstrate the quality of our inflows, with an at amount at risk at 53 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 34 basis points for death benefits. 2021 was another excellent year for the Annuity business, and we are well positioned for continued strong performance in 2022. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $57 million compared to $49 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase driven by higher fees and account values, positive full year net flows and continued expense efficiency. Favorable equity markets and the positive flows drove fourth quarter average account values up 17% to $98 billion. The expense ratio improved 40 basis points over the prior year quarter and 170 basis points for the year, driven by continued diligent expense management. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 2 basis points versus the prior year quarter and 7 basis points for the full year, better than our previously communicated 10- to 15-basis-point range, a result of continued management of crediting rates. Going forward, we expect spread decline to be in the 5- to 10-basis-point range. Overall, another excellent year for the Retirement business, capped off by a great quarter, positioning the business for continued success in 2022. 
Turning to Life Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $80 million, versus $144 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's results were impacted by pandemic claims and unfavorable underlying mortality with some offset from alternative investment income. Elevated mortality related to the pandemic was $66 million in the quarter, compared to $113 million in the prior year quarter. 
This quarter's impact per 10,000 U.S. COVID deaths improved year-over-year, and sequentially, as expected. In addition to the impacts of the pandemic, underlying mortality was negatively impacted by $24 million. This was primarily driven by claims incurred during the third quarter, but not reported until the fourth. For full year 2021, excluding the impact of the pandemic, our actual to expected mortality ratio came in at 100%. 
While alternative investment income was less favorable than the prior year quarter, the current quarter did include $22 million of excess alternative investment income. Our recent block reinsurance transaction reduced life earnings by $10 million, in line with our expectations. And as a reminder, the results from the prior year quarter included a $20 million favorable onetime item. Key metrics impacted by the transaction include average account values, which would have been up 7%, excluding impacts from the deal and base spreads which were favorably impacted and should move back towards our expectation of 5- to 10-basis-point decrease annually. 
While strong sales drove an increase in the quarterly expense ratio, we did see improvement in the full year results with the expense ratio declining 20 basis points. Though we continue to expect some impacts from the pandemic, growth in earnings drivers, underlying long-term mortality results in line with expectations and continued expense discipline, keep us optimistic about the future of the business. 
Group Protection reported an operating loss of $115 million, compared to an operating loss of $42 million in the prior year quarter, with the decrease primarily driven by $131 million of pandemic claims. Additionally, Group earnings were negatively impacted by other items during the quarter, including $25 million to $30 million of seasonally higher fourth quarter disability claims expenses and approximately $15 million of underlying disability results. We attribute the underlying disability results to a combination of normal quarterly volatility and indirect influence of the pandemic. 
Like prior quarters, the pandemic impact was primarily mortality related, with $115 million of life claims and $16 million of disability claims. The life claim impact per 10,000 U.S. COVID deaths from third quarter levels to $9.2 million as the percentage of working age tests declined somewhat. While the pandemic impact on Group earnings will vary quarter-to-quarter, we remain confident that the fundamentals of the business are solid and the actions we are taking will, over time, get us to the high end of our targeted margin range. 
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.4 billion of statutory capital and estimate our RBC ratio at 428%. The NAIC's new C1 factors went into effect at year-end, which lowered our RBC ratio by approximately 20 percentage points this quarter. Cash at the holding company stands at $1.1 billion, above our $450 million target as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity and retained $400 million of proceeds from the life block sale for additional incremental share repurchases. These will commence shortly via an accelerated share repurchase program that should be completed by the end of the first quarter. 
We deployed $650 million towards buybacks in the fourth quarter, including $150 million of ongoing quarterly share repurchases and $500 million in incremental share repurchases with proceeds from the block reinsurance deal. As I mentioned last quarter, the timing of ongoing buyback may be influenced by the accelerated share repurchase program. 
To conclude, 2021 was certainly a year that continued to be challenged by the pandemic. But as we enter 2022, we feel confident in our ability to continue to tackle any challenges that lie ahead as we have positioned Lincoln to continue its track record of delivering for customers, employees and shareholders. 
In summary, we delivered on our promises to customers with nearly $650 million of pandemic-related earnings impacts, while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, ending the year with estimated RBC ratio of 428%, while absorbing the impact from the C1 factor changes. We continued to achieve organic growth with a portfolio, including new and innovative products, driving strong returns. 
We delivered powerful earnings growth, with reported operating EPS, excluding notable items, up 20%. We continued our strong track record of capital return with $1.4 billion of buybacks and dividends, and with the addition of the Spark Initiative have positioned Lincoln to continue to grow EPS over the next 3 years at or above our long-term aspirations of 8% to 10%. With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

A number of factors that drove that outcome, which was in line with our expectations. We went back to the fourth quarter of last year first, we talked about, that was the point when all of our products had been repriced over shortly to be replay upward priced. And so we expected sales to be at a low point at that moment in time. So we're comparing to the low point from a life sales standpoint. And then in addition to all those repriced products, this year, we added, as Dennis mentioned, 7 new products. He used one example, MoneyGuard, a MoneyGuard product, variable MoneyGuard product, which did not exist in the fourth quarter of last year, but represented 42% of the sales in that particular product area. 
Dennis also mentioned some new distribution partners in the P&C channel, and that really drove some great results, especially in the term business. So it's a combination, Tom, of all of those new products, the fact that last year was as we communicated and expected, low point. And then the third factor I would just mention, the fourth quarter is typically, in a normal year, the biggest quarter for life sales. It's been that way as long as I've been in the industry. So that's what I would say, Tom."

867423,1761694054,2484330,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Yes. Tom, thanks for the question. I think, from a starting point, you've got the pandemic, which, over the back half of 2021, started to hit Group businesses, not just at Lincoln, across the industry in a more material way that was, we believe, as I've h",642,"Yes. Tom, thanks for the question. I think, from a starting point, you've got the pandemic, which, over the back half of 2021, started to hit Group businesses, not just at Lincoln, across the industry in a more material way that was, we believe, as I've heard others talk about, had to do with the shift in who was dying from COVID, an approximate doubling of the working age population percentage of COVID-related deaths. That came down a little bit in the fourth quarter and went from 40% in the third quarter to 35% in the fourth quarter. And I think that was the driver of why our mortality impact came down a little bit. 
But, once again, Group business, our Group business across the industry, when I look at it, got hit in a similar way and that impact grew over the course of 2021. It culminated in the fourth quarter, an impact of $131 million, $150 million of that for mortality. So that's that aspect. 
Now there are 2 other aspects about our quarter, and let me talk about those. The first is, I talked about in my prepared remarks, Tom, $15 million of underlying negative results in our disability business. You can really see that in the loss ratio. If you exclude the pandemic in our disability business, we had about an 87% loss ratio in the fourth quarter. That was a little over 83% last year in the fourth quarter, so up about 4 points. And that's that $15 million of underlying negative results that I talked about. 
I think there's 2 factors in there. First, we saw a blip in severity. Severity is run at a pretty tight channel for an extended period of time, and we saw it jump up this quarter. We think that's sort of normal volatility, and I mentioned that in my script. The other factor that we see when we look at our results is incidents, which ticked up a little bit. We think that's more influenced by the pandemic. If you think about care across the United States healthcare system throughout the pandemic, I think there's been some deferred care, there are some other things that have caused a slight tick up in incidence. 
And I think that's going to take a little longer to work out. I think we're going to be working on that over the course of 2022. So that's the underlying component. Additionally, I talked about the seasonality, which we hear at Lincoln, have seen, for some time in the fourth quarter, $25 million to $30 million. That's made up of expenses, which typically go up a little bit in the fourth quarter and then on the disability results, when we think about why do we have seasonality in the fourth quarter in our disability results, there's really 3 things that we typically see. The first is on the incident side. 
We really have to do our biggest incurral quarter from an SPD standpoint is the second quarter, and so we can, in those roll, in the fourth quarter after a 6-month waiting period, the second factor we typically see is resolutions. Seasonally, they're lowest in the fourth quarter. We think that has a lot to do with holidays, et cetera, doctors' offices, it's just harder to get information. So we typically see -- we still have a good result, but seasonally, we typically see it at its lowest level in the fourth quarter, and we saw that again. 
And then last side is, we typically also see seasonally our social security offset dropped in the fourth quarter. And once again, we saw that. So that's what we attribute the seasonal aspect. And we expect that to go back to what we've seen in the first quarter. So I hope that helps, Tom? That answers your question?"

The outflows are made up of both, a little bit more on the fixed annuity side, which is a result of our repricing of that business.

On the VA side, I think what we're seeing -- I think what we're seeing is our ratio of -- so the ongoing surrenders and so forth is staying pretty consistent. But at the same time, account values are going up, and so you have a little bit more account value impact on the outflow rate. 
So we're confident of the annuity business to be growing over time. How the net flows work out is a function of a couple of different things. But good business. I would say, we're getting excellent returns on the capital that we're putting behind both the business with guaranteed living benefits as well as the business without guaranteed benefits, including benefits. And I'll just come back to what we've been saying about this business for a long time by staying in the market consistently, in good times and bad times, we have produced one of the best quality in-force books of business in the industry, and we expect that to continue and to help drive earnings over the next couple of years."

If you remember on the Talcott deal, it had a maximum sales of $1.5 billion and it ran through next June. So yes, that was definitely a component. Now in and of itself, the growth, I think it's -- once again, it's similar to the life story. The fourth quarter of last year was the lowest quarter we've ever had. It was a very low fourth quarter 2020. So I think some of that growth, if you look at more recent quarters, sequential quarters, a much more smooth pattern of growth, there's no specific strategy to, hey, we're going to grow VA with living benefits or we're going to grow this. 
Once again, we -- our strategy is to price the products appropriately, have a very diversified portfolio and let consumers choose from among those products as their preferences shift. What we believe that's going to lead to over time is something similar to what you saw this year, right? About 1/4 of our sales over the course of 2021 were VAs with guarantees, about 75% were fixed or VAs without guarantees. I think that's a reasonable expectation. 
And that mix, over time, should pull our overall account value mix towards that over time. And just as a reminder, Dennis said in his script, we've reached a point now where less than 50% of our account values are VA with guarantees. And the current sales mix is about 25%. So it will take a long time, but that's where you would eventually expect to move over time."

I am excited about and confident in Lincoln's continued success as I step into the CEO role effective later this month.

I am excited about and confident in Lincoln's continued success as I step into the CEO role effective later this month. Dennis has been a valued mentor and colleague for many years, and I look forward to working with him as he transitions into the role of Chairman of the Board. I have met many of the investors and analysts joining today's call and look forward to having more opportunities to discuss Lincoln with all of you. Although the U.S. continued to experience headwinds related to the pandemic, Lincoln had a solid start to 2022. We are pleased with our underlying results and optimistic about the outlook for our business. Our current strategy has proven to be robust and we have an excellent track record of executing against it as demonstrated in part by having compounded underlying EPS at 11% over the past decade, as we have said, we expect over the next few years to grow underlying EPS at or above the high end of our 8% to 10% target range. I will now touch on some of the initiatives that are positioning us to meet this objective. First, we continue to generate organic growth at strong new business returns meaningfully above target across our businesses, driven by our broad product portfolio and our industry-leading distribution franchise. Top line growth is enhanced by our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, which is enabling us to meet evolving consumer needs. We have been able to drive a shift towards products with additional risk sharing between Lincoln and customers that appeal to broader demographics and expand shelf space. We introduced 13 new products in 2021 and continue to innovate. Second, company-wide margin improvement efforts are primarily centered around our Spark initiative, which we expect to generate $260 million to $300 million in run rate savings by the end of 2024. Investments we are making in our business through Spark will enable us to operate more efficiently and effectively and to improve the customer and employee experience, including the way we work here at Lincoln. Additionally, we are focused on improving the group protection underlying margin through continued pricing actions, improved claims effectiveness and Spark expense savings. And last, we continue to focus on effective capital allocation, including returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Recently, we announced that we are bringing our individual life and annuities businesses together under a senior leader who will join Lincoln in July and report to me. Product manufacturing has long been a key driver of the success of these businesses, and we see this continuing as we also place continued emphasis on in-force management, bringing the life and annuities businesses together creates more opportunity to leverage our capabilities, share best practices and enable greater innovation. This new leader will also oversee Lincoln Financial Network, or LFN, which represents more than 11,000 advisers and our growing wealth management platform. 
Turning now to the business segments. Starting with annuities. Our products are generating strong returns as we continue to sell on our terms across broadly diversified product segments with disciplined pricing and risk management built directly into the product design. Critical to our success in meeting the needs of our customers is offering a broad product portfolio through our industry-leading distribution force. We continue to enhance our product offerings, including the launch of multiple new investment options and features that differentiate our products and expand consumer choice. 
Sales of $2.7 billion were down 4% versus the prior year period due to a decline in indexed variable annuities. However, IVA sales were up sequentially for the second consecutive quarter as we regain sales momentum through our product innovation and an improved competitive pricing environment. In fixed indexed annuities, sales were up again significantly. Our differentiated investment options and higher rates have restored momentum to the FIA product line. The breadth of our annuity portfolio is enabling our strategic sales shift and variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits remain under 30% of total annuity sales for the 7th consecutive quarter. Our ongoing sales shift also is further diversifying the total annuities in-force account value mix as variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits again, represented less than half of total account value. At our current sales mix, this proportion will continue to decline. 
To be clear, we have been undertaking this mix shift for diversification purposes only as we believe in the value proposition of guaranteed living benefits for customers and are achieving very attractive mid-20% ROEs. We expect to see continued momentum as we look to further grow the Annuities business. Retirement Plan Services continues to have success and achieved record first quarter net flows of $946 million. First quarter total deposits of $3.4 billion were up 28%, including an 11% rise in recurring deposits and a 73% increase in first year sales. This sales growth, combined with high customer retention led to the quarter's excellent outcome. The retirement business is benefiting from the strong labor market. U.S. wage growth and increases in employee contribution rates were the main drivers of this quarter's recurring deposit growth. We also saw robust first year sales growth across our broad product portfolio. Another external factor that constructive legislative environment is also creating longer-term growth opportunities for RPS around in-plan guarantees and pooled employer plan solutions as well as by creating greater incentives for employers to establish plans. Beyond these external tailwinds is the favorable competitive positioning of RPS, with its broad innovative product suite, enhanced digital capabilities and the power of Lincoln's distribution franchise. The retirement business continues to produce strong returns and to drive positive net flows. 
Our Life Insurance business continues to demonstrate broad-based top line momentum as sales of $155 million were up 36% over the prior year period with growth across all major product lines. Since undertaking our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, we have returned to a more typical seasonal sales pattern and expect sales to ramp up through the end of the year. Our Life portfolio is achieving new business targeted returns and we continue to attract new financial professionals for instance, with our successful rollout last year a first-of-its-kind variable hybrid life product, MoneyGuard Market Advantage. This ongoing product innovation is expanding our access to new customer segments while advancing our sales mix shift towards lower guarantee risk sharing solutions, which represent over 70% of total life sales. 
We continue to expand upon and to see strong adoption of our digital capabilities. For example, in underwriting, we are investing in automation and other technologies that drive internal efficiencies. We are also utilizing digital real-time medical information. This is helping improve the producer and consumer experience by decreasing the average issue time from 5 weeks to 2 with the capability to issue within the same day. 
Lastly, on Group Protection, our results continue to be impacted by the pandemic. However, we are beginning to see signs of improvement and are confident that underlying margins will build over time toward the upper end of our target 5% to 7% range. The strong demand for employee benefits helped drive sales of $105 million, up 42% compared to the prior year period. We generated growth across all case sizes, primarily driven by increased sales to existing clients as our corporate customers hire more employees, raise salaries and expand benefits offerings to include new lines of coverage. Employee-paid sales represented 57% of the total this quarter. We expect the proportion of employee-paid sales to continue to rise over time on an annualized basis as we focus on growing in this market, including supplemental health. First quarter premiums of nearly $1.2 billion rose 4% compared to the prior year period, driven by new sales, improved persistency, rate increases and employment growth. I am pleased that this quarter's underlying results and confident our strategic actions will drive margin expansion over time to the top of our targeted range. 
Moving to investment results. Credit quality remains excellent with 97% of our fixed income assets rated investment grade or investment-grade equivalent. Portfolio performance remains strong as we experienced another quarter of negligible credit losses and positive net ratings migration. New money yields rose to 3.3% in the first quarter and nearly 50 basis point sequential increase, driven by higher rates. During the quarter, we invested 60% of new money in assets other than public corporates and expect to continue to invest at this level, adding high-quality assets with incremental yield. Finally, alternative investment performance was in line with our long-term expectations of a 2.5% quarterly or 10% annualized return. 
In closing, Lincoln's underlying earnings power is intact. We expect to benefit from the recent significant decline in pandemic hospitalizations and death and the rise in interest rates. Looking across our businesses, we are progressing on several fronts. Sales momentum continues to build, driven by our broad and innovative product portfolio and distribution strength. The Spark initiative is on track and group protection margin expansion efforts take hold. We will continue to allocate capital towards its highest and best use. In closing, we continue to execute on our near-term strategy with an eye toward long-term profitable growth. I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $294 million or $1.66 per share. The quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $150 million or $0.85 per share and unusual items of $1",1404,"Thank you, Ellen. Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $294 million or $1.66 per share. The quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $150 million or $0.85 per share and unusual items of $19 million or $0.11 per share, primarily related to a group protection customer to being a backlog of prior year claims. As Ellen mentioned, alternative investment income was in line with long-term expectations. Net income for the first quarter totaled $104 million or $0.58 per share, with the difference between net income and adjusted operating income, primarily resulting from a loss related to variable annuity net derivative results. The hedge program was 96% effective in what was a volatile quarter of the capital [indiscernible]. With the recent increase in rates this year, I thought I would update you on spread compression at Lincoln. Our current expectation is that spread compression will impact EPS growth in the near term by 0% to 1%, improved from the 2% to 3% range I communicated on last quarter's earnings call. Touching on the performance of key financial metrics compared to the prior year, excluding excess alternative investment income in the prior year quarter and the impact of the third quarter 2021 block reinsurance transaction on a consolidated basis. Operating revenues were up 4%. Our expense ratio improved 20 basis points. Shares outstanding declined 10% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $78.32, up 8% and an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $302 million compared to $290 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher account values driven by year-over-year growth in the equity markets and expense efficiency. Average account values of $164 billion increased 2% year-over-year. Of note, and as Ellen pointed out, variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits now represent less than 50% of our annuity account values. 
For variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, the net amount at stands at 134 basis points for living benefits and 107 basis points for death benefits. We expect these percentages to remain at the very low end of peers, highlighting the lower risk nature of our in-force business. 
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declined 3% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Return metrics remained solid with a return on assets of 74 basis points, up 2 basis points year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%. As a reminder, sequentially, there were 2 fewer fee days in the quarter, which reduced earnings by roughly $8 million. Overall, a good result for the annuity business, highlighted by strong returns and effective expense discipline. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $55 million compared to $57 million in the prior year quarter, as strong net flows and a year-over-year increase in the equity markets were more than offset by less favorable variable investment income. Continued sales success has produced $1.1 billion in net flows over the trailing 12 months, contributing to a 7% increase in average account values to $96 billion. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were in line with prior year quarter. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed to 6 basis points versus the prior year quarter, in line with our stated 5 to 10 basis point range as crediting rate actions take hold. Benefiting from the increase in rates, we expect spread compression in the retirement business going forward to be de minimis. This was another great quarter for the retirement business with strong net flows and expense management and an expectation as we exit the quarter that spread compression has become a nonevent for the business. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $58 million compared to $107 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was due to less favorable alternative investment income, a more normal level of underlying mortality and the impact of the resolution deal, which combined more than offset improved pandemic claims. This quarter's earnings were impacted by $69 million of pandemic-related mortality. Average account values, excluding the impact of last year's block reinsurance deal rose 4%. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 1% from the prior year quarter. Base spreads declined 12 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We expect spread compression to return to our 5 to 10 basis point stated range. 
Outside of continued pandemic headwinds and Life results were solid with underlying mortality in line with our first quarter expectations, good expense management and growing sales. Group Protection reported a loss from operations of $41 million compared to a loss of $26 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's loss is a significant improvement over a loss of [ $115 ] million in the fourth quarter as the impact of the pandemic began to ease, and we saw improvement in underlying disability results. 
As noted in my opening comments, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by [ $19 ] million of unusual items. The pandemic impacted our group life results by $53 million and our disability results by $18 million. Group protection pandemic claims relative to U.S. COVID deaths improved significantly from recent quarters due to death transitioning back towards the nonworking edge population. Excluding pandemic claims and unusual items, the group margin was 5.1% at the low end of our targeted range of 5% to 7%. 
On the life side, our underlying loss ratio of 72.9% improved 240 basis points year-over-year to 60 basis points sequentially as results benefited from pricing actions and good underlying experience. Our underlying disability loss ratio of 80.4% improved 680 basis points sequentially, as the seasonally higher claims that we saw in the fourth quarter returned to more normal levels. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2021, our disability underlying loss ratio is up 290 basis points and remains elevated compared to long-term expectations as both incidents and severity are above historic levels. I'd estimate that this certain's group's first quarter results by $10 million to $15 million. We believe our underlying disability results are indirectly influenced by the pandemic has delayed treatments and lack of routine care during peak pandemic ways appears to be impacting the overall health of our claimants. Our claims management efforts are focused on helping our customers recover and get back to work as quickly as possible and should lead to improving underlying disability results over time. Expense ratio was 12.7%, up 20 basis points, primarily due to elevated staffing levels given the volume of pandemic-related claims. We remain confident that the combined impacts of repricing, improved claims management and Spark expenses will move us to the top of our 5% to 7% target range.
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at approximately 415%, while cash at the holding company stands at $755 million. During the quarter, we paid off our $300 million 2022 debt maturity and issued $300 million of new debt as a partial prefunding of our 2023 maturity. We executed a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter, retiring over 3% of shares outstanding. As I mentioned, it was possible on last quarter's earnings conference call, with that level of repurchases, we chose not to pursue any open market buybacks, but we expect these to resume in the second quarter. 
In conclusion, while still affected by the financial impacts of the pandemic, our underlying results remain strong and leading indicators are positive, such as spread compression, which has been with us for many years, has come down dramatically. And as I noted earlier, now represents a very modest headwind to EPS growth of 0% to 1%. Our Group Protection margin enhancement efforts are gaining traction with underlying results returning to the bottom of our targeted margin range. Investments that we are making in the Spark initiative will drive significant expense savings over the next 3 years. While the pandemic is still with us, the combined impact of vaccinations and natural immunity can continue to reduce the potential negative financial impact on Lincoln. And while investing significant capital at strong returns to support new business that will drive our earnings of tomorrow, we are continuing to return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

I think when you think about buybacks in the second quarter, I'd go back to our sort of overarching philosophy when it comes to ongoing share buyback programs, open market programs. Typically, we have used a more levelized approach. We think that makes more sense to avoid the ups and downs of the share price. So I'd expect us in terms of the buybacks, we're going to do over the remainder of the year to spread them more evenly. The other thing I'd point out, there's a fair amount of uncertainty in the environment as we see a good day. There's more going on inflation. There's a question on what the economy is going to do. So I think it's one of those years where you lean towards prudence when it comes to that. More broadly speaking, Nigel, when it comes to capital allocation in general, just as a reminder, right? We have -- we generate a lot of capital. We've generated a lot of capital over the years. We have 2 big places. We put that capital. There's new business, new business, which has historically been about 60% to 65% of our overall capital allocation. You've seen us though at times, flex up or down, right? We flex down when the opportunity is not there. You saw that a couple of years ago when we took sales down, but we flex up when the opportunity is there, both from a return on a sales standpoint. And you really saw that in Ellen's comments. She talked about every business is getting returns meaningfully above their target. There really has not been better time to be issuing new business in our space in some time. So maybe 1 of those years when we flex up a little bit from a new business standpoint, but we'll see if the sales opportunities are over the remainder the year. Then obviously, the other big bucket is return to shareholders. We've done a lot, right? We -- if you look over the last 4 quarters, we've done $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion buybacks, $300 million of dividends. If you look over a longer period of time, that was actually -- it was interesting. I was looking at our long history of returning capital to shareholders. If you go back over the last decade or so, we've actually returned $10.3 billion of capital to shareholders $7.9 billion of that through buybacks. That's I think it represents 46% reduction in our outstanding shares. So yes, we believe in returning capital to shareholders. We're going to get back to buying stock in the second quarter, but I'd expect us to be more levelized over the remainder of the year, and I'd expect us to lean a little on the conservative side."

Should we assume those are unlikely to happen this year? Just anything you can give us on that sort of cadence on near-term buybacks would be helpful."

And we said at the time, we would put $900 million of that into buybacks and the remainder will go into debt reduction. And so we've completed the $900 million of buybacks. So there's that. In terms of -- I agree with you that historically, we've averaged $150 million, and that's, I think, over time, still a long-term expectation. Just as a reminder, with the resolution deal, that $900 million of incremental buybacks we did. That represents about 15 years' worth of distributable earnings, we were going to get off that block of business. But we did give up about $75 million or so of distributable earnings. So in the near term, we've given up that $75 million. 
Now we obviously we'd expect our capital generation to grow over time. But the normal growth we're going to get from our growing business is going to get a little math, at least, I think, for this year. Equity markets are down, those sorts of things. So I think you're not seeing that normal growth in capital generation that we'd see in a typical typical year. So that would lead us to a starting point, a little below the normal $150 million a quarter that you would typically see. And then as I pointed out and you pointed out your question, I think the capital opportunity in new business, well, probably it's early in the year, earlier, so it's tough to project. But when you look at the first quarter and what we expect for the remainder of the year, I think about $100 million to $150 million of incremental capital in the new business this year relative to a normal year. 
So that would put you down, Tom, more into the $100 million a quarter range as annual as a normal expectation. So I put it at $100 million to $150 million. Just one other point, if you had asked me the same question in the first quarter of last year, I would have said the exact same thing probably. I think we ended up doing $105 million in the first quarter of last year, and then we ended up doing $600 million for the full year. So it's somewhat influenced how the environment rolls out over the remainder of the year, Tom."

So you know that I've been with Lincoln now for 10 years and very much and part of really architecting the existing strategy. And everything that we have talked to you about, we are going to continue to execute on. So all things as it relates to our price shift and add new product strategy and really focusing there on organic growth. And you can see real real evidence of that in this particular quarter as we're continuing to build momentum there. The second area is really around expense initiatives and all of the execution that we're doing and very much on track as it relates to the overall Spark initiative. And we've also talked to you about the fact that in addition to that being a cost save program that it very much is focused on improving overall efficiency as it relates to our customers and how we face off with them and also a real focus on the employee experience. So that's very important. And then the third area, which we've also touched on is around restoring our group margin to the higher end. And there, as Randy just talked about, as we both highlighted in our script, we've got all of the pricing actions we're focused on there. Of course, the expense efficiencies through Spark and then the claims effectiveness. So all of that, we're going to continue to execute on. 
As we think about longer term, and we have talked to all of you about the fact that as I'm stepping into the CEO role, we are also thinking about longer-term strategy and overall longer-term direction. And so I'm way too early to communicate anything at this time, but what I will share with you is one of the first things that we have done as part of the transition is we've looked at our overall organizational structure and how that will align with us, thinking about executing on the near-term strategy while we are also focused on building out what that longer-term strategy looks like. And so we've appointed a Chief Strategy Officer that is focused on that now 24/7 and really taking a look at that. And then also our focus on combining the individual life and annuity businesses together, along with LFN and bringing that together is also very much strategic as we think about that. And so if I just step back for a second on that, we very much -- as we think about, for example, our product strategy and how we have focused on product manufacturing over the years. We're starting to see more opportunity for synergy and innovation across the 2 individual businesses. And so examples of that are products that have shifting investment engines, shifting value propositions, where both are thinking about risk sharing is another example there. We see opportunity as it relates to the overall the customer experience and operations. And then this other part that I highlighted, which is a continued emphasis as it relates to overall in-force management and some opportunity there. So more to come. Yes, we'll also take a look at capital management as part of everything that we're going to be doing longer term and as soon as we have something more definitive to be able to talk to you about, we'll, in fact, do that."

So as it relates to a favorable environment, I think we see a couple of things there. The first is, clearly, from a capital markets perspective, we have higher rates. And in general, when we think about higher rates and we have the 10-year now at 3%, this is an opportunity now to be able to invest new money higher, and that translates into offering customers higher value propositions. And so across the board, we think that, that will benefit the overall industry, and it will benefit Lincoln as well. So that's 1 piece.
The second thing that is very much important is that as we continue to manage through this pandemic, and we're now more than 24 months in, we're seeing that it has definitely increased awareness and, therefore, demand for financial protection and security. And so we're seeing real evidence of that, for example, in our Group Protection business, where we saw that sales were up pretty significantly year-over-year. The primary driver of that was inside of the existing clients and seeing increased demand there. The other thing that's happening from a macro environment is that we all know that we're seeing evidence of wage inflation, and we're seeing a direct relationship in terms of increased compensation that is leading to increased for example, on deposits in the retirement business. So across the board and also because there's such a significant focus right now on the overall employment environment and needing to attract talent, we're seeing expansion of benefits as well. And so that's another opportunity there. So I think across the board, there are a number of areas that are providing overall opportunity from a macro and external perspective. 
The other thing that I'll add is that we have done so much in terms of product innovation over the last couple of years that we are seeing that we have more and more attractive financial product. I mentioned in my script that we introduced 13 new products last year in 2021. And so we're seeing that the expansion of product is appealing to expand the demographics and very much so is part of why we also view that this is a favorable environment."

We've averaged taking annual dividends out of LNBar of roughly $125 million over the last 5 years. So we took $85 million in the first quarter. We did have breakage in the first quarter that followed a few quarters of really good results. Last year, I would say that the program didn't have, I think, over the whole year, I think it was about $120 million of breakage, which is a good year. So it was elevated in the first quarter, I think that was really driven by 2 things. If you break up breakage into the 2 big buckets, 1 fund basis went against us in the quarter. So it was about 1/3, I would say, of the excess breakage. As a reminder, fund basis is 1 of those things where we can go back over any extended period of time, it adds up to 0, but it can move up and down. So with a better at this time. I think the other 2/3 was really all about the volatility in the markets that we saw in the first quarter. The total amount hedge target traveled over the quarter was about twice what we saw on average last year. And when you see that sort of volatility, 2 things happen. We have to trade more. And you get some second order breakage. So I think it was 1 of those quarters where we'll have a little elevated breakage. I think when you look -- when we go out a couple of years and look back, what you'll see is that it will be averaged out with some good quarters, and we'll get back to that long-term expectation of some level of breakage.

And so the first thing is that while you are correct that IBA sales year-over-year were down 30%. What we saw is that in the first half of 2021, you may remember that -- we saw rates come down pretty significantly and market volatility also come down. And it required us to really do a pretty significant repricing in that particular time to be able to meet our overall target returns. And so we did that, and we actually led the rest of the industry down. And so we knew at the time that we did that because we will not offer products out on the shelf that is not meeting or exceeding our target returns. We knew when we did that, that we were going to see a pullback in sales, and that's exactly what happens. And so the third quarter really bottomed out in terms of our overall IVA sales. And then we started to see sequential rebound. And so you saw -- if you look at the trend, you can see fourth quarter was a bit better. And then when you look at first quarter, it's up sequentially from where we were in the fourth quarter. And actually, even inside of there, what we saw was momentum building. So January was a little lower. February was a little bit higher from that and March was even higher. So we feel good in terms of where we are. In terms of the overall competitive environment, yes, there are quite a few entrants now in the space, and we know that there are a number that are coming in as well in 2022. We feel really good about our broad product offerings in addition to being competitive with the rest of the market. We have a couple of new and really proprietary index options that we've offered as well as new product features that are unique to our particular product. So between that and the power of our distribution, we feel very good in terms of our overall share of IDA and continuing to sell and really sustain that moment that we're seeing."

This quarter's earnings conference call is a special one as we approach our CEO transition later this month. The transition is going very well and I am incredibly confident that Lincoln under Ellen's leadership will continue to build on our strong foundation. This is an exciting time for Lincoln. We are pleased with our start to 2022 and optimistic as ever about what lies ahead. 
Most importantly, we have a highly talented team of more than 11,000 employees who have risen to meet every challenge that has come their way during the pandemic and before as I have seen them do every day of my 15-year tenure as CEO. My Lincoln colleagues have shown an inspiring and unwavering commitment to our customers, partners and communities. And to them, I say thank you for all you do. I will now turn the call over to Ellen."

I am excited about and confident in Lincoln's continued success as I step into the CEO role effective later this month. Dennis has been a valued mentor and colleague for many years, and I look forward to work",1540,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I am excited about and confident in Lincoln's continued success as I step into the CEO role effective later this month. Dennis has been a valued mentor and colleague for many years, and I look forward to working with him as he transitions into the role of Chairman of the Board. I have met many of the investors and analysts joining today's call and look forward to having more opportunities to discuss Lincoln with all of you. Although the U.S. continued to experience headwinds related to the pandemic, Lincoln had a solid start to 2022. We are pleased with our underlying results and optimistic about the outlook for our business. 
Our current strategy has proven to be robust and we have an excellent track record of executing against it as demonstrated in part by having compounded underlying EPS at 11% over the past decade, as we have said, we expect over the next few years to grow underlying EPS at or above the high end of our 8% to 10% target range. I will now touch on some of the initiatives that are positioning us to meet this objective. First, we continue to generate organic growth at strong new business returns meaningfully above target across our businesses, driven by our broad product portfolio and our industry-leading distribution franchise. Top line growth is enhanced by our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, which is enabling us to meet evolving consumer needs. We have been able to drive a shift towards products with additional risk sharing between Lincoln and customers that appeal to broader demographics and expand shelf space. We introduced 13 new products in 2021 and continue to innovate. 
Second, company-wide margin improvement efforts are primarily centered around our Spark initiative, which we expect to generate $260 million to $300 million in run-rate savings by the end of 2024. Investments we are making in our business through Spark will enable us to operate more efficiently and effectively and to improve the customer and employee experience, including the way we work here at Lincoln. Additionally, we are focused on improving the group protection underlying margin through continued pricing actions, improved claims effectiveness and Spark expense savings. And last, we continue to focus on effective capital allocation, including returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Recently, we announced that we are bringing our Individual Life and Annuities businesses together under a senior leader who will join Lincoln in July and report to me. Product manufacturing has long been a key driver of the success of these businesses, and we see this continuing as we also place continued emphasis on in-force management, bringing the Life and Annuities businesses together creates more opportunity to leverage our capabilities, share best practices and enable greater innovation. This new leader will also oversee Lincoln Financial Network, or LFN, which represents more than 11,000 advisers and our growing wealth management platform. 
Turning now to the business segments. Starting with Annuities. Our products are generating strong returns as we continue to sell on our terms across broadly diversified product segments with disciplined pricing and risk management built directly into the product design. Critical to our success in meeting the needs of our customers is offering a broad product portfolio through our industry-leading distribution force. We continue to enhance our product offerings, including the launch of multiple new investment options and features that differentiate our products and expand consumer choice. 
Sales of $2.7 billion were down 4% versus the prior year period due to a decline in indexed variable annuities. However, IVA sales were up sequentially for the second consecutive quarter as we regain sales momentum through our product innovation and an improved competitive pricing environment. In fixed indexed annuities, sales were up again significantly. Our differentiated investment options and higher rates have restored momentum to the FIA product line. The breadth of our annuity portfolio is enabling our strategic sales shift and variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits remain under 30% of total annuity sales for the 7th consecutive quarter. Our ongoing sales shift also is further diversifying the total annuities in-force account value mix as variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, again, represented less than half of total account value. At our current sales mix, this proportion will continue to decline. 
To be clear, we have been undertaking this mix shift for diversification purposes only as we believe in the value proposition of guaranteed living benefits for customers and are achieving very attractive mid-20% ROEs. We expect to see continued momentum as we look to further grow the Annuities business. Retirement Plan Services continues to have success and achieved record first quarter net flows of $946 million. First quarter total deposits of $3.4 billion were up 28%, including an 11% rise in recurring deposits and a 73% increase in first year sales. This sales growth, combined with high customer retention led to the quarter's excellent outcome. The retirement business is benefiting from the strong labor market. U.S. wage growth and increases in employee contribution rates were the main drivers of this quarter's recurring deposit growth. We also saw robust first year sales growth across our broad product portfolio. 
Another external factor that constructive legislative environment is also creating longer-term growth opportunities for RPS around in-plan guarantees and pooled employer plan solutions as well as by creating greater incentives for employers to establish plans. Beyond these external tailwinds is the favorable competitive positioning of RPS, with its broad innovative product suite, enhanced digital capabilities and the power of Lincoln's distribution franchise. The retirement business continues to produce strong returns and to drive positive net flows. 
Our Life Insurance business continues to demonstrate broad-based top line momentum as sales of $155 million were up 36% over the prior year period with growth across all major product lines. Since undertaking our reprice, shift and add-new-product strategy, we have returned to a more typical seasonal sales pattern and expect sales to ramp up through the end of the year. Our Life portfolio is achieving new business targeted returns and we continue to attract new financial professionals, for instance, with our successful rollout last year, a first-of-its-kind variable hybrid life product, MoneyGuard Market Advantage. This ongoing product innovation is expanding our access to new customer segments while advancing our sales mix shift towards lower guarantee risk-sharing solutions, which represent over 70% of total life sales. 
We continue to expand upon and to see strong adoption of our digital capabilities. For example, in underwriting, we are investing in automation and other technologies that drive internal efficiencies. We are also utilizing digital real-time medical information. This is helping improve the producer and consumer experience by decreasing the average issue time from 5 weeks to 2 with the capability to issue within the same day. 
Lastly, on Group Protection, our results continue to be impacted by the pandemic. However, we are beginning to see signs of improvement and are confident that underlying margins will build over time toward the upper end of our target 5% to 7% range. The strong demand for employee benefits helped drive sales of $105 million, up 42% compared to the prior year period. We generated growth across all case sizes, primarily driven by increased sales to existing clients as our corporate customers hire more employees, raise salaries and expand benefits offerings to include new lines of coverage. 
Employee-paid sales represented 57% of the total this quarter. We expect the proportion of employee-paid sales to continue to rise over time on an annualized basis as we focus on growing in this market, including supplemental health. First quarter premiums of nearly $1.2 billion rose 4% compared to the prior year period, driven by new sales, improved persistency, rate increases and employment growth. I am pleased with this quarter's underlying results and confident our strategic actions will drive margin expansion over time to the top of our targeted range. 
Moving to investment results. Credit quality remains excellent with 97% of our fixed income assets rated investment grade or investment-grade equivalent. Portfolio performance remains strong as we experienced another quarter of negligible credit losses and positive net ratings migration. New money yields rose to 3.3% in the first quarter and nearly 50 basis point sequential increase, driven by higher rates. During the quarter, we invested 60% of new money in assets other than public corporates and expect to continue to invest at this level, adding high-quality assets with incremental yield. Finally, alternative investment performance was in line with our long-term expectations of a 2.5% quarterly or 10% annualized return. 
In closing, Lincoln's underlying earnings power is intact. We expect to benefit from the recent significant decline in pandemic hospitalizations and death and the rise in interest rates. Looking across our businesses, we are progressing on several fronts. Sales momentum continues to build, driven by our broad and innovative product portfolio and distribution strength. The Spark initiative is on track and group protection margin expansion efforts take hold. We will continue to allocate capital towards its highest and best use. In closing, we continue to execute on our near-term strategy with an eye toward long-term profitable growth. I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,1775537349,2555338,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 05, 2022",2022-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ellen. Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $294 million or $1.66 per share. The quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $150 million or $0.85 per share and unusual items of $1",1406,"Thank you, Ellen. Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $294 million or $1.66 per share. The quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $150 million or $0.85 per share and unusual items of $19 million or $0.11 per share, primarily related to a Group Protection customer to being a backlog of prior year claims. As Ellen mentioned, alternative investment income was in line with long-term expectations. Net income for the first quarter totaled $104 million or $0.58 per share, with the difference between net income and adjusted operating income, primarily resulting from a loss related to variable annuity net derivative results. The hedge program was 96% effective in what was a volatile quarter of the capital [indiscernible]. With the recent increase in rates this year, I thought I would update you on spread compression at Lincoln. Our current expectation is that spread compression will impact EPS growth in the near term by 0% to 1%, improved from the 2% to 3% range I communicated on last quarter's earnings call. .
Touching on the performance of key financial metrics compared to the prior year, excluding excess alternative investment income in the prior year quarter and the impact of the third quarter 2021 block reinsurance transaction on a consolidated basis. Operating revenues were up 4%. Our expense ratio improved 20 basis points. Shares outstanding declined 10% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $78.32, up 8% and an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $302 million compared to $290 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher account values driven by year-over-year growth in the equity markets and expense efficiency. Average account values of $164 billion increased 2% year-over-year. Of note, and as Ellen pointed out, variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits now represent less than 50% of our annuity account values. 
For variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, the net amount stands at 134 basis points for living benefits and 107 basis points for death benefits. We expect these percentages to remain at the very low end of peers, highlighting the lower risk nature of our in-force business. 
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declined 3% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Return metrics remained solid with a return on assets of 74 basis points, up 2 basis points year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%. As a reminder, sequentially, there were 2 fewer fee days in the quarter, which reduced earnings by roughly $8 million. Overall, a good result for the annuity business, highlighted by strong returns and effective expense discipline. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $55 million compared to $57 million in the prior year quarter, as strong net flows and a year-over-year increase in the equity markets were more than offset by less favorable variable investment income. Continued sales success has produced $1.1 billion in net flows over the trailing 12 months, contributing to a 7% increase in average account values to $96 billion. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were in line with prior year quarter. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed to 6 basis points versus the prior year quarter, in line with our stated 5 to 10 basis point range as crediting rate actions take hold. Benefiting from the increase in rates, we expect spread compression in the retirement business going forward to be the [ minimis ]. This was another great quarter for the retirement business with strong net flows and expense management and an expectation as we exit the quarter that spread compression has become a nonevent for the business. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $58 million compared to $107 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was due to less favorable alternative investment income, a more normal level of underlying mortality and the impact of the resolution deal, which combined more than offset improved pandemic claims. This quarter's earnings were impacted by $69 million of pandemic-related mortality. Average account values, excluding the impact of last year's block reinsurance deal rose 4%. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 1% from the prior year quarter. Base spreads declined 12 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We expect spread compression to return to our 5 to 10 basis point stated range. 
Outside of continued pandemic headwinds and Life results were solid with underlying mortality in line with our first quarter expectations, good expense management and growing sales. Group Protection reported a loss from operations of $41 million compared to a loss of $26 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's loss is a significant improvement over a loss of [ $115 ] million in the fourth quarter as the impact of the pandemic began to ease, and we saw improvement in underlying disability results. 
As noted in my opening comments, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by [ $19 ] million of unusual items. The pandemic impacted our Group Life results by $53 million and our disability results by $18 million. Group Protection pandemic claims relative to U.S. COVID deaths improved significantly from recent quarters due to death transitioning back towards the nonworking edge population. Excluding pandemic claims and unusual items, the group margin was 5.1% at the low end of our targeted range of 5% to 7%. 
On the Life side, our underlying loss ratio of 72.9% improved 240 basis points year-over-year to 60 basis points sequentially as results benefited from pricing actions and good underlying experience. Our underlying disability loss ratio of 80.4% improved 680 basis points sequentially, as the seasonally higher claims that we saw in the fourth quarter returned to more normal levels. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2021, our disability underlying loss ratio is up 290 basis points and remains elevated compared to long-term expectations as both incidents and severity are above historic levels. I'd estimate that this certain group's first quarter results by $10 million to $15 million. We believe our underlying disability results are indirectly influenced by the pandemic, has delayed treatments and lack of routine care during peak pandemic ways appears to be impacting the overall health of our claimants. Our claims management efforts are focused on helping our customers recover and get back to work as quickly as possible and should lead to improving underlying disability results over time. Expense ratio was 12.7%, up 20 basis points, primarily due to elevated staffing levels given the volume of pandemic-related claims. We remain confident that the combined impacts of repricing, improved claims management and Spark expenses will move us to the top of our 5% to 7% target range.
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at approximately 415%, while cash at the holding company stands at $755 million. During the quarter, we paid off our $300 million 2022 debt maturity and issued $300 million of new debt as a partial prefunding of our 2023 maturity. We executed a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter, retiring over 3% of shares outstanding. As I mentioned, it was possible on last quarter's earnings conference call, with that level of repurchases, we chose not to pursue any open market buybacks, but we expect these to resume in the second quarter. 
In conclusion, while still affected by the financial impacts of the pandemic, our underlying results remain strong and leading indicators are positive, such as spread compression, which has been with us for many years, has come down dramatically. And as I noted earlier, now represents a very modest headwind to EPS growth of 0% to 1%. 
Our Group Protection margin enhancement efforts are gaining traction with underlying results returning to the bottom of our targeted margin range. Investments that we are making in the Spark initiative will drive significant expense savings over the next 3 years. While the pandemic is still with us, the combined impact of vaccinations and natural immunity can continue to reduce the potential negative financial impact on Lincoln. And while investing significant capital at strong returns to support new business that will drive our earnings of tomorrow, we are continuing to return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

I think when you think about buybacks in the second quarter, I'd go back to our sort of overarching philosophy when it comes to ongoing share buyback programs, open market programs. Typically, we have used a more levelized approach. We think that makes more sense to avoid the ups and downs of the share price. So I'd expect us in terms of the buybacks, we're going to do over the remainder of the year to spread them more evenly. 
The other thing I'd point out, there's a fair amount of uncertainty in the environment as we see that there's more going on inflation. There's a question on what the economy is going to do. So I think it's one of those years where you lean towards prudence when it comes to that. More broadly speaking, Nigel, when it comes to capital allocation in general, just as a reminder, right? We have -- we generate a lot of capital. We've generated a lot of capital over the years. We have 2 big places. We put that capital. There's new business, new business, which has historically been about 60% to 65% of our overall capital allocation. You've seen us though at times, flex up or down, right? We flex down when the opportunity is not there. You saw that a couple of years ago when we took sales down, but we flex up when the opportunity is there, both from a return on a sales standpoint. And you really saw that in Ellen's comments. She talked about every business is getting returns meaningfully above their target. There really has not been better time to be issuing new business in our space in some time. So maybe one of those years when we flex up a little bit from a new business standpoint, but we'll see if the sales opportunities are over the remainder the year. Then obviously, the other big bucket is return to shareholders. We've done a lot, right? We -- if you look over the last 4 quarters, we've done $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion buybacks, $300 million of dividends. 
If you look over a longer period of time, that was actually -- it was interesting. I was looking at our long history of returning capital to shareholders. If you go back over the last decade or so, we've actually returned $10.3 billion of capital to shareholders, $7.9 billion of that through buybacks. That's I think it represents 46% reduction in our outstanding shares. So yes, we believe in returning capital to shareholders. We're going to get back to buying stock in the second quarter, but I'd expect us to be more levelized over the remainder of the year, and I'd expect us to lean a little on the conservative side."

And then there's a Spark program, which is really just getting going from an investment standpoint, you really should start to see the benefits of -- so yes, I think 5.1% is where you end up.

Should we expect something below the normal $150 million of quarterly buybacks over the next couple of quarters here?

And we said at the time, we would put $900 million of that into buybacks and the remainder will go into debt reduction. And so we've completed the $900 million of buybacks. So there's that. In terms of -- I agree with you that historically, we've averaged $150 million, and that's, I think, over time, still a long-term expectation. Just as a reminder, with the resolution deal, that $900 million of incremental buybacks we did, that represents about 15 years' worth of distributable earnings, we were going to get off that block of business. But we did give up about $75 million or so of distributable earnings. So in the near term, we've given up that $75 million. 
Now we obviously we'd expect our capital generation to grow over time. But the normal growth we're going to get from our growing business is going to get a little math, at least, I think, for this year. Equity markets are down, those sorts of things. So I think you're not seeing that normal growth in capital generation that we'd see in a typical year. So that would lead us to a starting point, a little below the normal $150 million a quarter that you would typically see. And then as I pointed out and you pointed out your question, I think the capital opportunity in new business, well, probably it's early in the year, so it's tough to project. But when you look at the first quarter and what we expect for the remainder of the year, I think about $100 million to $150 million of incremental capital in the new business this year relative to a normal year. 
So that would put you down, Tom, more into the $100 million a quarter range as annual as a normal expectation. So I put it at $100 million to $150 million. Just one other point, if you had asked me the same question in the first quarter of last year, I would have said the exact same thing probably. I think we ended up doing $105 million in the first quarter of last year, and then we ended up doing $600 million for the full year. So it's somewhat influenced how the environment rolls out over the remainder of the year, Tom."

Of course, the expense efficiencies through Spark and then the claims effectiveness. So all of that, we're going to continue to execute on. 
As we think about longer term, and we have talked to all of you about the fact that as I'm stepping into the CEO role, we are also thinking about longer-term strategy and overall longer-term direction. And so I'm way too early to communicate anything at this time, but what I will share with you is one of the first things that we have done as part of the transition is we've looked at our overall organizational structure and how that will align with us, thinking about executing on the near-term strategy while we are also focused on building out what that longer-term strategy looks like. 
And so we've appointed a Chief Strategy Officer that is focused on that now 24/7 and really taking a look at that. And then also our focus on combining the Individual Life and annuity businesses together, along with LFN and bringing that together is also very much strategic as we think about that. And so if I just step back for a second on that, we very much -- as we think about, for example, our product strategy and how we have focused on product manufacturing over the years. We're starting to see more opportunity for synergy and innovation across the 2 individual businesses. And so examples of that are products that have shifting investment engines, shifting value propositions, where both are thinking about -- risk sharing is another example there. 
We see opportunity as it relates to the overall customer experience and operations. And then this other part that I highlighted, which is a continued emphasis as it relates to overall in-force management and some opportunity there. So more to come. Yes, we'll also take a look at capital management as part of everything that we're going to be doing longer term and as soon as we have something more definitive to be able to talk to you about, we'll, in fact, do that."

So as it relates to a favorable environment, I think we see a couple of things there. The first is, clearly, from a capital-markets perspective, we have higher rates. And in general, when we think about higher rates and we have the 10-year now at 3%, this is an opportunity now to be able to invest new money higher, and that translates into offering customers higher value propositions. And so across the board, we think that, that will benefit the overall industry, and it will benefit Lincoln as well. So that's 1 piece.
The second thing that is very much important is that as we continue to manage through this pandemic, and we're now more than 24 months in, we're seeing that it has definitely increased awareness and, therefore, demand for financial protection and security. And so we're seeing real evidence of that, for example, in our Group Protection business, where we saw that sales were up pretty significantly year-over-year. 
The primary driver of that was inside of the existing clients and seeing increased demand there. The other thing that's happening from a macro environment is that we all know that we're seeing evidence of wage inflation, and we're seeing a direct relationship in terms of increased compensation that is leading to increased -- for example, on deposits in the retirement business. So across the board and also because there's such a significant focus right now on the overall employment environment and needing to attract talent, we're seeing expansion of benefits as well. And so that's another opportunity there. So I think across the board, there are a number of areas that are providing overall opportunity from a macro and external perspective. 
The other thing that I'll add is that we have done so much in terms of product innovation over the last couple of years that we are seeing that we have more and more attractive financial product. I mentioned in my script that we introduced 13 new products last year in 2021. And so we're seeing that the expansion of product is appealing to expand the demographics and very much so is part of why we also view that this is a favorable environment."

So it was 72 basis points last year, 74 basis points this year. So there is seasonality inside of the ROA mentioned, it's about $8 million. If you look at the first quarter compared to sequentially the fourth quarter. So that is an impact. But to be fair, when the markets go down, you get less fee income. And that influences ROA. So I think whether we're at that high 70s or 80 range will somewhat depend if the markets stabilize and start to move back up, right? It isn't so much volatility in the markets that drive ROE. It's whether they go down and stay down. You get less fee income that influences the top line, and that will give you a modest and lower ROA. I think when you look over the -- look at the broad sweep of time, markets will stabilize, we believe markets will start to move back up. And in that environment, we fully expect to move into that 75 to 80 basis point range again."

We've averaged taking annual dividends out of LNBar of roughly $125 million over the last 5 years. So we took $85 million in the first quarter. We did have breakage in the first quarter that followed a few quarters of really good results. 
Last year, I would say that the program didn't have, I think, over the whole year, I think it was about $120 million of breakage, which is a good year. So it was elevated in the first quarter, I think that was really driven by 2 things. If you break up breakage into the 2 big buckets; one, fund basis went against us in the quarter. So it was about 1/3, I would say, of the excess breakage. As a reminder, fund basis is one of those things where we can go back over any extended period of time, it adds up to 0, but it can move up and down. So it was better at this time. I think the other 2/3 was really all about the volatility in the markets that we saw in the first quarter. The total amount hedge target traveled over the quarter was about twice what we saw on average last year. 
And when you see that sort of volatility, 2 things happen. We have to trade more. And you get some second order breakage. So I think it was one of those quarters where we'll have a little elevated breakage. I think when you look -- when we go out a couple of years and look back, what you'll see is that it will be averaged out with some good quarters, and we'll get back to that long-term expectation of some level of breakage. Does that help, Alex?"

And so the first thing is that while you are correct that IVA sales year-over-year were down 30%. What we saw is that in the first half of 2021, you may remember that -- we saw rates come down pretty significantly and market volatility also come down. And it required us to really do a pretty significant repricing in that particular time to be able to meet our overall target returns. And so we did that, and we actually led the rest of the industry down. And so we knew at the time that we did that because we will not offer products out on the shelf that is not meeting or exceeding our target returns. We knew when we did that, that we were going to see a pullback in sales, and that's exactly what happens. 
And so the third quarter really bottomed out in terms of our overall IVA sales. And then we started to see sequential rebound. And so you saw -- if you look at the trend, you can see fourth quarter was a bit better. And then when you look at first quarter, it's up sequentially from where we were in the fourth quarter. And actually, even inside of there, what we saw was momentum building. So January was a little lower. February was a little bit higher from that and March was even higher. So we feel good in terms of where we are. In terms of the overall competitive environment, yes, there are quite a few entrants now in the space, and we know that there are a number that are coming in as well in 2022. We feel really good about our broad product offerings in addition to being competitive with the rest of the market. We have a couple of new and really proprietary index options that we've offered as well as new product features that are unique to our particular product. So between that and the power of our distribution, we feel very good in terms of our overall share of IVA and continuing to sell and really sustain that momentum that we're seeing."

And for us, overall, it has the benefit of increasing overall ROE, and it's also very supportive from an overall capital perspective, because we're effectively passing through a significant amount of the guarantee. So it's worked well. We are already close to really the capacity of that particular deal as we round out to the end of the quarter -- the second quarter. Just to give you a sense, by the way, when we talk about VA with guaranteed living benefits in terms of overall sales, and we mentioned 25% in the quarter. When we look at the net, so the pass-through of the reinsurance for the quarter, that 25% drops to about 18%. And we're evaluating the potential continue to extend it as we always do with all of our partners. So we'll let you know as we continue to look at it, but it's worked out extremely well on both sides, and we're very grateful for the partnership that we have with [ Talcott ]."

I am excited about and confident in Lincoln's continued success as I step into the CEO role effective later this month. Dennis has been a valued mentor and colleague for many years, and I look forward to working with him as he transitions into the role of Chairman of the Board. I have met many of the investors and analysts joining today's call and look forward to having more opportunities to discuss Lincoln with all of you. Although the U.S. continued to experience headwinds related to the pandemic, Lincoln had a solid start to 2022. We are pleased with our underlying results and optimistic about the outlook for our business. 
Our current strategy has proven to be robust and we have an excellent track record of executing against it, as demonstrated in part by having compounded underlying EPS at 11% over the past decade.  As we have said, we expect over the next few years to grow underlying EPS at or above the high end of our 8% to 10% target range. I will now touch on some of the initiatives that are positioning us to meet this objective. First, we continue to generate organic growth at strong new business returns meaningfully above target across our businesses, driven by our broad product portfolio and our industry-leading distribution franchise. Top line growth is enhanced by our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, which is enabling us to meet evolving consumer needs. We have been able to drive a shift towards products with additional risk-sharing between Lincoln and customers that appeal to broader demographics and expand shelf space. We introduced 13 new products in 2021 and continue to innovate. 
Second, company-wide margin improvement efforts are primarily centered around our Spark initiative, which we expect to generate $260 million to $300 million in run-rate savings by the end of 2024. Investments we are making in our business through Spark will enable us to operate more efficiently and effectively and to improve the customer and employee experience, including the way we work here at Lincoln. Additionally, we are focused on improving the group protection underlying margin through continued pricing actions, improved claims effectiveness and Spark expense savings. And last, we continue to focus on effective capital allocation, including returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Recently, we announced that we are bringing our Individual Life and Annuities businesses together under a senior leader who will join Lincoln in July and report to me. Product manufacturing has long been a key driver of the success of these businesses, and we see this continuing as we also place continued emphasis on in-force management.  Bringing the Life and Annuities businesses together creates more opportunity to leverage our capabilities, share best practices and enable greater innovation. This new leader will also oversee Lincoln Financial Network, or LFN, which represents more than 11,000 advisers and our growing wealth management platform. 
Turning now to the business segments. Starting with Annuities. Our products are generating strong returns as we continue to sell on our terms across broadly diversified product segments, with disciplined pricing and risk management built directly into the product design. Critical to our success in meeting the needs of our customers is offering a broad product portfolio through our industry-leading distribution force. We continue to enhance our product offerings, including the launch of multiple new investment options and features that differentiate our products and expand consumer choice. 
Sales of $2.7 billion were down 4% versus the prior year period due to a decline in indexed variable annuities. However, IVA sales were up sequentially for the second consecutive quarter as we regained sales momentum through our product innovation and an improved competitive pricing environment. In fixed indexed annuities, sales were up again significantly. Our differentiated investment options and higher rates have restored momentum to the FIA product line. The breadth of our annuity portfolio is enabling our strategic sales shift, and variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits remain under 30% of total annuity sales for the 7th consecutive quarter. Our ongoing sales shift also is further diversifying the total annuities in-force account value mix, as variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits again represented less than half of total account value. At our current sales mix, this proportion will continue to decline. 
To be clear, we have been undertaking this mix shift for diversification purposes only, as we believe in the value proposition of guaranteed living benefits for customers and are achieving very attractive mid-20% ROEs. We expect to see continued momentum as we look to further grow the Annuities business. Retirement Plan Services continues to have success and achieved record first quarter net flows of $946 million. First quarter total deposits of $3.4 billion were up 28%, including an 11% rise in recurring deposits and a 73% increase in first year sales. This sales growth, combined with high customer retention, led to the quarter's excellent outcome. The retirement business is benefiting from the strong labor market. U.S. wage growth and increases in employee contribution rates were the main drivers of this quarter's recurring deposit growth. We also saw robust first year sales growth across our broad product portfolio. 
Another external factor, the constructive legislative environment, is also creating longer-term growth opportunities for RPS around in-plan guarantees and pooled employer plan solutions as well as by creating greater incentives for employers to establish plans. Beyond these external tailwinds is the favorable competitive positioning of RPS, with its broad, innovative product suite, enhanced digital capabilities and the power of Lincoln's distribution franchise. The retirement business continues to produce strong returns and to drive positive net flows. 
Our Life Insurance business continues to demonstrate broad-based top line momentum as sales of $155 million were up 36% over the prior year period with growth across all major product lines. Since undertaking our reprice, shift and add-new-product strategy, we have returned to a more typical seasonal sales pattern and expect sales to ramp up through the end of the year. Our Life portfolio is achieving new business targeted returns and we continue to attract new financial professionals;  For instance, with our successful rollout last year of the first-of-its-kind variable hybrid life product, MoneyGuard Market Advantage. This ongoing product innovation is expanding our access to new customer segments while advancing our sales mix shift towards lower guarantee risk-sharing solutions, which represent over 70% of total life sales. 
We continue to expand upon and to see strong adoption of our digital capability. For example, in underwriting, we are investing in automation and other technologies that drive internal efficiencies. We are also utilizing digital real-time medical information. This is helping improve the producer and consumer experience by decreasing the average issue time from 5 weeks to 2, with the capability to issue within the same day. 
Lastly, on Group Protection, our results continue to be impacted by the pandemic. However, we are beginning to see signs of improvement and are confident that underlying margins will build over time toward the upper end of our target 5% to 7% range. The strong demand for employee benefits helped drive sales of $105 million, up 42% compared to the prior year period. We generated growth across all case sizes, primarily driven by increased sales to existing clients, as our corporate customers hire more employees, raise salaries and expand benefits offerings to include new lines of coverage. 
Employee-paid sales represented 57% of the total this quarter. We expect the proportion of employee-paid sales to continue to rise over time on an annualized basis as we focus on growing in this market, including supplemental health. First quarter premiums of nearly $1.2 billion rose 4% compared to the prior year period, driven by new sales, improved persistency, rate increases and employment growth. I am pleased with this quarter's underlying results and confident our strategic actions will drive margin expansion over time to the top of our targeted range. 
Moving to investment results. Credit quality remains excellent, with 97% of our fixed income assets rated investment grade or investment-grade equivalent. Portfolio performance remains strong as we experienced another quarter of negligible credit losses and positive net ratings migration. New money yields rose to 3.3% in the first quarter a nearly 50 basis point sequential increase, driven by higher rates. During the quarter, we invested 60% of new money in assets other than public corporates, and expect to continue to invest at this level, adding high-quality assets with incremental yield. Finally, alternative investment performance was in line with our long-term expectations of a 2.5% quarterly or 10% annualized return. 
In closing, Lincoln's underlying earnings power is intact. We expect to benefit from the recent significant decline in pandemic hospitalizations and deaths and the rise in interest rates. Looking across our businesses, we are progressing on several fronts. Sales momentum continues to build, driven by our broad and innovative product portfolio and distribution strength. The Spark initiative is on track and group protection margin expansion efforts take hold. We will continue to allocate capital towards its highest and best use. In closing, we continue to execute on our near-term strategy with an eye toward long-term profitable growth. I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $294 million, or $1.66 per share. The quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $150 million or $0.85 per share and unusual items of $19 million or $0.11 per share, primarily related to a Group Protection customer submitting a backlog of prior year claims. As Ellen mentioned, alternative investment income was in line with long-term expectations. Net income for the first quarter totaled $104 million or $0.58 per share, with the difference between net income and adjusted operating income primarily resulting from a loss related to variable annuity net derivative results. The hedge program was 96% effective in what was a volatile quarter of the capital [ markets ]. With the recent increase in rates this year, I thought I would update you on spread compression at Lincoln. Our current expectation is that spread compression will impact EPS growth in the near term by 0% to 1%, improved from the 2% to 3% range I communicated on last quarter's earnings call. 
Touching on the performance of key financial metrics compared to the prior year.  Excluding excess alternative investment income in the prior year quarter and the impact of the third quarter 2021 block reinsurance transaction, on a consolidated basis, operating revenues were up 4%. Our expense ratio improved 20 basis points. Shares outstanding declined 10% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $78.32, up 8% and an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $302 million compared to $290 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher account values driven by year-over-year growth in the equity markets and expense efficiency. Average account values of $164 billion increased 2% year-over-year. Of note, and as Ellen pointed out, variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits now represent less than 50% of our annuity account values. 
For variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, the net amount at risk stands at 134 basis points for living benefits and 107 basis points for death benefits. We expect these percentages to remain at the very low end of peers, highlighting the lower-risk nature of our in-force business. 
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declined 3% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Return metrics remained solid with a return on assets of 74 basis points, up 2 basis points year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%. As a reminder, sequentially there were 2 fewer fee days in the quarter, which reduced earnings by roughly $8 million. Overall, a good result for the annuity business, highlighted by strong returns and effective expense discipline. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $55 million compared to $57 million in the prior year quarter, as strong net flows and a year-over-year increase in the equity markets were more than offset by less favorable variable investment income. Continued sales success has produced $1.1 billion in net flows over the trailing 12 months, contributing to a 7% increase in average account values to $96 billion. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were in line with prior year quarter. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 6 basis points versus the prior year quarter, in line with our stated 5 to 10 basis point range as crediting rate actions take hold. Benefiting from the increase in rates, we expect spread compression in the retirement business going forward to be de minimis. This was another great quarter for the retirement business, with strong net flows and expense management, and an expectation as we exit the quarter that spread compression has become a non-event for the business. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $58 million compared to $107 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was due to less favorable alternative investment income, a more normal level of underlying mortality and the impact of the Resolution deal, which combined more than offset improved pandemic claims. This quarter's earnings were impacted by $69 million of pandemic-related mortality. Average account values, excluding the impact of last year's block reinsurance deal, rose 4%. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 1% from the prior year quarter. Base spreads declined 12 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We expect spread compression to return to our 5 to 10 basis point stated range. 
Outside of continued pandemic headwinds, Life results were solid, with underlying mortality in line with our first quarter expectations, good expense management and growing sales. Group Protection reported a loss from operations of $41 million compared to a loss of $26 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's loss is a significant improvement over a loss of [ $150 ] million in the fourth quarter as the impact of the pandemic began to ease, and we saw improvement in underlying disability results. 
As noted in my opening comments, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by $19 million of unusual items. The pandemic impacted our Group Life results by $53 million and our disability results by $18 million. Group Protection pandemic claims relative to U.S. COVID deaths improved significantly from recent quarters due to death transitioning back towards the nonworking edge population. Excluding pandemic claims and unusual items, the group margin was 5.1%, at the low end of our targeted range of 5% to 7%. 
On the Life side, our underlying loss ratio of 72.9% improved 240 basis points year-over-year to 60 basis points sequentially as results benefited from pricing actions and good underlying experience. Our underlying disability loss ratio of 80.4% improved 680 basis points sequentially, as the seasonally higher claims that we saw in the fourth quarter returned to more normal levels. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2021, our disability underlying loss ratio is up 290 basis points and remains elevated compared to long-term expectations, as both incidents and severity are above historic levels. I'd estimate that this hurt  group's first quarter results by $10 million to $15 million. We believe our underlying disability results are indirectly influenced by the pandemic, as delayed treatments and lack of routine care during peak pandemic waves appears to be impacting the overall health of our claimants. Our claims management efforts are focused on helping our customers recover and get back to work as quickly as possible, and should lead to improving underlying disability results over time. Expense ratio was 12.7%, up 20 basis points, primarily due to elevated staffing levels given the volume of pandemic-related claims. We remain confident that the combined impacts of repricing, improved claims management and Spark expense [ A's ] will move us to the top of our 5% to 7% target range.
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at approximately 415%, while cash at the holding company stands at $755 million. During the quarter, we paid off our $300 million 2022 debt maturity and issued $300 million of new debt as a partial prefunding of our 2023 maturity. We executed a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter, retiring over 3% of shares outstanding. As I mentioned was possible at last quarter's earnings conference call, with that level of repurchases, we chose not to pursue any open market buybacks, but we expect these to resume in the second quarter. 
In conclusion, while still affected by the financial impacts of the pandemic, our underlying results remain strong and leading indicators are positive. Such as spread compression, which has been with us for many years, has come down dramatically, and as I noted earlier, now represents a very modest headwind to EPS growth of 0% to 1%. 
Our Group Protection margin enhancement efforts are gaining traction, with underlying results returning to the bottom of our targeted margin range. Investments that we are making in the Spark initiative will drive significant expense savings over the next 3 years. While the pandemic is still with us, the combined impact of vaccinations and natural immunity can continue to reduce the potential negative financial impacts on Lincoln. And while investing significant capital at strong returns to support new business that will drive our earnings of tomorrow, we are continuing to return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

I think when you think about buybacks in the second quarter, I'd go back to our sort of overarching philosophy when it comes to ongoing share buyback programs, open market programs. Typically, we have used a more levelized approach. We think that makes more sense. It avoids the ups and downs of the share price. So I'd expect us in terms of the buybacks we're going to do over the remainder of the year, to spread them more evenly. 
The other thing I'd point out, there's a fair amount of uncertainty in the environment as we see [ a good day ]. There's a war going on, [ we've got ]inflation. There's a question on what the economy is going to do. So I think it's one of those years where you lean towards prudence when it comes to that. More broadly speaking, Nigel, when it comes to capital allocation in general, just as a reminder, right? We have -- we generate a lot of capital. We've generated a lot of capital over the years. We have 2 big places we put that capital. There's new business, new business which has historically been about 60% to 65% of our overall capital allocation. You've seen us, though, at times flex up or down, right? We flex down when the opportunity is not there. You saw that a couple of years ago when we took sales down, but we flex up when the opportunity is there, both from a return and a sales standpoint. And you really saw that in Ellen's comments. She talked about every business is getting returns meaningfully above their target. There really has not been a better time to be issuing new business in our space in some time. So it may be one of those years when we flex up a little bit from a new business standpoint, but we'll see what the sales opportunities are over the remainder the year. Then obviously, the other big bucket is return to shareholders. We've done a lot, right? We -- if you look over the last 4 quarters, we've done $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion buybacks, $300 million of dividends. 
If you look over a longer period of time, I was actually -- it was interesting. I was looking at our long history of returning capital to shareholders. If you go back over the last decade or so, we've actually returned $10.3 billion of capital to shareholders, $7.9 billion of that through buybacks. That's -- I think it represents 46% reduction in our outstanding shares. So yes, we believe in returning capital to shareholders. We're going to get back to buying back our stock in this second quarter, but I'd expect us to be more levelized over the remainder of the year, and I'd expect us to lean a little on the conservative side."

So there's price increases, there's claims effectiveness, which we need to continue to work on. And then there's the Spark program, which is really just getting going from an investment standpoint and you really should start to see the benefits of.  So yes, I think 5.1% is where you end up.

So -- everything you said, I think, makes sense, the -- in terms of the environment and your new business was strong. So that's probably going to be consuming some more capital. Should we expect something below the normal $150 million of quarterly buybacks over the next couple of quarters here?

And we said at the time, we would put $900 million of that into buybacks and the remainder will go into debt reduction. And so we've completed the $900 million of buybacks. So there's that. In terms of  the amount, I agree with you that historically, we've averaged $150 million, and that's, I think, over time still a long-term expectation. Just as a reminder, with the Resolution deal, that $900 million of incremental buybacks we did, that represents about 15 years' worth of distributable earnings we were going to get off that block of business. But we did give up about $75 million or so of distributable earnings. So in the near term, we've given up that $75 million. 
Now we'd, obviously we'd expect our capital generation to grow over time. But the normal growth we're going to get from our growing business is going to get a little masked, at least, I think, for this year. Equity markets are down, those sorts of things. So I think you're not seeing that normal growth in capital generation that we'd see in a typical year. So that would lead us to a starting point a little below the normal $150 million a quarter that you would typically see. And then as I pointed out and you pointed out in your question, I think the capital opportunity in new business will, probably -- it's early in the year, so it's tough to project. But when you look at the first quarter and what we expect over the remainder of the year, I think about $100 million to $150 million of incremental capital in the new business this year relative to a normal year. 
So that would put you down, Tom, more into the $100 million a quarter range as an annual -- as a normal expectation. So I'd put it at $100 million to $150 million. Just one other point, if you had asked me the same question in the first quarter of last year, I would have said the exact same thing probably. I think we ended up doing $105 million in the first quarter of last year, and then we ended up doing $600 million for the full year. So it's somewhat influenced by how the environment rolls out over the remainder of the year, Tom."

So you know that I've been with Lincoln now for 10 years and very much and part of really architecting the existing strategy. And everything that we have talked to you about, we are going to continue to execute on. So all things as it relates to our reprice shift and add-new-product strategy and really focusing there on organic growth. And you can see real evidence of that in this particular quarter as we're continuing to build momentum there. The second area is really around expense initiatives and all of the execution that we're doing, and very much on track as it relates to the overall Spark initiative. And we've also talked to you about the fact that in addition to that being a cost save program, that it very much is focused on improving overall efficiency as it relates to our customers and how we face off with them, and also a real focus on the employee experience. So that's very important. 
And then the third area, which we've also touched on, is around restoring our group margin to the higher end. And there, as Randy just talked about, and as we both highlighted in our script, we've got all of the pricing actions that we're focused on there. Of course, the expense efficiencies through Spark and then the claims effectiveness. So all of that, we're going to continue to execute on. 
As we think about longer term, and we have talked to all of you about the fact that as I'm stepping into the CEO role, we are also thinking about longer-term strategy and overall longer-term direction. And so I'm way too early to communicate anything at this time, but what I will share with you is one of the first things that we have done as part of the transition is we've looked at our overall organizational structure and how that will align with us, thinking about executing on the near-term strategy while we are also focused on building out what that longer-term strategy looks like. 
And so we've appointed a Chief Strategy Officer that is focused on that now 24/7 and really taking a look at that. And then also our focus on combining the Individual Life and Annuity businesses together, along with LFN and bringing that together is also very much strategic as we think about that. And so if I just step back for a second on that, we very much -- as we think about, for example, our product strategy and how we have focused on product manufacturing over the years. We're starting to see more opportunity for synergy and innovation across the 2 individual businesses. And so examples of that are products that have shifting investment engines, shifting value propositions, where both are thinking about -- risk sharing is another example there. 
We see opportunity as it relates to the overall, the customer experience and operations. And then this other part that I highlighted, which is a continued emphasis as it relates to overall in-force management and some opportunity there. So more to come. Yes, we'll also take a look at capital management as part of everything that we're going to be doing longer term.  And as soon as we have something more definitive to be able to talk to you about, we'll in fact do that."

The second thing that is very much important is that as we continue to manage through this pandemic, and we're now more than 24 months in, we're seeing that it has definitely increased awareness and, therefore, demand for financial protection and security. And so we're seeing real evidence of that, for example, in our Group Protection business, where we saw that sales were up pretty significantly year-over-year. 
The primary driver of that was inside of the existing clients and seeing increased demand there. The other thing that's happening from a macro environment is that we all know that we're seeing evidence of wage inflation, and we're seeing a direct relationship in terms of increased compensation that is leading to increased -- for example, on deposits in the retirement business. So across the board and also because there's such a significant focus right now on the overall employment environment and needing to attract talent, we're seeing expansion of benefits as well. And so that's another opportunity there. So I think across the board, there are a number of areas that are providing overall opportunity from a macro and external perspective. 
The other thing that I'll add is that we have done so much in terms of product innovation over the last couple of years that we are seeing that we have more and more attractive financial product. I mentioned in my script that we introduced 13 new products last year in 2021. And so we're seeing that the expansion of product, it's appealing to expand the demographics and very much so is part of why we also view that this is a favorable environment."

So it was 72 basis points last year, 74 basis points this year. So there is seasonality inside of the ROA mentioned.  It's about $8 million if you look at the first quarter compared to sequentially the fourth quarter. So that is an impact. But to be fair, when the markets go down, you get less fee income. And that influences ROA. So I think whether we're at that high 70s or 80 range will somewhat depend if the markets stabilize and start to move back up, right? It isn't so much volatility in the markets that drive ROA. It's whether they go down and stay down. You get less fee income, that influences the top line, and that will give you a modestly lower ROA. I think when you look over the -- look at the broad sweep of time, markets will stabilize, we believe markets will start to move back up. And in that environment, we'd fully expect to move into that 75 to 80 basis point range again."

We've averaged taking annual dividends out of LNBar of roughly $125 million over the last 5 years. So we took $85 million in the first quarter. We did have breakage in the first quarter, that followed a few quarters of really good results. 
Last year, I would say that the program didn't have, I think, over the whole year, I think it was about $120 million of breakage, which is a good year. So it was elevated in the first quarter.  I think that was really driven by 2 things. If you break up breakage into the 2 big buckets; one, fund basis went against us in the quarter. So that was about 1/3, I would say, of the excess breakage. As a reminder, fund basis is one of those things where we can go back over any extended period of time, it adds up to 0, but it can move up and down. So it was -- that hurt us this time. I think the other 2/3 was really all about the volatility in the markets that we saw in the first quarter. The total amount the hedge target traveled over the quarter was about twice what we saw on average last year. 
And when you see that sort of volatility, 2 things happen. We have to trade more. And you get some second order breakage. So I think it was one of those quarters where we'll have a little elevated breakage. I think when you look -- when we go out a couple of years and look back, what you'll see is that it will be averaged out with some good quarters, and we'll get back to that long-term expectation of some level of breakage. Does that help, Alex?"

So yes, as it relates to indexed VA, it is an important tail. And so the first thing is that while you are correct that IVA sales year-over-year were down 30%, what we saw is that in the first half of 2021, you may remember that -- we saw rates come down pretty significantly and market volatility also come down. And so it required us to really do a pretty significant repricing in that particular time to be able to meet our overall target returns. And so we did that, and we actually led the rest of the industry down. And so we knew at the time that we did that -- because we will not offer product out on the shelf that is not meeting or exceeding our target returns -- we knew when we did that, that we were going to see a pullback in sales, and that's exactly what happened. 
And so the third quarter really bottomed out in terms of our overall IVA sales. And then we started to see sequential rebound. And so you saw -- if you look at the trend, you can see fourth quarter was a bit better. And then when you look at first quarter, it's up sequentially from where we were in the fourth quarter. And actually, even inside of there, what we saw was momentum building. So January was a little lower. February was a little bit higher from that and March was even higher. So we feel good in terms of where we are. In terms of the overall competitive environment, yes, there are quite a few entrants now in the space, and we know that there are a number that are coming in as well in 2022. We feel really good about our broad product offerings.  IN addition to being competitive with the rest of the market, we have a couple of new and really proprietary index options that we've offered as well as new product features that are unique to our particular product. So between that and the power of our distribution, we feel very good in terms of our overall share of IVA and continuing to sell and really sustain that momentum that we're seeing."

And for us, overall it has the benefit of increasing overall ROEs, and it's also very supportive from an overall capital perspective, because we're effectively passing through a significant amount of the guarantee. So it's worked well. We are pretty close to really the capacity of that particular deal as we round out to the end of the quarter -- the second quarter. Just to give you a sense, by the way, when we talk about VA with guaranteed living benefits in terms of overall sales, and we mentioned 25% in the quarter. When we look at the net, so the pass-through of the reinsurance for the quarter, that 25% drops to about 18%. And we're evaluating the potential to continue to extend it, as we always do with all of our partners. So we'll let you know as we continue to look at it, but it's worked out extremely well on both sides, and we're very grateful for the partnership that we have with Talcott."

I am excited about and confident in Lincoln's continued success as I step into the CEO role effective later this month. Dennis has been a valued mentor and colleague for many years, and I look forward to working with him as he transitions into the role of Chairman of the Board. I have met many of the investors and analysts joining today's call and look forward to having more opportunities to discuss Lincoln with all of you. Although the U.S. continued to experience headwinds related to the pandemic, Lincoln had a solid start to 2022. We are pleased with our underlying results and optimistic about the outlook for our business. 
Our current strategy has proven to be robust and we have an excellent track record of executing against it, as demonstrated in part by having compounded underlying EPS at 11% over the past decade.  As we have said, we expect over the next few years to grow underlying EPS at or above the high end of our 8% to 10% target range. I will now touch on some of the initiatives that are positioning us to meet this objective. First, we continue to generate organic growth at strong new business returns meaningfully above target across our businesses, driven by our broad product portfolio and our industry-leading distribution franchise. Top line growth is enhanced by our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, which is enabling us to meet evolving consumer needs. We have been able to drive a shift towards products with additional risk-sharing between Lincoln and customers that appeal to broader demographics and expand shelf space. We introduced 13 new products in 2021 and continue to innovate. 
Second, company-wide margin improvement efforts are primarily centered around our Spark initiative, which we expect to generate $260 million to $300 million in run-rate savings by the end of 2024. Investments we are making in our business through Spark will enable us to operate more efficiently and effectively and to improve the customer and employee experience, including the way we work here at Lincoln. Additionally, we are focused on improving the group protection underlying margin through continued pricing actions, improved claims effectiveness and Spark expense savings. And last, we continue to focus on effective capital allocation, including returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Recently, we announced that we are bringing our Individual Life and Annuities businesses together under a senior leader who will join Lincoln in July and report to me. Product manufacturing has long been a key driver of the success of these businesses, and we see this continuing as we also place continued emphasis on in-force management.  Bringing the Life and Annuities businesses together creates more opportunity to leverage our capabilities, share best practices and enable greater innovation. This new leader will also oversee Lincoln Financial Network, or LFN, which represents more than 11,000 advisers and our growing wealth management platform. 
Turning now to the business segments. Starting with Annuities. Our products are generating strong returns as we continue to sell on our terms across broadly diversified product segments, with disciplined pricing and risk management built directly into the product design. Critical to our success in meeting the needs of our customers is offering a broad product portfolio through our industry-leading distribution force. We continue to enhance our product offerings, including the launch of multiple new investment options and features that differentiate our products and expand consumer choice. 
Sales of $2.7 billion were down 4% versus the prior year period due to a decline in indexed variable annuities. However, IVA sales were up sequentially for the second consecutive quarter as we regained sales momentum through our product innovation and an improved competitive pricing environment. In fixed indexed annuities, sales were up again significantly. Our differentiated investment options and higher rates have restored momentum to the FIA product line. The breadth of our annuity portfolio is enabling our strategic sales shift, and variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits remain under 30% of total annuity sales for the 7th consecutive quarter. Our ongoing sales shift also is further diversifying the total annuities in-force account value mix, as variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits again represented less than half of total account value. At our current sales mix, this proportion will continue to decline. 
To be clear, we have been undertaking this mix shift for diversification purposes only, as we believe in the value proposition of guaranteed living benefits for customers and are achieving very attractive mid-20% ROEs. We expect to see continued momentum as we look to further grow the Annuities business. Retirement Plan Services continues to have success and achieved record first quarter net flows of $946 million. First quarter total deposits of $3.4 billion were up 28%, including an 11% rise in recurring deposits and a 73% increase in first year sales. This sales growth, combined with high customer retention, led to the quarter's excellent outcome. The retirement business is benefiting from the strong labor market. U.S. wage growth and increases in employee contribution rates were the main drivers of this quarter's recurring deposit growth. We also saw robust first year sales growth across our broad product portfolio. 
Another external factor, the constructive legislative environment, is also creating longer-term growth opportunities for RPS around in-plan guarantees and pooled employer plan solutions as well as by creating greater incentives for employers to establish plans. Beyond these external tailwinds is the favorable competitive positioning of RPS, with its broad, innovative product suite, enhanced digital capabilities and the power of Lincoln's distribution franchise. The retirement business continues to produce strong returns and to drive positive net flows. 
Our Life Insurance business continues to demonstrate broad-based top line momentum as sales of $155 million were up 36% over the prior year period with growth across all major product lines. Since undertaking our reprice, shift and add-new-product strategy, we have returned to a more typical seasonal sales pattern and expect sales to ramp up through the end of the year. Our Life portfolio is achieving new business targeted returns and we continue to attract new financial professionals;  For instance, with our successful rollout last year of the first-of-its-kind variable hybrid life product, MoneyGuard Market Advantage. This ongoing product innovation is expanding our access to new customer segments while advancing our sales mix shift towards lower guarantee risk-sharing solutions, which represent over 70% of total life sales. 
We continue to expand upon and to see strong adoption of our digital capability. For example, in underwriting, we are investing in automation and other technologies that drive internal efficiencies. We are also utilizing digital real-time medical information. This is helping improve the producer and consumer experience by decreasing the average issue time from 5 weeks to 2, with the capability to issue within the same day. 
Lastly, on Group Protection, our results continue to be impacted by the pandemic. However, we are beginning to see signs of improvement and are confident that underlying margins will build over time toward the upper end of our target 5% to 7% range. The strong demand for employee benefits helped drive sales of $105 million, up 42% compared to the prior year period. We generated growth across all case sizes, primarily driven by increased sales to existing clients, as our corporate customers hire more employees, raise salaries and expand benefits offerings to include new lines of coverage. 
Employee-paid sales represented 57% of the total this quarter. We expect the proportion of employee-paid sales to continue to rise over time on an annualized basis as we focus on growing in this market, including supplemental health. First quarter premiums of nearly $1.2 billion rose 4% compared to the prior year period, driven by new sales, improved persistency, rate increases and employment growth. I am pleased with this quarter's underlying results and confident our strategic actions will drive margin expansion over time to the top of our targeted range. 
Moving to investment results. Credit quality remains excellent, with 97% of our fixed income assets rated investment grade or investment-grade equivalent. Portfolio performance remains strong as we experienced another quarter of negligible credit losses and positive net ratings migration. New money yields rose to 3.3% in the first quarter a nearly 50 basis point sequential increase, driven by higher rates. During the quarter, we invested 60% of new money in assets other than public corporates, and expect to continue to invest at this level, adding high-quality assets with incremental yield. Finally, alternative investment performance was in line with our long-term expectations of a 2.5% quarterly or 10% annualized return. 
In closing, Lincoln's underlying earnings power is intact. We expect to benefit from the recent significant decline in pandemic hospitalizations and deaths and the rise in interest rates. Looking across our businesses, we are progressing on several fronts. Sales momentum continues to build, driven by our broad and innovative product portfolio and distribution strength. The Spark initiative is on track and group protection margin expansion efforts take hold. We will continue to allocate capital towards its highest and best use. In closing, we continue to execute on our near-term strategy with an eye toward long-term profitable growth. I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $294 million, or $1.66 per share. The quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $150 million or $0.85 per share and unusual items of $19 million or $0.11 per share, primarily related to a Group Protection customer submitting a backlog of prior year claims. As Ellen mentioned, alternative investment income was in line with long-term expectations. Net income for the first quarter totaled $104 million or $0.58 per share, with the difference between net income and adjusted operating income primarily resulting from a loss related to variable annuity net derivative results. The hedge program was 96% effective in what was a volatile quarter of the capital [ markets ]. With the recent increase in rates this year, I thought I would update you on spread compression at Lincoln. Our current expectation is that spread compression will impact EPS growth in the near term by 0% to 1%, improved from the 2% to 3% range I communicated on last quarter's earnings call. 
Touching on the performance of key financial metrics compared to the prior year.  Excluding excess alternative investment income in the prior year quarter and the impact of the third quarter 2021 block reinsurance transaction, on a consolidated basis, operating revenues were up 4%. Our expense ratio improved 20 basis points. Shares outstanding declined 10% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $78.32, up 8% and an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $302 million compared to $290 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher account values driven by year-over-year growth in the equity markets and expense efficiency. Average account values of $164 billion increased 2% year-over-year. Of note, and as Ellen pointed out, variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits now represent less than 50% of our annuity account values. 
For variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, the net amount at risk stands at 134 basis points for living benefits and 107 basis points for death benefits. We expect these percentages to remain at the very low end of peers, highlighting the lower-risk nature of our in-force business. 
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declined 3% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Return metrics remained solid with a return on assets of 74 basis points, up 2 basis points year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%. As a reminder, sequentially there were 2 fewer fee days in the quarter, which reduced earnings by roughly $8 million. Overall, a good result for the annuity business, highlighted by strong returns and effective expense discipline. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $55 million compared to $57 million in the prior year quarter, as strong net flows and a year-over-year increase in the equity markets were more than offset by less favorable variable investment income. Continued sales success has produced $1.1 billion in net flows over the trailing 12 months, contributing to a 7% increase in average account values to $96 billion. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were in line with prior year quarter. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 6 basis points versus the prior year quarter, in line with our stated 5 to 10 basis point range as crediting rate actions take hold. Benefiting from the increase in rates, we expect spread compression in the retirement business going forward to be de minimis. This was another great quarter for the retirement business, with strong net flows and expense management, and an expectation as we exit the quarter that spread compression has become a non-event for the business. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $58 million compared to $107 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was due to less favorable alternative investment income, a more normal level of underlying mortality and the impact of the Resolution deal, which combined more than offset improved pandemic claims. This quarter's earnings were impacted by $69 million of pandemic-related mortality. Average account values, excluding the impact of last year's block reinsurance deal, rose 4%. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 1% from the prior year quarter. Base spreads declined 12 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We expect spread compression to return to our 5 to 10 basis point stated range. 
Outside of continued pandemic headwinds, Life results were solid, with underlying mortality in line with our first quarter expectations, good expense management and growing sales. Group Protection reported a loss from operations of $41 million compared to a loss of $26 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's loss is a significant improvement over a loss of [ $150 ] million in the fourth quarter as the impact of the pandemic began to ease, and we saw improvement in underlying disability results. 
As noted in my opening comments, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by $19 million of unusual items. The pandemic impacted our Group Life results by $53 million and our disability results by $18 million. Group Protection pandemic claims relative to U.S. COVID deaths improved significantly from recent quarters due to death transitioning back towards the nonworking edge population. Excluding pandemic claims and unusual items, the group margin was 5.1%, at the low end of our targeted range of 5% to 7%. 
On the Life side, our underlying loss ratio of 72.9% improved 240 basis points year-over-year to 60 basis points sequentially as results benefited from pricing actions and good underlying experience. Our underlying disability loss ratio of 80.4% improved 680 basis points sequentially, as the seasonally higher claims that we saw in the fourth quarter returned to more normal levels. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2021, our disability underlying loss ratio is up 290 basis points and remains elevated compared to long-term expectations, as both incidents and severity are above historic levels. I'd estimate that this hurt  group's first quarter results by $10 million to $15 million. We believe our underlying disability results are indirectly influenced by the pandemic, as delayed treatments and lack of routine care during peak pandemic waves appears to be impacting the overall health of our claimants. Our claims management efforts are focused on helping our customers recover and get back to work as quickly as possible, and should lead to improving underlying disability results over time. Expense ratio was 12.7%, up 20 basis points, primarily due to elevated staffing levels given the volume of pandemic-related claims. We remain confident that the combined impacts of repricing, improved claims management and Spark expense [ A's ] will move us to the top of our 5% to 7% target range.
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at approximately 415%, while cash at the holding company stands at $755 million. During the quarter, we paid off our $300 million 2022 debt maturity and issued $300 million of new debt as a partial prefunding of our 2023 maturity. We executed a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter, retiring over 3% of shares outstanding. As I mentioned was possible at last quarter's earnings conference call, with that level of repurchases, we chose not to pursue any open market buybacks, but we expect these to resume in the second quarter. 
In conclusion, while still affected by the financial impacts of the pandemic, our underlying results remain strong and leading indicators are positive. Such as spread compression, which has been with us for many years, has come down dramatically, and as I noted earlier, now represents a very modest headwind to EPS growth of 0% to 1%. 
Our Group Protection margin enhancement efforts are gaining traction, with underlying results returning to the bottom of our targeted margin range. Investments that we are making in the Spark initiative will drive significant expense savings over the next 3 years. While the pandemic is still with us, the combined impact of vaccinations and natural immunity can continue to reduce the potential negative financial impacts on Lincoln. And while investing significant capital at strong returns to support new business that will drive our earnings of tomorrow, we are continuing to return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

I think when you think about buybacks in the second quarter, I'd go back to our sort of overarching philosophy when it comes to ongoing share buyback programs, open market programs. Typically, we have used a more levelized approach. We think that makes more sense. It avoids the ups and downs of the share price. So I'd expect us in terms of the buybacks we're going to do over the remainder of the year, to spread them more evenly. 
The other thing I'd point out, there's a fair amount of uncertainty in the environment as we see [ a good day ]. There's a war going on, [ we've got ]inflation. There's a question on what the economy is going to do. So I think it's one of those years where you lean towards prudence when it comes to that. More broadly speaking, Nigel, when it comes to capital allocation in general, just as a reminder, right? We have -- we generate a lot of capital. We've generated a lot of capital over the years. We have 2 big places we put that capital. There's new business, new business which has historically been about 60% to 65% of our overall capital allocation. You've seen us, though, at times flex up or down, right? We flex down when the opportunity is not there. You saw that a couple of years ago when we took sales down, but we flex up when the opportunity is there, both from a return and a sales standpoint. And you really saw that in Ellen's comments. She talked about every business is getting returns meaningfully above their target. There really has not been a better time to be issuing new business in our space in some time. So it may be one of those years when we flex up a little bit from a new business standpoint, but we'll see what the sales opportunities are over the remainder the year. Then obviously, the other big bucket is return to shareholders. We've done a lot, right? We -- if you look over the last 4 quarters, we've done $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion buybacks, $300 million of dividends. 
If you look over a longer period of time, I was actually -- it was interesting. I was looking at our long history of returning capital to shareholders. If you go back over the last decade or so, we've actually returned $10.3 billion of capital to shareholders, $7.9 billion of that through buybacks. That's -- I think it represents 46% reduction in our outstanding shares. So yes, we believe in returning capital to shareholders. We're going to get back to buying back our stock in this second quarter, but I'd expect us to be more levelized over the remainder of the year, and I'd expect us to lean a little on the conservative side."

So there's price increases, there's claims effectiveness, which we need to continue to work on. And then there's the Spark program, which is really just getting going from an investment standpoint and you really should start to see the benefits of.  So yes, I think 5.1% is where you end up. I think it's a good place to start, and we're very confident, as both Ellen and I said, in moving towards the upper end of that range over time."

So -- everything you said, I think, makes sense, the -- in terms of the environment and your new business was strong. So that's probably going to be consuming some more capital. Should we expect something below the normal $150 million of quarterly buybacks over the next couple of quarters here? And then also, I think from the capital that was freed up from the life reinsurance transaction that was still an extra $150 million or so of buybacks that you had planned to do.

And we said at the time, we would put $900 million of that into buybacks and the remainder will go into debt reduction. And so we've completed the $900 million of buybacks. So there's that. In terms of  the amount, I agree with you that historically, we've averaged $150 million, and that's, I think, over time still a long-term expectation. Just as a reminder, with the Resolution deal, that $900 million of incremental buybacks we did, that represents about 15 years' worth of distributable earnings we were going to get off that block of business. But we did give up about $75 million or so of distributable earnings. So in the near term, we've given up that $75 million. 
Now we'd, obviously we'd expect our capital generation to grow over time. But the normal growth we're going to get from our growing business is going to get a little masked, at least, I think, for this year. Equity markets are down, those sorts of things. So I think you're not seeing that normal growth in capital generation that we'd see in a typical year. So that would lead us to a starting point a little below the normal $150 million a quarter that you would typically see. And then as I pointed out and you pointed out in your question, I think the capital opportunity in new business will, probably -- it's early in the year, so it's tough to project. But when you look at the first quarter and what we expect over the remainder of the year, I think about $100 million to $150 million of incremental capital in the new business this year relative to a normal year. 
So that would put you down, Tom, more into the $100 million a quarter range as an annual -- as a normal expectation. So I'd put it at $100 million to $150 million. Just one other point, if you had asked me the same question in the first quarter of last year, I would have said the exact same thing probably. I think we ended up doing $105 million in the first quarter of last year, and then we ended up doing $600 million for the full year. So it's somewhat influenced by how the environment rolls out over the remainder of the year, Tom."

So you know that I've been with Lincoln now for 10 years and very much and part of really architecting the existing strategy. And everything that we have talked to you about, we are going to continue to execute on. So all things as it relates to our reprice shift and add-new-product strategy and really focusing there on organic growth. And you can see real evidence of that in this particular quarter as we're continuing to build momentum there. The second area is really around expense initiatives and all of the execution that we're doing, and very much on track as it relates to the overall Spark initiative. And we've also talked to you about the fact that in addition to that being a cost save program, that it very much is focused on improving overall efficiency as it relates to our customers and how we face off with them, and also a real focus on the employee experience. So that's very important. 
And then the third area, which we've also touched on, is around restoring our group margin to the higher end. And there, as Randy just talked about, and as we both highlighted in our script, we've got all of the pricing actions that we're focused on there. Of course, the expense efficiencies through Spark and then the claims effectiveness. So all of that, we're going to continue to execute on. 
As we think about longer term, and we have talked to all of you about the fact that as I'm stepping into the CEO role, we are also thinking about longer-term strategy and overall longer-term direction. And so I'm way too early to communicate anything at this time, but what I will share with you is one of the first things that we have done as part of the transition is we've looked at our overall organizational structure and how that will align with us, thinking about executing on the near-term strategy while we are also focused on building out what that longer-term strategy looks like. 
And so we've appointed a Chief Strategy Officer that is focused on that now 24/7 and really taking a look at that. And then also our focus on combining the Individual Life and Annuity businesses together, along with LFN and bringing that together is also very much strategic as we think about that. And so if I just step back for a second on that, we very much -- as we think about, for example, our product strategy and how we have focused on product manufacturing over the years. We're starting to see more opportunity for synergy and innovation across the 2 individual businesses. And so examples of that are products that have shifting investment engines, shifting value propositions, where both are thinking about -- risk sharing is another example there. 
We see opportunity as it relates to the overall, the customer experience and operations. And then this other part that I highlighted, which is a continued emphasis as it relates to overall in-force management and some opportunity there. So more to come. Yes, we'll also take a look at capital management as part of everything that we're going to be doing longer term.  And as soon as we have something more definitive to be able to talk to you about, we'll in fact do that."

So as it relates to a favorable environment, I think we see a couple of things there. The first is, clearly from a capital-markets perspective, we have higher rates. And in general, when we think about higher rates and we have the 10-year now at 3%, this is an opportunity now to be able to invest new money higher, and that translates into offering customers higher value propositions. And so across the board, we think that, that will benefit the overall industry, and it will benefit Lincoln as well. So that's 1 piece.
The second thing that is very much important is that as we continue to manage through this pandemic, and we're now more than 24 months in, we're seeing that it has definitely increased awareness and, therefore, demand for financial protection and security. And so we're seeing real evidence of that, for example, in our Group Protection business, where we saw that sales were up pretty significantly year-over-year. 
The primary driver of that was inside of the existing clients and seeing increased demand there. The other thing that's happening from a macro environment is that we all know that we're seeing evidence of wage inflation, and we're seeing a direct relationship in terms of increased compensation that is leading to increased -- for example, on deposits in the retirement business. So across the board and also because there's such a significant focus right now on the overall employment environment and needing to attract talent, we're seeing expansion of benefits as well. And so that's another opportunity there. So I think across the board, there are a number of areas that are providing overall opportunity from a macro and external perspective. 
The other thing that I'll add is that we have done so much in terms of product innovation over the last couple of years that we are seeing that we have more and more attractive financial product. I mentioned in my script that we introduced 13 new products last year in 2021. And so we're seeing that the expansion of product, it's appealing to expand the demographics and very much so is part of why we also view that this is a favorable environment."

So it was 72 basis points last year, 74 basis points this year. So there is seasonality inside of the ROA mentioned.  It's about $8 million if you look at the first quarter compared to sequentially the fourth quarter. So that is an impact. But to be fair, when the markets go down, you get less fee income. And that influences ROA. So I think whether we're at that high 70s or 80 range will somewhat depend if the markets stabilize and start to move back up, right? It isn't so much volatility in the markets that drive ROA. It's whether they go down and stay down. You get less fee income, that influences the top line, and that will give you a modestly lower ROA. I think when you look over the -- look at the broad sweep of time, markets will stabilize, we believe markets will start to move back up. And in that environment, we'd fully expect to move into that 75 to 80 basis point range again."

We've averaged taking annual dividends out of LNBar of roughly $125 million over the last 5 years. So we took $85 million in the first quarter. We did have breakage in the first quarter, that followed a few quarters of really good results. 
Last year, I would say that the program didn't have, I think, over the whole year, I think it was about $120 million of breakage, which is a good year. So it was elevated in the first quarter.  I think that was really driven by 2 things. If you break up breakage into the 2 big buckets; one, fund basis went against us in the quarter. So that was about 1/3, I would say, of the excess breakage. As a reminder, fund basis is one of those things where we can go back over any extended period of time, it adds up to 0, but it can move up and down. So it was -- that hurt us this time. I think the other 2/3 was really all about the volatility in the markets that we saw in the first quarter. The total amount the hedge target traveled over the quarter was about twice what we saw on average last year. 
And when you see that sort of volatility, 2 things happen. We have to trade more. And you get some second order breakage. So I think it was one of those quarters where we'll have a little elevated breakage. I think when you look -- when we go out a couple of years and look back, what you'll see is that it will be averaged out with some good quarters, and we'll get back to that long-term expectation of some level of breakage. Does that help, Alex?"

So yes, as it relates to indexed VA, it is an important tail. And so the first thing is that while you are correct that IVA sales year-over-year were down 30%, what we saw is that in the first half of 2021, you may remember that -- we saw rates come down pretty significantly and market volatility also come down. And so it required us to really do a pretty significant repricing in that particular time to be able to meet our overall target returns. And so we did that, and we actually led the rest of the industry down. And so we knew at the time that we did that -- because we will not offer product out on the shelf that is not meeting or exceeding our target returns -- we knew when we did that, that we were going to see a pullback in sales, and that's exactly what happened. 
And so the third quarter really bottomed out in terms of our overall IVA sales. And then we started to see sequential rebound. And so you saw -- if you look at the trend, you can see fourth quarter was a bit better. And then when you look at first quarter, it's up sequentially from where we were in the fourth quarter. And actually, even inside of there, what we saw was momentum building. So January was a little lower. February was a little bit higher from that and March was even higher. So we feel good in terms of where we are. In terms of the overall competitive environment, yes, there are quite a few entrants now in the space, and we know that there are a number that are coming in as well in 2022. We feel really good about our broad product offerings.  In addition to being competitive with the rest of the market, we have a couple of new and really proprietary index options that we've offered as well as new product features that are unique to our particular product. So between that and the power of our distribution, we feel very good in terms of our overall share of IVA and continuing to sell and really sustain that momentum that we're seeing."

And for us, overall it has the benefit of increasing overall ROEs, and it's also very supportive from an overall capital perspective, because we're effectively passing through a significant amount of the guarantee. So it's worked well. We are pretty close to really the capacity of that particular deal as we round out to the end of the quarter -- the second quarter. Just to give you a sense, by the way, when we talk about VA with guaranteed living benefits in terms of overall sales, and we mentioned 25% in the quarter. When we look at the net, so the pass-through of the reinsurance for the quarter, that 25% drops to about 18%. And we're evaluating the potential to continue to extend it, as we always do with all of our partners. So we'll let you know as we continue to look at it, but it's worked out extremely well on both sides, and we're very grateful for the partnership that we have with Talcott."

I am excited about and confident in Lincoln's continued success as I step into the CEO role effective later this month. Dennis has been a valued mentor and colleague for many years, and I look forward to working with him as he transitions into the role of Chairman of the Board. I have met many of the investors and analysts joining today's call and look forward to having more opportunities to discuss Lincoln with all of you. Although the U.S. continued to experience headwinds related to the pandemic, Lincoln had a solid start to 2022. We are pleased with our underlying results and optimistic about the outlook for our business. 
Our current strategy has proven to be robust and we have an excellent track record of executing against it, as demonstrated in part by having compounded underlying EPS at 11% over the past decade.  As we have said, we expect over the next few years to grow underlying EPS at or above the high end of our 8% to 10% target range. I will now touch on some of the initiatives that are positioning us to meet this objective. First, we continue to generate organic growth at strong new business returns meaningfully above target across our businesses, driven by our broad product portfolio and our industry-leading distribution franchise. Top line growth is enhanced by our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, which is enabling us to meet evolving consumer needs. We have been able to drive a shift towards products with additional risk-sharing between Lincoln and customers that appeal to broader demographics and expand shelf space. We introduced 13 new products in 2021 and continue to innovate. 
Second, company-wide margin improvement efforts are primarily centered around our Spark initiative, which we expect to generate $260 million to $300 million in run-rate savings by the end of 2024. Investments we are making in our business through Spark will enable us to operate more efficiently and effectively and to improve the customer and employee experience, including the way we work here at Lincoln. Additionally, we are focused on improving the group protection underlying margin through continued pricing actions, improved claims effectiveness and Spark expense savings. And last, we continue to focus on effective capital allocation, including returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Recently, we announced that we are bringing our Individual Life and Annuities businesses together under a senior leader who will join Lincoln in July and report to me. Product manufacturing has long been a key driver of the success of these businesses, and we see this continuing as we also place continued emphasis on in-force management.  Bringing the Life and Annuities businesses together creates more opportunity to leverage our capabilities, share best practices and enable greater innovation. This new leader will also oversee Lincoln Financial Network, or LFN, which represents more than 11,000 advisers and our growing wealth management platform. 
Turning now to the business segments. Starting with Annuities. Our products are generating strong returns as we continue to sell on our terms across broadly diversified product segments, with disciplined pricing and risk management built directly into the product design. Critical to our success in meeting the needs of our customers is offering a broad product portfolio through our industry-leading distribution force. We continue to enhance our product offerings, including the launch of multiple new investment options and features that differentiate our products and expand consumer choice. 
Sales of $2.7 billion were down 4% versus the prior year period due to a decline in indexed variable annuities. However, IVA sales were up sequentially for the second consecutive quarter as we regained sales momentum through our product innovation and an improved competitive pricing environment. In fixed indexed annuities, sales were up again significantly. Our differentiated investment options and higher rates have restored momentum to the FIA product line. The breadth of our annuity portfolio is enabling our strategic sales shift, and variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits remain under 30% of total annuity sales for the 7th consecutive quarter. Our ongoing sales shift also is further diversifying the total annuities in-force account value mix, as variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits again represented less than half of total account value. At our current sales mix, this proportion will continue to decline. 
To be clear, we have been undertaking this mix shift for diversification purposes only, as we believe in the value proposition of guaranteed living benefits for customers and are achieving very attractive mid-20% ROEs. We expect to see continued momentum as we look to further grow the Annuities business. Retirement Plan Services continues to have success and achieved record first quarter net flows of $946 million. First quarter total deposits of $3.4 billion were up 28%, including an 11% rise in recurring deposits and a 73% increase in first year sales. This sales growth, combined with high customer retention, led to the quarter's excellent outcome. The retirement business is benefiting from the strong labor market. U.S. wage growth and increases in employee contribution rates were the main drivers of this quarter's recurring deposit growth. We also saw robust first year sales growth across our broad product portfolio. 
Another external factor, the constructive legislative environment, is also creating longer-term growth opportunities for RPS around in-plan guarantees and pooled employer plan solutions as well as by creating greater incentives for employers to establish plans. Beyond these external tailwinds is the favorable competitive positioning of RPS, with its broad, innovative product suite, enhanced digital capabilities and the power of Lincoln's distribution franchise. The retirement business continues to produce strong returns and to drive positive net flows. 
Our Life Insurance business continues to demonstrate broad-based top line momentum as sales of $155 million were up 36% over the prior year period with growth across all major product lines. Since undertaking our reprice, shift and add-new-product strategy, we have returned to a more typical seasonal sales pattern and expect sales to ramp up through the end of the year. Our Life portfolio is achieving new business targeted returns and we continue to attract new financial professionals;  For instance, with our successful rollout last year of the first-of-its-kind variable hybrid life product, MoneyGuard Market Advantage. This ongoing product innovation is expanding our access to new customer segments while advancing our sales mix shift towards lower guarantee risk-sharing solutions, which represent over 70% of total life sales. 
We continue to expand upon and to see strong adoption of our digital capability. For example, in underwriting, we are investing in automation and other technologies that drive internal efficiencies. We are also utilizing digital real-time medical information. This is helping improve the producer and consumer experience by decreasing the average issue time from 5 weeks to 2, with the capability to issue within the same day. 
Lastly, on Group Protection, our results continue to be impacted by the pandemic. However, we are beginning to see signs of improvement and are confident that underlying margins will build over time toward the upper end of our target 5% to 7% range. The strong demand for employee benefits helped drive sales of $105 million, up 42% compared to the prior year period. We generated growth across all case sizes, primarily driven by increased sales to existing clients, as our corporate customers hire more employees, raise salaries and expand benefits offerings to include new lines of coverage. 
Employee-paid sales represented 57% of the total this quarter. We expect the proportion of employee-paid sales to continue to rise over time on an annualized basis as we focus on growing in this market, including supplemental health. First quarter premiums of nearly $1.2 billion rose 4% compared to the prior year period, driven by new sales, improved persistency, rate increases and employment growth. I am pleased with this quarter's underlying results and confident our strategic actions will drive margin expansion over time to the top of our targeted range. 
Moving to investment results. Credit quality remains excellent, with 97% of our fixed income assets rated investment grade or investment-grade equivalent. Portfolio performance remains strong as we experienced another quarter of negligible credit losses and positive net ratings migration. New money yields rose to 3.3% in the first quarter a nearly 50 basis point sequential increase, driven by higher rates. During the quarter, we invested 60% of new money in assets other than public corporates, and expect to continue to invest at this level, adding high-quality assets with incremental yield. Finally, alternative investment performance was in line with our long-term expectations of a 2.5% quarterly or 10% annualized return. 
In closing, Lincoln's underlying earnings power is intact. We expect to benefit from the recent significant decline in pandemic hospitalizations and deaths and the rise in interest rates. Looking across our businesses, we are progressing on several fronts. Sales momentum continues to build, driven by our broad and innovative product portfolio and distribution strength. The Spark initiative is on track and group protection margin expansion efforts take hold. We will continue to allocate capital towards its highest and best use. In closing, we continue to execute on our near-term strategy with an eye toward long-term profitable growth. I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $294 million, or $1.66 per share. The quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $150 million or $0.85 per share and unusual items of $19 million or $0.11 per share, primarily related to a Group Protection customer submitting a backlog of prior year claims. As Ellen mentioned, alternative investment income was in line with long-term expectations. Net income for the first quarter totaled $104 million or $0.58 per share, with the difference between net income and adjusted operating income primarily resulting from a loss related to variable annuity net derivative results. The hedge program was 96% effective in what was a volatile quarter of the capital [ markets ]. With the recent increase in rates this year, I thought I would update you on spread compression at Lincoln. Our current expectation is that spread compression will impact EPS growth in the near term by 0% to 1%, improved from the 2% to 3% range I communicated on last quarter's earnings call. 
Touching on the performance of key financial metrics compared to the prior year.  Excluding excess alternative investment income in the prior year quarter and the impact of the third quarter 2021 block reinsurance transaction, on a consolidated basis, operating revenues were up 4%. Our expense ratio improved 20 basis points. Shares outstanding declined 10% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $78.32, up 8% and an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $302 million compared to $290 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher account values driven by year-over-year growth in the equity markets and expense efficiency. Average account values of $164 billion increased 2% year-over-year. Of note, and as Ellen pointed out, variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits now represent less than 50% of our annuity account values. 
For variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, the net amount at risk stands at 134 basis points for living benefits and 107 basis points for death benefits. We expect these percentages to remain at the very low end of peers, highlighting the lower-risk nature of our in-force business. 
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declined 3% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Return metrics remained solid with a return on assets of 74 basis points, up 2 basis points year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%. As a reminder, sequentially there were 2 fewer fee days in the quarter, which reduced earnings by roughly $8 million. Overall, a good result for the annuity business, highlighted by strong returns and effective expense discipline. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $55 million compared to $57 million in the prior year quarter, as strong net flows and a year-over-year increase in the equity markets were more than offset by less favorable variable investment income. Continued sales success has produced $1.1 billion in net flows over the trailing 12 months, contributing to a 7% increase in average account values to $96 billion. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were in line with prior year quarter. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 6 basis points versus the prior year quarter, in line with our stated 5 to 10 basis point range as crediting rate actions take hold. Benefiting from the increase in rates, we expect spread compression in the retirement business going forward to be de minimis. This was another great quarter for the retirement business, with strong net flows and expense management, and an expectation as we exit the quarter that spread compression has become a non-event for the business. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $58 million compared to $107 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was due to less favorable alternative investment income, a more normal level of underlying mortality and the impact of the Resolution deal, which combined more than offset improved pandemic claims. This quarter's earnings were impacted by $69 million of pandemic-related mortality. Average account values, excluding the impact of last year's block reinsurance deal, rose 4%. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 1% from the prior year quarter. Base spreads declined 12 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We expect spread compression to return to our 5 to 10 basis point stated range. 
Outside of continued pandemic headwinds, Life results were solid, with underlying mortality in line with our first quarter expectations, good expense management and growing sales. Group Protection reported a loss from operations of $41 million compared to a loss of $26 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's loss is a significant improvement over a loss of [ $150 ] million in the fourth quarter as the impact of the pandemic began to ease, and we saw improvement in underlying disability results. 
As noted in my opening comments, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by $19 million of unusual items. The pandemic impacted our Group Life results by $53 million and our disability results by $18 million. Group Protection pandemic claims relative to U.S. COVID deaths improved significantly from recent quarters due to death transitioning back towards the nonworking edge population. Excluding pandemic claims and unusual items, the group margin was 5.1%, at the low end of our targeted range of 5% to 7%. 
On the Life side, our underlying loss ratio of 72.9% improved 240 basis points year-over-year to 60 basis points sequentially as results benefited from pricing actions and good underlying experience. Our underlying disability loss ratio of 80.4% improved 680 basis points sequentially, as the seasonally higher claims that we saw in the fourth quarter returned to more normal levels. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2021, our disability underlying loss ratio is up 290 basis points and remains elevated compared to long-term expectations, as both incidents and severity are above historic levels. I'd estimate that this hurt  group's first quarter results by $10 million to $15 million. We believe our underlying disability results are indirectly influenced by the pandemic, as delayed treatments and lack of routine care during peak pandemic waves appears to be impacting the overall health of our claimants. Our claims management efforts are focused on helping our customers recover and get back to work as quickly as possible, and should lead to improving underlying disability results over time. Expense ratio was 12.7%, up 20 basis points, primarily due to elevated staffing levels given the volume of pandemic-related claims. We remain confident that the combined impacts of repricing, improved claims management and Spark expense [ A's ] will move us to the top of our 5% to 7% target range.
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at approximately 415%, while cash at the holding company stands at $755 million. During the quarter, we paid off our $300 million 2022 debt maturity and issued $300 million of new debt as a partial prefunding of our 2023 maturity. We executed a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter, retiring over 3% of shares outstanding. As I mentioned was possible at last quarter's earnings conference call, with that level of repurchases, we chose not to pursue any open market buybacks, but we expect these to resume in the second quarter. 
In conclusion, while still affected by the financial impacts of the pandemic, our underlying results remain strong and leading indicators are positive. Such as spread compression, which has been with us for many years, has come down dramatically, and as I noted earlier, now represents a very modest headwind to EPS growth of 0% to 1%. 
Our Group Protection margin enhancement efforts are gaining traction, with underlying results returning to the bottom of our targeted margin range. Investments that we are making in the Spark initiative will drive significant expense savings over the next 3 years. While the pandemic is still with us, the combined impact of vaccinations and natural immunity can continue to reduce the potential negative financial impacts on Lincoln. And while investing significant capital at strong returns to support new business that will drive our earnings of tomorrow, we are continuing to return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

I think when you think about buybacks in the second quarter, I'd go back to our sort of overarching philosophy when it comes to ongoing share buyback programs, open market programs. Typically, we have used a more levelized approach. We think that makes more sense. It avoids the ups and downs of the share price. So I'd expect us in terms of the buybacks we're going to do over the remainder of the year, to spread them more evenly. 
The other thing I'd point out, there's a fair amount of uncertainty in the environment as we see [ a good day ]. There's a war going on, [ we've got ]inflation. There's a question on what the economy is going to do. So I think it's one of those years where you lean towards prudence when it comes to that. More broadly speaking, Nigel, when it comes to capital allocation in general, just as a reminder, right? We have -- we generate a lot of capital. We've generated a lot of capital over the years. We have 2 big places we put that capital. There's new business, new business which has historically been about 60% to 65% of our overall capital allocation. You've seen us, though, at times flex up or down, right? We flex down when the opportunity is not there. You saw that a couple of years ago when we took sales down, but we flex up when the opportunity is there, both from a return and a sales standpoint. And you really saw that in Ellen's comments. She talked about every business is getting returns meaningfully above their target. There really has not been a better time to be issuing new business in our space in some time. So it may be one of those years when we flex up a little bit from a new business standpoint, but we'll see what the sales opportunities are over the remainder the year. Then obviously, the other big bucket is return to shareholders. We've done a lot, right? We -- if you look over the last 4 quarters, we've done $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion buybacks, $300 million of dividends. 
If you look over a longer period of time, I was actually -- it was interesting. I was looking at our long history of returning capital to shareholders. If you go back over the last decade or so, we've actually returned $10.3 billion of capital to shareholders, $7.9 billion of that through buybacks. That's -- I think it represents 46% reduction in our outstanding shares. So yes, we believe in returning capital to shareholders. We're going to get back to buying back our stock in this second quarter, but I'd expect us to be more levelized over the remainder of the year, and I'd expect us to lean a little on the conservative side."

So there's price increases, there's claims effectiveness, which we need to continue to work on. And then there's the Spark program, which is really just getting going from an investment standpoint and you really should start to see the benefits of.  So yes, I think 5.1% is where you end up. I think it's a good place to start, and we're very confident, as both Ellen and I said, in moving towards the upper end of that range over time."

So -- everything you said, I think, makes sense, the -- in terms of the environment and your new business was strong. So that's probably going to be consuming some more capital. Should we expect something below the normal $150 million of quarterly buybacks over the next couple of quarters here? And then also, I think from the capital that was freed up from the life reinsurance transaction that was still an extra $150 million or so of buybacks that you had planned to do. Should we assume those are unlikely to happen this year? Just anything you can give us on that sort of cadence in near-term buybacks would be helpful."

And we said at the time, we would put $900 million of that into buybacks and the remainder will go into debt reduction. And so we've completed the $900 million of buybacks. So there's that. In terms of  the amount, I agree with you that historically, we've averaged $150 million, and that's, I think, over time still a long-term expectation. Just as a reminder, with the Resolution deal, that $900 million of incremental buybacks we did, that represents about 15 years' worth of distributable earnings we were going to get off that block of business. But we did give up about $75 million or so of distributable earnings. So in the near term, we've given up that $75 million. 
Now we'd, obviously we'd expect our capital generation to grow over time. But the normal growth we're going to get from our growing business is going to get a little masked, at least, I think, for this year. Equity markets are down, those sorts of things. So I think you're not seeing that normal growth in capital generation that we'd see in a typical year. So that would lead us to a starting point a little below the normal $150 million a quarter that you would typically see. And then as I pointed out and you pointed out in your question, I think the capital opportunity in new business will, probably -- it's early in the year, so it's tough to project. But when you look at the first quarter and what we expect over the remainder of the year, I think about $100 million to $150 million of incremental capital in the new business this year relative to a normal year. 
So that would put you down, Tom, more into the $100 million a quarter range as an annual -- as a normal expectation. So I'd put it at $100 million to $150 million. Just one other point, if you had asked me the same question in the first quarter of last year, I would have said the exact same thing probably. I think we ended up doing $105 million in the first quarter of last year, and then we ended up doing $600 million for the full year. So it's somewhat influenced by how the environment rolls out over the remainder of the year, Tom."

So you know that I've been with Lincoln now for 10 years and very much and part of really architecting the existing strategy. And everything that we have talked to you about, we are going to continue to execute on. So all things as it relates to our reprice shift and add-new-product strategy and really focusing there on organic growth. And you can see real evidence of that in this particular quarter as we're continuing to build momentum there. The second area is really around expense initiatives and all of the execution that we're doing, and very much on track as it relates to the overall Spark initiative. And we've also talked to you about the fact that in addition to that being a cost save program, that it very much is focused on improving overall efficiency as it relates to our customers and how we face off with them, and also a real focus on the employee experience. So that's very important. 
And then the third area, which we've also touched on, is around restoring our group margin to the higher end. And there, as Randy just talked about, and as we both highlighted in our script, we've got all of the pricing actions that we're focused on there. Of course, the expense efficiencies through Spark and then the claims effectiveness. So all of that, we're going to continue to execute on. 
As we think about longer term, and we have talked to all of you about the fact that as I'm stepping into the CEO role, we are also thinking about longer-term strategy and overall longer-term direction. And so I'm way too early to communicate anything at this time, but what I will share with you is one of the first things that we have done as part of the transition is we've looked at our overall organizational structure and how that will align with us, thinking about executing on the near-term strategy while we are also focused on building out what that longer-term strategy looks like. 
And so we've appointed a Chief Strategy Officer that is focused on that now 24/7 and really taking a look at that. And then also our focus on combining the Individual Life and Annuity businesses together, along with LFN and bringing that together is also very much strategic as we think about that. And so if I just step back for a second on that, we very much -- as we think about, for example, our product strategy and how we have focused on product manufacturing over the years. We're starting to see more opportunity for synergy and innovation across the 2 individual businesses. And so examples of that are products that have shifting investment engines, shifting value propositions, where both are thinking about -- risk sharing is another example there. 
We see opportunity as it relates to the overall, the customer experience and operations. And then this other part that I highlighted, which is a continued emphasis as it relates to overall in-force management and some opportunity there. So more to come. Yes, we'll also take a look at capital management as part of everything that we're going to be doing longer term.  And as soon as we have something more definitive to be able to talk to you about, we'll in fact do that."

So as it relates to a favorable environment, I think we see a couple of things there. The first is, clearly from a capital-markets perspective, we have higher rates. And in general, when we think about higher rates and we have the 10-year now at 3%, this is an opportunity now to be able to invest new money higher, and that translates into offering customers higher value propositions. And so across the board, we think that, that will benefit the overall industry, and it will benefit Lincoln as well. So that's 1 piece.
The second thing that is very much important is that as we continue to manage through this pandemic, and we're now more than 24 months in, we're seeing that it has definitely increased awareness and, therefore, demand for financial protection and security. And so we're seeing real evidence of that, for example, in our Group Protection business, where we saw that sales were up pretty significantly year-over-year. 
The primary driver of that was inside of the existing clients and seeing increased demand there. The other thing that's happening from a macro environment is that we all know that we're seeing evidence of wage inflation, and we're seeing a direct relationship in terms of increased compensation that is leading to increased -- for example, on deposits in the retirement business. So across the board and also because there's such a significant focus right now on the overall employment environment and needing to attract talent, we're seeing expansion of benefits as well. And so that's another opportunity there. So I think across the board, there are a number of areas that are providing overall opportunity from a macro and external perspective. 
The other thing that I'll add is that we have done so much in terms of product innovation over the last couple of years that we are seeing that we have more and more attractive financial product. I mentioned in my script that we introduced 13 new products last year in 2021. And so we're seeing that the expansion of product, it's appealing to expand the demographics and very much so is part of why we also view that this is a favorable environment."

It isn't so much volatility in the markets that drive ROA. It's whether they go down and stay down. You get less fee income, that influences the top line, and that will give you a modestly lower ROA.

We actually got dividends from LNBar in the first quarter. I believe it was $85 million. We've averaged taking annual dividends out of LNBar of roughly $125 million over the last 5 years. So we took $85 million i",314,"The capital position is still very strong. We actually got dividends from LNBar in the first quarter. I believe it was $85 million. We've averaged taking annual dividends out of LNBar of roughly $125 million over the last 5 years. So we took $85 million in the first quarter. We did have breakage in the first quarter, that followed a few quarters of really good results. 
Last year, I would say that the program didn't have, I think, over the whole year, I think it was about $120 million of breakage, which is a good year. So it was elevated in the first quarter.  I think that was really driven by 2 things. If you break up breakage into the 2 big buckets; one, fund basis went against us in the quarter. So that was about 1/3, I would say, of the excess breakage. As a reminder, fund basis is one of those things where we can go back over any extended period of time, it adds up to 0, but it can move up and down. So it was -- that hurt us this time. I think the other 2/3 was really all about the volatility in the markets that we saw in the first quarter. The total amount the hedge target traveled over the quarter was about twice what we saw on average last year. 
And when you see that sort of volatility, 2 things happen. We have to trade more. And you get some second order breakage. So I think it was one of those quarters where we'll have a little elevated breakage. I think when you look -- when we go out a couple of years and look back, what you'll see is that it will be averaged out with some good quarters, and we'll get back to that long-term expectation of some level of breakage. Does that help, Alex?"

So yes, as it relates to indexed VA, it is an important tail. And so the first thing is that while you are correct that IVA sales year-over-year were down 30%, what we saw is that in the first half of 2021, you may remember that -- we saw rates come down pretty significantly and market volatility also come down. And so it required us to really do a pretty significant repricing in that particular time to be able to meet our overall target returns. And so we did that, and we actually led the rest of the industry down. And so we knew at the time that we did that -- because we will not offer product out on the shelf that is not meeting or exceeding our target returns -- we knew when we did that, that we were going to see a pullback in sales, and that's exactly what happened. 
And so the third quarter really bottomed out in terms of our overall IVA sales. And then we started to see sequential rebound. And so you saw -- if you look at the trend, you can see fourth quarter was a bit better. And then when you look at first quarter, it's up sequentially from where we were in the fourth quarter. And actually, even inside of there, what we saw was momentum building. So January was a little lower. February was a little bit higher from that and March was even higher. So we feel good in terms of where we are. In terms of the overall competitive environment, yes, there are quite a few entrants now in the space, and we know that there are a number that are coming in as well in 2022. We feel really good about our broad product offerings.  In addition to being competitive with the rest of the market, we have a couple of new and really proprietary index options that we've offered as well as new product features that are unique to our particular product. So between that and the power of our distribution, we feel very good in terms of our overall share of IVA and continuing to sell and really sustain that momentum that we're seeing."

So you are correct, Suneet, that the VA flow deal that we did, which really if you all remember and just to set some context here, we did this deal with Talcott and it is effective through the end of June, and it is a flow deal. And basically what it did is, it really effectively substantiated that the cost or the price that we are charging for our guarantees is appropriate. 
And for us, overall it has the benefit of increasing overall ROEs, and it's also very supportive from an overall capital perspective, because we're effectively passing through a significant amount of the guarantee. So it's worked well. We are pretty close to really the capacity of that particular deal as we round out to the end of the quarter -- the second quarter. Just to give you a sense, by the way, when we talk about VA with guaranteed living benefits in terms of overall sales, and we mentioned 25% in the quarter. When we look at the net, so the pass-through of the reinsurance for the quarter, that 25% drops to about 18%. And we're evaluating the potential to continue to extend it, as we always do with all of our partners. So we'll let you know as we continue to look at it, but it's worked out extremely well on both sides, and we're very grateful for the partnership that we have with Talcott."

As you all know, Lincoln has been providing financial protection and security to millions of Americans and their families for 117 years through 2 pandemics and numerous recessions. Over those years,",1716,"Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone, and welcome. As you all know, Lincoln has been providing financial protection and security to millions of Americans and their families for 117 years through 2 pandemics and numerous recessions. Over those years, we have built a powerful franchise with a reputation and brand grounded in integrity and trust, and we are a destination employer known for our great culture, talent development and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We pride ourselves on our many strengths, including innovative and agile product manufacturing, world-class distribution and industry-leading risk management capabilities. We have consistently delivered on our financial performance objectives and we are committed to continuing to enhance shareholder, customer and employee value as we move into our next chapter, and we will do this as we always have, with the right strategy and consistent execution. 
Effective execution starts with leadership, ensuring we have the right people in place to drive the organization forward. I am pleased to share that we have assembled an incredibly experienced and talented senior leadership team, including the recent appointment of Matt Grove as Head of Individual Life, Annuity and Lincoln Financial Network. Matt joined us with deep experience running retail businesses, including all aspects of individual life, annuity and wealth management. Bringing these businesses together enables us to leverage opportunities for synergies across product manufacturing best practices, in-force management optimization and enhancing the customer experience. 
Additionally, we recently announced the addition of James Reid as Head of Workplace Solutions which includes group protection and retirement plan services. James joins Lincoln as an established group protection leader with deep group experience, which is critical as we continue to deliver strong results and grow this integral part of our business. Chris Neczypor is our newly appointed Chief Strategy Officer and his organization is quarterbacking all aspects of the build-out of our longer-term strategic framework. Jayson Bronchetti, as our new Chief Investment Officer; and of course, our long-standing CFO, and Randy Freitag is a key partner to me in this next chapter. I am confident in our senior team and excited about Lincoln's future. 
Regarding strategy, we are on the right path to continue to deliver shareholder value in the near term, and we are also focused on developing a longer-term strategy to accelerate the pace of value creation for all stakeholders. In addition to having the right people in the right roles, we also optimize our deployment of capital balancing capital allocated to build long-term value to support new business, investing in our future, for example, direct investments in our Spark program and, of course, returning capital to shareholders. And we also acknowledge the critical importance our investors place on cash flow generation and capital return as we evaluate deepening our strategic focus on distributable cash flow generation alongside our long-standing goal of generating strong ROE and growing operating earnings and sales. 
To that end, we have an excellent track record of setting strategy and executing against it as demonstrated in part by having delivered compounded underlying EPS of 11% over the past decade. Despite the recent market headwinds, as we look forward over the next few years, we continue to expect to grow underlying EPS in the 8% to 10% range. I will touch on the key strategic initiatives that have and will continue to drive results. 
First, product strategy. Sales remain robust as we continue to benefit from our reprice, shift and add new product strategy. New sales are generating returns at or above targeted levels while contributing to an ongoing strategic shift to a broader diversified mix of products that provide a range of customer value propositions and away from traditional long-term guarantees. This shift has also contributed to a more capital-efficient new business mix as the capital per dollar of sales and overall capital to support new business have continued to decline. 
Second, Spark. We are on track and making substantial progress in the implementation of this enterprise-wide efforts. In addition to the expense run rate saves of $260 million to $300 million we expect to achieve, Spark is designed to accelerate delivery of results with increased agility and innovation. We have made about 1/3 of our planned direct investments and will continue to deliver, to accelerate our execution capabilities, modernize our technology, improve operational processes and create expanded opportunities for our employees as well as further enhance our customer experience. 
Third, Group protection margins. We are making excellent progress, and in the quarter, achieved an underlying 6.8% margin and remain confident in sustaining the top end of our targeted 5% to 7% margin range through continued pricing actions, improved claims effectiveness and Spark expense savings. 
Fourth, balance sheet resilience. As Randy will mention in his remarks, we did see a decline in our risk-based capital ratio in the quarter of about 15 points to approximately 400%, which was expected given the equity market downturn. We maintain a solid balance sheet, including our high-quality investment portfolio and remain comfortable with our RBC level. 
Turning to the quarter's results. Despite market headwinds, second quarter underlying earnings were solid, and we are seeing positive developments, improving group protection results, a significant sequential decline in pandemic claims and a meaningful rise in interest rates year-to-date, supporting future earnings growth and new business returns. 
In Annuities, we saw flat sequential sales that included growth of indexed variable annuities and fixed annuities of 16% and 40%, respectively, offset by a drop in traditional VAs, not surprisingly during a stock market downturn. The combination of this downturn and higher interest rates are shifting customer preferences towards IVA and fixed products. This marks the third consecutive quarter of sequential IBA sales growth. This change in consumer preferences has been boosting a strategic mix shift that has been underway at Lincoln for several years. For the eighth consecutive quarter, more than 70% of total annuity sales were of products other than variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. This sales mix shift is in turn contributing to a shift in our account value mix as products other than BAs with GLBs represented 53% of our total annuity account value, up 5 percentage points compared to the prior year period. 
Retirement Plan Services continues to deliver as our proven strategy, competitive product offerings and differentiated high-touch, high-tech customer experience model drove another quarter of excellent results. Compared to the prior year period, total deposits grew 6% and withdrawals improved 11%, demonstrating our focus not only on sales, but also persistency. Net flows were again favorable this quarter at over $900 million. 
In the Life Insurance business, second quarter life insurance sales grew 53% from the prior year period and 25% sequentially. Sales of all product categories and sales across all major distribution channels were up compared to both the second quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of this year. All products are priced to generate new business returns in line with or above target levels. 
Following the introduction of 7 new products and features in 2021, we continue to innovate and expand our offerings as part of our reprice, shift and add new product strategy. Lastly, on group protection, as I mentioned, our margin expansion efforts are gaining traction, and I am pleased to report that group achieved strong earnings this quarter. Premiums were up 7%, driven by solid persistency, organic growth and price increases. 
Most importantly, we remain disciplined in our pricing approach and are meeting or exceeding our targets for both new sales and renewals. In what is typically not a big seasonal quarter for sales, sales were up 61% over the prior year period with increases across all products and case sizes. We are also achieving a healthy mix of both employee paid sales and sales to existing customers. 
By continuing to focus on pricing discipline, claims management effectiveness and expense efficiency supported by our Spark program, I am confident that our margin expansion plan is on a solid path to achieve and sustain our margin expectations. Across these 4 businesses, our broad and diversified set of products to meet a range of customer value propositions, expanded digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience and industry-leading distribution strength position us to continue to generate profitable growth in the quarters and years to come. 
Moving to investment results. Our credit performance and the quality of our investment portfolio remain excellent. You may recall that we began derisking our portfolio well before the onset of the pandemic. And today, fixed income assets are comprised of 97% investment grade holdings. Our credit outlook remains solid as net positive ratings migration continued for a fourth consecutive quarter and credit losses remain benign. We recognize that the risk of recession has been increasing with the Federal Reserve tightening financial conditions. One of the many benefits of our multi-manager investment model is that we leverage our entire suite of managers to perform scenario analysis on a name-by-name basis across all asset classes in our portfolio. Based on our current views, we would expect any potential credit impacts from a near-term recession to have a modest impact on our balance sheet. 
New money yields have risen sharply as we invested new money at a rate of 4.2% in the second quarter, up 90 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points above our fixed income portfolio yield. In fact, our total fixed income portfolio yield rose 5 basis points sequentially. At these levels, we expect to see spread compression shift to spread expansion and support EPS growth over the coming years. 
Briefly on our alternatives portfolio, despite declines in the public equity markets during the prior quarter, our highly diversified alternative investment portfolio delivered a positive 1.5% quarterly return. In closing, we are a financially strong organization that provides our customers' financial security and peace of mind. We have a long-standing, proven track record of discipline and consistent execution and are committed to continuing to achieve strong financial performance. Our leadership team is excited and energized to continue to deliver on our strategy with actions to continue to produce strong results while we also develop our vision for the longer-term business of tomorrow with the objective of accelerating growth and value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $391 million or $2.23 per share. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, whic",1357,"Thank you, Ellen. Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $391 million or $2.23 per share. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $39 million or $0.23 per share. Alternative investment income that was $19 million or $0.11 per share below our target return levels and unfavorable onetime items of $14 million or $0.08 per share in the Annuity segment. 
Net income for the second quarter totaled $238 million or $1.34 per share. With the difference between net income and adjusted operating income, primarily the result of hedge breakage. The hedge program was 98% effective in what was a volatile quarter for the market. With the increase we have seen in new money rates, we have reached the point where interest spreads have become a positive contributor to earnings growth. As these earnings accumulate over time, they will work to offset and eventually overcome the negative impacts we have seen from equity markets in the first 2 quarters of 2022. 
Nine months into the implementation of the Spark initiative, we have already made about 1/3 of the investments and generated about 40% of the expected savings. As previously disclosed, Spark is expected to achieve $260 million to $300 million in run rate savings by the end of 2024 and is expected to begin boosting EPS growth next year. 
Touching on the performance of key financial metrics relative to the prior year on a consolidated basis. Adjusted operating ROE came in at 11.6%, adjusted operating revenues, not including resolution and alternatives were down 2%, negatively affected by the stock market decline. G&A net of amounts capitalized declined 4% as Spark savings, lower incentive and deferred comp expenses and ongoing expense management more than offset an increase in Spark investments. Shares outstanding declined 10% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $79.49 up 5% and an all-time [indiscernible]. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $256 million compared to $323 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was driven by a drop in average account values, lower variable investment income and the $14 million of unfavorable onetime items I noted upfront. The decline in the equity markets during the quarter increased our net amount of risk for living benefits and death benefits to 5% and 4% of account values, respectively. We expect these figures to remain at the low end of peers. 
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declined 11% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 30 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Looking at return metrics, Annuities return on assets was 67 basis points compared to 78 basis points in the prior year period, and return on equity was 18% compared to 25% in the prior year period. During what was a tough quarter for the markets, the annuity business delivered over $250 million of earnings, the result that we would expect to improve as the market stabilize and return to growth. Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $54 million compared to $62 million in the prior year quarter, with the reduction driven by lower variable investment income. Average account values declined 4% compared to the year ago quarter to $91 billion, is $1.5 billion of positive flows more than offset by market headwinds. 
G&A expenses [ that month ] capitalized were down $4 million or 6% versus the prior year period. Interest spreads, excluding variable investment income, expanded 3 basis points versus the prior year quarter as our ongoing crediting reductions continue to take hold and the benefits of higher new money investment yields emerge. Looking forward, we expect expansion to continue. 
The retirement business continues to produce profitable new business growth and to manage expenses effectively, while also benefiting from an improved interest rate environment. This combination positions the retirement business to deliver long-term growth.
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $114 million compared to $255 million in the prior year quarter. The drop was primarily due to lower alternative investment income when compared to the year-ago quarter's record results and $10 million of reduced earnings associated with the resolution block deal. Pandemic-related claims impacted results by $18 million. 
Outside of the pandemic, mortality was in line with expectations. Average account values, excluding the impact of last year's block reinsurance deal fell 1%. Reflecting the impact of lower equity markets, while total in-force [indiscernible] grew 11%, driven by strong term sales.
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 9% from the prior year quarter. Contribute to an understanding of the long-term benefit of alternative investments, we have added a new item in our [indiscernible], which shows that when using our 10% annual target at returns, Life spreads have stabilized on a year-over-year basis. Strong sales growth, good underlying mortality experience and stabilize the spreads, position the life business for future growth. 
Group Protection reported operating income of $59 million up from $46 million in the prior year quarter, driven by strong top line growth, improved underlying profitability and lower pandemic-related claims. Pandemic-related claims were $21 million, substantially improved from the first quarter and representing the smallest impact on the group business since the pandemic [indiscernible]. This includes $13 million in our group life business and $8 million in group disability. Excluding pandemic claims, and adjusting for below-target alternative investment income, the group margin was 6.8%. On the same basis and further excluding unfavorable items in the prior quarter, our total loss ratio of 75.9% improved 130 basis points sequentially as an improvement in disability results more than offset a tick up in life loss ratio. 
Moving to the product lines and excluding pandemic impact. The life loss ratio of 77% rose 370 basis points from the prior year period and 400 basis points sequentially and driven by an increase in the number of larger claims. Looking at results over an extended period of time, we are confident this past quarter's experience was an outlier and not likely to repeat in the third quarter. Group's disability loss ratio of 75.2% improved 230 basis points from the prior year quarter and 520 basis points sequentially, as we benefited from what is typically our seasonally strongest disability quarter and new disability claims that return to within a range of historical levels. 
Driven by our strong top line growth, the expense ratio of 12.5% was down 50 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. While we are excited about the progress we have made in improving group's profitability, we are well aware that there's still more to do, continued pricing actions, improvements in claims management, and executing on Spark are all components of what will allow us to deliver on our long-term goals for this business. 
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at approximately 400%, while cash at the holding company stands at $756 million. The approximate 15-point sequential decrease in the RBC ratio was in line with our expectations and driven by weaker equity markets and noneconomic limitations on the deferred tax assets. Taking into account the strength of our capital position, our high-quality investment portfolio and an improved view on potential credit losses, we intend to continue to repurchase our stock in the third quarter. We look forward to getting together with you next month for a holistic discussion about the impacts of LDTI, not to front run that discussion as we continue to assess the impact, I will note that as of 6/30, we would currently expect to see only a modest impact from LDTI under total book value. 
In closing, in the face of a challenging equity market environment, our second quarter earnings performance remained solid. We are confident in our balance sheet and pleased to be continuing buybacks in the current market environment. Finally, we see continued opportunity for earnings growth through our group protection margin expansion efforts and the Spark initiatives. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

But I think it would be helpful to give you a",745,"Elyse, thank you for that question. Al had mentioned to me that this is topical last night from the call. So I spend a little time thinking about this. The short answer to your question is up to $100 million. But I think it would be helpful to give you a little more context around how we think about that. We have -- obviously, like every company, we have a philosophy on how we allocate capital. And philosophically, we believe that buybacks are primarily in our growth of capital generation and really should reflect the facts and the circumstances around capital generation in any given period. I think a good way to think about this is if you look at last year, there were a few outside influences or abnormal influences in last year's in 2021. On one hand, we paid out about $642 million of pandemic claims. That's a real use of capital. On the other hand, we had record all its performance and the equity markets that were up over 25%. You sort of added those things together, and it put us back at $605 million buybacks right in line with what you've seen for a few years. 
Now when you look at 2022, the facts and circumstances of what we see this year are -- I won't get all of them but at a high level, right? The pandemic is receding. We expect, as you look forward, that will continue to recede. But the reality is, in the first quarter, we had $150 million of cash used for the pandemic. We had $39 million this quarter. And so you project that out roughly speaking, just round numbers, let's call it, $250 million of pandemic-related claims this year. The equity markets are down 21 points at [ 630 ]. The reality is we expect this. It's in all of our models. But when that happens, we get some reserves that pop up across the organization. It's primarily in the Life Business, which is being valued under PBR and PBR reserves are more sensitive to the movements in the capital markets. Both in the capital markets move up and down, by the way, so it's not just one sided. So that was an impact this year. And then as Ellen mentioned, this is the peak year or I've mentioned and Ellen has mentioned, this is the peak year for Spark Investments. When you look at the long-term benefits of Spark, $260 million to $300 million run rate benefits, right, just a huge IRR on those investments. So anybody would look at that and say that's a wise thing to be doing at a time like this. 
On the other hand, once again, Ellen mentioned, credit performance is just tremendous this year. So better than our expectations, and that's supportive of capital generation. And I had mentioned with the powerful benefit of interest rates. But I also noted that interest rates are something that sort of accumulates over time, you don't get the sort of the immediate impact of the equity markets. Sort of add all those things together and -- from our standpoint, the $100 million we did last quarter, off to $100 million we just talked about for the third quarter, we'll talk about the fourth quarter when we get there. I think it's just very reflective of what we see this year. I'd also remind you in terms of capital generation and how we use that capital. We'll also pay out $300 million of -- over $300 million of shareholder dividends this year. And we'll continue to allocate capital, roughly $1.5 billion to new business. And we've talked about the very strong returns we're getting on new business, which is ultimately the lifeblood of cash flows in the future. So I think that this year is very reflective of what we see this year. I don't think it says anything about what you might see in a normal year, but it says everything about what we're seeing this year. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. We've done a tremendous amount of it over years. That doesn't mean it's been a level amount every year, but -- the reality is at least over an extended period of time, and it's been fairly level over time. We've bought over 50% of our shares back. We're very proud of that. It's something we'd expect to continue looking forward. So I hope that helps."

We have had a couple of breakage in LNBar and it think about that in the context of how we manage that entity, and we've managed that entity to maintain very robust capital also.

The first one is that I spoke about our near-term strategy. You all know that",829,"Absolutely. And Erik, you and yes, clearly a priority. And I want to just spend a moment really stepping back and make a couple of comments to be able to address your question. The first one is that I spoke about our near-term strategy. You all know that I've been part of the senior management team for a decade. I feel very comfortable about all that we are focused on as it relates to near-term strategy and also that we are well on the path in terms of delivering results around that. And at the same time, now with the new team in place, we are focused on our longer-term strategy. And of course, this is all going to take some time and is all new. And some of the overall objectives that we continue to focus on here are around how we accelerate growth and how we enhance shareholder value. And a big part of that, we believe is around a further emphasis around distributable cash flow generation, of course, around capital return to shareholders, and to have those in combination with our long-standing focuses around ROE and EPS growth. So when we think about that and just to make it a little bit more tangible and a big piece as well is to really think longer term around how we continue to diversify our sources of revenue and earnings. So let me make it a little bit more tangible for you in terms of some of what we're thinking. 
So when we talk about product strategy and our reprice shift and a new, a very large piece of what we're doing there is really focusing on making our products more capital efficient. And I mentioned that in my script as well. And Randy talked about the fact that we allocated, for example, $1.5 billion of capital to those new sales that are all generating returns that are at or above our targets. And that is as well looking at capital efficiency there. I would expect that we're going to look at ways to really accelerate that capital efficiency as we look at our overall product suite. 
The second area is really around looking at our overall in-force and how we can further maximize the value there and really maximize our present value of distributable earnings at the end of the day under a range of economic scenarios. So here, as an example, you know that we have been very much involved historically in doing transactions. We did one in the third quarter of 2021. We have a team that is fully dedicated and staffed up. There are no commitments here. There are no time frames. But if something was to be the right opportunity at the right price, we certainly would look to do something here. 
And then the other piece of this is really looking at the optimal long-term business mix. And so an example here is that some years ago, we talked about the fact that we were focused on increasing our source of earnings mix and looking at getting our mortality, morbidity source of earnings to 30%. We were able to achieve that by acquiring the Liberty business and putting that together with our existing group business. 
And so I would expect, as we think about longer term, that -- and we have James Reid coming on board, who I mentioned to the deep group expert that we're going to look at ways that we can continue to grow that business in our Workplace Solutions business overall in general. And then we have other opportunities where we believe that there also could be sources of earnings and revenue that could be further grown. An example of that is that we have a managed account business. We haven't really talked about it very much. It's grown to $30 billion in assets under management, and we are strategically looking at over the longer term, whether or not there's opportunity there. 
And then the final pillar that I'll mention is really around what I would call emerging trends. And so here, and I talked about how can we accelerate innovation and agility. And the Spark program is a perfect example of enterprise-wide, a foundation around how we're doing that and we're going to be looking at other opportunities here that potentially over the long term could be enhancing value. So you put it all together and we will have a further emphasis on distributable cash flow generation. As we do it, we're going to focus on capital efficiency. We are going to be strategic as we always are. It's going to take some time. We will be back to all of you with more as we work through this with the new team. At the moment, we are in process of really strategically evaluating all of our businesses and really looking for those growth opportunities where we're leveraging current capability. So I hope that addresses your question."

So let me take your question and expand and start with just. In general, Erik, our assumption view process is very robust. It's got a huge number of controls around it. They are done -- have really done people that are involved in that process. I'm not going to front run that work. We'll go through our assumption review, and we'll talk about it on next quarter's call. 
So what I can tell you is that at a high level, the setting of assumptions is something that gets better, the more data you have, the talented people you have. And as a leading player in the life business, we have a lot of data. That data gets incorporated. We've been adjusting all of our assumptions every year reflecting that data. We did participate in a study, an additional study this year. By the way, we do that all the time around assumptions, but there was a particular study this year focused on GUL. We participated in that. So we have that study. And I'm sure the team will incorporate any new things they can learn from that process. 
When it comes to lapses, I'm not going to specifically discuss [ geo ], but I think there have been some things that have occurred over the last couple of years have been discussed across the industry. So let's just remind ourselves of what those were. The pandemic raised in the minds of consumers, the value of life insurance. And almost immediately with the onset of the pandemic, you saw lapse rates fall across every product, every type of life insurance. 
And then after about 3, 4 quarters, you started to see them tick back up, and that's what you've seen. They haven't recovered all the way back to pre-pandemic levels, but they have come back up. So at a high level, I think that -- hopefully, that gives you some context around what has been a pretty interesting couple of years in terms of lapse experience and how you should think about the future. For instance, will it recover back to pre-pandemic levels. will level out at some point. I think those things all go into the pot. But Erik at a high level, we have a lot of data. We seek any data we can and we incorporate that into our assumptions every year."

Just a couple of additional points around that if this was last year, 400 would have been 420, right, because the C1 factors lowered at about 20 points, but didn't change the actual economics of how we think about appropriate capital.

The other sort of once again philosophy when we think about capital is -- and why we don't talk about a single target. Philosophically, we believe that the right amount of capital is something that moves over time or the right RBC ratio is something that moves over time. at a very high level, immediately after a full-blown stress, we expect to be below our sort of average travel rate, right, maybe 50 to 70 points below.

So statutory reserving is primarily formula-based and develops reserves at a high level are meant to be conservative, right? It's a solvency-based reserving standards. So feel very good about that it's very supportive of the sufficiency of reserves. SGUL itself then has some separate tests, right? And we've talked about these over the years. they go by the monikers AC and AB. And those are the things that we've talked about in the past, where if we were to see any impact on statutory capital, it would have come through those subtests. You can go back, gosh, a number of years, and we talked about if rates drop to a certain amount, we saw a potential risk, which has declined over time, right? It's declined over time because the base reserves continue to grow. So inside of AC and AB, each test is a little different. But were you to make big assumption changes. You do those inside those models also. So that can modestly impact those. But once again, at the end of the day, we've seen the potential impact from an AC and AB decline over the time. We haven't even talked about it for at least a year, near as I can remember. So at a high level, we feel good about there. But the reality is in those tests, -- to the extent you change your assumptions about the future, you reflect those changes into those tests also. [indiscernible]"

Yes, Tom, you're right. We've had elevated breakage for a couple of quarters in a row. A couple of other comments are on LNBar itself. It does have earnings, right? So we tend to talk about the breakage, but it does have a level of earnings that is meant to cover sort of a normal level of breakage and build capital over time. So that's the entity structure. Just like any ongoing enterprise. I'd also point out that if you look back at last year, we came into the year in a pretty good place because we really didn't have elevated breakage last year. I think I'm remembering like the middle 2 quarters of last year added up to actually to a small positive. There was no breakage. So we came into the year in a pretty good spot. 
That being said, 2 quarters in a row of elevated breakage. I would we have to think about that. That's real capital.

We have been, in terms of our hiring, we've been increasing wages in terms of our higher performers inside and we have been increasing wages. And also we have been looking at appropriate market adjustments to be able to keep pace. And then the other comment that I'll make is that we also see a benefit as it relates to overall wage inflation in our workplace businesses as well. So we know and I talked about in my remarks earlier, that we've seen overall broad-based increase in terms of deposits on the RPS side. We've seen broad-based increases as it relates to employee paid the group protection business.

Actually, just for societal thing, I think you mentioned specifically the Highway juniors. I think one of the really good things about the inflation we've seen it's been across the spectrum. So I think the increases we've seen have not just been about higher wage owners. It's really been across the spectrum.

As you all know, Lincoln has been providing financial protection and security to millions of Americans and their families for 117 years through 2 pandemics and numerous recessions. Over those years,",1716,"Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone, and welcome. As you all know, Lincoln has been providing financial protection and security to millions of Americans and their families for 117 years through 2 pandemics and numerous recessions. Over those years, we have built a powerful franchise with a reputation and brand grounded in integrity and trust, and we are a destination employer known for our great culture, talent development and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We pride ourselves on our many strengths, including innovative and agile product manufacturing, world-class distribution and industry-leading risk management capabilities. We have consistently delivered on our financial performance objectives and we are committed to continuing to enhance shareholder, customer and employee value as we move into our next chapter, and we will do this as we always have, with the right strategy and consistent execution.
Effective execution starts with leadership, ensuring we have the right people in place to drive the organization forward. I am pleased to share that we have assembled an incredibly experienced and talented senior leadership team, including the recent appointment of Matt Grove as Head of Individual Life, Annuity and Lincoln Financial Network. Matt joined us with deep experience running retail businesses, including all aspects of Individual Life, annuity and wealth management. Bringing these businesses together enables us to leverage opportunities for synergies across product manufacturing best practices, in-force management optimization and enhancing the customer experience.
Additionally, we recently announced the addition of James Reid as Head of Workplace Solutions which includes group protection and retirement plan services. James joins Lincoln as an established group protection leader with deep group experience, which is critical as we continue to deliver strong results and grow this integral part of our business. Chris Neczypor is our newly appointed Chief Strategy Officer and his organization is quarterbacking all aspects of the build-out of our longer-term strategic framework. Jayson Bronchetti, as our new Chief Investment Officer; and of course, our long-standing CFO, and Randy Freitag is a key partner to me in this next chapter. I am confident in our senior team and excited about Lincoln's future.
Regarding strategy, we are on the right path to continue to deliver shareholder value in the near term, and we are also focused on developing a longer-term strategy to accelerate the pace of value creation for all stakeholders. In addition to having the right people in the right roles, we also optimize our deployment of capital, balancing capital allocated to build long-term value to support new business, investing in our future, for example, direct investments in our Spark program and, of course, returning capital to shareholders. And we also acknowledge the critical importance our investors place on cash flow generation and capital return as we evaluate deepening our strategic focus on distributable cash flow generation alongside our long-standing goal of generating strong ROE and growing operating earnings and sales.
To that end, we have an excellent track record of setting strategy and executing against it as demonstrated in part by having delivered compounded underlying EPS of 11% over the past decade. Despite the recent market headwinds, as we look forward over the next few years, we continue to expect to grow underlying EPS in the 8% to 10% range. I will touch on the key strategic initiatives that have and will continue to drive results.
First, product strategy. Sales remain robust as we continue to benefit from our reprice, shift and add new product strategy. New sales are generating returns at or above targeted levels while contributing to an ongoing strategic shift to a broader diversified mix of products that provide a range of customer value propositions and away from traditional long-term guarantees. This shift has also contributed to a more capital-efficient new business mix as the capital per dollar of sales and overall capital to support new business have continued to decline.
Second, Spark. We are on track and making substantial progress in the implementation of this enterprise-wide efforts. In addition to the expense run rate saves of $260 million to $300 million we expect to achieve, Spark is designed to accelerate delivery of results with increased agility and innovation. We have made about 1/3 of our planned direct investments and will continue to deliver, to accelerate our execution capabilities, modernize our technology, improve operational processes and create expanded opportunities for our employees as well as further enhance our customer experience.
Third, Group protection margins. We are making excellent progress, and in the quarter, achieved an underlying 6.8% margin and remain confident in sustaining the top end of our targeted 5% to 7% margin range through continued pricing actions, improved claims effectiveness and Spark expense savings.
Fourth, balance sheet resilience. As Randy will mention in his remarks, we did see a decline in our risk-based capital ratio in the quarter of about 15 points to approximately 400%, which was expected given the equity market downturn. We maintain a solid balance sheet, including our high-quality investment portfolio and remain comfortable with our RBC level.
Turning to the quarter's results. Despite market headwinds, second quarter underlying earnings were solid, and we are seeing positive developments, improving group protection results, a significant sequential decline in pandemic claims and a meaningful rise in interest rates year-to-date, supporting future earnings growth and new business returns.
In Annuities, we saw flat sequential sales that included growth of indexed variable annuities and fixed annuities of 16% and 40%, respectively, offset by a drop in traditional VAs, not surprisingly during a stock market downturn. The combination of this downturn and higher interest rates are shifting customer preferences towards IVA and fixed products. This marks the third consecutive quarter of sequential IVA sales growth. This change in consumer preferences has been boosting a strategic mix shift that has been underway at Lincoln for several years. For the eighth consecutive quarter, more than 70% of total annuity sales were of products other than variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. This sales mix shift is in turn contributing to a shift in our account value mix as products other than VAs with GLBs represented 53% of our total annuity account value, up 5 percentage points compared to the prior year period. 
Retirement Plan Services continues to deliver as our proven strategy, competitive product offerings and differentiated high-touch, high-tech customer experience model drove another quarter of excellent results. Compared to the prior year period, total deposits grew 6% and withdrawals improved 11%, demonstrating our focus not only on sales, but also persistency. Net flows were again favorable this quarter at over $900 million.
In the Life Insurance business, second quarter life insurance sales grew 53% from the prior year period and 25% sequentially. Sales of all product categories and sales across all major distribution channels were up compared to both the second quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of this year. All products are priced to generate new business returns in line with or above target levels.
Following the introduction of 7 new products and features in 2021, we continue to innovate and expand our offerings as part of our reprice, shift and add new product strategy. Lastly, on group protection, as I mentioned, our margin expansion efforts are gaining traction, and I am pleased to report that group achieved strong earnings this quarter. Premiums were up 7%, driven by solid persistency, organic growth and price increases.
Most importantly, we remain disciplined in our pricing approach and are meeting or exceeding our targets for both new sales and renewals. In what is typically not a big seasonal quarter for sales, sales were up 61% over the prior year period with increases across all products and case sizes. We are also achieving a healthy mix of both employee paid sales and sales to existing customers.
By continuing to focus on pricing discipline, claims management effectiveness and expense efficiency supported by our Spark program, I am confident that our margin expansion plan is on a solid path to achieve and sustain our margin expectations. Across these 4 businesses, our broad and diversified set of products to meet a range of customer value propositions, expanded digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience and industry-leading distribution strength position us to continue to generate profitable growth in the quarters and years to come.
Moving to investment results. Our credit performance and the quality of our investment portfolio remain excellent. You may recall that we began derisking our portfolio well before the onset of the pandemic. And today, fixed income assets are comprised of 97% investment grade holdings. Our credit outlook remains solid as net positive ratings migration continued for a fourth consecutive quarter and credit losses remain benign. We recognize that the risk of recession has been increasing with the Federal Reserve tightening financial conditions. One of the many benefits of our multi-manager investment model is that we leverage our entire suite of managers to perform scenario analysis on a name-by-name basis across all asset classes in our portfolio. Based on our current views, we would expect any potential credit impacts from a near-term recession to have a modest impact on our balance sheet.
New money yields have risen sharply as we invested new money at a rate of 4.2% in the second quarter, up 90 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points above our fixed income portfolio yield. In fact, our total fixed income portfolio yield rose 5 basis points sequentially. At these levels, we expect to see spread compression shift to spread expansion and support EPS growth over the coming years.
Briefly on our alternatives portfolio, despite declines in the public equity markets during the prior quarter, our highly diversified alternative investment portfolio delivered a positive 1.5% quarterly return. In closing, we are a financially strong organization that provides our customers' financial security and peace of mind. We have a long-standing, proven track record of discipline and consistent execution and are committed to continuing to achieve strong financial performance. Our leadership team is excited and energized to continue to deliver on our strategy with actions to continue to produce strong results while we also develop our vision for the longer-term business of tomorrow with the objective of accelerating growth and value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $391 million or $2.23 per share. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, whic",1361,"Thank you, Ellen. Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $391 million or $2.23 per share. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $39 million or $0.23 per share. Alternative investment income that was $19 million or $0.11 per share below our target return levels and unfavorable onetime items of $14 million or $0.08 per share in the Annuity segment.
Net income for the second quarter totaled $238 million or $1.34 per share. With the difference between net income and adjusted operating income, primarily the result of hedge breakage. The hedge program was 98% effective in what was a volatile quarter for the market. With the increase we have seen in new money rates, we have reached the point where interest spreads have become a positive contributor to earnings growth. As these earnings accumulate over time, they will work to offset and eventually overcome the negative impacts we have seen from equity markets in the first 2 quarters of 2022.
Nine months into the implementation of the Spark initiative, we have already made about 1/3 of the investments and generated about 40% of the expected savings. As previously disclosed, Spark is expected to achieve $260 million to $300 million in run rate savings by the end of 2024 and is expected to begin boosting EPS growth next year.
Touching on the performance of key financial metrics relative to the prior year on a consolidated basis. Adjusted operating ROE came in at 11.6%, adjusted operating revenues, not including resolution and alternatives were down 2%, negatively affected by the stock market decline. G&A net of amounts capitalized declined 4% as Spark savings, lower incentive and deferred comp expenses and ongoing expense management more than offset an increase in Spark investments. Shares outstanding declined 10% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $79.49 up 5% and an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $256 million compared to $323 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was driven by a drop in average account values, lower variable investment income and the $14 million of unfavorable one-time items noted upfront. The decline in the equity markets during the quarter increased our net amount of risk for living benefits and death benefits to 5% and 4% of account values, respectively. We expect these figures to remain at the low end of peers.
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declined 11% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 30 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Looking at return metrics, Annuities return on assets was 67 basis points compared to 78 basis points in the prior year period, and return on equity was 18% compared to 25% in the prior year period. During what was a tough quarter for the markets, the Annuity business delivered over $250 million of earnings, the result that we would expect to improve as the market stabilize and return to growth. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $54 million compared to $62 million in the prior year quarter, with the reduction driven by lower variable investment income. Average account values declined 4% compared to the year ago quarter to $91 billion, is $1.5 billion of positive flows more than offset by market headwinds.
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were down $4 million or 6% versus the prior year period. Interest spreads, excluding variable investment income, expanded 3 basis points versus the prior year quarter as our ongoing crediting reductions continue to take hold and the benefits of higher new money investment yields emerge. Looking forward, we expect expansion to continue.
The Retirement business continues to produce profitable new business growth and to manage expenses effectively, while also benefiting from an improved interest rate environment. This combination positions the retirement business to deliver long-term growth.
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $114 million compared to $255 million in the prior year quarter. The drop was primarily due to lower alternative investment income when compared to the year-ago quarter's record results and $10 million of reduced earnings associated with the resolution block deal. Pandemic-related claims impacted results by $18 million. Outside of the pandemic, mortality was in line with expectations. 
Average account values, excluding the impact of last year's block reinsurance deal fell 1%. Reflecting the impact of lower equity markets, while total in-force [indiscernible] grew 11%, driven by strong term sales.
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 9% from the prior year quarter. Contribute to an understanding of the long-term benefit of alternative investments, we have added a new item in our [indiscernible], which shows that when using our 10% annual target at returns, [ Life spreads ] have stabilized on a year-over-year basis. Strong sales growth, good underlying mortality experience and stabilize the spreads, position the Life business for future growth. 
Group Protection reported operating income of $59 million up from $46 million in the prior year quarter, driven by strong top line growth, improved underlying profitability and lower pandemic-related claims. Pandemic-related claims were $21 million, substantially improved from the first quarter and representing the smallest impact on the group business since the pandemic [ outbreak ]. This includes $13 million in our group life business and $8 million in group disability. 
Excluding pandemic claims, and adjusting for below-target alternative investment income, the group margin was 6.8%. On the same basis and further excluding unfavorable items in the prior quarter, our total loss ratio of 75.9% improved 130 basis points sequentially as an improvement in disability results more than offset a tick up in life loss ratio.
Moving to the product lines and excluding pandemic impact. The life loss ratio of 77% rose 370 basis points from the prior year period and 400 basis points sequentially and driven by an increase in the number of larger claims. Looking at results over an extended period of time, we are confident this past quarter's experience was an outlier and not likely to repeat in the third quarter. Group's disability loss ratio of 75.2% improved 230 basis points from the prior year quarter and 520 basis points sequentially, as we benefited from what is typically our seasonally strongest disability quarter and new disability claims that return to within a range of historical levels.
Driven by our strong top line growth, the expense ratio of 12.5% was down 50 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. While we are excited about the progress we have made in improving group's profitability, we are well aware that there's still more to do, continued pricing actions, improvements in claims management, and executing on Spark are all components of what will allow us to deliver on our long-term goals for this business.
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at approximately 400%, while cash at the holding company stands at $756 million. The approximate 15-point sequential decrease in the RBC ratio was in line with our expectations and driven by weaker equity markets and noneconomic limitations on the deferred tax assets. Taking into account the strength of our capital position, our high-quality investment portfolio and an improved view on potential credit losses, we intend to continue to repurchase our stock in the third quarter. We look forward to getting together with you next month for a holistic discussion about the impacts of LDTI, not to front run that discussion as we continue to assess the impact, I will note that as of [ 630 ], we would currently expect to see only a modest impact from LDTI under total book value.
In closing, in the face of a challenging equity market environment, our second quarter earnings performance remained solid. We are confident in our balance sheet and pleased to be continuing buybacks in the current market environment. Finally, we see continued opportunity for earnings growth through our group protection margin expansion efforts and the Spark initiatives.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

Al had mentioned to me that this is topical last night from the call. So I spend a little time thinking about this. The short answer to your question is up to $100 million. But I think it would be helpful to give you a",747,"Elyse, thank you for that question. Al had mentioned to me that this is topical last night from the call. So I spend a little time thinking about this. The short answer to your question is up to $100 million. But I think it would be helpful to give you a little more context around how we think about that. We have -- obviously, like every company, we have a philosophy on how we allocate capital. And philosophically, we believe that buybacks are primarily in our growth of capital generation and really should reflect the facts and the circumstances around capital generation in any given period. I think a good way to think about this is if you look at last year, there were a few outside influences or abnormal influences in last year's in 2021. On one hand, we paid out about $642 million of pandemic claims. That's a real use of capital. On the other hand, we had record all its performance and the equity markets that were up over 25%. You sort of added those things together, and it put us back at $605 million buybacks sort of right in line with what you've seen for a few years. 
Now when you look at 2022, the facts and circumstances of what we see this year are -- I won't get all of them but at a high level, right? The pandemic is receding. We expect, as you look forward, that will continue to recede. But the reality is, in the first quarter, we had $150 million of cash used for the pandemic. We had $39 million this quarter. And so you project that out roughly speaking, just round numbers, let's call it, $250 million of pandemic-related claims this year. The equity markets are down 21 points at [ 630 ]. The reality is we expect this. It's in all of our models. But when that happens, we get some reserves that pop up across the organization. It's primarily in the Life Business, which is being valued under PBR and PBR reserves are more sensitive to the movements in the capital markets. Both in the capital markets move up and down, by the way, so it's not just one sided. 
So that was an impact this year. And then as Ellen mentioned, this is the peak year or I've mentioned and Ellen has mentioned, this is the peak year for Spark Investments. When you look at the long-term benefits of Spark, $260 million to $300 million run rate benefits, right, just a huge IRR on those investments. So anybody would look at that and say that's a wise thing to be doing at a time like this.
On the other hand, once again, Ellen mentioned, credit performance is just tremendous this year. So better than our expectations, and that's supportive of capital generation. And I had mentioned with the powerful benefit of interest rates. But I also noted that interest rates are something that sort of accumulates over time, you don't get the sort of the immediate impact of the equity markets. Sort of add all those things together and -- from our standpoint, the $100 million we did last quarter, off to $100 million we just talked about for the third quarter, we'll talk about the fourth quarter when we get there. I think it's just very reflective of what we see this year. 
I'd also remind you in terms of capital generation and how we use that capital. We'll also pay out $300 million of -- over $300 million of shareholder dividends this year. And we'll continue to allocate capital, roughly $1.5 billion to new business. And we've talked about the very strong returns we're getting on new business, which is ultimately the lifeblood of cash flows in the future. 
So I think that this year is very reflective of what we see this year. I don't think it says anything about what you might see in a normal year, but it says everything about what we're seeing this year. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. We've done a tremendous amount of it over years. That doesn't mean it's been a level amount every year, but -- the reality is at least over an extended period of time, and it's been fairly level over time. We've bought over 50% of our shares back. We're very proud of that. It's something we'd expect to continue looking forward. So I hope that helps."

And I want to just spend a moment really stepping back and make a couple of comments to be able to address your question. The first one is that I spoke about our near-term strategy. You all know that I've been part of the senior management team for a decade. I feel very comfortable about all that we are focused on as it relates to near-term strategy and also that we are well on the path in terms of delivering results around that. And at the same time, now with the new team in place, we are focused on our longer-term strategy. And of course, this is all going to take some time and is all new. 
And some of the overall objectives that we continue to focus on here are around how we accelerate growth and how we enhance shareholder value. And a big part of that, we believe is around a further emphasis around distributable cash flow generation, of course, around capital return to shareholders, and to have those in combination with our long-standing focuses around ROE and EPS growth. So when we think about that and just to make it a little bit more tangible and a big piece as well is to really think longer term around how we continue to diversify our sources of revenue and earnings. 
So let me make it a little bit more tangible for you in terms of some of what we're thinking. So when we talk about product strategy and our reprice shift and a new, a very large piece of what we're doing there is really focusing on making our products more capital efficient. And I mentioned that in my script as well. And Randy talked about the fact that we allocated, for example, $1.5 billion of capital to those new sales that are all generating returns that are at or above our targets. And that is as well looking at capital efficiency there. I would expect that we're going to look at ways to really accelerate that capital efficiency as we look at our overall product suite.
The second area is really around looking at our overall in-force and how we can further maximize the value there and really maximize our present value of distributable earnings at the end of the day under a range of economic scenarios. So here, as an example, you know that we have been very much involved historically in doing transactions. We did one in the third quarter of 2021. We have a team that is fully dedicated and staffed up. There are no commitments here. There are no time frames. But if something was to be the right opportunity at the right price, we certainly would look to do something here.
And then the other piece of this is really looking at the optimal long-term business mix. And so an example here is that some years ago, we talked about the fact that we were focused on increasing our source of earnings mix and looking at getting our mortality, morbidity source of earnings to 30%. We were able to achieve that by acquiring the Liberty business and putting that together with our existing group business.
And so I would expect, as we think about longer term, that -- and we have James Reid coming on board, who I mentioned as the deep group expert that we're going to look at ways that we can continue to grow that business in our Workplace Solutions business overall in general. And then we have other opportunities where we believe that there also could be sources of earnings and revenue that could be further grown. An example of that is that we have a managed account business. We haven't really talked about it very much. It's grown to $30 billion in assets under management, and we are strategically looking at over the longer term, whether or not there's opportunity there.
And then the final pillar that I'll mention is really around what I would call emerging trends. And so here, and I talked about how can we accelerate innovation and agility. And the Spark program is a perfect example of enterprise-wide, a foundation around how we're doing that and we're going to be looking at other opportunities here that potentially over the long term could be enhancing value. So you put it all together and we will have a further emphasis on distributable cash flow generation. As we do it, we're going to focus on capital efficiency. We are going to be strategic as we always are. It's going to take some time. We will be back to all of you with more as we work through this with the new team. At the moment, we are in process of really strategically evaluating all of our businesses and really looking for those growth opportunities where we're leveraging current capability. So I hope that addresses your question."

So let me take your question and expand and start with just. In general, Erik, our assumption view process is very robust. It's got a huge number of controls around it. They are a ton of really talented people that are involved in that process. I'm not going to front run that work. We'll go through our assumption review, and we'll talk about it on next quarter's call.
So what I can tell you is that at a high level, the setting of assumptions is something that gets better, the more data you have, the talented people you have. And as a leading player in the life business, we have a lot of data. That data gets incorporated. We've been adjusting all of our assumptions every year reflecting that data. We did participate in a study, an additional study this year. By the way, we do that all the time around assumptions, but there was a particular study this year focused on GUL. We participated in that. So we have that study. And I'm sure the team will incorporate any new things they can learn from that process.
When it comes to lapses, I'm not going to specifically discuss GUL, but I think there have been some things that have occurred over the last couple of years have been discussed across the industry. So let's just remind ourselves of what those were. The pandemic raised in the minds of consumers, the value of life insurance. And almost immediately with the onset of the pandemic, you saw lapse rates fall across every product, every type of life insurance.
And then after about 3, 4 quarters, you started to see them tick back up, and that's what you've seen. They haven't recovered all the way back to pre-pandemic levels, but they have come back up. So at a high level, I think that -- hopefully, that gives you some context around what has been a pretty interesting couple of years in terms of lapse experience and how you should think about the future. For instance, will it recover back to pre-pandemic levels, will level out at some point. I think those things all go into the pot. But Erik at a high level, we have a lot of data. We seek any data we can and we incorporate that into our assumptions every year."

The other sort of once again philosophy when we think about capital is -- and why we don't talk about a single target. Philosophically, we believe that the right amount of capital is something that moves over time or the right RBC ratio is something that moves over time. at a very high level, immediately after a full-blown stress, we expect to be below our sort of average travel rate, right, maybe 50 to 70 points below.

To Randy's point as it relates to CLO, the majority of all of our CLOs that are ours are single A and above, they're predominantly AAA. We're really -- at the end of the day, we're really working across the industry as we always do to ensure that there's a good model that appropriately really correlates the losses with the capital and recognize that given the growth of CLOs on insurance company balance sheets that it is good to take a fresh look at that and ensure that the capital levels are appropriate."

And so we're in the smaller markets, and we're in the larger markets. And we also have introduced a range of new products. So we know that traditionally, we've been in the life areas and in the disability areas. We have been increasing our focus on supplemental health for a variety of reasons. And in there last year, we introduced a new product Hospital Indemnity. 
We do have a dental business right now. It is fairly small as it relates to the overall business over in -- on the group side. I would expect that as James comes in and gets his arms around our current business and our current capabilities and we think about the long-term value of the business. Certainly, the types of products that we are offering and where we're doing business is going to be part of that overall strategic review that I mentioned earlier. And so we'll be back to with more in terms of whether or not those are areas that we believe that we could build scale and then therefore, participate in or if it will be some other direction. Most importantly, we recognize the importance strategically of this property. We're going to do everything that we can to continue on the path around restoring our margins and looking to grow this part of our business."

So statutory reserving is primarily formula-based and develops reserves at a high level are meant to be conservative, right? It's a solvency-based reserving standards. So feel very good about that it's very supportive of the sufficiency of reserves. SGUL itself then has some separate tests, right?

You can go back, gosh, a number of years, and we talked about if rates drop to a certain amount, we saw a potential risk, which has declined over time, right? It's declined over time because the base reserves continue to grow. 
So inside of 8C and 8D, each test is a little different. But were you to make big assumption changes. You do those inside those models also. So that can modestly impact those. But once again, at the end of the day, we've seen the potential impact from an 8C and 8D decline over the time. We haven't even talked about it for at least a year, near as I can remember. So at a high level, we feel good about there. But the reality is in those tests, -- to the extent you change your assumptions about the future, you reflect those changes into those tests also."

Just like any ongoing enterprise. I'd also point out that if you look back at last year, we came into the year in a pretty good place because we really didn't have elevated breakage last year. I'm remembering like the middle 2 quarters of last year added up to actually to a small positive. There was no breakage. So we came into the year in a pretty good spot.

Before we discuss the details of our third quarter performance, I want to step back and speak to the magnitude of the unlocking charge resulting from our annual assumption review. I'll also address the decline in",2014,"Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss the details of our third quarter performance, I want to step back and speak to the magnitude of the unlocking charge resulting from our annual assumption review. I'll also address the decline in our risk-based capital ratio, the recent performance of our Life business provide a quick review of our other businesses, the multiple levers available to improve our capital position and how we are changing the strategic approach to our business in key areas. 
First, I will address the unlocking at a high level, and Randy will provide more details. The $2.1 billion total unlocking includes a $2.3 billion charge in our Life business, driven by $1.8 billion related to policyholder lapse behavior within the Guaranteed Universal Life or GUL block. This charge was primarily due to updated lapse assumptions where emerging Lincoln GLU experience was validated this year by new industry perspectives. As a result, we expect a $180 million decline in GAAP annual run rate life operating earnings. 
On a statutory basis, the updated lapse assumptions also produce a $550 million charge related to the 8D GUL subtest to be booked in the fourth quarter, which translates to about 22 points of RBC. The unlocking has no impact on run rate statutory earnings. As a reminder, GUL is a type of permanent life policy that guarantees insurance will stay in force if the policyholder continues to pay a certain minimum premium. Because of this guarantee, GUL is subject to long-term assumption risk. 
Interest rates have been lower than assumed in pricing and were a significant driver of our decision some years ago to reduce sales dramatically and ultimately exit the GUL market. Additionally, over the years, mortality and reinsurance costs have seen unfavorable adjustments. Last is the other key assumption. Over the last several years, as Lincoln's GUL policy experience has materialized, it has provided deeper insights into anticipated behavior patterns in later policy durations, which were subsequently supplemented with the recent industry experience study. As a result, we have reset our assumptions to reflect lower lapsation going forward. 
In addition, we separately incurred a $634 million GAAP goodwill impairment charge in our life business, primarily driven by variable universal life or VUL equity market impacts and the use of a higher discount rate. Before I discuss the other topics, I will briefly touch on the operating highlights of our businesses this quarter. We delivered strong sales growth in all 4 of our businesses reflecting our continued focus on expanding and diversifying the product portfolio. 
We saw a sales rebound in annuities, up 21% from the prior year quarter as growth in index variable annuities and fixed annuities more than offset a decline in traditional variable annuities. Net flows were positive in the quarter for the first time since mid-2020 driven by sales growth. Total Life Insurance sales were up 3% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by an increase in indexed universal life sales. 
And in Retirement Plan Services, or RPS, total deposits of $2.8 billion were up 16% from the prior year quarter reflecting a 33% increase in first year sales and a 9% increase in recurring deposits. Year-to-date, positive net flows rose to $2.7 billion. In Group Protection, sales were up 83% from the prior year quarter, reflecting strong results across all products and market segments premiums of $1.2 billion were up 8% compared to the prior year quarter. And finally, our high-quality investment portfolio continues to perform well and higher interest rates have led to spread expansion following years of spread compression. 
Now turning to the RBC ratio. We started the year at approximately 430% risk-based capital and are projected to end the year with our RBC at approximately 360%. The year-end projection includes the expected fourth quarter statutory charge as well as other factors. Before I elaborate on those factors and importantly, our actions underway to replenish capital back to our target, I want to emphasize the following: while we are not satisfied with our projected RBC ratio, we are taking swift and targeted actions to rebuild to our 400% target. We are confident we have ample capital to effectively operate the business as we get back to our targeted level. 
We have a clear understanding of the issues and have a plan in place to address them as you'll hear this morning. Effective execution starts with leadership and our new experienced and talented senior leaders will execute on the strategic objectives I introduced last quarter, which are: first, maximizing distributable earnings and improving capital generation. Second, reducing capital sensitivity to market volatility and improving capital efficiency; and third, further diversifying our earnings mix with durable cash-generative income streams. 
Continuing this discussion on capital. Our life business has been the source of 3/4 of our RBC ratio decline this year, with the 3 main contributors as follows: as I mentioned, the assumption review will increase our statutory reserves, which will reduce statutory capital and is included in the projected year-end RBC ratio I referenced above. However, the statutory 8D test utilizes prescribed trailing interest rates. And if rates stay at current levels, we would expect to release a portion of these reserves over time. Second, while smaller than the impacts of the prior 2 years, we continue to experience pandemic claims this year, particularly in the first quarter. We expect these impacts to continue to moderate over time. Third, setting aside the impact of the 8D test and pandemic claims, the life insurance business is a negative contributor to cash flow generation. A portion of this negative contribution is attributable to increased reserves in our VUL portfolio due to this year's equity market decline. However, there are other factors weighing on the life insurance business' ability to generate distributable earnings, including negative statutory earnings producing negative cash flow from our GUL block which are not affected by the assumption change, an increase in recurring reinsurance costs, the loss of ongoing free cash flow from previous block transactions and the transition to principal-based reserving, which has changed the pattern of distributable earnings and capital intensity for certain products, notably term life. 
The remaining 25% of this year's projected RBC decline is attributable to a variety of factors, including higher capital allocation to fixed annuity sales and stable value offerings within our retirement business as well as the impact of group's pandemic claims and lower fees in our annuity business. Our annuity business has always been and remains highly cash generative and well risk managed. However, this year's market movements, specifically the declines in equity markets and the increase in interest rates had negatively impacted both equity and bond fund returns, resulting in lower fees on assets under management and consequently reduce capital generation. 
Additionally, we hedge our variable annuity guaranteed benefits out of LNBar. The current hedge program has been highly effective and has focused on generating sufficient assets to fund future claims by minimizing GAAP net income volatility. This year's capital market environment has led to market volatility and increased hedge breakage that has resulted in reduced capital within LNBar. We intend to organically rebuild the LNBar capital position over time. And while we have taken an average of about $120 million of dividends per year out of LNBar, we do not expect to take the dividend for some time. 
In September, we announced enhancements to our VA hedging program that focus on maximizing distributable earnings and explicitly protecting statutory capital. The updated VA hedge program aligns with our increased strategic focus on capital generation. Additionally, I note that our 2 workplace businesses group protection and retirement plan services are well positioned to deliver strong distributable earnings and contribute to the rebuilding of capital. I will now discuss the actions that the leadership team and I are taking to enhance the distributable earnings and capital generation of our business where a number of the initiatives underway will support improvements in our life business, rebuild our RBC ratio to our 400% target and strengthen our balance sheet. First, while we prioritize balance sheet resilience to replenish our capital, we are pausing share repurchases. 
We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders will be maintaining the dividend and expect to return to dividend growth and share repurchases over time. Second, -- we have capacity in our capital structure beyond today's mix of primarily common equity and senior debt and are evaluating alternatives such as preferred or additional hybrid securities to provide additional margin given the uncertain macroeconomic environment and risk of potential headwinds from that environment beyond what we see today. And third, we are considering strategic alternatives for our in-force business, including potential block reinsurance transactions with a wider lens that incorporates our new strategic objectives. 
As I have mentioned previously, we have a fully dedicated and staffed up team while there are no commitments if we find the right opportunity at the right price, we will look to execute. In addition to these 3 actions, we have several initiatives already underway to advance our strategic objectives that will have a favorable impact to our balance sheet longer term. In particular, a number of the measures we are taking are designed to improve the distributable earnings profile of the Life business. 
The 3 new leaders I introduced last quarter Matt Grove, Head of Individual Life, Annuity and Lincoln Financial Network, James Reid, Head of Workplace Solutions; and Chris Neczypor, our Chief Strategy Officer, are charged with implementing our strategic actions. As a team, we are keenly focused on our reprice, shift and add new product strategy. In recent years, we have been focused on shifting the product mix to a diversified set of solutions with lower guarantees, more sharing with the customer and improved capital efficiency.  As we move forward, consistent with our strategy to maximize distributable earnings, we are refocusing our new business capital allocation process. 
We've previously focused on growing sales while exceeding our return thresholds. Going forward, we expect to allocate a targeted amount of capital to new business and will focus on maximizing our return on this capital. We expect this approach to allow us to allocate less capital to new business in 2023 than we did in 2022 and while delivering a robust level of sales and more distributable earnings. This focus on the efficiency of our capital allocation is an important part of our go-forward strategy. Spark. We are ahead of schedule and making substantial progress in the implementation of this enterprise-wide expense initiative to deliver run rate savings of $260 million to $300 million by late 2024. We have achieved approximately 45% of the planned expense savings to date. 
We are also working on reducing the market sensitivity of our BUL product to mitigate the capital impact of potential further market declines and are exploring multiple avenues to accomplish this including both hedge and structural solutions. And as I previously mentioned, our Workplace Solutions businesses comprised of group protection and retirement plan services continue to be critically important to our long-term strategy. Both businesses are focused on the customer, driving differentiation in the market and delivering results. 
We have spoken with you about our goal of reaching and then sustaining the high end of our 5% to 7% target margins for Group Protection, which will have a positive impact on our capital generation. We continue to execute our group protection margin enhancement strategy of pricing and product discipline improved claims effectiveness such as by helping our customers return to the workforce and driving expense efficiencies through Spark. And finally, higher interest rates, enabling a shift from spread compression to spread expansion. 
In closing, we are laser-focused on advancing our strategic objectives as we increase capital and strengthen our balance sheet, delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. With a talented leadership team in place, a strong franchise and a long-standing track record of disciplined execution. We have a clear strategy that we will be executing on in the months ahead, and I look forward to updating you on our progress."

Before I discuss our earnings results today, I'm going to provide commentary around 3 topics: the results of this year's assumption review where we expect to end the year from an RBC standpoint a",1819,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I discuss our earnings results today, I'm going to provide commentary around 3 topics: the results of this year's assumption review where we expect to end the year from an RBC standpoint and the drivers behind that outcome. And lastly, the writing off of the remainder of the goodwill associated with our Life business. 
Starting with the results of this year's assumption review, which in total reduced our earnings by $2.1 billion with $2 billion of that impact in adjusted operating income with the balance below the line. Looking at the adjusted operating income impact of this year's assumption review by business unit. -- at positive $6 million and $1 million, respectively, the impacts in retirement and group were negligible, while the annuity business experienced a favorable impact of $217 million, driven by the impact of higher interest rates on projected profitability. 
Turning to the Life business. which had a negative impact of $2.2 billion, driven by 4 primary factors: First, rate increased settlements with 2 reinsurance partners in 2022, drove an unfavorable impact of $81 million. Second, an unfavorable impact of $106 million associated with updates to our underlying morbidity assumptions. Third, an unfavorable impact of $223 million from updating our mortality assumptions. I'd attribute about 2/3 of this adjustment to update its remit to expected mortality improvement as we align to this assumption to overall industry expectations and about 1/3 to adjustments to underlying older age mortality assumptions. 
Lastly, an unfavorable impact of $1.8 billion from updated policyholder behavior assumptions in our guaranteed Universal Life book. Digging into that impact. About 70% of the $1.8 billion impact was driven by changes in our long-term expectations around lapsation. As a reminder, a lapse occurs when a policyholder runs out of account value and decides to not pay additional premium to keep their policy in force. 
Coming into 2022, we have limited policyholder behavior experience. Combining our own data with a significant amount of experience contained in the industry study that I referenced on last quarter's call gave us the credible data needed to update our assumptions. With the result being that we now are assuming significantly greater persistency than we had been previously. 
As to the other 30%, I noted on last quarter's call that we saw a drop in lapse and surrender rates with the onset of the pandemic. In the case of GUL, we do not expect these to recover to pre-pandemic levels. A little more color on our GUL book. It is made up of 128,000 policies. Including the impact of the assumption review, we have a net GAAP reserves of $20.7 billion compared to $23.1 billion of net statutory reserves, which includes the $550 million statutory reserve charge we expect to take next quarter. 
I would note that if interest rates remain near current levels, we would expect to recover roughly 1/2 of that statutory capital impact at year-end 2023. In addition to the onetime impact I described above, we expect a $180 million reduction in run rate after-tax life GAAP operating earnings but no impact on run rate statutory results. 
Turning to our risk-based capital ratio. We began 2022 at 427% and and as noted by Ellen expect to end the year at approximately 360%. This year's expected 67-point drop is driven by a number of items of which 75% came from life insurance, including the expected fourth quarter statutory charge, smaller but continuing pandemic claims and negative cash flow generations. Rebuilding RBC is our #1 goal, and we are targeting an RBC ratio of 400%. 
Additionally, our leverage ratio has been negatively impacted by this quarter's unlocking and goodwill charges and is above our longer-term target of 25%. We expect to manage this over time through organic equity growth, which will be enhanced by the pausing of the buyback program. In LNBar, as we communicated previously, we will not take a dividend from this entity as we replenish capital following this year's elevated hedge breakage. As we communicated on our LDTI call, we are changing the focus of our hedge program to specifically focus on the protection of capital. 
Turning to the $634 million write-off of our remaining life goodwill balance. This result was driven by a number of factors, but 2 items that I would spike out are an increase in the discount rate used to value the business driven by increases in the broader interest rate environment and the impact of the decline in equity markets on our VUL business. 
Now let me turn to our results for the quarter. Last night, we reported a third quarter adjusted operating loss of $1.7 billion or $10.23 per share. which includes $11.62 per share from this year's assumption review. Not including the impact of the assumption review, adjusted operating earnings would have been $237 million or $1.39 per share for the quarter. Pandemic-related claims reduced operating earnings by $48 million or $0.28 per share and alternative investment returns were below long-term expectations by $93 million or $0.55 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, came in at $64.09, while cash at the holding company stands at $756 million. The VA hedge program was 99% effective for the quarter, resulting in breakage of $82 million improved versus recent periods. Not including the impact of the prior year quarter's $94 million legal expense notable item, G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were up 11% and as we experienced a number of onetime expenses that added roughly $30 million to G&A in the quarter. I'd also add that strong sales were a contributor to the growth in G&A. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income, not including the impact of the annual assumption review was $232 million compared to $343 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income declined 32% from the prior year quarter due to a 19% decrease in average separate account values and alternative investment results that were $18 million less favorable than the prior year period. The decline in equity markets during the quarter increased our net amount of risk for living benefits and death benefits to 9% and 6% of account values, respectively. I note that as we have continued to work on diversifying our annuity business, VAs with living benefit guarantees have come down to 46% of total annuity account values. 
Turning to Annuities return metrics. Excluding the annual review, return on assets and return on equity were 63 basis points and 15%, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect our diverse product portfolio, revised VA hedge program and the benefit of higher interest rates to drive future earnings and cash flow generation. Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $52 million, which includes a $6 million favorable impact from DeCamockin. Excluding notable items, operating earnings were $46 million compared to $60 million in the prior year quarter. The decline in operating earnings was driven by a $10 million drop in alternative investment income results and a 9% decline in average account values as positive net flows were not able to overcome the lower equity markets. These headwinds were partially offset by a 14 basis point increase in base spreads continued organic growth solid performance during a turbulent year in the capital markets and spread expansion show the resilience and competitive strength of RPS. 
Turning to life insurance. We reported an operating loss for the quarter of $2.2 billion or operating income of $37 million, excluding the net unfavorable impact of our annual assumption review. In the prior year quarter, we reported operating income of $93 million, which included a $26 million net unfavorable impact from last year's annual assumption review and $19 million from a legal expense. This quarter's result also included alternative investment results that were $131 million less favorable than the prior year period and $22 million of pandemic-related claims. This represented a $38 million improvement in pandemic-related claims. 
Beginning in the fourth quarter, an unfavorable $45 million quarterly run rate impact from the annual review will begin to be reflected in life operating earnings. Average in-force rose 11% compared to the prior year period, while average account values, net of reinsurance decreased 20% due to equity market declines, and impacts from the resolution transaction. While this was a difficult quarter, we are confident the combination of the reset of our GUL assumptions, higher interest rates, a product portfolio that has been revamped over the last several years and milder pandemic claims of the Life business in position to grow with a particular focus on improving the cash flow profile of the business. 
Group Protection reported operating income of $37 million compared to an operating loss of $32 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $16 million net favorable impact from last year's annual assumption review. The current quarter included pandemic-related claims of $26 million and alternative investment income that was $5 million below our target return levels. Pandemic-related claims improved $94 million from the year ago period. Adjusting for pandemic claims and unfavorable alternative investment income, the group margin was 5.5%, within our 5% to 7% target range. 
Excluding pandemic-related claims and the impact of last year's assumption review, the loss ratio improved 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower new group disability claims offset by slightly higher group life mortality. We are pleased with the direction of the Group Protection business. Through continued execution of our margin enhancement strategy, we are optimistic about achieving and sustainably reporting margins at the high end of our targeted range over time. 
Moving to investment results, where we continue to report excellent credit results and increasing new money yields. First, regarding the strength of the investment portfolio. Credit migration was net positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. And below investment grade fixed income assets remain at a historical low of 3%. We recognize the risk of a recession has been increasing and remain diligent in managing credit risk. As part of our normal process, we recently leveraged our entire multi-manager platform to perform scenario analysis on a name-by-name basis across all asset classes in the portfolio and continue to believe we are well positioned for a potential recession. 
The third quarter new money yield rose 80 basis points sequentially to 5%, 90 basis points above the current 4.1% yield on the fixed income portfolio. Higher rates have helped transition from many years of spread compression to spread expansion, which is supportive of earnings and cash flow generation. In addition, higher rates ultimately are beneficial to reserve levels. Finally, our alternatives return was negative 2.1% this quarter, below our targeted 2.5% quarterly return, a good result compared to the double-digit negative returns of major equity indices in the second quarter.

When you think about the substantial change we made this year to both our lapses to underwrite I think about it this way. So the process we go through, Ryan, a deep dive into our experience and we talked about the fact that our experience had come down with pandemic, and we now expect that behavior to remain in place. a significant amount of data that we're able to achieve, not only is our own experience grows, but with access to the industry study, which included participants and gave us the amount of data to understand how policyholders should be expected to behave in the future when they come to this point of do they have to pay additional premium. You think about all those things, and let me give you insights into what that meant. 
So when you think about Lincoln today, our own experience for the last couple of years. The total that we have seen in our book, and I mentioned that, that was down from before the pandemic. It was a total lapsing surrender rate of roughly 1.2%, right? About 40% of that came from surrenders. And the surrender is somebody who has account value. They decide they want to have that company back and surrender their policy. So about 40% or roughly 50 basis points. The other 60 basis points or 60% or roughly 70 basis points comes from lapsation. And lapsation are these people who they run out of account value, they haven't been paying their premiums sufficient to keep their policy in force, and they make the decision not to pay more premiums and so they lapse. So in total, roughly 50 basis points from surrenders, 70 basis points from ops. It's that experience which we then projected for the future. If you think about those 2 items, I comment on surrenders. So the very design of these policies is that the account value gets used up over time through charges. And so the surrender rate over roughly the next 20 to 25 years goes from that 0.5% level to 0 eventually. And then the lapse is projected forward using all of this behavioral data which is meant to tie to our current experience and then reflect all of the people in the future who will face this funding decision. So we feel very, very good about the assumption of the future. 
Not let's be clear, right? It's not 0. So there's always some risk, but we feel good that it reflects not only a substantial reduction, and a really solid understanding of how people will behave. Another way of thinking about it, Ryan, is this. When you look at the model this year compared to last year, over the next decade, we are keeping approximately 8% more of those policies in force. If you go back to my script, I mentioned we have about 128,000 policies, 8% of 128,000 means we're keeping about an additional 10,000 policies in force relative to last year. 
And if you think about this impact, right, this $1.8 billion impact associated with the as changes in the lapse and surrender assumptions. Do you think about that ongoing impact of $180 million. Essentially, what we're doing is we're setting up reserves to fund the claims for all of those additional people that we now expect to stay in force. So I hope that helps, Ryan. Once again, it's not 0. So of course, there's some residual risk, but we do feel really good about what we've done."

We do view based on best estimate assumptions that we have completely reset or well assumptions with full confidence here. You mentioned also in terms of reinsurance of SGL, so I want to address that as well. We talked about -- I mentioned in my script that we are evaluating all alternatives. And so we talked about the fact that we are evaluating transactions. We're looking at everything. And we would only look at a potential transaction if there was an opportunity that was at an appropriate price at the right time that really was there to enhance value. And ideally, if we were to go ahead and transact it would meet the objectives that we outlined. So increasing capital generation and distributable earnings, reducing the capital volatility. 
So clearly, if there was an opportunity that involved some reinsurance of SGL that would meet all of those factors, that certainly would be something that we would want to execute on. And the other thing that I'll add there is that we're certainly encouraged by the fact that when we look at the potential buyer universe out there that we've seen an expansion of buyers that really have shifted from where I would say that they were interested in more in more straight forward liabilities, and they've shifted into appetite for more complex liabilities. 
So again, everything is on the table. If there's an opportunity, right price, right time, we've got a full team, fully dedicated on taking a look at these opportunities, and we'll be back with further updates as we continue to explore."

And so we need to start with what are our overall priorities and 1 of those priorities, again, is to maintain the dividend. And while we do that, we're going to manage all these other levers, as I had mentioned earlier. So we're really looking for ways to overall improve the quality of the distributable earnings. We're looking at ways that we can improve how we think about really optimizing the capital that's allocated to new business -- and then the other piece, which is so critical, and we really have experienced it this year, and that is we've seen very significant impact to our capital position as a result of the capital markets. And so we believe that we can execute on some potential hedge and structural solutions to try to alleviate some of that and mitigate that in the near term on some of the inforce and that's an area that we'll really be focused on, again, to really execute as quickly as possible.

And so while we are in the process right now of organically replenishing and for us, the implication of that is not taking a dividend for some time out of Lima as we are focused on that. The other important piece of that is that we really believe as we look forward the next time we see equity market volatility that we won't find ourselves in this situation. So -- and I'm going to hand it over to Randy specifically to talk about the SGUL impact as it relates to LNBar."

So in terms of other business outside of variable annuity inside of Win bar in this case, your question specifically on STL. What you have in there is some of the financing arrangements with external parties, our host in Lin bar. And so it's not the total contract. You have all the base reserves over in LN. It's just that financed piece, Alex, that sits over in LNBar. In terms of those financed reserves over in LNBar, those are long-term financing arrangements that are in place. I think the first 1 that comes up for renewal is sort of in the middle of the 30s, so it's a little over a decade from now. I think when we think about those financing relationships, 1 of the ways I've been thinking about it when we plug the new assumptions. You got to remember, when you do financing, you subs have provisions for adverse deviations, so you get some support there. But 1 pushes new assumptions when these things start rolling over a decade from now. 
There will be a little bit of pressure on the amount of financing. One of the way I'm thinking about it is we talked about with rates where they are will release roughly half, we would expect to release roughly half of the AD reserve we're putting up at this year. I think that remaining half essentially can be there to support those financing relationships. So I think LNBar, in terms of its capitalization outside of DBA business is in good shape and very well managed and capitalized consistent with how we capitalized L&O and our overall life companies."

And so everything that we're talking about in terms of our actions are really to improve that. 
The other thing that I want to mention as it relates to hybrid is that while it's true that, of course, that there is a cost. To the earlier question around a significant portion of that will then flow into the life companies. And we'll turn around and we'll invest that so that the ultimate cost will be net of the new money yields, which are pretty nice right now.

Before we discuss the details of our third quarter performance, I want to step back and speak to the magnitude of the unlocking charge resulting from our annual assumption review. I'll also address the decline in",2011,"Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss the details of our third quarter performance, I want to step back and speak to the magnitude of the unlocking charge resulting from our annual assumption review. I'll also address the decline in our risk-based capital ratio, the recent performance of our Life business provide a quick review of our other businesses, the multiple levers available to improve our capital position and how we are changing the strategic approach to our business in key areas. 
First, I will address the unlocking at a high level, and Randy will provide more details. The $2.1 billion total unlocking includes a $2.3 billion charge in our Life business, driven by $1.8 billion related to policyholder lapse behavior within the Guaranteed Universal Life or GUL block. This charge was primarily due to updated lapse assumptions where emerging Lincoln GLU experience was validated this year by new industry perspectives. As a result, we expect a $180 million decline in GAAP annual run rate life operating earnings. 
On a statutory basis, the updated lapse assumptions also produce a $550 million charge related to the AD GUL subtest to be booked in the fourth quarter, which translates to about 22 points of RBC. The unlocking has no impact on run rate statutory earnings. As a reminder, GUL is a type of permanent life policy that guarantees insurance will stay in-force if the policyholder continues to pay a certain minimum premium. Because of this guarantee, GUL is subject to long-term assumption risk. 
Interest rates have been lower than assumed in pricing and were a significant driver of our decision some years ago to reduce sales dramatically and ultimately exit the GUL market. Additionally, over the years, mortality and reinsurance costs have seen unfavorable adjustments. Lapse is the other key assumption. Over the last several years, as Lincoln's GUL policy experience has materialized, it has provided deeper insights into anticipated behavior patterns in later policy durations, which were subsequently supplemented with the recent industry experience study. As a result, we have reset our assumptions to reflect lower lapsation going forward. 
In addition, we separately incurred a $634 million GAAP goodwill impairment charge in our life business, primarily driven by variable universal life or VUL equity market impacts and the use of a higher discount rate. Before I discuss the other topics, I will briefly touch on the operating highlights of our businesses this quarter. We delivered strong sales growth in all 4 of our businesses reflecting our continued focus on expanding and diversifying the product portfolio. 
We saw a sales rebound in annuities, up 21% from the prior year quarter as growth in index variable annuities and fixed annuities more than offset a decline in traditional variable annuities. Net flows were positive in the quarter for the first time since mid-2020 driven by sales growth. Total Life Insurance sales were up 3% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by an increase in indexed Universal Life sales. 
And in Retirement Plan Services, or RPS, total deposits of $2.8 billion were up 16% from the prior year quarter reflecting a 33% increase in first year sales and a 9% increase in recurring deposits. Year-to-date, positive net flows rose to $2.7 billion. In Group Protection, sales were up 83% from the prior year quarter, reflecting strong results across all products and market segments. Premiums of $1.2 billion were up 8% compared to the prior year quarter. And finally, our high-quality investment portfolio continues to perform well and higher interest rates have led to spread expansion following years of spread compression. 
Now turning to the RBC ratio. We started the year at approximately 430% risk-based capital and are projected to end the year with our RBC at approximately 360%. The year-end projection includes the expected fourth quarter statutory charge as well as other factors. Before I elaborate on those factors and importantly, our actions underway to replenish capital back to our target, I want to emphasize the following: while we are not satisfied with our projected RBC ratio, we are taking swift and targeted actions to rebuild to our 400% target. We are confident we have ample capital to effectively operate the business as we get back to our targeted level. 
We have a clear understanding of the issues and have a plan in place to address them as you'll hear this morning. Effective execution starts with leadership and our new experienced and talented senior leaders will execute on the strategic objectives I introduced last quarter, which are: first, maximizing distributable earnings and improving capital generation. Second, reducing capital sensitivity to market volatility and improving capital efficiency; and third, further diversifying our earnings mix with durable cash-generative income streams. 
Continuing this discussion on capital. Our life business has been the source of 3/4 of our RBC ratio decline this year, with the 3 main contributors as follows: as I mentioned, the assumption review will increase our statutory reserves, which will reduce statutory capital and is included in the projected year-end RBC ratio I referenced above. However, the statutory AD test utilizes prescribed trailing interest rates. And if rates stay at current levels, we would expect to release a portion of these reserves over time. 
Second, while smaller than the impacts of the prior 2 years, we continue to experience pandemic claims this year, particularly in the first quarter. We expect these impacts to continue to moderate over time. 
Third, setting aside the impact of the AD test and pandemic claims, the life insurance business is a negative contributor to cash flow generation. A portion of this negative contribution is attributable to increased reserves in our VUL portfolio due to this year's equity market decline. However, there are other factors weighing on the life insurance business' ability to generate distributable earnings, including negative statutory earnings producing negative cash flow from our GUL block which are not affected by the assumption change, an increase in recurring reinsurance costs, the loss of ongoing free cash flow from previous block transactions and the transition to principal-based reserving, which has changed the pattern of distributable earnings and capital intensity for certain products, notably term life. 
The remaining 25% of this year's projected RBC decline is attributable to a variety of factors, including higher capital allocation to fixed annuity sales and stable value offerings within our retirement business as well as the impact of group's pandemic claims and lower fees in our annuity business. Our annuity business has always been and remains highly cash generative and well risk managed. However, this year's market movements, specifically the declines in equity markets and the increase in interest rates had negatively impacted both equity and bond fund returns, resulting in lower fees on assets under management and consequently reduced capital generation. 
Additionally, we hedge our variable annuity guaranteed benefits out of LNBar. The current hedge program has been highly effective and has focused on generating sufficient assets to fund future claims by minimizing GAAP net income volatility. This year's capital market environment has led to market volatility and increased hedge breakage that has resulted in reduced capital within LNBar. We intend to organically rebuild the LNBar capital position over time. And while we have taken an average of about $120 million of dividends per year out of LNBar, we do not expect to take the dividend for some time. 
In September, we announced enhancements to our VA hedging program that focus on maximizing distributable earnings and explicitly protecting statutory capital. The updated VA hedge program aligns with our increased strategic focus on capital generation. Additionally, I note that our 2 workplace businesses; group protection and retirement plan services are well positioned to deliver strong distributable earnings and contribute to the rebuilding of capital. I will now discuss the actions that the leadership team and I are taking to enhance the distributable earnings and capital generation of our business where a number of the initiatives underway will support improvements in our life business, rebuild our RBC ratio to our 400% target and strengthen our balance sheet. First, while we prioritize balance sheet resilience to replenish our capital, we are pausing share repurchases. 
We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, will be maintaining the dividend and expect to return to dividend growth and share repurchases over time. Second, we have capacity in our capital structure beyond today's mix of primarily common equity and senior debt and are evaluating alternatives such as preferred or additional hybrid securities to provide additional margin given the uncertain macroeconomic environment and risk of potential headwinds from that environment beyond what we see today. And third, we are considering strategic alternatives for our in-force business, including potential block reinsurance transactions with a wider lens that incorporates our new strategic objectives. 
As I have mentioned previously, we have a fully dedicated and staffed up team. While there are no commitments, if we find the right opportunity at the right price, we will look to execute. In addition to these 3 actions, we have several initiatives already underway to advance our strategic objectives that will have a favorable impact to our balance sheet longer term. In particular, a number of the measures we are taking are designed to improve the distributable earnings profile of the Life business. 
The 3 new leaders I introduced last quarter Matt Grove, Head of Individual Life, Annuity and Lincoln Financial Network, James Reid, Head of Workplace Solutions; and Chris Neczypor, our Chief Strategy Officer, are charged with implementing our strategic actions. As a team, we are keenly focused on our reprice, shift and add new product strategy. In recent years, we have been focused on shifting the product mix to a diversified set of solutions with lower guarantees, more sharing with the customer and improved capital efficiency.  As we move forward, consistent with our strategy to maximize distributable earnings, we are refocusing our new business capital allocation process. 
We've previously focused on growing sales while exceeding our return thresholds. Going forward, we expect to allocate a targeted amount of capital to new business and will focus on maximizing our return on this capital. We expect this approach to allow us to allocate less capital to new business in 2023 than we did in 2022 while delivering a robust level of sales and more distributable earnings. This focus on the efficiency of our capital allocation is an important part of our go-forward strategy. Spark. We are ahead of schedule and making substantial progress in the implementation of this enterprise-wide expense initiative to deliver run rate savings of $260 million to $300 million by late 2024. We have achieved approximately 45% of the planned expense savings to date. 
We are also working on reducing the market sensitivity of our BUL product to mitigate the capital impact of potential further market declines and are exploring multiple avenues to accomplish this including both hedge and structural solutions. And as I previously mentioned, our Workplace Solutions businesses comprised of group protection and retirement plan services continue to be critically important to our long-term strategy. Both businesses are focused on the customer, driving differentiation in the market and delivering results. 
We have spoken with you about our goal of reaching and then sustaining the high end of our 5% to 7% target margins for Group Protection, which will have a positive impact on our capital generation. We continue to execute our group protection margin enhancement strategy of pricing and product discipline, improved claims effectiveness such as by helping our customers return to the workforce and driving expense efficiencies through Spark. And finally, higher interest rates, enabling a shift from spread compression to spread expansion. 
In closing, we are laser-focused on advancing our strategic objectives as we increase capital and strengthen our balance sheet, delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. With a talented leadership team in place, a strong franchise and a long-standing track record of disciplined execution, we have a clear strategy that we will be executing on in the months ahead, and I look forward to updating you on our progress."

Before I discuss our earnings results today, I'm going to provide commentary around 3 topics: the results of this year's assumption review where we expect to end the year from an RBC standpoint a",1817,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I discuss our earnings results today, I'm going to provide commentary around 3 topics: the results of this year's assumption review where we expect to end the year from an RBC standpoint and the drivers behind that outcome. And lastly, the writing off of the remainder of the goodwill associated with our Life business. 
Starting with the results of this year's assumption review, which in total reduced our earnings by $2.1 billion with $2 billion of that impact in adjusted operating income with the balance below the line. Looking at the adjusted operating income impact of this year's assumption review by business unit. At positive $6 million and $1 million, respectively, the impacts in retirement and group were negligible, while the annuity business experienced a favorable impact of $217 million, driven by the impact of higher interest rates on projected profitability. 
Turning to the Life business which had a negative impact of $2.2 billion, driven by 4 primary factors: First, rate increased settlements with 2 reinsurance partners in 2022, drove an unfavorable impact of $81 million. Second, an unfavorable impact of $106 million associated with updates to our underlying morbidity assumptions. Third, an unfavorable impact of $223 million from updating our mortality assumptions. I'd attribute about 2/3 of this adjustment to update its remit to expected mortality improvement as we align to this assumption to overall industry expectations and about 1/3 to adjustments to underlying older age mortality assumptions. 
Lastly, an unfavorable impact of $1.8 billion from updated policyholder behavior assumptions in our guaranteed Universal Life book. Digging into that impact. About 70% of the $1.8 billion impact was driven by changes in our long-term expectations around lapsation. As a reminder, a lapse occurs when a policyholder runs out of account value and decides to not pay additional premium to keep their policy in-force. 
Coming into 2022, we have limited policyholder behavior experience. Combining our own data with a significant amount of experience contained in the industry study that I referenced on last quarter's call gave us the credible data needed to update our assumptions, with the result being that we now are assuming significantly greater persistency than we had been previously. 
As to the other 30%, I noted on last quarter's call that we saw a drop in lapse and surrender rates with the onset of the pandemic. In the case of GUL, we do not expect these to recover to pre-pandemic levels. A little more color on our GUL book. It is made up of 128,000 policies. Including the impact of the assumption review, we have a net GAAP reserves of $20.7 billion compared to $23.1 billion of net statutory reserves, which includes the $550 million statutory reserve charge we expect to take next quarter. 
I would note that if interest rates remain near current levels, we would expect to recover roughly 1/2 of that statutory capital impact at year-end 2023. In addition to the onetime impact I described above, we expect a $180 million reduction in run rate after-tax life GAAP operating earnings but no impact on run rate statutory results. 
Turning to our risk-based capital ratio. We began 2022 at 427% and as noted by Ellen expect to end the year at approximately 360%. This year's expected 67-point drop is driven by a number of items of which 75% came from life insurance, including the expected fourth quarter statutory charge, smaller but continuing pandemic claims and negative cash flow generations. Rebuilding RBC is our #1 goal, and we are targeting an RBC ratio of 400%. 
Additionally, our leverage ratio has been negatively impacted by this quarter's unlocking and goodwill charges and is above our longer-term target of 25%. We expect to manage this over time through organic equity growth, which will be enhanced by the pausing of the buyback program. In LNBar, as we communicated previously, we will not take a dividend from this entity as we replenish capital following this year's elevated hedge breakage. As we communicated on our LDTI call, we are changing the focus of our hedge program to specifically focus on the protection of capital. 
Turning to the $634 million write-off of our remaining life goodwill balance. This result was driven by a number of factors, but 2 items that I would spike out are an increase in the discount rate used to value the business driven by increases in the broader interest rate environment and the impact of the decline in equity markets on our VUL business. 
Now let me turn to our results for the quarter. Last night, we reported a third quarter adjusted operating loss of $1.7 billion or $10.23 per share. which includes $11.62 per share from this year's assumption review. Not including the impact of the assumption review, adjusted operating earnings would have been $237 million or $1.39 per share for the quarter. Pandemic-related claims reduced operating earnings by $48 million or $0.28 per share and alternative investment returns were below long-term expectations by $93 million or $0.55 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, came in at $64.09, while cash at the holding company stands at $756 million. The VA hedge program was 99% effective for the quarter, resulting in breakage of $82 million improved versus recent periods. Not including the impact of the prior year quarter's $94 million legal expense notable item, G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were up 11% and as we experienced a number of onetime expenses that added roughly $30 million to G&A in the quarter. I'd also add that strong sales were a contributor to the growth in G&A. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income, not including the impact of the annual assumption review was $232 million compared to $343 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income declined 32% from the prior year quarter due to a 19% decrease in average separate account values and alternative investment results that were $18 million less favorable than the prior year period. The decline in equity markets during the quarter increased our net amount of risk for living benefits and death benefits to 9% and 6% of account values, respectively. I note that as we have continued to work on diversifying our annuity business, VAs with living benefit guarantees have come down to 46% of total annuity account values. 
Turning to Annuities return metrics. Excluding the annual review, return on assets and return on equity were 63 basis points and 15%, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect our diverse product portfolio, revised VA hedge program and the benefit of higher interest rates to drive future earnings and cash flow generation. Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $52 million, which includes a $6 million favorable impact from DAC [indiscernible]. Excluding notable items, operating earnings were $46 million compared to $60 million in the prior year quarter. The decline in operating earnings was driven by a $10 million drop in alternative investment income results and a 9% decline in average account values as positive net flows were not able to overcome the lower equity markets. These headwinds were partially offset by a 14 basis point increase in base spreads, continued organic growth, solid performance during a turbulent year in the capital markets and spread expansion show the resilience and competitive strength of RPS. 
Turning to life insurance. We reported an operating loss for the quarter of $2.2 billion or operating income of $37 million, excluding the net unfavorable impact of our annual assumption review. In the prior year quarter, we reported operating income of $93 million, which included a $26 million net unfavorable impact from last year's annual assumption review and $19 million from a legal expense. This quarter's result also included alternative investment results that were $131 million less favorable than the prior year period and $22 million of pandemic-related claims. This represented a $38 million improvement in pandemic-related claims. 
Beginning in the fourth quarter, an unfavorable $45 million quarterly run rate impact from the annual review will begin to be reflected in life operating earnings. Average in-force rose 11% compared to the prior year period, while average account values, net of reinsurance decreased 20% due to equity market declines, and impacts from the resolution transaction. While this was a difficult quarter, we are confident the combination of the reset of our GUL assumptions, higher interest rates, a product portfolio that has been revamped over the last several years and milder pandemic claims of the Life business in position to grow with a particular focus on improving the cash flow profile of the business. 
Group Protection reported operating income of $37 million compared to an operating loss of $32 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $16 million net favorable impact from last year's annual assumption review. The current quarter included pandemic-related claims of $26 million and alternative investment income that was $5 million below our target return levels. Pandemic-related claims improved $94 million from the year ago period. Adjusting for pandemic claims and unfavorable alternative investment income, the group margin was 5.5%, within our 5% to 7% target range. 
Excluding pandemic-related claims and the impact of last year's assumption review, the loss ratio improved 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower new group disability claims offset by slightly higher group life mortality. We are pleased with the direction of the Group Protection business. Through continued execution of our margin enhancement strategy, we are optimistic about achieving and sustainably reporting margins at the high end of our targeted range over time. 
Moving to investment results, where we continue to report excellent credit results and increasing new money yields. First, regarding the strength of the investment portfolio. Credit migration was net positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. And below investment grade fixed income assets remain at a historical low of 3%. We recognize the risk of a recession has been increasing and remain diligent in managing credit risk. As part of our normal process, we recently leveraged our entire multi-manager platform to perform scenario analysis on a name-by-name basis across all asset classes in the portfolio and continue to believe we are well positioned for a potential recession. 
The third quarter new money yield rose 80 basis points sequentially to 5%, 90 basis points above the current 4.1% yield on the fixed income portfolio. Higher rates have helped transition from many years of spread compression to spread expansion, which is supportive of earnings and cash flow generation. In addition, higher rates ultimately are beneficial to reserve levels. Finally, our alternatives return was negative 2.1% this quarter, below our targeted 2.5% quarterly return, a good result compared to the double-digit negative returns of major equity indices in the second quarter.

So the process we go through, Ryan, a deep dive into our experience and we talked about the fact that ou",596,"Thank you for the question. When you think about the substantial change we made this year to both our lapses to underwrite, I think about it this way. So the process we go through, Ryan, a deep dive into our experience and we talked about the fact that our experience had come down with pandemic, and we now expect that behavior to remain in place. A significant amount of data that we're able to achieve, not only is our own experience grows, but with access to the industry study, which included 9 participants and gave us the amount of data to understand how policyholders should be expected to behave in the future when they come to this point of do they have to pay additional premium. You think about all those things, and let me give you insights into what that meant. 
So when you think about Lincoln today, our own experience for the last couple of years. The total that we have seen in our book, and I mentioned that, that was down from before the pandemic. It was a total lapsing surrender rate of roughly 1.2%, right? About 40% of that came from surrenders. And the surrender is somebody who has account value. They decide they want to have that company back and surrender their policy. So about 40% or roughly 50 basis points. 
The other 60 basis points or 60% or roughly 70 basis points comes from lapsation. And lapsation are these people who -- they run out of account value, they haven't been paying their premiums sufficient to keep their policy in-force, and they make the decision not to pay more premiums and so they lapse. So [ 1.2 ] in total, roughly 50 basis points from surrenders, 70 basis points from lapses It's that experience which we then projected for the future. If you think about those 2 items, I comment on surrenders. So the very design of these policies is that the account value gets used up over time through charges. And so the surrender rate over roughly the next 20 to 25 years goes from that 0.5% level to 0 eventually. And then the lapse is projected forward using all of this behavioral data which is meant to tie to our current experience and then reflect all of the people in the future who will face this funding decision. So we feel very, very good about the assumption of the future. 
Now let's be clear, right? It's not 0. So there's always some risk, but we feel good that it reflects not only a substantial reduction, and a really solid understanding of how people will behave. Another way of thinking about it, Ryan, is this. When you look at the model this year compared to last year, over the next decade, we are keeping approximately 8% more of those policies in-force. If you go back to my script, I mentioned we have about 128,000 policies, 8% of 128,000 means we're keeping about an additional 10,000 policies in-force relative to last year. 
And if you think about this impact, right, this $1.8 billion impact associated with the lapse -- changes in the lapse and surrender assumptions. Do you think about that ongoing impact of $180 million. Essentially, what we're doing is we're setting up reserves to fund the claims for all of those additional people that we now expect to stay in-force. So I hope that helps, Ryan. Once again, it's not 0. So of course, there's some residual risk, but we do feel really good about what we've done."

We do view based on best estimate assumptions that we have completely reset our GUL assumptions with full confidence here. You mentioned also in terms of reinsurance of SGUL, so I want to address that as well. We talked about -- I mentioned in my script that we are evaluating all alternatives. 
And so we talked about the fact that we are evaluating transactions. We're looking at everything. And we would only look at a potential transaction if there was an opportunity that was at an appropriate price at the right time that really was there to enhance value. And ideally, if we were to go ahead and transact, it would meet the objectives that we outlined. So increasing capital generation and distributable earnings, reducing the capital volatility. 
So clearly, if there was an opportunity that involved some reinsurance of SGL that would meet all of those factors, that certainly would be something that we would want to execute on. And the other thing that I'll add there is that we're certainly encouraged by the fact that when we look at the potential buyer universe out there that we've seen an expansion of buyers that really have shifted from where I would say that they were interested in more straight forward liabilities, and they've shifted into appetite for more complex liabilities. 
So again, everything is on the table. If there's an opportunity, right price, right time, we've got a full team, fully dedicated on taking a look at these opportunities, and we'll be back with further updates as we continue to explore."

And so we need to start with what are our overall priorities and one of those priorities, again, is to maintain the dividend. And while we do that, we're going to manage all these other levers, as I had mentioned earlier. 
So we're really looking for ways to overall improve the quality of the distributable earnings. We're looking at ways that we can improve how we think about really optimizing the capital that's allocated to new business. And then the other piece, which is so critical, and we really have experienced it this year, and that is we've seen very significant impact to our capital position as a result of the capital markets. And so we believe that we can execute on some potential hedge and structural solutions to try to alleviate some of that and mitigate that in the near term on some of the in-force and that's an area that we'll really be focused on, again, to really execute as quickly as possible.

The power of our distribution organization and our relationships, coupled with all the work that we've done around reprice, shift and add new as it relates to product strategy. So when we look across the 4 businesses right now, part of what we are seeing is we have a broad diversified set of product solutions that are really meeting a variety of different customer preferences and really strong, deep distribution relationships. 
And so you put those things together and when we were talking about things like now really shifting and further emphasizing as it relates to new business capital allocation, the idea of having a set amount of capital and then really optimizing the overall new business relative to that. I want to be clear that that's within the current product suite. So we really believe that the reprice shift in add new and all of those actions have given us the broad product portfolio that we need to be able to deliver on our commitment to all of you. 
But what we're going to be doing is being further laser-focused on how we take the overall products that we're offering and utilize them to really be able to optimize the overall distributable earnings profile at the same time. And so this is work that's well underway already in partnership inside of the organization with the business, with the product manufacturing teams and with distribution.

Currently switching to stat so I'm just trying to understand, I mean is $550 million really the right number for me to think about in the said entity, and we can see the RBC moving in the U.S. operating company. But just based on your comments around cash flow from LNBar probably being shut off for a while. I mean, is there an impact in there that we need to be thinking about? I mean can you disclose anything about the capitalization of LNBar and help us think about the adequacy of capital there, just in light of the seeding of -- between UL and variable annuities, there's a lot of your tail rest being ceded there?"

And so we are confident that we can organically rebuild the overall capital position as it relates to LNBar. 
And at the same time, we announced in September that we are shifting to a hedge strategy, and that head strategy will have an explicit stat capital hedge on it. And so part of the goal there is that the next time that we have an equity market downturn that the hedge will be appropriate from a risk management perspective to really mitigate that. And so while we are in the process right now of organically replenishing and for us, the implication of that is not taking a dividend for some time out of LNBar as we are focused on that. The other important piece of that is that we really believe as we look forward the next time we see equity market volatility that we won't find ourselves in this situation.

So in terms of other business outside of variable annuity inside of LNBar in this case, your question specifically on SGUL. What you have in there is some of the financing arrangements with external parties, our host in LNBar. And so it's not the total contract. You have all the base reserves over in LNL. It's just that financed piece, Alex, that sits over in LNBar. In terms of those financed reserves over in LNBar, those are long-term financing arrangements that are in place. I think the first one that comes up for renewal is sort of in the middle of the 30s, so it's a little over a decade from now. 
I think when we think about those financing relationships, one of the ways I've been thinking about it when we plug the new assumptions. You got to remember, when you do financing, your [indiscernible] have provisions for adverse deviations, so you get some support there. But [indiscernible] new assumptions when these things start rolling over a decade from now. 
There will be a little bit of pressure on the amount of financing. One of the way I'm thinking about it is we talked about with rates where they are, well, release roughly half -- we would expect to release roughly half of the AD reserve we're putting up at this year. I think that remaining half essentially can be there to support those financing relationships. So I think LNBar, in terms of its capitalization outside of [indiscernible] business is in good shape and very well managed and capitalized consistent with how we capitalized LNL and our overall life companies."

The other thing that I want to mention as it relates to hybrid is that while it's true that, of course, that there is a cost. To the earlier question around a significant portion of that will then flow into the life companies. And we'll turn around and we'll invest that so that the ultimate cost will be net of the new money yields, which are pretty nice right now.
