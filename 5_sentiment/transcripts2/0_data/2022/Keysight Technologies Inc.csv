Keysight delivered a strong start to the year. First quarter results are evidence that our broad-based portfolio of differentiated solutions is aligned with the market's most important design and test challenges. We are enabling our customers to address rapidly evolving technologies and market opportunities.
Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we continue to see sustained robust demand with record orders again exceeding our expectations. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and balanced across our diverse set of end markets and across all regions. Orders grew 22% year-over-year and were 31% higher than the first quarter of 2020, just prior to the initial impact of the COVID pandemic.
Second, record first quarter revenue and earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance despite ongoing supply constraints. Our results and exceptional execution by the Keysight team continue to demonstrate the durability and resilience of our business.
And third, Keysight solutions are aligned with the long-term secular trends fueled by ongoing innovation across multiple markets. Our investments in growth initiatives and supply chain resiliency are paying off.
We continue to expect to deliver 6% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and given the stronger-than-guided first quarter earnings, to achieve 12% earnings growth. We are confident in the strength of the company we built and our ability to drive above-market profitable growth over the long term. Accordingly, with the recent equity market volatility, we capitalized on the opportunity to create value for shareholders by accelerating our share repurchases in the past 2 quarters.
Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered another quarter of record orders, which grew 22% to $1.5 billion. This outpaced record first quarter revenue, which grew 6% to $1.25 billion. We achieved gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 28% and EPS of $1.65, all of which were first quarter records. Although supply constraints continue to moderate revenue, Keysight's consistent execution and focus on growth initiatives across the 5G ecosystem, automotive and software position us well to capitalize on a robust demand environment.
The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Record orders were driven by strong demand for automotive and semiconductor solutions as well as broad general electronic applications. Our differentiated solutions position us well to win in the fast-expanding automotive market, where we achieved all-time record orders and record first quarter revenue. Orders grew well over 50% in the quarter and exceeded 50% growth over the past year.
Manufacturing capacity continued to expand to meet pent-up demand, and the EV and AV technology investment accelerated. This happened particularly in Europe and China, where EV market share of total car sales in 2021 increased to 19% and 15%, respectively. Demand remains strong from leading manufacturers for both EV and AV production test solutions, power semiconductors, automotive electronics and RF and millimeter wave wireless test.
Keysight continues to engage with global industry leaders such as BMW, Sony Semiconductor Solutions and Provincia to enable next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D and production workflows. Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove double-digit order and revenue growth and resulted in record orders and record first quarter revenue. Investments remain high in advanced semiconductor technologies and capacity expansion to serve a broad set of applications, including silicon-rich smartphones, high-performance computing, IoT and autos.
In general electronics, we achieved record orders with double-digit growth across all regions driven by investment in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health, connectivity and remote monitoring.
Turning to the Communications Solutions Group. We delivered record first quarter orders and revenue with double-digit order growth across all regions. Commercial communications orders achieved the second-highest quarter on record with double-digit order and revenue growth in the Americas and Europe.
We see continued strength in 400G and 800G Ethernet solutions for enterprise and service provider customers as well as increasing demand for terabit communication solutions. Driven by the ongoing investment in data center and cloud applications, orders for Keysight's differentiated, high-performance, real-time oscilloscopes grew triple digits this quarter. Keysight's leadership in 5G Release 16 applications, broad test case coverage and our strategic role in O-RAN are enabling our expansion across the broad communications ecosystem.
Our 5G customer base is growing as deployments begin to scale, and we are enabling disruptive technologies with key industry players, such as Qualcomm to demonstrate 3.5-gigabit uplink data throughput, China Telecom in Taiwan to accelerate verification of O-RAN connectivity, KT Corporation in South Korea to verify advanced 5G new radio features, and LG Electronics to demonstrate 6G radio frequencies. Investments remain strong in 5G wireless R&D and manufacturing as well as networking as market expansion transitions to devices, network equipment and the aerospace defense vertical.
In aerospace defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by demand for signal monitoring, cyber, space and satellite as well as 5G and 6G applications. Demand was particularly strong in Asia Pacific and Europe. As design, test and measurement solutions growing complexity, software and services are an increasingly more important differentiator for Keysight. Combined, they represented more than 1/3 of total revenue this quarter, increasing recurring revenue and contributing to the resiliency and predictability of our business.
In summary, demand remains strong for Keysight's software-centric portfolio of differentiated solutions across all of our end markets and regions. Since the pandemic began in 2020, Keysight has been focused on supporting our customers and delivering on our commitments. We have implemented new sourcing strategies and increased partner engagement to improve supply chain flexibility diversification and resilience. While fully focused on our near-term priorities, we continue to work towards a long-term sustainable vision for the company and for the communities in which we operate.
The Keysight leadership model drives us to deliver business value through ethical, environmentally sustainable and socially responsible operations. Corporate social responsibility is an enabling value of the KLM, and we are proud to have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third year in a row. Keysight's inclusion exemplifies the company's continued commitment to building a better planet. This includes ambitious targets that support several UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions in our company operations by fiscal year 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement goal of 2050. As we accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, we are better positioned than ever to deliver value to our customers, shareholders and employees.
Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Q1 was a great start to fiscal 2022, and our full year outlook exemplifies Keysight's ability to deliver on our commitments.
In the first quarter of 2022, we delivered revenue of $1.250 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 7% on a core basis. As expected, supply chain constraints continue to temper revenue results. We delivered a record $1.495 billion in orders, up 22% or 23% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with over $2.3 billion in backlog.
Turning to our operational results for Q1. We reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $473 million, resulting in an operating margin of 28%. We achieved net income of $305 million and delivered $1.65 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 184 million shares.
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $878 million, up 3% on both the reported and core basis. CSG delivered record gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 27%. In Q1, commercial communications generated revenue of $584 million, up 5%, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas and Europe driven by continued investments in 5G, O-RAN adoption, 400-gigabit, 800-gigabit and terabit R&D and wireline applications. Aerospace defense and government revenue of $294 million was flat versus a strong prior year compare.
Solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the Americas and Europe. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in aerospace defense and government, and the funnel remains strong for this end market.
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated first quarter revenue of $372 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 31%.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $182 million or 15% of revenue. Under the new share repurchase authorization announced in November of last year, we have acquired 1.13 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $182.19 for a total consideration of $206 million.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance 
million to $1.310 billion and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.69 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 183 million shares. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we continue to expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7% while delivering 12% earnings growth. The raised EPS growth expectation
In closing, the demand environment remains strong across our end markets and regions. With a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence, we are confident in our ability to meet our customer commitments and continue to deliver profitable above-market growth going forward.
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

So I think, first of all, I would say that the order growth, we believe, is indicative of the highly -- or the very strong demand environment we're seeing across the wide range of end markets, right? Within EISG, the semi auto market is very strong. The surge in manufacturing, driving strength in general electronics. In the communications side, we're seeing great strength in 5G, as Satish just talked about, but also 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit on the networking side as well. And so very strong demand, and I think that's reflected in the order strength and in the growth you're seeing in orders.
On the revenue side, obviously, we continue to work through significant supply chain challenges. Our revenue is significantly constrained by the supply environment, and we're working through that. We have said on prior calls that we have seen lead times to our customers extend by about a month, and that month extension has really happened over the course of the last 2 years, really from the onset of COVID back in the spring of 2020. And I think the good news is that our customers have responded to that and are placing orders with Keysight a bit earlier so that they can still get product delivery on a time line that meets their needs. And I think we're doing a good job getting product into the hands of our customers on those time lines.
I think if you turn the lens forward, what you're going to see as the supply chain situation starts to improve, and we hope to see that beginning in the second half. But certainly, we expect to see some supply chain constraints through 2023, that our lead times will slowly start to migrate back in over a number of quarters. And similarly, our customers will once again readjust their ordering patterns to, again, align them with their own need for delivery.
Why don't I turn it back to Mark with some more comments on the demand side."

I just would add that, reiterating the demand remains strong. It was very strong in Q1, very broad. We saw some earlier orders placed in distribution as an example, where the channel inventories are low because of the demand that we've seen there. So that's to be expected. We also saw some early orders from semiconductor, which is typical. They have longer-term horizons, and we work with them in that fashion.
But the headline is our strong double-digit order growth. It was not an outcome of advanced purchases. And on the plus side, as Neil mentioned, we are now working with customers much earlier than we may have done in the past. We've always had deep relationships.

And we see that all of the data that comes through the networks through 5G, as an example, have to ultimately flow into a data center or cloud.
And so as we follow that trial end-to-end, we see significant upgrades happening across the entire communications design flow. And we're participating in a number of those technology trends associated with not only the speed because you referenced with 400, 800 and terabit but also the underlying infrastructure that's changing with the memories, the server technologies and the edge compute as well.
And we're also very pleased with the number of new chipset starts, the design starts that are occurring across the entire industry today. And all of this is contributing to strength, and we saw that reflected in our commercial communications business, where we maintain a good balance between the 5G growth and also the wireline evolutions growth."

So that has this compounding effect.
I certainly think that as we get to the maturity with some of these technologies, the capacities will meet certain levels so we can see some of that begin to -- the growth begin to turn more to more long-term models that we've been seeing. But as we do so, we look forward to the next generation.

But look at the convergence in semiconductors and how more and more functions are being integrated into semiconductors and everything, whether you're talking about IoT or any of the other apps that we talk about, that demand we're going to see for a long period of time.
Look at automotive. We're not talking about things that will grow for a year or 2. Even though we talk about 19% and 15% of the total market being effectively EV in Europe and Asia, I mean, that's going to go up to close to 100%.

And then following that, where we're starting to see early investments in talking is 6G that will follow it. On top of that, you put quantum.

So I'd say that when we look at the automotive market, as Ron referenced in his script that we see a real inflection in adoption of EV and then a subsequent simultaneous adoption for AV as well, really driving the needs of the automotive market. At a simplistic level, we see a number of new lab activities that are starting in R&D across the globe, where automotive customers traditionally outsourced a lot of the R&D work, but they are now starting to build new facilities for research and development, hiring of electrical engineering talent, hiring of software talent is increasing, and that's really reflected in our R&D business that continues to grow strongly. We see this continuing to be a secular growth driver for us.
With regard to the manufacturing expansion, as you saw the number of EV starts to increase, our manufacturing business in this market also continues to grow. So at this point, I would say the opportunities for us -- for Keysight is to expand with a number of new lab starts as the hiring of electrical engineers growth in the automotive market will continue to grow.

So automotive continues to be the area of investment for us. And it's really hard to predict the growth rate, but we're quite pleased with the very strong results we're seeing so far.
I'll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the funnel."

So that funnel is growing substantially.
The other indicator that I think is very positive is the adoption of our services, which again is another indicator that customers are looking for help in innovating and getting these tough jobs done. So we're attaching a lot more services to our solutions, especially in the EV and the AV space."

Keysight delivered a strong start to the year. First quarter results are evidence that our broad-based portfolio of differentiated solutions is aligned with the market's most important design and test challenges. We are enabling our customers to address rapidly evolving technologies and market opportunities. 
Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we continue to see sustained robust demand with record orders again exceeding our expectations. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and balanced across our diverse set of end markets and across all regions. Orders grew 22% year-over-year and were 31% higher than the first quarter of 2020, just prior to the initial impact of the COVID pandemic. 
Second, record first quarter revenue and earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance despite ongoing supply constraints. Our results and exceptional execution by the Keysight team continue to demonstrate the durability and resilience of our business. 
And third, Keysight solutions are aligned with the long-term secular trends fueled by ongoing innovation across multiple markets. Our investments in growth initiatives and supply chain resiliency are paying off. We continue to expect to deliver 6% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and given the stronger-than-guided first quarter earnings, to achieve 12% earnings growth. We are confident in the strength of the company we built and our ability to drive above-market profitable growth over the long term. 
Accordingly, with the recent equity market volatility, we capitalized on the opportunity to create value for shareholders by accelerating our share repurchases in the past 2 quarters. 
Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered another quarter of record orders, which grew 22% to $1.5 billion. This outpaced record first quarter revenue, which grew 6% to $1.25 billion. We achieved gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 28% and EPS of $1.65, all of which were first quarter records. Although supply constraints continue to moderate revenue, Keysight's consistent execution and focus on growth initiatives across the 5G ecosystem, automotive and software position us well to capitalize on a robust demand environment. 
The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Record orders were driven by strong demand for automotive and semiconductor solutions as well as broad general electronic applications. Our differentiated solutions position us well to win in the fast-expanding automotive market, where we achieved all-time record orders and record first quarter revenue. Orders grew well over 50% in the quarter and exceeded 50% growth over the past year. 
Manufacturing capacity continued to expand to meet pent-up demand, and the EV and AV technology investment accelerated. This happened particularly in Europe and China, where EV market share of total car sales in 2021 increased to 19% and 15%, respectively. Demand remains strong from leading manufacturers for both EV and AV production test solutions, power semiconductors, automotive electronics and RF and millimeter wave wireless test. 
Keysight continues to engage with global industry leaders such as BMW, Sony Semiconductor Solutions and Proventia to enable next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D and production workflows. Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove double-digit order and revenue growth and resulted in record orders and record first quarter revenue. Investments remain high in advanced semiconductor technologies and capacity expansion to serve a broad set of applications, including silicon-rich smartphones, high-performance computing, IoT and autos. 
In general electronics, we achieved record orders with double-digit growth across all regions driven by investment in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health, connectivity and remote monitoring. 
Turning to the Communications Solutions Group. We delivered record first quarter orders and revenue with double-digit order growth across all regions. Commercial communications orders achieved the second-highest quarter on record with double-digit order and revenue growth in the Americas and Europe. 
We see continued strength in 400G and 800G Ethernet solutions for enterprise and service provider customers as well as increasing demand for terabit communication solutions. Driven by the ongoing investment in data center and cloud applications, orders for Keysight's differentiated, high-performance, real-time oscilloscopes grew triple digits this quarter. Keysight's leadership in 5G Release 16 applications, broad test case coverage and our strategic role in O-RAN are enabling our expansion across the broad communications ecosystem. 
Our 5G customer base is growing as deployments begin to scale, and we are enabling disruptive technologies with key industry players, such as Qualcomm to demonstrate 3.5-gigabit uplink data throughput, Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan to accelerate verification of O-RAN connectivity, KT Corporation in South Korea to verify advanced 5G new radio features and LG Electronics to demonstrate 6G radio frequencies. Investments remain strong in 5G wireless R&D and manufacturing as well as networking as market expansion transitions to devices, network equipment and the aerospace, defense vertical. 
In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by demand for signal monitoring, cyber, space and satellite as well as 5G and 6G applications. Demand was particularly strong in Asia Pacific and Europe. As design, test and measurement solutions grow in complexity, software and services are an increasingly more important differentiator for Keysight. Combined, they represented more than 1/3 of total revenue this quarter, increasing recurring revenue and contributing to the resiliency and predictability of our business. 
In summary, demand remains strong for Keysight's software-centric portfolio of differentiated solutions across all of our end markets and regions. Since the pandemic began in 2020, Keysight has been focused on supporting our customers and delivering on our commitments. We have implemented new sourcing strategies and increased partner engagement to improve supply chain flexibility, diversification and resilience. While fully focused on our near-term priorities, we continue to work towards a long-term sustainable vision for the company and for the communities in which we operate. 
The Keysight leadership model drives us to deliver business value through ethical, environmentally sustainable and socially responsible operations. Corporate social responsibility is an enabling value of the KLM, and we are proud to have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third year in a row. 
Keysight's inclusion exemplifies the company's continued commitment to building a better planet. This includes ambitious targets that support several UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions in our company operations by fiscal year 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement goal of 2050. As we accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, we are better positioned than ever to deliver value to our customers, shareholders and employees. 
Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Q1 was a great start to fiscal 2022, and our full year outlook exemplifies Keysight's ability to deliver on our commitments. 
In the first quarter of 2022, we delivered revenue of $1.250 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 7% on a core basis. As expected, supply chain constraints continue to temper revenue results. We delivered a record $1.495 billion in orders, up 22% or 23% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with over $2.3 billion in backlog. 
Turning to our operational results for Q1. We reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $473 million, resulting in an operating margin of 28%. We achieved net income of $305 million and delivered $1.65 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 184 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $878 million, up 3% on both the reported and core basis. CSG delivered record gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 27%. In Q1, commercial communications generated revenue of $584 million, up 5%, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas and Europe driven by continued investments in 5G, O-RAN adoption, 400-gigabit, 800-gigabit and terabit R&D and wireline applications. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $294 million was flat versus a strong prior year compare. 
Solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the Americas and Europe. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in aerospace, defense and government, and the funnel remains strong for this end market. 
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated first quarter revenue of $372 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 31%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $182 million or 15% of revenue. Under the new share repurchase authorization announced in November of last year, we have acquired 1.13 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $182.19 for a total consideration of $206 million. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Demand remains strong for Keysight Solutions. However, supply constraints continue to moderate shipments. We expect second quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.290 billion to $1.310 billion and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.69 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 183 million shares. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we continue to expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7% while delivering 12% earnings growth. The raised EPS growth expectation reflects ours higher-than-expected Q1 earnings. 
In closing, the demand environment remains strong across our end markets and regions. With a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence, we are confident in our ability to meet our customer commitments and continue to deliver profitable above-market growth going forward. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

Specific to 5G, I think as I've stated before, we see near-term and medium-term catalysts that remain intact. If you look at it more near term, I would say, the ongoing global deployments that are scaling continue to drive demand in both R&D and manufacturing offerings. Specific to R&D, the Release 16 is really aimed at some of these new use cases with industrial applications and private networks in particular. Longer term, we remain bullish about millimeter wave and its adoption.
But in the medium term, the applications such as O-RAN are really growing the ecosystem of opportunities for us. in We just added over 100 new customers into our 5G platform in the most recent quarter. So very strong growth in the 5G applications for sure across both R&D and manufacturing and deployments and across the globe. So broad strength."

But the industry is also looking at what's the next wave of innovations, 6G on the wireless side. On the wireline side, terabit Ethernet is definitely an area where there's a lot of advanced research happening both on the wireless and wireline side. And Keysight, given our strong strategy of focus on building out the workflow for the communication cycle system, we're engaged in those advanced research discussions with multiple consortiums around the globe. And we've already started to get some early research business, which positions us for continued leadership over time."

This is, I think, the fourth quarter where you've expanded orders by more than 20% year-on-year. And when we look at the revenue outlook, obviously, that's materially below that. How should we think about it? Sort of is there more of unwind into the revenue or some realization of revenue or supply chain eases? Or is that -- is the order strength driven by a lot of early ordering or sort of long-dated orders? 
And in particular, if I can just ask one follow-up there. If -- how are we thinking about the same divergence between ADG and [ UC ] remaining flat for the last couple of quarters versus what you talked about in terms of strong order increase?"

So I think, first of all, I would say that the order growth, we believe, is indicative of the highly -- or the very strong demand environment we're seeing across the wide range of end markets, right? Within EISG, the semi auto market is very strong. The surge in manufacturing driving strength in general electronics. In the communications side, we're seeing great strength in 5G, as Satish just talked about, but also 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit on the networking side as well. And so very strong demand, and I think that's reflected in the order strength and in the growth you're seeing in orders.
On the revenue side, obviously, we continue to work through significant supply chain challenges. Our revenue is significantly constrained by the supply environment, and we're working through that. We have said on prior calls that we have seen lead times to our customers extend by about a month, and that month extension has really happened over the course of the last 2 years, really from the onset of COVID back in the spring of 2020. And I think the good news is that our customers have responded to that and are placing orders with Keysight a bit earlier so that they can still get product delivery on a time line that meets their needs. And I think we're doing a good job getting product into the hands of our customers on those time lines.
I think if you turn the lens forward, what you're going to see as the supply chain situation starts to improve, and we hope to see that beginning in the second half. But certainly, we expect to see some supply chain constraints through 2023, that our lead times will slowly start to migrate back in over a number of quarters. And similarly, our customers will once again readjust their ordering patterns to, again, align them with their own need for delivery.
Why don't I turn it back to Mark for some more comments on the demand side."

We also saw some early orders from semiconductor, which is typical. They have longer-term horizons, and we work with them in that fashion.
But the headline is our strong double-digit order growth. It was not an outcome of advanced purchases. And on the plus side, as Neil mentioned, we are now working with customers much earlier than we may have done in the past. We've always had deep relationships. But the outcome is we're getting better visibility to their forecast and their forward-looking plans, which I think will sustain for the long term."

I certainly think that as we get to the maturity with some of these technologies, the capacities will meet certain levels so we can see some of that begin to -- the growth begin to turn more to more long-term models that we've been seeing. But as we do so, we look forward to the next generation.

But look at the convergence in semiconductors and how more and more functions are being integrated into semiconductors and everything, whether you're talking about IoT or any of these other apps that we talk about, that demand we're going to see for a long period of time.
Look at automotive. We're not talking about things that will grow for a year or 2. Even though we talk about 19% and 15% of the total market being effectively EV in Europe and Asia, I mean, that's going to go up close to 100%.

Obviously, the constraints in the supply chain are broad, and I think you're hearing this across multiple industries as well, and we feel that. But with regard to the actions that we're taking to maximize, those include internal value engineering activities to find multiple sources for products, looking for alternate sourcing from the open markets. We have strong collaborations with a number of our strategic silicon or semiconductor suppliers and our customers, too. So when we look at the end-markets demand for Keysight products around 5G, automotive and semiconductor, we have strong engagements with customers and our supply chain so that we're able to coordinate this.
And at this point, as Neil mentioned earlier, that we're able to meet our customers' needs a very high percentage of the time. So we're very confident on our ability to process this backlog and convert it into revenue in future quarters. And pending upside from any improvement in the supply chain, we could further accelerate."

At a",325,"Yes. So I'd say that when we look at the automotive market, as Ron referenced in his script that we see a real inflection in adoption of EV and then a subsequent simultaneous adoption for AV as well, really driving the needs of the automotive market. At a simplistic level, we see a number of new lab activities that are starting in R&D across the globe, where automotive customers traditionally outsourced a lot of the R&D work, but they are now starting to build new facilities for research and development, hiring of electrical engineering talent, hiring of software talent is increasing, and that's really reflected in our R&D business that continues to grow strongly. We see this continuing to be a secular growth driver for us.
With regard to the manufacturing expansion, as you saw the number of EV starts to increase, our manufacturing business in this market also continues to grow. So at this point, I would say the opportunities for us -- for Keysight is to expand with a number of new lab starts as the hiring of electrical engineers growth in the automotive market will continue to grow. 
But we also have the opportunity to increase our solutions content in display. And some of the acquisitions that we have made enables us to play strongly into the battery test and charging arena. And so we're positioning ourselves there, along with the C-V2X stack that we've invested in with our 5G portfolio that allows us to get into this marketplace.
In the most recent quarter, we've basically announced at CES the radar scene emulator solution, which again, got a lot of active interest from our customers. So automotive continues to be the area of investment for us. And it's really hard to predict the growth rate, but we're quite pleased with the very strong results we're seeing so far.
I'll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the funnel."

I am humbled and honored to be Keysight's CEO and excited about the future. I would like to thank Ron Nersesian for his visionary leadership of the company, which has provided us a solid foundation to build on. Over the last decade, I've had the honor of working closely with Ron and benefited greatly from his experience in many different roles I've held since joining the company 16 years ago. This is a great time to be at Keysight as we remain focused on our core purpose of accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world.
Keysight delivered exceptional results in quarter 2, driven by strong execution and broad-based demand across the business. The team focused on innovating and solving customers' design and test challenges while successfully navigating the ongoing supply chain and geopolitical challenges.
I will focus my comments today on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered record quarter 2 orders, capitalizing on the robust end-market demand for Keysight's high-value differentiated solutions. Our focus on delivering first-to-market solutions is enabling us to uncover new emerging applications, adding to our momentum. Second, we achieved record revenue, strong operating margin performance, resulting in record earnings per share, which grew 27%, demonstrating the durability and resilience of our business. Third, we are raising our outlook for the year based on our strong performance in the first half and continued momentum. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 8% and earnings per share growth in the range of 14% to 15% for the fiscal year.
Let's now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Second quarter orders grew 9% to $1.46 billion and outpaced revenue, which grew 11% to a new record of $1.35 billion and was $41 million above the high end of our guidance. We achieved gross margins of 65%, operating margin of 29% and record EPS of $1.83, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.14. Also with the ongoing equity market volatility, we again capitalized on the opportunity to accelerate share repurchases. These results are a reflection of our strong portfolio and our global team's application of the Keysight leadership model, which enables us to deliver consistent value to all stakeholders. We delivered these results despite many headwinds, including geopolitical challenges, inflationary pressures and continued supply chain disruptions.
We continue to advance our software-centric solution strategy. As the rapid pace of technology accelerates, our customers across end markets are seeking deeper engagements earlier in the design cycle and are adopting our software solutions. The capabilities of our PathWave software platform facilitate continuous stream of releases that matches the innovation cadence of our customers. This enables us to secure enterprise agreements with market leaders for high-value R&D solutions. Orders for software and value-added services like Keysight Care again grew double digits as we continue to grow recurring revenue this quarter.
Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group delivered record second quarter orders and an all-time record revenue. Within CSG, commercial communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue with double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter. Ongoing innovation and investments in our end markets spanning both the wireless and wireline segments remained strong, driven by adoption of 5G, 400 gig, 800 gig and terabit and optical technologies.
In wireless, the increase in the number of 5G device types continues to drive test and certification requirements. With our leading solutions portfolio, we expect to benefit from the continued investment in the evolution of 5G standards, including stand-alone 5G, Release 16 and beyond. In quarter 2, Keysight announced collaborations with leading companies such as NTT DOCOMO, Telefonica and Analog Devices to enable a wide range of 5G applications, including O-RAN, which continues to gain momentum.
In wireline, we're enabling the digital transformation driven by cloud computing and telecom stack virtualization through our end-to-end solutions. We recently launched the industry's first 800-gig solution to enable data center design workflows for ultra-high data rates and energy efficiency.
Aerospace defense and government achieved record Q2 revenue, driven by double-digit growth in Americas and strength in signal monitoring, cyber and space and satellite solutions as well as 5G and 6G applications. Complex scenario emulations continue to drive the need for modeling and digital twin solutions with increasing software content. Our leading network analyzer platform and phased array test solutions enable increasingly complex satellite communication design and test requirements.
Increasing defense budgets in the U.S. and Europe are expected to provide support for higher spend going forward. CSG is well positioned to capitalize on growth by enabling innovation in our end markets through our broad and synergistic portfolio, including wireline, wireless, cybersecurity, satellite and space solutions.
The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by automotive and semiconductor solutions. In automotive, all-time record revenue was driven by strong demand for our expanding portfolio of EV and AV applications. Keysight is capitalizing on strategic investments in the automotive and energy space, providing industry-first solutions that support new capabilities and use cases, such as our recently launched protocol test solution for in-vehicle networking. During the quarter, we secured EV wins with major OEMs across all regions.
In addition, we're excited by the recognition of our new RADAR can emulator solution, including the 2022 Tech.80Europe award. We saw strong demand for our semiconductor solutions, which delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Investments in advanced semiconductor technologies, along with capacity expansion for existing nodes, remain robust.
Over the next 3 to 5 years, we see solid customer R&D road maps for ICs for a broader set of applications. As an example, in Q2, we sold our first on-wafer silicon photonics parametric test solution to a major semiconductor fab to develop and manufacture next-generation data center transceivers. We believe this trend represents long-term opportunities for Keysight's R&D solutions portfolio.
Our general electronics business achieved all-time record revenue as investments continued in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health and advanced research. We're seeing active investments globally in fundamental research in terahertz and quantum technologies. For example, we recently announced a collaboration with National Research Foundation of Singapore's quantum engineering program to accelerate research and development and education in quantum technologies. The strength of our general electronics business reflects the broad nature of applications for our solutions.
Before I wrap, I'd like to acknowledge and thank our more than 14,000 employees worldwide for their commitment to our customers around the globe and for their passion in delivering market-leading solutions. I'm proud to share that Keysight was recently named as one of Fortune 100's best companies to work for in 2022. This is a recognition of our inclusive and diverse culture exhibiting value for collaboration, high performance and innovation.
Our culture also places high value on corporate social responsibility. We recently released our 2021 CSR report, highlighting our progress in environmental, social and governance efforts worldwide and announcing new goals to track through '22 and into '23. I believe Keysight has a bright future ahead. I look forward to working with the team to execute our strategy and continue to deliver greater value for our customers, shareholders and employees.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Neil?"

Our performance this quarter once again demonstrated the resilience of our business. We delivered on our commitments and exceeded expectations as we powered through multiple challenges and new headwinds in the quarter.
In the second quarter of 2022, we delivered revenue of $1.351 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 11% or 12% on a core basis. We generated $1.458 billion in orders, up 9% or 11% on a core basis. During the quarter, we suspended our operations in Russia and canceled our entire backlog of Russian orders. Core growth adjusted for Russia was 13%. Demand again outpaced supply, and we ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in backlog.
Turning to our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 65% and operating expenses of $489 million, resulting in an operating margin of 29%. The strength of our results highlights the resiliency of our business and our team's ability to execute despite significant supply, cost and currency headwinds within the quarter. We achieved net income of $334 million and delivered $1.83 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 183 million shares.
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $963 million, up 10% or 11% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%. Within CSG, commercial communications generated revenue of $672 million, up 11% with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas, driven by strong demand for 5G device and component development as well as network test, O-RAN and terabit R&D. Aerospace defense and government revenue of $291 million grew 7%. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we reported solid growth in the Americas and Europe.
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated second quarter revenue of $388 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in automotive and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 62% and operating margin of 30%.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $298 million and free cash flow of $245 million or 18% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.9 million shares at an average price per share of $153.78 for a total consideration of $289 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased approximately 3 million shares for a total consideration of $495 million.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. The demand environment remains strong for Keysight solutions. As in recent quarters, our revenues continue to be constrained by tight supply conditions. However, we have demonstrated our ability to effectively navigate through this environment, and we remain confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. We expect third quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.330 billion to $1.350 billion and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.74 to $1.80 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 181 million shares.
We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 8%, which given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar now includes a 2-point year-over-year headwind from currency. We're also raising our earnings growth expectation to 14% to 15%. Despite quarter-to-quarter dynamics being difficult to predict, we have confidence in our raised expectations for the year.
In closing, we have a strong track record of execution. Our backlog is at an all-time high, and we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities across our diverse set of end markets.
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

As we've already stated, our revenue situation is still highly constrained by the supply environment. And we had significant outperformance in Q2 as we navigated the tight supply environment and did better than we expected. And so -- but what you can read into that is that a significant portion of our Q2 outperformance was shipment of orders that we had originally or going into the quarter had scheduled to be in Q3. And so that's great news, and we're pleased with that.
But that -- on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that can be a significant impact. I would say that the guidance reflects our best estimate as we see it at this point in time. This quarter-to-quarter perturbations can be very difficult to call in this environment. We certainly have the backlog to do better if -- depending on how incoming supply works.
And I think the point that we want everybody to focus on is that we are taking up the full year guidance significantly from 6% to 7% growth to approaching 8%. And that 8% growth, as you noted, has kind of new and significant FX headwinds. We saw a very significant strengthening of the dollar within our fiscal second quarter. We now have a 2-point year-over-year headwind in the second half that we're baking into account. And on the full year basis, we have a 1.5 points relative of FX. Just from November, when we put out the 6% to 7% guide to where we are today, saying approaching 8%, there's a new 1.5% FX headwind baked into that. And so we feel very good about the situation as it currently sits and are pleased to be raising estimates for the year."

So it's a testament to the broad strength and demand of our business across multiple industries and segments. In Asia, in particular, we saw strong continued demand and growth in automotive and semi, 400 gig, 800 gig, terabit, all of those things. So very stable there.
In Europe, we did see an impact, obviously, from the Russia cancellations. So we had double-digit order growth in all regions except for Europe. But again, the demand continues. We saw a robust demand for our semiconductor solutions, again, automotive, our commercial comms across the European region. So the broad interactions and dynamics with our customers so far remain pretty much unchanged."

We're engaging with the OEMs globally. We've had some successes, as I reported, in this quarter. And we're also working with the entire ecosystem with the Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers, the semiconductor houses that feed the auto and the test labs that are just growing across the world. So it's a growing ecosystem. We're expanding our portfolio into EV, particularly around battery test, charging test, in-vehicle network testing as an example.

So prior -- in prior quarters, we've talked about an expectation or thinking that we would see some material improvement in the supply chain situation in the second half of this year. To this point, we have not seen that. And in fact, I think if you look broader across the tech industry, there's an argument that things got incrementally worse in Q2 are more challenging, driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as the COVID shutdowns in China even though those COVID shutdowns don't impact us directly.
I think for us, we look at the items that we can control, our own capacity both for finished goods as well as for the subcomponents that come out of our fab and technology centers that feed our instrumentation. We look at our relationships with our suppliers, some of the engineering efforts that we have to quantify -- or to qualify new parts or secondary sources to open up new sources of supply. Those things are paying dividends for us and have contributed to the revenue performance that we've been able to deliver.
And so -- but as we look forward, and you asked specifically about the guide for the second half, we are still very much supply chain-constrained.

And it continues to move up the value chain with our customers. So over time, we would expect it to continue to be more in that direction.
Another area of focus for that group is also around advanced research. As I noted, we had some announcements with the Singapore -- with a university in Singapore around quantum. We also had a major win in terahertz research associated with that business.

But we saw a lot of new customers in growth from R&D solutions for digital health care. We've added nearly 500 new customers again in the quarter, which helps to diversify our base and represents this broad base of industries across multiple segments and so forth.
We saw strong demand continue across Asia with several new wins around the R&D solutions. And as Satish just mentioned, there have been some real bright spots around advanced research with our university.

I am humbled and honored to be Keysight's CEO and excited about the future. I would like to thank Ron Nersesian for his visionary leadership of the company, which has provided us a solid foundation to build on. Over the last decade, I've had the honor of working closely with Ron and benefited greatly from his experience in many different roles I've held since joining the company 16 years ago. This is a great time to be at Keysight as we remain focused on our core purpose of accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world. 
Keysight delivered exceptional results in quarter 2 driven by strong execution and broad-based demand across the business. The team focused on innovating and solving customers' design and test challenges while successfully navigating the ongoing supply chain and geopolitical challenges. 
I will focus my comments today on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered record quarter 2 orders, capitalizing on the robust end-market demand for Keysight's high-value, differentiated solutions. Our focus on delivering first-to-market solutions is enabling us to uncover new emerging applications, adding to our momentum. 
Second, we achieved record revenue, strong operating margin performance, resulting in record earnings per share, which grew 27%, demonstrating the durability and resilience of our business. 
Third, we are raising our outlook for the year based on our strong performance in the first half and continued momentum. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 8% and earnings per share growth in the range of 14% to 15% for the fiscal year. 
Let's now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Second quarter orders grew 9% to $1.46 billion and outpaced revenue, which grew 11% to a new record of $1.35 billion and was $41 million above the high end of our guidance. We achieved gross margins of 65%, operating margin of 29% and record EPS of $1.83, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.14. Also with the ongoing equity market volatility, we again capitalized on the opportunity to accelerate share repurchases. These results are a reflection of our strong portfolio and our global team's application of the Keysight leadership model, which enables us to deliver consistent value to all stakeholders. We delivered these results despite many headwinds, including geopolitical challenges, inflationary pressures and continued supply chain disruptions. 
We continue to advance our software-centric solution strategy as the rapid pace of technology accelerates, our customers across end markets are seeking deeper engagements earlier in the design cycle and are adopting our software solutions. The capabilities of our PathWave software platform facilitate continuous stream of releases that matches the innovation cadence of our customers. This enables us to secure enterprise agreements with market leaders for high-value R&D solutions. 
Orders for software and value-added services like KeysightCare again grew double digits as we continue to grow recurring revenue this quarter. 
Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group delivered record second quarter orders and an all-time record revenue. Within CSG, commercial communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue with double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter. Ongoing innovation and investments in our end markets spanning both the wireless and wireline segments remained strong, driven by adoption of 5G, 400 gig, 800 gig and terabit and optical technologies. 
In wireless, the increase in the number of 5G device types continues to drive test and certification requirements. With our leading solutions portfolio, we expect to benefit from the continued investment in the evolution of 5G standards, including stand-alone 5G, Release 16 and beyond. In quarter 2, Keysight announced collaborations with leading companies such as NTT DOCOMO, Telefonica and Analog Devices to enable a wide range of 5G applications, including O-RAN, which continues to gain momentum. 
In wireline, we're enabling the digital transformation driven by cloud computing and telecom stack virtualization through our end-to-end solutions. We recently launched the industry's first 800-gig solution to enable data center design workflows for ultra-high data rates and energy efficiency. 
Aerospace, defense and government achieved record Q2 revenue driven by double-digit growth in Americas and strength in signal monitoring, cyber and space and satellite solutions as well as 5G and 6G applications. Complex scenario emulations continue to drive the need for modeling and digital twin solutions with increasing software content. Our leading network analyzer platform and phased array test solutions enable increasingly complex satellite communication design and test requirements. 
Increasing defense budgets in the U.S. and Europe are expected to provide support for higher spend going forward. CSG is well positioned to capitalize on growth by enabling innovation in our end markets through our broad and synergistic portfolio, including wireline, wireless, cybersecurity, satellite and space solutions. 
The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by automotive and semiconductor solutions. In automotive, all-time record revenue was driven by strong demand for our expanding portfolio of EV and AV applications. Keysight is capitalizing on strategic investments in the automotive and energy space, providing industry-first solutions that support new capabilities and use cases, such as our recently launched protocol test solution for in-vehicle networking. During the quarter, we secured EV wins with major OEMs across all regions. 
In addition, we're excited by the recognition of our new radar's scene emulator solution, including the 2022 Tech.80 Europe award. We saw strong demand for our semiconductor solutions, which delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Investments in advanced semiconductor technologies, along with capacity expansion for existing nodes, remain robust. 
Over the next 3 to 5 years, we see solid customer R&D road maps for ICs for a broader set of applications. As an example, in Q2, we sold our first on-wafer silicon photonics parametric test solution to a major semiconductor fab to develop and manufacture next-generation data center transceivers. We believe this trend represents long-term opportunities for Keysight's R&D solutions portfolio. 
Our general electronics business achieved all-time record revenue as investments continued in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health and advanced research. We're seeing active investments globally in fundamental research in terahertz and quantum technologies. For example, we recently announced a collaboration with National Research Foundation of Singapore's quantum engineering program to accelerate research and development and education in quantum technologies. The strength of our general electronics business reflects the broad nature of applications for our solutions. 
Before I wrap, I'd like to acknowledge and thank our more than 14,000 employees worldwide for their commitment to our customers around the globe and for their passion in delivering market-leading solutions. I'm proud to share that Keysight was recently named as one of Fortune 100's best companies to work for in 2022. This is a recognition of our inclusive and diverse culture exhibiting value for collaboration, high performance and innovation. 
Our culture also places high value on corporate social responsibility. We recently released our 2021 CSR report, highlighting our progress in environmental, social and governance efforts worldwide and announcing new goals to track through '22 and into '23. I believe Keysight has a bright future ahead. I look forward to working with the team to execute our strategy and continue to deliver greater value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Neil?"

We generated $1.458 billion in orders, up 9% or 11% on a core basis. During the quarter, we suspended our operations in Russia and canceled our entire backlog of Russian orders. Core growth adjusted for Russia was 13%. Demand again outpaced supply, and we ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in backlog.
Turning to our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 65% and operating expenses of $489 million, resulting in an operating margin of 29%. The strength of our results highlights the resiliency of our business and our team's ability to execute despite significant supply, cost and currency headwinds within the quarter.

Within CSG, commercial communications generated revenue of $672 million, up 11% with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas driven by strong demand for 5G device and component development as well as network test, O-RAN and terabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $291 million grew 7%. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we reported solid growth in the Americas and Europe.
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated second quarter revenue of $388 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in automotive and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 62% and operating margin of 30%.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $298 million and free cash flow of $245 million or 18% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.9 million shares at an average price per share of $153.78 for a total consideration of $289 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased approximately 3 million shares for a total consideration of $495 million.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. The demand environment remains strong for Keysight solutions. As in recent quarters, our revenues continue to be constrained by tight supply conditions. However, we have demonstrated our ability to effectively navigate through this environment, and we remain confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. We expect third quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.330 billion to $1.350 billion and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.74 to $1.80 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 181 million shares.
We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 8%, which given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar now includes a 2-point year-over-year headwind from currency. We're also raising our earnings growth expectation to 14% to 15%. Despite quarter-to-quarter dynamics being difficult to predict, we have confidence in our raised expectations for the year.
In closing, we have a strong track record of execution. Our backlog is at an all-time high, and we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities across our diverse set of end markets.
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

And while the supplier environment remains, in our view, pretty challenging, but we have found a way to find more upside. I would say that the demand from our customers is robust. And our customers want the products as quickly as we can make them, and we're shipping them as quickly as we can. So the supply situation does remain challenging to the point you made, but we've been able to find a way around it. Thank you."

As we've already stated, our revenue situation is still highly constrained by the supply environment. And we had significant outperformance in Q2 as we navigated the tight supply environment and did better than we expected. And so -- but what you can read into that is that a significant portion of our Q2 outperformance was shipment of orders that we had originally or going into the quarter had scheduled to be in Q3. And so that's great news, and we're pleased with that. But that -- on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that can be a significant impact. 
I would say that the guidance reflects our best estimate as we see it at this point in time. This quarter-to-quarter perturbations can be very difficult to call in this environment. We certainly have the backlog to do better if -- depending on how incoming supply works. And I think the point that we want everybody to focus on is that we are taking up the full year guidance significantly from 6% to 7% growth to approaching 8%. And that 8% growth, as you noted, has kind of new and significant FX headwinds. We saw a very significant strengthening of the dollar within our fiscal second quarter. We now have a 2-point year-over-year headwind in the second half that we're baking into account. And on the full year basis, we have a 1.5 points relative of FX. Just from November, when we put out the 6% to 7% guide to where we are today, saying approaching 8%, there's a new 1.5% FX headwind baked into that. And so we feel very good about the situation as it currently sits and are pleased to be raising estimates for the year."

So it's a testament to the broad strength and demand of our business across multiple industries and segments. In Asia, in particular, we saw strong continued demand and growth in automotive and semi, 400 gig, 800 gig, terabit, all of those things. So very stable there.
In Europe, we did see an impact, obviously, from the Russia cancellations. So we had double-digit order growth in all regions except for Europe. But again, the demand continues. We saw a robust demand for our semiconductor solutions, again, automotive, our commercial comms across the European region.

To this point, we have not seen that. And in fact, I think if you look broader across the tech industry, there's an argument that things got incrementally worse in Q2, are more challenging, driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as the COVID shutdowns in China even though those COVID shutdowns don't impact us directly.
I think for us, we look at the items that we can control, our own capacity both for finished goods as well as for the subcomponents that come out of our fab and technology centers that feed our instrumentation. We look at our relationships with our suppliers, some of the engineering efforts that we have to quantify -- or to qualify new parts or secondary sources to open up new sources of supply. Those things are paying dividends for us and have contributed to the revenue performance that we've been able to deliver.
And so -- but as we look forward, and you asked specifically about the guide for the second half, we are still very much supply chain-constrained.

Silicon photonics is one of the technologies that is seen as a possible solution to the high-throughput demands of a data center and cloud environment. So it's another area where Keysight is opening up a new franchise, which will continue to position us for future growth."

I think the prepared remarks disclosed it to be $2.4 billion, which is roughly 45% of the current year revenue guide, and obviously, well above where it's been historically. So based on guidance and the commentary around supply chain, it certainly does not sound like this backlog will be released to any capacity this year. So I guess my question is, how should we think about the cadence of this backlog release? Any color on the duration or impact? Like will we see it come through? Or will it just be kind of tapered in over many, many quarters? Any color there is helpful."

We do not expect that we're going to reduce backlog at all this year. In fact, we would estimate in the current supply environment, which we expect to be challenging through the remainder of our fiscal year, that we're going to continue to add to backlog. I think how the backlog eventually winds its way from where -- from its current elevated levels to a more normalized level is really a function of how the broader supply chain situation resolves itself, right? And it's only educated guesses at this point because the honest answer is we don't know what that's going to look like. But I'm not expecting that there's going to be a step-function improvement across the supply chain that allows us to flush backlog over a 1- or 2-quarter period. I think it's going to be much more a function of us slowly bringing our quote and lead times on products down and slowly working that -- the backlog down to more normalized levels."

Another area of focus for that group is also around advanced research. As I noted, we had some announcements with the Singapore -- with a university in Singapore around quantum.

We saw strong demand continue across Asia with several new wins around the R&D solutions.

Keysight Technologies delivered another exceptional quarter with both revenue and EPS, or earnings per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our outperformance reflects the effectiveness of our strategy, outstanding execution by our teams around the world, and the strength of our operating model. Keysight's deep customer engagements with industry leaders and high-value differentiated solutions continue to drive broad-based demand across key technology megatrends. 
I will focus my comments today on 3 key headlines. First, outstanding execution by the Keysight teams around the world, resulted in an all-time record revenue and earnings per share as we saw some supply constraints ease as the quarter progressed. Second, we saw strong order growth and sustained demand across all end markets and regions. Third, we're once again raising our full year outlook. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 9% and earnings per share growth of approximately 20% for the full fiscal year. 
Let's now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Third quarter orders grew 12% to $1.46 billion and outpaced record revenue, which grew 10% to $1.38 billion. Record EPS of $2.01, grew 31%. Orders and revenue growth in both business segments and across all regions is evidence of our ability to deliver value for customers as we manage macro and supply dynamics. Software revenue achieved an all-time high, outpacing total Keysight revenue growth, expanding our recurring revenue profile to further strengthen the durability of our business. Our software-centric solution strategy is a key differentiator in rapidly evolving design systems emulation and modeling environments. We recently introduced [ Pathwave Advanced Design ] system 2023 to address growing complexity in ultra-high frequency designs. We also announced that Keysight's Open RAN solutions are moving to cloud-based deployment to support our customers' needs as networks evolve to more software-enabled virtualized architectures. 
Turning to our business segments. The Communications Solutions Group delivered all-time record revenue and record third quarter orders. Commercial Communications achieved record revenue with growth across all industry segments and regions. Innovation dynamics across the communication cycle system remains strong, driving demand Keysight's comprehensive end-to-end portfolio for both the wireless and wireline ecosystems. In wireless, 5G continues to represent an innovation-rich environment for the industry. Our differentiated software-centric solutions enable customers to address the growing complexity of use cases, frequency band combinations, real-world connectivity and mobility challenges. We continue to evolve our 5G platform to meet the requirements of emerging applications and newer versions of the standards. 
In collaboration with Intel, Radisys, Vodafone and Wind River, we recently showcased an industry-first demonstration, deploying Keysights or/and solutions to help reduce power consumption in a multi-vendor Open RAN network. AI Link, a provider of industrial IoT offerings, used Keysight solutions for end-to-end performance validation of cloud-native radio access network infrastructure. In wireline, we continue to see strong demand for 400 gig, 800 gig and photonics applications. We recently collaborated with Nokia to demonstrate the first public 800-gig interoperability test, validating the robustness of ultra-high data rates in telco networks and data center environments for the expected increase in AIML network workloads. 
Record Q3 orders in aerospace defense and government outpaced revenue, which grew 1% on a core basis versus a strong growth quarter last year. Budget appropriations began to flow as reflected in prime contractor spending in the U.S., while 5G investments continued to grow to address new use cases such as RADAR and 5G coexistence. We also saw strong strength in satellite and space, including new applications for nonterrestrial networks. Over the next several years, we expect this market will benefit from elevated investments in technology modernization. The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the eighth consecutive quarter, with momentum from continued investments in next-generation technologies across automotive, industrial IoT and semiconductor end markets. 
In automotive, we are pleased with the continued broad adoption of our solutions portfolio, with the business nearly doubling over the past 2 years. Orders grew strong double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter, and we delivered all-time record revenue. Keysight's contributions to the advancement of EV and AV technologies, which include vehicle intelligence, connectivity, power and security are fueling momentum with leading car manufacturers, and helped us secure wins with giga factories around the world. Keysight's award-winning RADAR seen emulator is the only solution on the market to imitate realistic roadway scenarios in a lab environment, and was chosen by a leading U.S. auto manufacturer for testing and validation of autonomous drive systems. 
This quarter, we completed another tuck-in acquisition in the automotive space, further adding to our software technology and technical staff focused on vehicle-to-everything communications. We continue to invest as we target evolving opportunities in the future of transportation. 
In general electronics, we achieved double-digit order growth and all-time record revenue as investments continued in digital health, IoT and advanced research. In educational research, Keysight is partnering with global leaders such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to advance 6G technology. Together with [ SauceLabs ], our client business delivered artificial intelligence-driven testing of enterprise applications. The acceleration in our general electronics business reflects the broad scope of our portfolio of leading technology solutions. Record orders for our semiconductor solutions resulted in ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by capacity expansion of mature foundries to address pent-up demand in the market and investments in advanced processes. 
Keysight's PathWave design solutions expands our collaboration with major foundries beyond parametric wafer test into emerging applications like silicon photonics and next-generation design and simulation applications. While we continue to successfully execute our strategy, we recognize the near-term macroeconomic uncertainties. Keysight's sustained performance over time is evidence of the resilience and durability of our business. Our resilience is an outcome of enduring partnerships with market-leading customers with early engagement to develop software-centric solutions that enable them to solve their most critical development challenges and achieve their first-to-market goals. 
Durability is a product of our flexible operating model designed to quickly respond to variations in demand while investing in critical long-term priorities. These strengths give us confidence that we can navigate uncertainties, and continue to deliver superior results going forward. Of course, all of this is made possible by our talented people. steadfast execution by our teams, especially in a challenging environment is proof that our Keysight leadership model delivers results, empowering our inclusive and diverse culture which fosters collaboration, high performance and innovation. 
We recently released our first diversity, equity and inclusion report as we renewed and strengthened Keysight's long-standing commitment to DE&I and to being a great place to work for our global workforce of more than 14,000. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook."

We delivered strong third quarter results, successfully navigating ongoing supply chain and other headwinds. Third quarter 2022 revenue of $1.376 billion was $26 million above the high end of our guidance range, and",586,"Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results, successfully navigating ongoing supply chain and other headwinds. Third quarter 2022 revenue of $1.376 billion was $26 million above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 10% or 13% on a core basis. We generated $1.461 billion in orders, up 12% or 14% on a core basis, and we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in backlog. 
Turning to our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation and currency headwinds. Operating expenses were $480 million, resulting in an operating margin of 30%. We used a number of strategies to effectively navigate supply chain challenges, including product redesign, alternate sourcing and increased supplier and customer engagement. We achieved net income of $363 million and delivered $2.01 in earnings per share, which was $0.21 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 181 million shares. 
Despite significant currency headwinds on the top line, we saw negligible FX impact to earnings due to the meaningful natural hedge provided by our global footprint that has been supplemented by our financial hedging program. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $970 million, up 11% or 13% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and record operating margin of 30%. Within CSG, commercial communications generated record revenue of $694 million, up 17% or 19% on a core basis, driven by 5G, O-RAN, 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit and high-speed digital applications. Aerospace and defense and government revenue of $276 million was down 2%, and up 1% on a core basis. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we continue to expect increasing defense budgets in the U.S., Europe and Japan to provide support for higher spending going forward. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated third quarter revenue of $406 million, up 10% or 13% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth across all end markets and regions. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 31%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $192 million or 14% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.6 million shares at an average price per share of $139.46 for a total consideration of $228 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for a total consideration of $723 million. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Demand remains strong for Keysight solutions. Our funnel is near historic high levels, and we exit the quarter with a record backlog. We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 9% or 11% on a core basis with EPS in the range of $7.43 and to $7.49, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.38 billion to $1.4 billion, with earnings per share in the range of $1.94 to $2, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. 
In closing, Keysight's resilient business, consistent execution and flexible cost structure give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the long-term secular growth trends and deliver above-market profitable growth in 2023 and beyond. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

How much is automotive for you? What has kind of been growing? And importantly, is there like long-term visibility? Are you in that -- in the production side of things also or just only in the R&D traditionally, I think about you more as R&D, but it seems like you're kind of a little bit more into production or long life on automotive?

As you noted, this is one of the new expansion opportunities that we're incredibly excited about, and we're continuing to build momentum. And as you saw emerging from the pandemic, this big acceleration into EV and AV has just gotten started. And from a manufacturing perspective, yes, we have some exposure to it, but it is this proliferation of electronics content that's causing automakers to ramp up production as supply becomes lesser and lesser of an issue over time. So it's all about testing their EV capabilities in the manufacturing environment. So we have some exposure to that. 
But we're very excited by this big trend we see that's going to play out over the next 10 years where [indiscernible] makers are going to increasingly invest in organic R&D capabilities needed to differentiate their platform over others. And that involves software and hardware, and it's a great fit for the broad array of tools that we offer to every electrical engineer in the planet that we're now selling into the automakers. But equally, the growing emphasis we have put on -- growing our footprint in EV. As an example, this quarter, we had some design wins with some giga factories that are coming up just getting started in the RADAR [indiscernible] solution, which really allows you to take a car, turn on all the sensors and really see how we behave in the real world, very unique solution offering. And we had a design win with a major North American car manufacturer. So just getting started, very excited about the opportunity and strong double-digit growth in orders this quarter."

I'll say on the supply chain front, I did reference that we're very pleased with the execution. It's been now 3 or 4 quarters since we put the program in place to build out our capabilities to second source, extend our partnerships with suppliers more tighter and ongoing-ly engaged with our customers on lead time reduction activities. So those have progressed very nicely. And as the quarter progressed, we saw some of the constraints get better as the quarter progressed, which resulted in the upside that we were able to generate in revenue, and delivered a very strong record revenue this quarter. 
I would say, on the macro supply situation, it still remains challenging. It is a tale of 2 worlds. On one hand, you have improved visibility and improved supply for general-purpose electronics parts, but highly precision electronics, analog components still appear to have constraints associated with them. But nevertheless, we are very pleased with our execution, and we're also confident about our guide, which is why we have actually taken up the guide for Q4, and also for the full year to be now 9%. So that's with regard to the supply situation. 
With regard to your second question on the long-term guide on targets. Yes, I mean, we're also very pleased with the progression -- ongoing progression that we see quarter-after-quarter towards those long-term targets we set, both for growth and profitability. And that was goals that we set for 2023. We're obviously executing very well towards those.

We added more than 90 new 5G customers again during Q3. We're seeing continued growth of O-RAN where we've been expanding our opportunities from device manufacturers to operators to test labs and et cetera. So wireless side, the demand remains strong and broad.

The other area that I'm very pleased with is the gross margin performance of the business in the backdrop of these inflationary pressures we're seeing, which, over time, as we have thought about the value we bring and continue to innovate with software and services we have more upside to continue to grow that margin profile over time. And so we're not done at 65%, which should give us further room for growth. 
And then when we look at the next-generation innovation drivers that we're engaged with our customers right now, we feel pretty confident about extending that runway of growth as well."

Our outperformance reflects t",1125,"Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Keysight Technologies delivered another exceptional quarter with both revenue and EPS, our earnings per share exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our outperformance reflects the effectiveness of our strategy, outstanding execution by our teams around the world, and the strength of our operating model. Keysight's deep customer engagements with industry leaders and high-value differentiated solutions continue to drive broad-based demand across key technology megatrends.  
I will focus my comments today on 3 key headlines. First, outstanding execution by the Keysight teams around the world, resulted in an all-time record revenue and earnings per share as we saw some supply constraints ease as the quarter progressed. Second, we saw strong order growth and sustained demand across all end markets and regions. Third, we're once again raising our full year outlook. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 9% and earnings per share growth of approximately 20% for the full fiscal year.  
Let's now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Third quarter orders grew 12% to $1.46 billion and outpaced record revenue, which grew 10% to $1.38 billion. Record EPS of $2.01, grew 31%. Orders and revenue growth in both business segments and across all regions is evidence of our ability to deliver value for customers as we manage macro and supply dynamics. Software revenue achieved an all-time high, outpacing total Keysight revenue growth, expanding our recurring revenue profile to further strengthen the durability of our business. Our software-centric solution strategy is a key differentiator in rapidly evolving design, systems emulation and modeling environments. We recently introduced PathWave Advanced Design System 2023 to address growing complexity in ultra-high frequency designs. We also announced that Keysight's Open RAN solutions are moving to cloud-based deployment to support our customers' needs as networks evolve to more software-enabled virtualized architectures.  
Turning to our business segments. The Communications Solutions Group delivered all-time record revenue and record third quarter orders. Commercial Communications achieved record revenue with growth across all industry segments and regions. Innovation dynamics across the Communications ecosystem remains strong, driving demand Keysight's comprehensive end-to-end portfolio for both the wireless and wireline ecosystems. In wireless, 5G continues to represent an innovation-rich environment for the industry. Our differentiated software-centric solutions enable customers to address the growing complexity of use cases, frequency band combinations, real-world connectivity and mobility challenges. We continue to evolve our 5G platform to meet the requirements of emerging applications and newer versions of the standards. 
In collaboration with, Intel, Radisys, Vodafone and Wind River, we recently showcased an industry-first demonstration, deploying Keysight's O-RAN and solutions to help reduce power consumption in a multi-vendor Open RAN network. AI-LINK, a provider of industrial IoT offerings, used Keysight solutions for end-to-end performance validation of cloud-native radio access network infrastructure. In wireline, we continue to see strong demand for 400 gig, 800 gig and photonics applications. We recently collaborated with Nokia to demonstrate the first public 800-gig interoperability test, validating the robustness of ultra-high data rates in telco networks and data center environments for the expected increase in AI, ML network workloads.  
Record Q3 orders in aerospace, defense and government outpaced revenue, which grew 1% on a core basis versus a strong growth quarter last year. Budget appropriations began to flow as reflected in prime contractor spending in the U.S., while 5G investments continued to grow to address new use cases such as RADAR and 5G coexistence. We also saw strong strength in satellite and space, including new applications for nonterrestrial networks. Over the next several years, we expect this market will benefit from elevated investments in technology modernization. 
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the eighth consecutive quarter, with momentum from continued investments in next-generation technologies across automotive, industrial IoT and semiconductor end markets. In automotive, we are pleased with the continued broad adoption of our solutions portfolio, with the business nearly doubling over the past 2 years. Orders grew strong double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter, and we delivered all-time record revenue. Keysight's contributions to the advancement of EV and AV technologies, which include vehicle intelligence, connectivity, power and security are fueling momentum with leading car manufacturers, and helped us secure wins with giga factories around the world. Keysight's award-winning Radar Scene Emulator is the only solution on the market to imitate realistic roadway scenarios in a lab environment, and was chosen by a leading U.S. auto manufacturer for testing and validation of autonomous drive systems.  
This quarter, we completed another tuck-in acquisition in the automotive space, further adding to our software technology and technical staff focused on vehicle-to-everything communications. We continue to invest as we target evolving opportunities in the future of transportation.  
In general electronics, we achieved double-digit order growth and all-time record revenue as investments continued in digital health, IoT and advanced research. In educational research, Keysight is partnering with global leaders such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to advance 6G technology. Together with Sauce Labs, our Eggplant business delivered artificial intelligence-driven testing of enterprise applications. The acceleration in our general electronics business reflects the broad scope of our portfolio of leading technology solutions. Record orders for our semiconductor solutions resulted in ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by capacity expansion of mature foundries to address pent-up demand in the market and investments in advanced processes. 
Keysight's PathWave design solutions expands our collaboration with major foundries beyond parametric wafer test into emerging applications like silicon photonics and next-generation design and simulation applications. While we continue to successfully execute our strategy, we recognize the near-term macroeconomic uncertainties. Keysight's sustained performance over time is evidence of the resilience and durability of our business. Our resilience is an outcome of enduring partnerships with market-leading customers with early engagement to develop software-centric solutions that enable them to solve their most critical development challenges and achieve their first-to-market goals.
Durability is a product of our flexible operating model designed to quickly respond to variations in demand while investing in critical long-term priorities. These strengths give us confidence that we can navigate uncertainties, and continue to deliver superior results going forward. Of course, all of this is made possible by our talented people. steadfast execution by our teams, especially in a challenging environment is proof that our Keysight leadership model delivers results, empowering our inclusive and diverse culture which fosters collaboration, high performance and innovation. We recently released our first diversity, equity and inclusion report as we renewed and strengthened Keysight's long-standing commitment to DE&I and to being a great place to work for our global workforce of more than 14,000.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook."

We delivered strong third quarter results, successfully navigating ongoing supply chain and other headwinds. Third quarter 2022 revenue of $1.376 billion was $26 million above the high end of our guidance range, and",586,"Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results, successfully navigating ongoing supply chain and other headwinds. Third quarter 2022 revenue of $1.376 billion was $26 million above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 10% or 13% on a core basis. We generated $1.461 billion in orders, up 12% or 14% on a core basis, and we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in backlog.  
Turning to our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation and currency headwinds. Operating expenses were $480 million, resulting in an operating margin of 30%. We used a number of strategies to effectively navigate supply chain challenges, including product redesign, alternate sourcing and increased supplier and customer engagement. We achieved net income of $363 million and delivered $2.01 in earnings per share, which was $0.21 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 181 million shares. Despite significant currency headwinds on the top line, we saw negligible FX impact to earnings due to the meaningful natural hedge provided by our global footprint that has been supplemented by our financial hedging program.
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $970 million, up 11% or 13% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and record operating margin of 30%. Within CSG, commercial communications generated record revenue of $694 million, up 17% or 19% on a core basis, driven by 5G, O-RAN, 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit and high-speed digital applications. Aerospace and defense and government revenue of $276 million was down 2% and up 1% on a core basis. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we continue to expect increasing defense budgets in the U.S., Europe and Japan to provide support for higher spending going forward.  
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated third quarter revenue of $406 million, up 10% or 13% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth across all end markets and regions. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 31%.  
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $192 million or 14% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.6 million shares at an average price per share of $139.46 for a total consideration of $228 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for a total consideration of $723 million.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Demand remains strong for Keysight solutions. Our funnel is near historic high levels, and we exit the quarter with a record backlog. We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 9% or 11% on a core basis with EPS in the range of $7.43 and to $7.49, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.38 billion to $1.4 billion, with earnings per share in the range of $1.94 to $2, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares.  
In closing, Keysight's resilient business, consistent execution and flexible cost structure give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the long-term secular growth trends and deliver above-market profitable growth in 2023 and beyond.  
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

As you noted, this is one of the new expansion opportunities that we're incredibly excited about, and we're continuing to build momentum. And as you saw emerging from the pandemic, this big acceleration into EV and AV has just gotten started. And from a manufacturing perspective, yes, we have some exposure to it, but it is this proliferation of electronics content that's causing automakers to ramp up production as supply becomes lesser and lesser of an issue over time. So it's all about testing their EV capabilities in the manufacturing environment. So we have some exposure to that.  
We're very excited by this big trend we see that's going to play out over the next 10 years where auto makers are going to increasingly invest in organic R&D capabilities needed to differentiate their platform over others. And that involves software and hardware, and it's a great fit for the broad array of tools that we offer to every electrical engineer in the planet that we're now selling into the automakers. But equally, the growing emphasis we have put on -- growing our footprint in EV. As an example, this quarter, we had some design wins with some giga factories that are coming up just getting started in the Radar Scene Emulator solution, which really allows you to take a car, turn on all the sensors and really see how we behave in the real world, very unique solution offering. And we had a design win with a major North American car manufacturer. So just getting started, very excited about the opportunity and strong double-digit growth in orders this quarter."

It's been now 3 or 4 quarters since we put the program in place to build out our capabilities to second source, extend our partnerships with suppliers more tighter and ongoingly engaged with our customers on lead time reduction activities. So those have progressed very nicely. And as the quarter progressed, we saw some of the constraints get better as the quarter progressed, which resulted in the upside that we were able to generate in revenue, and delivered a very strong record revenue this quarter.  
I would say, on the macro supply situation, it still remains challenging. It is a tale of 2 worlds. On one hand, you have improved visibility and improved supply for general-purpose electronics parts, but high-precision electronics, analog components still appear to have constraints associated with them. But nevertheless, we are very pleased with our execution, and we're also confident about our guide, which is why we have actually taken up the guide for Q4, and also for the full year to be now 9%. So that's with regard to the supply situation.  
With regard to your second question on the long-term guide on targets. Yes, I mean, we're also very pleased with the progression -- ongoing progression that we see quarter-after-quarter towards those long-term targets we set, both for growth and profitability. And that was goals that we set for 2023. We're obviously executing very well towards those.

You look at the backlog build, $2.5 billion roughly as we exit this quarter and then we have a whole quarter in front of us to exit the fiscal year. So we fully expect that the backlog will continue to grow, which gives us increased stability. And as the supply situation improves, that just converts into earnings power for the company. The other area that I'm very pleased with is the gross margin performance of the business in the backdrop of these inflationary pressures we're seeing, which, over time, as we have thought about the value we bring and continue to innovate with software and services we have more upside to continue to grow that margin profile over time. And so we're not done at 65%, which should give us further room for growth. And then when we look at the next-generation innovation drivers that we're engaged with our customers right now, we feel pretty confident about extending that runway of growth as well."

You saw earlier this month, or maybe this last week, the U.S. Congress just passed the CHIPS package that's all in front of us. That expansion is going to help additional business, fuel additional growth, to boost manufacturing in the U.S.

And the only way you do it is you have to have your assets on the cloud, and that's a critical component of how we deliver value through PathWave. The PathWave design franchise that we've had continues to grow. We've been able to convert majority of the customer base into recurring subscription-based contracts, and we're moving that franchise from just being able to simulate circuits to simulate circuits in complex environments. 
And that's a new area of emphasis that will continue to grow. And on our base instruments, it still remains a focus for us to add more capabilities, connect them to the cloud so that we make our customers more productive in their labs, and that's the focus for us moving forward.

Before we get into the quarter, I want to highlight our exceptional p",1198,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight reported strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and drove a strong finish to the year. 
Before we get into the quarter, I want to highlight our exceptional performance for fiscal year, which illustrates continued progress we're making in transforming the company to a software-centric solutions provider. We set new records for orders, which grew 12% to $6 billion, a new record for revenue, which was up 10%, and a new record for earnings per share, which increased 22%, all the while returning capital through $849 million in share repurchases or 89% of free cash flow. 
In addition, we continue to invest in next-generation technologies for long-term differentiation and see a high level of engagement and activity with our customers around their future needs. 
Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered an all-time record revenue and earnings per share in the fourth quarter ahead of expectations enabled by outstanding execution by Keysight teams who successfully navigated supply chain, geopolitical and macro dynamics. Second, we achieved record orders of $1.6 billion with steady bookings throughout the quarter and a book-to-bill of 1.09. While our customers' multiyear road maps remain unchanged, they are exercising more caution given the macro backdrop, which we anticipate will moderate demand in the near term. Third, as we enter fiscal '23, we remain confident in our ability to outperform the market based on the differentiation of our solutions, our strong R&D customer value proposition and the robust backlog position we have entering the year. And as we look longer term, the secular innovation trends in our end markets remain strong. 
Now let's take a deeper look at the strength of the fourth quarter. Record orders of $1.6 billion grew 9% on a core basis. Record revenue grew 15% on a core basis, with solid growth across all regions as Keysight team successfully navigated challenging dynamics. This resulted in record quarterly earnings of $2.14 per share. 
The strength and resiliency of our business model is due to our strategic efforts to diversify our industry exposure. This has been best exemplified in the growth of our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group and our ability to leverage our industry-leading first-to-market solutions to enable expansion across the broader communications ecosystem. 
EISG achieved its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Auto, semiconductor solutions and general electronics all achieved record quarterly revenue. For the year, both orders and revenues set new records as we capitalize on continued investments across all 3 EISG markets. 
In automotive, we're pleased with the continued adoption of our solutions portfolio as orders grew double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and exceeded $500 million this year. Automotive OEMs and their suppliers continue to focus on strategic new mobility investments, which drove key wins for Keysight. In addition, automotive-focused semiconductor companies continue to add capabilities to support EV and AV applications, which we view as a favorable long-term dynamic. 
We recently announced the Scienlab DC Emulator, which enables customers to accurately characterize high-voltage, high-power electric vehicle battery performance under varying real-world charging conditions. And Keysight's PathWave Lab's operation software won 2022 AutoTech Breakthrough Award for overall electric vehicle technology. 
In support of AV applications, silicon designers are exploring adoption of commercial standards such as MIPI for automotive and other surround sensor applications, including cameras and in-vehicle infotainment displays. We are now expanding our leading compliance test solutions to offer advanced verification and diagnostic capabilities for automotive designers. 
Turning to our semiconductor solutions business. Q4 was the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit order book and a record revenue quarter. We saw sustained demand for our wafer test solutions and precision positioning capabilities, which enable the realization of advanced process nodes. 
In addition, Keysight has continued to partner with industry leaders, Synopsys and Ansys, on RF and millimeter wave integrated circuit design flows built for today's wireless communication requirements, including 5G and 6G system-on-chips. Keysight received a Partner of the Year Award from TSMC for joint development design flows in RF and millimeter wave nodes. 
In general electronics, record orders grew double digits [indiscernible] order as demand remains strong and broad-based across industrial IoT and digital health as well as education and advanced research markets. 
Turning to Communication Solutions Group. The business delivered strong orders and record revenue. Annual orders and revenue were all-time highs despite geopolitical headwinds and delays in U.S. Defense budget appropriations. Commercial communications revenue grew 10% and 11% for the year, with growth across all regions. Investments across communications ecosystem continued throughout the year with sustained spending in next-generation wireless and wireline technologies. Ongoing investments in 5G standards, new spectrum growing deployments around the world and steady evolution from 400 gig to 800 gig to terabit Ethernet drove growth. We ended a record year for 5G orders as Keysight's market-leading solutions continue to provide industry with new capabilities needed for development of next-generation devices as well as wireless and wireline networks. 
Examples that highlight our portfolio's alignment with key industry priority include a recent partnership with IBM to integrate our Open RAN capabilities into their cloud automation tools to accelerate network deployments. We also completed the validation of our first 5G location-based service use case from Global Certification Forum by combining the testing of 5G new radio and global navigation satellite system technologies into a single platform. Lastly, in collaboration with key silicon and data center partners, we enabled the industry's first [ 2.6 ] terabit transmission and data center interconnect, leveraging our high-speed digital solutions. 
Aerospace, defense and government business revenue grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the year, setting a new record while navigating geopolitical headwinds. Steady investments in spectrum operations, cybersecurity and space and satellite drove demand. 5G continued to expand in aerospace and defense end markets, and we saw increasing investment in advanced research. Proposed increases in investment in the U.S. and allied countries for modernization of defense capabilities and new satellite and space applications position us well for future opportunities. 
As an integral part of our solution strategy, software and services order and revenue growth this year continued to outpace Keysight overall, which has driven our annual recurring revenue to approximately $1.2 billion. Software and services again represented just over 1/3 of Keysight's total revenue for the year. 
Keysight's focus on customer success and innovation is driving our development of first-to-market, high-value solutions. Our achievements over the years exemplify Keysight's collaborative culture and our talented workforce, and we are honored that Keysight has placed tenth on the Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology list for 2022. We believe our differentiated culture gives us a unique ability to recruit and develop capable talent and will be our sustaining competitive advantage. 
In conclusion, I would like to thank our employees for all their contributions, commitment and strong track record of execution. In the midst of an uncertain economic environment, we remain confident in the resilience of our business, the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility of our operating model. 
Now I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

While the supply chain situation improved within the quarter, it continues to moderate our near-term revenue expectations. 
Record orders of $1.570 billion increased 5% or 9% on a core basis, and we entered fiscal year 2023 with over $2.5 billion in backlog. 
Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 64%, which, as expected, was down 80 basis points sequentially due to inflationary pressures and increased shipments of lower-end instruments, enabled by the improving supply chain. Operating expenses of $494 million were well managed, and we generated operating margin of 30%. 
Net income was a record $386 million, and we achieved $2.14 in earnings per share, which was $0.14 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 180 million shares. 
Foreign exchange impact on our earnings was negligible, thanks to a full natural hedge provided by our global footprint, which was then supplemented by our financial hedging program. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $992 million, up 8% or 11% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 29%. Commercial communications generated revenue of $681 million in the fourth quarter, up 10%, driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, increasing O-RAN adoption and investment in 800 gigabit and 1.6 terabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $311 million, up 4%, driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $451 million, up 20% or 25% on a core basis, driven by strength across all markets. EISG reported gross margin of 60% and operating margin of 32%. 
Turning to our full year financial performance. Keysight delivered outstanding results in 2022 despite ongoing supply constraints, foreign exchange headwinds and incremental trade restrictions. FY '22 revenue totaled $5.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year or 12% on a core basis. Gross margin was flat at 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation. We invested $813 million in R&D, while operating margin improved 140 basis points to 29%. FY '22 non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $7.63 per share, up 22%. 
Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with more than $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $398 million and free cash flow of $340 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $959 million, representing 18% of revenue and [ 69% ] of non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $158.77 for a total consideration of $126 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 5.4 million shares at an average share price of $156.09 for a total consideration of $849 million or 89% of free cash flow. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We exit the year with record backlog and confidence in Keysight's ability to continue executing through near-term uncertainties. As a result, we expect first quarter 2023 revenue to be in the range of $1.360 billion to $1.380 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.87 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. 
A few modeling reminders as we enter the year. Our annual compensation cycle is administered in Q1. And in this current inflationary environment, we expect our second consecutive year of wage increases above our historic average. We are targeting FY '23 R&D investment at approximately [ 16% ] of revenue. Annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million, and we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '23. 
In closing, we recognize the uncertainty of the current macro environment, and we'll continue to be disciplined. Keysight's highly flexible cost structure, track record of execution, diverse end markets and long-term secular growth drivers give us confidence in our ability to outperform the market. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

And in consideration of this environment, pretty strong results and also a strong finish to the year. And as I stated, we saw a steady level of spend from a demand perspective through the quarter. All our regions from a sales perspective grew. So it was broad-based. 
And going into a little bit on the end market color, I would say 5G continues to remain strong. We grew our 5G orders double-digit, strength in R&D. And also with the inflections that we're seeing in deployments around some parts of the world, even some of the manufacturing spend there remains strong for us this quarter. 
And we did see pockets of weakness in the broad component ecosystem, and that was an area we obviously watch carefully, and that is related to the smartphone demand. And if you look at the cloud and data center markets in wireline, while some of the cloud -- direct cloud spend from cloud providers was pushed out -- service providers was pushed out, the broad spend to adopt 400 gig and 800 gig continues to remain strong. So they focus on R&D, and new innovations remain strong. 
Moving on to aerospace and defense business. Obviously, it was still a strong quarter for us, but we did not see the typical year-end surge that we would expect given the budget appropriations process. 
And then moving to EISG end markets. All of the markets remain strong, right? Automotive, we had strong double-digit growth as continued investments and inflection from EV and AV are playing out. Semiconductor is an area we watch carefully. But because of our exposure into the wafer stage equipment process and new node -- specifically new nodes, that remains strong. And lastly, the general electronics business, which typically gets -- part of its spend from PMI continued to remain strong from a demand perspective. 
So I would say we're doing well, and the customer activity with our customers and engagements remain strong and quite pleased with the -- with our quarter in this environment."

So as Satish said, our order level was steady throughout the quarter. So we're watching this, right? Because if customers are taking more time to make decisions, you would look for orders to slow down. They did not. As a matter of fact, October was very strong. It was a record October for us in terms of orders. So that's good. 
You've heard us talk about before the addition of new customers. We've added about 450 this quarter again for nearly 2,000 new customers across the whole year. So that creates more diversity and durability to our business, and I see that paying off. Our top 20 customers in the quarter were up strong double digits as well. So all of that continues to translate to the fact that we did not see an impact to our business because of the customers taking more time. And I think it also has to do with the fact that we are so biased toward R&D and design optimization. And as we've seen through other waves in the recent term where market slowed, the advanced technology development continues. 
So that's what we see, but we look around and we do see some macro uncertainty. And from my seat, what I see in terms of order or in terms of customer activities is very active customers. Our 6-month funnel continues to grow, but customers are taking more time to make ultimate CapEx decisions."

A year ago, in Q1, that was the first time in Keysight's history that we'd ever posted order growth moving from the end of Q4 into the first quarter of the new fiscal year. So we've got a tough compare from that perspective. 
In addition, as you all know, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen pretty significantly in the back half of this year. We estimate the FX headwind in our first quarter to be a full 5 percentage points. And so we've got a 5-point FX headwind. And we estimate another 2 to 3 points of headwind from the recent increase in China trade restrictions as well as the loss of our Russia business, which happened in the second quarter of last year. So those things combined give us a 7- to 8-point headwind just coming out of the gate here as we enter the first quarter."

I think at the highest level, we're at approximately 60% R&D today, 30% manufacturing and 10% deployments. So that's the sort of mix of the business. Clearly, we believe R&D secular, you look at some of the areas in R&D that we're focused on, that involve next-generation innovations such as with 5G and then 6G and automotive and digital health, so on and so forth. And it really gives us this diversity of applications that is -- gives us a resilience in this environment for sure. 
With regard to the software strategy, it, again, goes congruent with our with our go-to-market approach because we're here to enable innovations to happen faster. And the way we do that is by offering more software-centric solutions. So as we deploy more solutions to our customers, increasingly, that is in the form of growing software mix. And that goes, again, synergistic with our services strategy. So you look at our software and services revenue this year will end at 3% of the total mix, and our ARR, or annual recurring revenue, has reached a new high of $1.2 billion. And we'll continue to invest to grow those portions of the business and increase our resilience and durability over time as well."

I mean given some of the dynamics that Satish just talked about, increasing software services, recurring revenue, we have seen growth in our deferred revenue over the same 3-year period of time as well as our migration towards systems rather than tools, I think, will drive our ultimate backlog level when things normalize to be significantly higher than it was, say, pre-COVID in the 2018, 2019 time frame. And so I think we'll have to see how that plays out over time. 
I think again, we built -- you can do the math. We built well north of $1 billion of backlog over the course of the last 3 years as we've had this book-to-bill that I've mentioned of 1.09. And as our lead times come in, we're going to expect ordering patterns to adjust and lead times to pull in. 
I've said previously that there's probably 4 to 5 weeks' worth of kind of abnormal backlog as a result of a 4- to 5-week extension of lead times kind of on average would be a way to think about it."

And as we have continued to do that, our strategy has taken the form of not just [indiscernible] sales, but our focus on this life cycle value creation for our customers, but also value capture for Keysight. And that's the journey we've been on. 
Some of the more newer solutions such as in Open RAN that we've talked about where we are seeing considerable traction, software alone is nearing 40%, 50% of the total sale value, and with a lot bigger portion of it being in the recurring category as well. So we feel good about the continued traction we're seeing for our solutions. And as we continue to deploy the solution strategy over time, we will enter into new end market verticals. 
And as you've seen some examples I put out this latest earnings announcement, we've also had some successes in the automotive sector with deploying software and in the semiconductor as well with our design offerings. Mark may make some comments on the sales side."

The other thing that you can see is we are delivering solutions more and more through updates to our software. If you think about our 5G solutions going from Release 15 to Release 16 and 17, much of that is software updates that creates additional opportunities for upsell, cross-sell and, of course, recurring revenue as well. So there's -- and there's several elements of our go-to-market that we are deploying now to encourage that recurring growth and expansion of attachment upfront to our total solutions."

I think on the 5G front, I think as we have always stated, there are multiple catalysts. I think about 18 months ago, I said the first catalyst was the C-band deployments in the U.S. That's played out as we had hoped, and we have captured a lot of that spend. We are pleased with some action that's happening in Asia and India, parts of India that have made commitments to roll out 5G. So that's, again, opportunity for us that's playing out right now. But the second and the third part to this is the millimeter wave opportunity. There's still some complex challenges with millimeter wave that customers are trying to solve. That continues to be a longer-term R&D opportunity for us as that deployment has continued to push out anyway -- scale deployments anyway. And lastly, as 5G is deployed, operators are looking to further monetize by adding the SA versions and new applications such as Open RAN continue to be gain traction across the global ecosystem. And so the opportunity that we have in R&D continues to grow, and we're well positioned with the comprehensive offerings we have to address it. 
I also want to point out that we have a very diversified business. Yes, 5G gets a lot of attention, but we have secular trends in wireline evolutions, which we're well positioned to capitalize on based on the acquisitions of Ixia that we have made, and we continue to see traction there. Not to mention the newer additions to our go-to-market with automotive and with next-generation semiconductor nodes. So we run a diversified business, and I think that's a source of greater stability for us and -- over time. 
And the second part of the supply chain question that you asked is, at the beginning of last year, we took a series of actions to basically redesign our products to second source components, and we had a -- we've talked about it on earnings calls. And all those actions have really enabled us to do better than we expected every quarter. But as we think about the supply chain, I speak with a number of our semiconductor supply chain partners, and they're all putting actions in place to obviously increase capacity, but it still continues to be a constrained environment. We're not back to this pre-COVID sort of supply environment yet and might take all of '23 to get there from our best information right now."

We've had multiple rounds of price increases over the course of the last 12 to 18 months, and those are embedded in the backlog. Although I think you can see based on the fact that we have maintained margins over the course of fiscal '22, it's flat at 65%, which frankly, I think in this inflationary environment was a very strong result that we're basically keeping pace on a margin basis with what we're seeing in terms of increases. 
And so -- and right now, while on the one side, yes, we have these increases that are embedded in our backlog and will continue to yield dividends and revenue, it's not like the inflationary elements have stopped in the cost structure as well. I referenced, for example, that we are going to be doing our salary administration for next year here in our fiscal first quarter. And this will be our second consecutive year with salary increases that are materially above our historic averages. 
As to the volume question, given the nature of our business where we're selling instruments that literally cost, in some cases, hundreds of dollars and, in other cases, cost [ $1 million ], that's a very difficult question to answer.

We see it in terms of inventory, at least inventory via the prices that we're paying [ for parts ]. We see it money tied up in terms of commitments to buy future inventory where we paid in advance for future delivery -- has been a use of working capital that, frankly, is new over the course of the last 12 months. And then frankly, the supply chain situation has significantly impacted the linearity of our revenue within the quarter.  You can imagine when you move from more of a just-in-time environment where you're just building and shipping and building and shipping, we're doing a lot more build to a certain stage, wait for parts, finish and ship. And so our revenue is tended to be more back-end loaded, which results in us carrying more receivables at the end of the quarter than we would if we were shipping in a more linear fashion. So again, I think it's a function of how does supply chain normalize and when does that eventually happen? That is -- you need a little bit of a crystal ball to answer that question.

Keysight reported strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and drove a strong finish to the year.  Before we get into the quarter, I want to highlight our exceptional",1199,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight reported strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and drove a strong finish to the year.  
Before we get into the quarter, I want to highlight our exceptional performance for fiscal year, which illustrates continued progress we're making in transforming the company to a software-centric solutions provider. We set new records for orders, which grew 12% to $6 billion, a new record for revenue, which was up 10%, and a new record for earnings per share, which increased 22%, all the while returning capital through $849 million in share repurchases or 89% of free cash flow. In addition, we continue to invest in next-generation technologies for long-term differentiation and see a high level of engagement and activity with our customers around their future needs.  
Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered an all-time record revenue and earnings per share in the fourth quarter ahead of expectations, enabled by outstanding execution by Keysight teams who successfully navigated supply chain, geopolitical and macro dynamics. Second, we achieved record orders of $1.6 billion with steady bookings throughout the quarter and a book-to-bill of 1.09. While our customers' multiyear road maps remain unchanged, they are exercising more caution given the macro backdrop, which we anticipate will moderate demand in the near term. Third, as we enter fiscal '23, we remain confident in our ability to outperform the market based on the differentiation of our solutions, our strong R&D customer value proposition and the robust backlog position we have entering the year. And as we look longer term, the secular innovation trends in our end markets remain strong.  
Now let's take a deeper look at the strength of the fourth quarter. Record orders of $1.6 billion grew 9% on a core basis. Record revenue grew 15% on a core basis, with solid growth across all regions as Keysight team successfully navigated challenging dynamics. This resulted in record quarterly earnings of $2.14 per share. 
The strength and resiliency of our business model is due to our strategic efforts to diversify our industry exposure. This has been best exemplified in the growth of our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group and our ability to leverage our industry-leading first-to-market solutions to enable expansion across the broader communications ecosystem.  
EISG achieved its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Auto, semiconductor solutions and general electronics all achieved record quarterly revenue. For the year, both orders and revenues set new records as we capitalize on continued investments across all 3 EISG markets.  
In automotive, we're pleased with the continued adoption of our solutions portfolio as orders grew double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and exceeded $500 million this year. Automotive OEMs and their suppliers continue to focus on strategic new mobility investments, which drove key wins for Keysight. In addition, automotive-focused semiconductor companies continue to add capabilities to support EV and AV applications, which we view as a favorable long-term dynamic.  
We recently announced the Scienlab DC Emulator, which enables customers to accurately characterize high-voltage, high-power electric vehicle battery performance under varying real-world charging conditions. And Keysight's PathWave Labs Operation software won 2022 Autotech Breakthrough Award for overall electric vehicle technology.  
In support of AV applications, silicon designers are exploring adoption of commercial standards such as MIPI for automotive and other surround sensor applications, including cameras and in-vehicle infotainment displays. We are now expanding our leading compliance test solutions to offer advanced verification and diagnostic capabilities for automotive designers.  
Turning to our semiconductor solutions business. Q4 was the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth and a record revenue quarter. We saw sustained demand for our wafer test solutions and precision positioning capabilities, which enable the realization of advanced process nodes.  
In addition, Keysight has continued to partner with industry leaders, Synopsys and Ansys, on RF and millimeter wave integrated circuit design flows built for today's wireless communication requirements, including 5G and 6G system-on-chips. Keysight received a Partner of the Year Award from TSMC for joint development design flows in RF and millimeter wave nodes.  
In general electronics, record orders grew double digits this quarter as demand remains strong and broad-based across industrial IoT and digital health as well as education and advanced research markets.  
Turning to Communications Solutions Group. The business delivered strong orders and record revenue. Annual orders and revenue were all-time highs despite geopolitical headwinds and delays in U.S. Defense budget appropriations. Commercial communications revenue grew 10% this quarter and 11% for the year, with growth across all regions. Investments across communications ecosystem continued throughout the year with sustained spending in next-generation wireless and wireline technologies. 
Ongoing investments in 5G standards, new spectrum, growing deployments around the world and steady evolution from 400 gig to 800 gig to terabit Ethernet drove growth. We had another record year for 5G orders as Keysight's market-leading solutions continue to provide the industry with new capabilities needed for development of next-generation devices as well as wireless and wireline networks.  
Examples that highlight our portfolio's alignment with key industry priority include a recent partnership with IBM to integrate our open RAN capabilities into their cloud automation tools to accelerate network deployments. We also completed the validation of our first 5G location-based service use case from Global Certification Forum by combining the testing of 5G new radio and global navigation satellite system technologies into a single platform. Lastly, in collaboration with key silicon and data center partners, we enabled the industry's first 1.6 terabit transmission and data center interconnect, leveraging our high-speed digital solutions.  
Aerospace, defense and government business revenue grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the year, setting a new record while navigating geopolitical headwinds. Steady investments in spectrum operations, cybersecurity and space and satellite drove demand. 5G continued to expand in aerospace and defense end markets, and we saw increasing investment in advanced research. Proposed increases in investment in the U.S. and allied countries for modernization of defense capabilities and new satellite and space applications position us well for future opportunities.  
As an integral part of our solution strategy, software and services order and revenue growth this year continued to outpace Keysight overall, which has driven our annual recurring revenue to approximately $1.2 billion. Software and services again represented just over 1/3 of Keysight's total revenue for the year.  
Keysight's focus on customer success and innovation is driving our development of first-to-market, high-value solutions. Our achievements over the years exemplify Keysight's collaborative culture and our talented workforce, and we are honored that Keysight has placed 10th on the Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology list for 2022. We believe our differentiated culture gives us a unique ability to recruit and develop capable talent and will be our sustaining competitive advantage.  
In conclusion, I would like to thank our employees for all their contributions, commitment and strong track record of execution. In the midst of an uncertain economic environment, we remain confident in the resilience of our business, the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility of our operating model. 
Now I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."
247017859,1806209216,2693050,"Keysight Technologies, Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2022",2022-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Keysight Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter of 2022 with record revenue of $1,443,000,000, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 11% or 15% on a core basis. Our strategies to navigate the ongoin",737,"Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter of 2022 with record revenue of $1,443,000,000, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 11% or 15% on a core basis. Our strategies to navigate the ongoing supply constraints continue to be effective. While the supply chain situation improved within the quarter, it continues to moderate our near-term revenue expectations. Record orders of $1,570,000,000 increased 5% or 9% on a core basis, and we entered fiscal year 2023 with over $2.5 billion in backlog. 
Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 64%, which, as expected, was down 80 basis points sequentially due to inflationary pressures and increased shipments of lower-end instruments, enabled by the improving supply chain. Operating expenses of $494 million were well managed, and we generated operating margin of 30%. Net income was a record $386 million, and we achieved $2.14 in earnings per share, which was $0.14 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 180 million shares. Foreign exchange impact on our earnings was negligible, thanks to a meaningful natural hedge provided by our global footprint, which was then supplemented by our financial hedging program. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $992 million, up 8% or 11% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 29%. Commercial communications generated revenue of $681 million in the fourth quarter, up 10%, driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, increasing O-RAN adoption and investment in 800 gigabit and 1.6 terabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $311 million, up 4%, driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $451 million, up 20% or 25% on a core basis, driven by strength across all markets. EISG reported gross margin of 60% and operating margin of 32%. 
Turning to our full year financial performance. Keysight delivered outstanding results in 2022 despite ongoing supply constraints, foreign exchange headwinds and incremental trade restrictions. FY '22 revenue totaled $5.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year or 12% on a core basis. Gross margin was flat at 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation. We invested $813 million in R&D, while operating margin improved 140 basis points to 29%. FY '22 non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $7.63 per share, up 22%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with more than $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $398 million and free cash flow of $340 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $959 million, representing 18% of revenue and 69% of non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $158.77 for a total consideration of $126 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 5.4 million shares at an average share price of $156.09 for a total consideration of $849 million or 89% of free cash flow. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We exit the year with record backlog and confidence in Keysight's ability to continue executing through near-term uncertainties. As a result, we expect first quarter 2023 revenue to be in the range of $1,360,000,000 to $1,380,000,000 and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.87 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. 
A few modeling reminders as we enter the year. Our annual compensation cycle is administered in Q1. And in this current inflationary environment, we expect our second consecutive year of wage increases above our historic average. We are targeting FY '23 R&D investment at approximately 16% of revenue. Annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million. And we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '23. 
In closing, we recognize the uncertainty of the current macro environment, and we'll continue to be disciplined. Keysight's highly flexible cost structure, track record of execution, diverse end markets and long-term secular growth drivers give us confidence in our ability to outperform the market. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

And in consideration of this environment, pretty strong results and also a strong finish to the year. And as I stated, we saw a steady level of spend from a demand perspective through the quarter. All our regions from a sales perspective grew. So it was broad-based. 
And going into a little bit on the end market color, I would say 5G continues to remain strong. We grew our 5G orders double digit, strength in R&D. And also with the inflections that we're seeing in deployments around some parts of the world, even some of the manufacturing spend there remains strong for us this quarter. 
And we did see pockets of weakness in the broad component ecosystem, and that was an area we obviously watch carefully, and that is related to the smartphone demand. And if you look at the cloud and data center markets in wireline, while some of the cloud -- direct cloud spend from the cloud providers was pushed out, service providers was pushed out, the broad spend to adopt 400 gig and 800 gig continues to remain strong. So they focus on R&D, and new innovations remain strong. 
Moving on to aerospace and defense business. Obviously, it was still a strong quarter for us, but we did not see the typical year-end surge that we would expect given the budget appropriations process. 
And then moving to EISG end markets. All of the markets remain strong, right? Automotive, we had strong double-digit growth as continued investments and inflection from EV and AV are playing out. Semiconductor is an area we watch carefully. But because of our exposure into the wafer stage equipment process and new node -- specifically new nodes, that remains strong. And lastly, the general electronics business, which typically gets part of its spend from PMI, continued to remain strong from a demand perspective. 
So I would say we're doing well, and the customer activity with our customers and engagements remain strong and quite pleased with the -- with our quarter in this environment."

Because, Satish, as you just kind of ramped through all the different subsegments and businesses, it seems like everything is going quite strong. Should we take this as maybe an indicator that fiscal Q1 orders are easing a bit? And ultimately, does this push the growth profile back to that 4% to 6% normalized range?

So as Satish said, our order level was steady throughout the quarter. So we're watching this, right? Because if customers are taking more time to make decisions, you would look for orders to slow down. They did not. As a matter of fact, October was very strong. It was a record October for us in terms of orders. So that's good. 
You've heard us talk about before the addition of new customers. We've added about 450 this quarter again for nearly 2,000 new customers across the whole year. So that creates more diversity and durability to our business, and I see that paying off. Our top 20 customers in the quarter were up strong double digits as well. 
So all of that continues to translate to the fact that we did not see an impact to our business because of the customers taking more time. And I think it also has to do with the fact that we are so biased toward R&D and design optimization. And as we've seen through other waves in the recent term where some markets slowed, the advanced technology development continues. 
So that's what we see, but we look around and we do see some macro uncertainty. And from my seat, what I see in terms of order or in terms of customer activities is very active customers. Our 6-month funnel continues to grow, but customers are taking more time to make ultimate CapEx decisions."

I'd just give you a little bit maybe more quantification of the situation going into Q1.

A year ago, in Q1, that was the first time in Keysight's history that we'd ever posted order growth moving from the end of Q4 into the first quarter of the new fiscal year. So we've got a tough compare from that perspective. 
In addition, as you all know, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen pretty significantly in the back half of this year. We estimate the FX headwind in our first quarter to be a full 5 percentage points. And so we've got a 5-point FX headwind. And we estimate another 2 to 3 points of headwind from the recent increase in China trade restrictions as well as the loss of our Russia business, which happened in the second quarter of last year. So those things combined give us a 7- to 8-point headwind just coming out of the gate here as we enter the first quarter."

But what you can't see is that our commits were very much in line with our original expectations. It just took longer for things to be delivered. 
And so what we're seeing as we go into next year is a pretty dramatic scaling back of new capital purchases, but with a little bit of a cash flow overhang as we go into next year. And so that's what's going to carry our capital purchases up to that $250 million level in fiscal '23."

With regard to the software strategy, it, again, goes congruent with our go-to-market approach because we're here to enable innovations to happen faster, and the way we do that is by offering more software-centric solutions. So as we deploy more solutions to our customers, increasingly, that is in the form of growing software mix. And that goes, again, synergistic with our services strategy. 
So you look at our software and services revenue this year will end at 34% of the total mix, and our ARR, or annual recurring revenue, has reached a new high of $1.2 billion.

And so I think we'll have to see how that plays out over time. 
I think again, we built -- you can do the math. We built well north of $1 billion of backlog over the course of the last 3 years as we've had this book-to-bill that I've mentioned of 1.09. And as our lead times come in, we're going to expect ordering patterns to adjust and lead times to pull in.

I think about 18 months ago, I said the first catalyst was the C-band deployments in the U.S. That's played out as we had hoped, and we have captured a lot of that spend. We are pleased with some action that's happening in Asia and India, parts of India that have made commitments to roll out 5G. So that's, again, opportunity for us that's playing out right now. .
But the second and the third parts to this is the millimeter wave opportunity. There's still some complex challenges with millimeter wave that customers are trying to solve. That continues to be a longer-term R&D opportunity for us as that deployment has continued to push out anyway -- scale deployments anyway. 
And lastly, as 5G is deployed, operators are looking to further monetize by adding the SA versions and new applications such as open RAN continue to be -- gain traction across the global ecosystem. And so the opportunity that we have in R&D continues to grow, and we're well positioned with the comprehensive offerings we have to address it. 
I also want to point out that we have a very diversified business. Yes, 5G gets a lot of attention, but we have secular trends in wireline evolutions, which we're well positioned to capitalize on based on the acquisitions of Ixia that we have made, and we continue to see traction there. Not to mention the newer additions to our go-to-market with automotive and with next-generation semiconductor nodes. So we run a diversified business, and I think that's a source of greater stability for us and -- over time. 
The second part of the supply chain question that you asked is, at the beginning of last year, we took a series of actions to basically redesign our products to second source components, and we had a -- we've talked about it on earnings calls. And all those actions have really enabled us to do better than we expected every quarter. 
But as we think about the supply chain, I speak with a number of our semiconductor supply chain partners, and they're all putting actions in place to obviously increase capacity, but it still continues to be a constrained environment. We're not back to this pre-COVID sort of supply environment yet, and it might take all of '23 to get there from our best information right now."

Although I think you can see based on the fact that we have maintained margins over the course of fiscal '22, it's flat at 65%, which, frankly, I think in this inflationary environment, was a very strong result that we're basically keeping pace on a margin basis with what we're seeing in terms of increases. 
And so -- and right now, while on the one side, yes, we have these price increases that are embedded in our backlog and will continue to yield dividends and revenue, it's not like the inflationary elements have stopped in the cost structure as well. I referenced, for example, that we are going to be doing our salary administration for next year here in our fiscal first quarter. And this will be our second consecutive year with salary increases that are materially above our historic averages. 
As to the volume question, given the nature of our business where we're selling instruments that literally cost, in some cases, hundreds of dollars and, in other cases, cost million dollars, that's a very difficult question to answer.

Obviously, our 16% or 16% plus has been our long-term target. We underspent that here in FY '22. I think a big function of that was the revenue outperformance within the year. If you remember, this time last year, we guided you to 6%",196,"Yes. So you're right. Obviously, our 16% or 16% plus has been our long-term target. We underspent that here in FY '22. I think a big function of that was the revenue outperformance within the year. If you remember, this time last year, we guided you to 6% revenue growth on the year, and we actually grew 12% on a core basis. And so our R&D plans for the year were much more aligned with that lower level of revenue growth. 
So I think as we go -- we certainly continue to see a large amount of opportunity for us to continue to invest in the future growth of our business, a lot of pull from our customers to do R&D work. And so our intent is to revamp back towards 16% of revenue. Obviously, the salary administration here in the first quarter is going to help to move us in that direction. We may not get to 16% here in the first quarter, but looking at an exit rate that's at 16% or even potentially a little bit above by the time we get out to the fourth quarter is not out of the question."

We see it in terms of inventory, increased inventory via the prices that we're paying for parts. We see money tied up in terms of commitments to buy future inventory where we paid in advance for future delivery. It's been a use of working capital that, frankly, is new over the course of the last 12 months. 
And then frankly, the supply chain situation has significantly impacted the linearity of our revenue within the quarter. You can imagine when you move from more of a just-in-time environment where you're just building and shipping and building and shipping, we're doing a lot more build to a certain stage, wait for parts, finish and ship. And so our revenue is tended to be more back-end-loaded, which results in us carrying more receivables at the end of the quarter than we would if we were shipping in a more linear fashion. 
So again, I think it's a function of how does supply chain normalize and when does that eventually happen? That is -- you need a little bit of a crystal ball to answer that question. But when it does happen, we would see -- we would expect to see an ability to reduce working capital."
