Third, I wi",1601,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. I will highlight 4 topics today during our call. First, our financial results for the quarter. Second, I will provide some color on the current state of our business and the COVID environment. Third, I will detail our continued share gains despite a difficult macro environment. And finally, I will outline our approach to the long game with some highlights of our recipe for growth transformation. I'll then turn it over to Aaron to discuss our financial results in more detail.
So let's get started with our financial results displayed on Slide 4. Earlier this morning, Sysco reported fiscal second quarter results that were fueled by substantial top line momentum and an acceleration of market share gains. Our sales and volume performance success is a testament to our supply chain strength in the advancement of our Recipe for Growth.
Our operating expenses for the period were elevated due to the effects of COVID on our business. And as a result, our bottom line results were below our expectations this quarter. Key headlines for the quarter include strong sales results and market share gains. We delivered growth of more than 1.2x the market, which exceeded our expectations for the period. We delivered sales growth of 10.5% versus 2019 and sequential volume improvements throughout the quarter until the Omicron variant impacted our December performance. More on Omicron in a moment.
As I mentioned, operational expenses within our supply chain were above expectations due to the challenges that COVID is presenting to our labor environment and our transportation costs. I will detail this complex operating environment in a moment. But we remain confident these incremental expenses driven by labor costs are near-term challenges that will improve over time.
Our strong sales results and elevated operating expenses resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 for the quarter. We further advanced our Recipe for Growth strategy, which we believe will uniquely position Sysco to win in the marketplace for the long term. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment. That strategic and economic reality will enable Sysco to outperform the market for quarters and years to come.
Topic 2 for today, an update on the state of the business. As I mentioned a moment ago, COVID continues to negatively impact supply chains across the globe and the effect was elevated in Q2 relative to our first quarter. The impact is being felt in product availability shortages from our suppliers and higher-than-anticipated labor and transportation costs. I would like to further explain some of the labor cost pressures that we are addressing.
At Sysco, we have hired thousands of new associates over the past quarter to support the recovery of our industry, which is coming faster and stronger than had been anticipated. We are also winning market share across our business sectors, which adds to our hiring needs. As a result of our hiring and an industry-wide higher rate of associate turnover, we have a higher ratio of new associates in our labor population than we had originally planned. A higher population of less experienced associates has a direct negative impact on our supply chain productivity. The punchline is that our tenured associates perform at a much higher rate of productivity than new associates. With that said, we are confident that we can and will move our newer associates up the productivity curve over time.
We have also incurred higher-than-planned expenses as COVID-related illnesses accelerated in the quarter and have come into January. To provide a sense of the magnitude of this disruption, nearly 10% of our U.S. workforce tested positive for COVID during the month of January and were out for a minimum of several days. To cover these absences, we invested in overtime and supplemental third-party resources to ensure that we properly supported our customers. At Sysco, we cannot let our health care, education, hospitality and important restaurant partners go without food because of these labor challenges caused by COVID.
Our customer-centric approach to ensure that we can ship on time and in full will benefit our relationship with our customers for the long term, positively impacting retention and growth. We are confident that our service performance is stronger than the industry as measured by our Net Promoter Score. In fact, our NPS performance versus the market expanded in the quarter.
Lastly, as I mentioned, Omicron negatively impacted our top line performance, starting the weekend after Thanksgiving. Our business in Europe was impacted first with the reintroduction of major restrictions on our customers. Our sales and volume performances in December were impacted by those restrictions, most notably in the U.K., France and Canada. For example, restaurants in the majority of Canada began closing for on-premise dining at the end of the second quarter, with restrictions slowly starting to ease in February. These types of restrictions impact our customers' performance and ordering patterns. As a result, we expect the top line impact from Omicron to continue into the third quarter. The speed of the return to pre-Omicron levels is uncertain, but we are seeing signs of progress in Europe as restrictions have begun easing. I would like to highlight again that Sysco's sequentially improved sales and volume performance every month compared to 2019 levels until the impact of Omicron began being felt Thanksgiving weekend, and we are confident that we will get back to that growth pattern as Omicron receives.
Topic 3, let's turn to our market share performance highlighted on Slide 5. Despite the challenges presented by Omicron at the end of the quarter, as you can see on Slide 5, Sysco delivered exceptional growth versus the market in the second quarter. As a result, we are now confident we will exceed our 1.2x the market growth target for the full fiscal year. Our performance versus the market expanded this quarter. Furthermore, looking back over the last 3 quarters, we are beginning to pull ahead of the industry.
The next slide from NPD shows how over the last 2 years, we have consistently increased the percentage of customers that purchased exclusively from Sysco. This compares to the dotted line that shows the percentage of customers not yet buying from Sysco. You can see that the dotted line is steadily declining. These slides are just 2 more proof points that our team is winning in the marketplace and that our strategy is working.
Lastly, Topic 4, I will highlight examples in our business transformation and how that progress will enable consistent profitable growth. Today, I will give an update on 2 of our growth initiatives. Sysco Your Way and our Italian cuisine program. As a reminder, Sysco Your Way is a new service model that we are piloting to better serve what we call restaurant dense neighborhoods. Through this program, we are providing our customers with enhanced levels of service and sales support. We are very pleased with the success of the pilot locations, and we will be expanding the program to net new neighborhoods in the spring of 2022.
In addition to Sysco Your Way, I would like to provide an update on our Italian cuisine platform work. As a reminder, Italian is one of the largest squeezing segments and Sysco historically underpenetrated with this important customer segment. We did not have an optimal assortment, and we lap the go-to-market selling strategy to win. Our Greco acquisition has changed that capability in a meaningful way. First off, Greco is off to a great start and is exceeding our Year 1 top and bottom line expectations. We are really pleased with the Greco business and the great work that they are doing. As importantly, we are leveraging the Greco product assortment and selling prowess and bringing the best-selling items to Sysco houses across the country. More on that in due course. Winning in the specialty sectors like Italian is a priority for our Recipe for Growth strategy.
Turning to Slide 7. In summary, for the quarter, we are winning as a company in the marketplace. We are growing our business with new and existing customers. Our year-to-date growth is exceeding our 1.2x the industry target for the year and is being driven by our supply chain strength and our Recipe for Growth strategy. We also returned over $650 million of cash to our shareholders during the quarter. We are confident that the impact of our initiatives will grow over time, enabling us to consistently outperform the market at large.
As I wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to thank all of our associates at Sysco. These past 2 years have been challenging. We continue to lead the industry from a service perspective and make deliveries to our customers regardless of the COVID conditions. I am proud of our sales, operations and global support center teams for their persistence and customer focus that they have displayed. I really want to thank them for their tenacity and I'll use another word, endurance. I am honored to serve these associates and work by their side.
I would also like to welcome the recently appointed members of our Board of Directors: Ali Dibadj, Jill Golder and Alison Kenney Paul. Together, they bring deep industry experience a modern skills inventory, including finance, consumer and digital and strategy capabilities. Our 3 new Board members will be extremely valuable to Sysco in our transformation for years to come.
I'll now turn it over to Aaron who will provide additional financial details before we open it up for questions."

Sales growth of 41.2% compared to last year, also up 10.5% versus fiscal 2019, leading to our highest Q2 sales ever. Good management of our product cost inflation, recording the highest gross profit in absolute dollar terms for any Q2 at Sysco. A doubling of adjusted operating income and a 62.9% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year, notwithstanding a cost environment, which worsened during the quarter. Continued investment against our long-term recipe for growth with $44 million of operating expense investments against our strategic investments, creating momentum with our commercial capabilities.
Proactive action on the COVID generated labor and safety environments in which we are operating, with $73 million in transitory snapback operating investments such as recruiting costs, hiring marketing, vaccination promotion, contract labor and sign-on and retention bonuses in the quarter. And while the magnitude was greater than we could foresee last quarter, we experienced productivity challenges and much higher overtime costs in the quarter, resulting from the pandemic-related workforce transition and our prioritization of customer service.
With respect to our capital allocation, we refinanced elements of our long-term debt during the quarter, and we returned $657 million of cash to shareholders. With those headlines on the table, let's turn to some details on the financials for the quarter and some thoughts on our outlook.
Second quarter sales were $16.3 billion, an increase of 41.2% from fiscal 2021, and a 10.5% increase from fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice, showed excellent progress, up 45.1% versus fiscal 2021 and up 14% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the pre-Thanksgiving and pre-Omicron resurgence in volumes and sales. Local case volume within the subset of USFS, our U.S. Broadline operations, increased 17.6%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 22.5%. SYGMA sales were up 16.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up 15.3% and versus fiscal 2019, even with the large customer rationalization we disclosed earlier, which we expect will be complete on a comparable basis following Q3.
International sales were up 43% versus fiscal 2021 and down approximately 3% versus fiscal 2019. Sales trends were accelerating nicely in our International segment before the onset of Omicron and restrictions in our key international markets such as the U.K. and we are watching post lockdown trends carefully. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 0.3% on Sysco's sales results. We continue to monitor the impact on our customers and on our business as international restrictions are starting to ease, including in Ireland and the U.K... Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 14.6% in our U.S. Broadline business.
Gross profit for the enterprise was approximately $3 billion in the second quarter, increasing 37.8% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and also exceeding gross profit in fiscal 2019 by 4%. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal '21 and compared to the same quarter in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in gross profit dollars per case across all 4 of our reporting segments as we successfully managed increased costs for our product suppliers while addressing some, but not all, of our increased operating costs. Gross margin rate was 17.7% during the quarter with the margin rate math impacted by product inflation. Of course, it is gross profit dollars that count in an inflationary environment.
Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense came in at $2.4 billion with a combination of planned and unexpected expense increases from the prior year, really driven by 4 things. First, the increased variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes. Second, as you can see on Slide 10, more than $73 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, which we expect to decline in the third quarter. While we have increased wages in select locations, those increases are not material and have the opportunity to be offset by productivity and cost-out improvements going forward. Third, $44 million of purposeful operating expense investments against our Recipe for Growth initiatives, like personalization, digital sales tools and assortment capabilities, which remain on track to be elevated for the rest of the year. And fourth, the productivity expense challenges Kevin referenced earlier, including ramp-up time associated with new higher productivity in our warehouses and trucks elevated overtime and third-party labor support in the face of staff absences.
I want to emphasize that the management team at Sysco has been aggressive in pursuing the cause of the cost increases. While the transformation continues unabated, the team has also pushed hard to identify in action incremental profit opportunities and cost reduction initiatives, which should help the company in the back half and beyond as the environment stabilizes. Together the snapback investments in the transformation costs totaled approximately $116 million of operating expenses this quarter, and negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.17.
All in, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 14.7%, which is flat from fiscal 2019 and down 145 basis points from fiscal 2021. Our cost-out efforts are meaningfully benefiting our P&L, and we continue to assess and execute against new cost-out projects each quarter.
Finally, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted operating income increased $262 million from last year to $496 million. This was primarily driven by a 45% improvement in U.S. Foodservice and continued progress on profitability from International, partially offset by SYGMA. The second quarter SYGMA operating loss was driven by higher-than-expected labor costs, which will be offset in future quarters by specific actions already taken by the SYGMA management team. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.40 to $0.57 for the second quarter compared to last year.
Now let me share a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $377 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by our higher income and lower interest, offset by higher tax payments and a significant investment in working capital. Net CapEx was $175.9 million, somewhat lower than expected given increased lead times on fleet and equipment. Adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $201 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand.
As seen on Slide 15, our results this quarter also reflected incremental progress against our capital allocation priorities. This included the further strengthening of our balance sheet by successfully refinancing debt during the quarter at longer maturities and more attractive rates, lowering our adjusted interest expense costs going forward. We also commenced our share repurchase program during the second quarter and repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares for a total of $416 million at an average share price of $72.30. This was in addition to paying our quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share in October. We remain committed to growing our dividend and as previously communicated, planned to next address decisions around our dividend per share during our fiscal Q4.
While our track record goes back decades, as you can see on Slide 16, over the last 7 years, cumulatively, we have returned over $12 billion of cash to shareholders.
Let's turn now to the look forward. Our Recipe for Growth transformation plan is on track. However, Omicron had a noticeable impact on our December and Q2 results continuing into January and now February. As a result, we are reaffirming our long-term guidance that for fiscal 2024, Sysco will deliver adjusted EPS growth of at least 30% over our record 2019 EPS of $3.55. We are updating our view of the back half to reflect the realities of the disruption caused by Omicron and the labor environment. We expect to fall below our prior EPS guidance for fiscal year 2022. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS of approximately $3 to $3.10. This translates to adjusted EPS in the back half of about $1.60 to $1.70.
In a typical pre-COVID fiscal year, adjusted EPS for our second half is generally weighted around 40% to Q3 and 60% in Q4 due to normal seasonality of our business. This year, we expect our second half profitability to be weighted even more to the fourth quarter. We expect a stronger Q4 this year relative to Q3 as a result of anticipated volume recovery, lower snapback expenses, improved operating productivity and specific actions we are taking to offset Omicron. In offering this perspective, we are assuming no further COVID variant disruptions to our operating environment.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks."

First, this quarter included substantial top line momentum and an acceleration of our market share gains. We are winning in the marketplace, and we have confidence that we will continue to win share. With that said, Q2 presented challenges from Omicron on both our top and bottom line. Our sequential volume growth progress stalled post-Thanksgiving and that headwind has continued into January. More importantly, COVID-related staffing disruptions increased our operating expenses for the quarter. As a result, our bottom line results were below our expectations.
Second, despite the short-term impact of Omicron on our business, we are confident that we will resume our volume improvement as soon as the variant recedes. And we can see green shoots of progress in February from a volume perspective. As it relates to expenses, we have a management plan to improve our year-to-go operating expenses. We are meaningfully focused on improving associate retention, training and productivity. These activities are a core competency of Sysco and our experienced field leadership team has a plan to deliver improvement for the remainder of the year.
Third, we remain confident in the long-term trajectory at Sysco. And as Aaron stated, we are reaffirming our long-term guidance that includes significant sales and EPS growth. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term. The customer-first solutions we are developing will enable us to grow our share profitably and also enable Sysco to be more efficient.

But for the quarter, we incurred $73 million of snapback cost, which is the combination of contract labor, retention bonuses, sign-on bonuses, training, vaccination credits, et cetera. We also incurred more than $40 million on transformation costs.

Again, we were sequentially improving each and every month, taking market share as evidenced by our slide chart, we're really beginning to pull away from the rest of the market. So winning in aggregate. December was impacted. January was impacted because the restrictions were in place for all of January. We are beginning to see some signs of progress or green shoots in February as restrictions begin to ease, but we're not fully yet back to the pre-Omicron levels. We have 50% restaurant restriction on-premise dining in Canada. We have mandatory work-from-home work orders in France and in the U.K. And then in northern urban locations within the United States, still heavy, heavy work from home, which impacts daypart restaurant traffic, as you well know. So we're not quite back to where we were.
What we are very confident in is as the restrictions on our customers ease, vaccine, passports and things like that mask mandates that impact people's psychology tied to going out. As those things ease, we see fast recovery from our customers, and we're prepared from an inventory perspective, we're prepared from a staffing perspective, we're prepared from a service level perspective to be able to serve when our customers are ready, and we expect to continue to pull away from the market from a growth versus the industry perspective.

And you can see it in our performance results at just our inventory management is significantly improved from 2 years ago when COVID first began. 
The second is in labor strategy, one of the things that I made the call with full support of our Board back in December when Omicron began impacting, we were not going to furlough associates our staff. That would be a penny-wise, dollar-foolish decision. Pennies that we could save from furloughing staff in December and January, would cost us twice as much as we attempted to restock the bench and bring people back off furlough because in today's labor environment, we furlough someone, they're going to get a job in another industry at another company. So we made that very purposeful choice to not furlough any staff, not a single person over that period of time, December and January. That will pay dividends for our company. My guess would be smaller, less capitalized companies are not fortunate enough to be able to make those types of decisions. In fact, not only did we not furlough anyone, we hired thousands of people in our Q2 and have continued hiring December into January. 
At this moment in time, we literally have hundreds of drivers in the passenger seat of a truck getting trained on Sysco standards, Sysco processes, and they will be ready to be driving their own truck as the volume recovery begins. Because keep in mind that there's an entire sector that we serve that isn't yet even back in business sufficiently, and that's what we call business and industry. We had been anticipating that the business and industry sector would have kicked in, in January as most companies were planning a return to work after the holidays. That has not occurred, as you know, and that's future tailwinds to the Sysco recovery as business and industry will begin kicking back in here. It's hard to predict when, but we will be prepared, we'll be ready. Those are just a handful of things that are on the different from March of 2020. And we've gotten pretty agile at dealing with these curveballs. But back to you if you have a follow-up."

And the partners that we work with to produce that product, they're doing well. And again, Sysco Brand in aggregate has a higher rate of in-stock than national brands. That's point one.
Point two, because of inflation being elevated and everybody knows it's currently elevated, Sysco Brand has an even bigger punch than it normally would. So we view Sysco Brand as an opportunity to save our customers' money with a high-quality product and we are doing a good job with our sales team of introducing customers to products that they perhaps have not purchased before. And we did see progress in fact, 250 basis points of progress from Q1 into Q2 on Sysco Brands penetration, and I would view further tailwind in that regard in the coming years."

As you know, it's been double digit now for longer than any of us in the industry would like. We have not seen yet a reduction in consumer demand tied to that higher inflation. And it's hard to predict how long that will be able to persist, but we're not seeing elasticity of pricing impact consumer purchasing and that is a positive. It has obviously helped our P&L. In the most recent quarter, as Aaron said, we increased GP dollars per case in each of our reportable segments. So we're doing a good job of passing through inflation. We're also doing a good job of helping our customers find lower cost alternatives. So menu suggestions, narrowing the number of items on the menu, so they can increase their profitability. Portion size, as you know, optimization so that they can keep their ticket on the menu the same and do so from a lower COGS to them.
So those things are going well. Protein is even higher than the overall basket of inflation. We need to see progress on supplier availability in protein. It's a priority for Sysco. We are working with our supplier partners in the protein category to work on longer-range forecasts so they have consistency or purchase volume from Sysco, so that they can be efficient in their production. And we are working as hard as we can to find additional sources of supplies in the protein category because we need to bring the protein inflation down. John, that's the #1 focus for us from an inflation perspective.
As it relates to the second half of your question, which was can we grow faster than 1.5x, yes, we're pleased to report today that we are exceeding our goal for this year, which was 1.2x. Prior quarter, we had said we are on track to deliver 1.2x. So those words matter. We changed our words from on track to exceed. We are confident we will exceed the 1.2x this year. Our third year goal of our 3-year plan, which is fiscal 2024, it remains at this time at 1.5x. Do I have confidence we can do better than that? And we'll talk more about that at Investor Day. But we like our strategy. It's winning in the marketplace. If you look at the chart in our prepared remarks, you can see the pulling away from the industry, and I don't anticipate that slowing down."

First and foremost, scale matters in this industry meaningfully. So purchasing scale matters so we can get best possible costs so we can share value with our customers. Scale matters from a physicality perspective. So we have more distribution centers in the United States, our primary country than anyone else, which means our last mile delivery is a shorter route, a more dense route than others. And as we continue to grow, Aaron and I will make appropriate investments in incremental physical capabilities to put us even closer to the customer, which will lower our cost to serve. And you can see the flywheel that comes from the size, breadth and scale of Sysco, and we believe that will become an increasing strength capability over time. Because of the cash generation of this company and our strong balance sheet, we have the ability to invest in net new facilities to lower that cost to serve last-mile delivery. So we believe it will be an increasing strength formula for our company.
One of the questions that we believe is on investors' minds is, Kevin, aren't you worried about labor costs? Everyone we talked to is talking about labor costs going up. I just want to be clear on this topic. Labor wage rate is immaterial to the cost pressure that we experienced in Q2. I'll repeat that, the labor wage rate was immaterial in our Q2. Our wage -- excuse me, our operating cost pressure in this past quarter, if you had to single it down to like the biggest thing was the percentage of people working for us that are new tied to the hiring and there was more turnover that occurred this past summer than is typical in our industry tied to what some people call that great resignation. So we are working feverishly on improving associate retention, improvement training of our associates, improving the productivity of our associates.
As I mentioned, this is our core competence. This is what we do, and we are confident we will move up the productivity ladder. As Aaron said, that will be more Q4 impactful than Q3 because it takes time. As I mentioned earlier, I gave a decent piece of color. When you started as a driver in our company, you're in the passenger seat for weeks, learning Sysco standards, learning our customer relations interface because that driver is the face of this company and also, of course, learning the challenging type of driving, which is mostly backing up to restaurant locations that our drivers have to do.
So those investments we're making will reduce over time, which is why we are confident that we will improve our productivity, which will then begin to flow through to improved EBIT percent margin. So I just want to be clear, labor rate increase is not something that is causing our current operating cost pressure.
As you look to the future, will that change? We do anticipate when we do our annual review process that we will have a nominally higher wage rate increase provided to our associates. They work hard. They deserve to be paid fairly and appropriately, and we have productivity improvement efforts that can help offset those types of increases."

So we've been fully open for business now for a long time, and we're growing. So we're taking market share. We're winning new customers. Our sales are obviously well above '19. Our volumes, we anticipate will be back to and then above '19 in the not-too-distant future. So we've got the open to hire shingle out there. In fact, we're getting much more effective at recruiting for open positions. Our marketing team is getting more sophisticated on how to target applicants, and we're getting better and better at training them.
But in the future, to specifically answer your question, Jake, we're actually going to have to go to people from outside this industry, to meet the hiring needs and higher demands that we have. It's why we formed our driver academy. Just a little bit of color on that. We're now live in 2 physical driver academy locations. Our first CDL class has graduated from our driver academy and we think we're going to have to eat our own cooking, pun intended, where we're going to have to find people who aren't today CDL class drivers teach them to trade, train them and then have them work for a long time for Sysco. And again, that's an example of size and scale matter. We pay people to participate in that program. whereas today, if you were an average person wanting to become a driver and you enter driver school, you actually have to pay the driver school. So think about that flip from having to go from having to pay to attend and lose time working to we actually pay you to attend the Sysco Driver Academy, and we're bullish about that and expanding that opportunity across the country. Thank you for the questions."

The green shoot comment that I made was actually tied to cases -- excuse me, case volume, therefore, and sales beginning to improve. That's what that comment was tied to. As restrictions begin to ease, Canada just in February has relaxed. They still have a very onerous restriction in place, which is a 50% on-prem dining, but it was like literally restaurants were closed in Canada. In the GTA, Greater Toronto area, in Quebec province, you couldn't get in a restaurant for the month of January. So those restrictions that began easing. In the U.K. and France, the restrictions have been very heavy, mandatory work from home. We're seeing restrictions ease there and the green shoot comment was tied to as those restrictions ease, we can see a recovery of the business and a return of volume. And then in the U.S., I didn't give this color commentary. The Southern 1/3 of the United States continues to perform very well. The headwind in the U.S. is in the urban centers in the north, and we anticipate recovery being made in those environments as, again, restrictions in these -- that's mostly a city mayor decision as the restrictions they're putting on customers ease.
Point two, that where else will progress come from? So we do expect volume and sales to make progress in Q3 and certainly into Q4. But operating expenses, we have a plan. We have a management action plan to address our operating expenses. It's a 5-part plan. I'll cover 3 quickly, and then I'll talk to Aaron, who will cover 2. First and foremost, it's about retention, training and productivity. We need to move the new hires up the productivity curve, and we are maniacally focused on improving that new hire productivity.
Topic 2 is transportation efficiency. There's Golden Nam Hills, we like to say on ensuring that the trucks are being routed most optimally. There's work we can do. It's pick and shovel work to ensure that our transportation efficiency is operating at the highest level.
The third is Sysco Brand. The question that came up earlier in today's conversation from Alex. We are making progress in Sysco Brand. It will be a big focus in the year to go, and we anticipate profit improvement in the year to go tied to increasing penetration of Sysco Brand.
And I'll toss to Aaron for the 2 other topics we're addressing. Aaron, over to you."

If we go back to the beginning of COVID, fast food QSR drive-through meaningful share winner. And you could see that in our SYGMA reportable segment for last year, SYGMA had a record year in both top line and bottom line. In part because SYGMA indexes towards obviously serving that customer type. That was year 1 of COVID.
Year 2 of COVID, the big winners are the sophisticated restaurant chains that have a digital app that allows to go ordering, that allows paperless contactless payment, I meant to say, and just frictionless ease of purchase and really loyalty. One of the things we're working on at Sysco is personalization. Well, there are select retailers -- excuse me, restaurants, I won't name the names of them that are pretty fantastic loyalty program that prompt their customers to buy more from them and come back to their restaurants more often. Those are the big winners at this point in time.
As it relates to Sysco and how we can help the mom and pop. This is the sweet spot of who we are. So we are helping independent restaurants figure out how to connect to a delivery partner. We help them with a creation of a mobile version of their venue so that customers can shop remotely and pick up or take out and also we're helping them with things like contactless payment in the restaurant. So we have the largest sales force in the industry, and that literally is what they do. They don't just sell food. They consult with mom-and-pops to help them compete more effectively with some of the larger companies. And we believe that will earn loyalty to Sysco over time. We believe that will increase Sysco's stickiness. And I refer you back to the chart in our slide deck that talked about the percentage of Sysco customers now buying just from us and then the percentage of customers that weren't previously buying from us in both of those indices are improving steadily.
So we're confident in the long term of the mom-and-pop independents. There are many of them out there, and we can help them succeed. And we believe that Sysco's independent customers are going to outperform the mom-and-pop that does not partner with Sysco. In fact, we've got data that shows that, in fact, is the case and our sales reps use that in their selling process.
Point 2 is well inflation more negatively impact mom-and-pops. I would say yes, but then I would call it back to the Sysco thesis. And why does the national chain perhaps have more mitigating buffering? Many of them have long-term supplier contracts with fixed pricing and/or scales tied to inflation and the mom-and-pop has less of that. But that's what we are. We are essentially their purchasing agent. We are pushing back hard on cost increases, as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions from the other, John, is what are we doing about this inflation component. We are working aggressively to find alternative suppliers, alternative items, lower cost items that could be substituted too. And again, that's what motivates us at Sysco is to serve that mom-and-pop. And we've got a lot of good things happening to help them with their inflation, which includes Sysco Brand and our mom-pop restaurant customers love Sysco Brand for the fact that it saves them time and saves them money and we anticipate making progress in that regard as well."

I would just kind of call back to my answer to one of the previous questions, which is that size and scale matter and have become even more important in this COVID environment. Supply chain resiliency is the newest buzzword if you think about places like World Economic Forum and what our CEO is talking about, it used to be supply chain agility and -- people now are talking about supply chain resiliency that you can weather storms of environmental conditions, political unrest and then things like this, which is a health care tied topic. So size and scale matter meaningfully when you're talking supply chain resiliency. We have the inventory to be able to support our customers as they recover. Aaron and I have invested to ensure that we have more inventory on hand at the present time than we did pre-COVID. We also are investing in labor, as I mentioned earlier, and some less strong balance sheet and income statement competitors of ours aren't able to do that. They're holding on to get through, and we're hiring thousands of people, while Omicron is in our midst. And that's intentional.
And yes, it impacted our operating expenses in Q2, but it will position us to be able to serve our customers in a proper way, win new business. In that business, we intend to keep forever. So those are our ambitions. We are confident in our ability to do so. And yes, size and scale matter.
Last comment for me is digital before I toss to Aaron. One of our transformation investments is to improve our digital capabilities. So modern pricing software, substantial improvements to our website. We've made substantial improvements to our sales force guiding tool, which we call Salesforce 360, which literally guides the sales rep on what the job to be done is at that restaurant on that given visit. We've made substantial improvements to that tool, which have increased our sales consultant success rate on penetrating new cases and winning new lines of business with existing customers. So those types of investments, which are not immaterial, as Aaron quoted on the call today, $44 million worth of investments in those types of capabilities, we're going to distance ourselves from those that we compete with. 
Cost, Aaron, for additional comments."

The first is that the snapback costs we're calling out, they're transitory, short term are onetime in nature. And so we do not expect those to be long-term or even medium-term increases to our capital structure, and I want to emphasize our cost structure. And when I emphasize -- I want to emphasize something Kevin said earlier, which is wage rate increase increases are immaterial to our current results. And so there's not a -- those don't include structural changes, so to speak.
With respect to our transformation investments, we do -- we will continue to invest against the transformation -- and we'll provide more clarity on what that looks like in '23 when we get to '23 guidance.

I want to be clear on something that might not be obvious outside our company. There are certain customer types where our transaction with them is purely through the purchase of the food and how much the food costs. So Aaron just described that very well. And we're doing a good job in that regard for that customer type. We also have other customers that we transact from a fee per case basis. And it's in those contracts that -- there are times are provisions for food cost increases, but when our operating cost increase like they did in the most recent quarter, that's where we get pinched. And we are working aggressively on that. In fact, our SYGMA sector -- excuse me, SYGMA reporting segment -- our operating cost increased in SYGMA in the most recent quarter tied to the same reasons that I described earlier. We've got a plan to meaningfully improve the productivity within SYGMA as our staffing is improving. And also, we are looking at the long-term contracts that we have in those types of fee-per-case arrangements so that we have fairness and partnership with the customers that we work with in that reporting segment. So I hope that gives you some color where it's item price, yes, we can do what you described.

I hinted at this a little bit ago. We have 2 primary sectors that are still down meaningfully. We're not going to quote a percentage, but I'll say it down meaningfully and that's business and industry, and we're the leading food provider in that space. So we partner with foodservice management companies, and we are the primary distributor to those companies for offices, catering and the rest. So that sector is still down meaningfully. We had anticipated that, that sector was going to really kick in, in January and that did not occur. Most companies are still currently working from home. Those companies have actually stopped trying to predict when they're going to go back to working from the office. But we do anticipate progress being made in the year to go, but it will be a slower progress than we thought.
On the optimist longer-term view, it's additional tailwind fuel at Sysco. And what we've said is we'd be getting to flat volume to '19 kind of inclusive of our current business performance and trends that got delayed because of Omicron, as Aaron said very well in his prepared remarks. But we have tailwinds still in front of us on that business and industry.
And the second is travel and hospitality. Again, we are a very large player in the travel and hospitality space. Business travel currently down significantly. Leisure travel performed quite well last summer. We anticipate this summer will be a very strong leisure travel summer. But business travel conferences and the like that drives a big portion of that business isn't meaningfully recovered yet, and that will also be a further tailwind for us into the future."

Today, I chose to focus on Sysco Your Way and Italian cuisine, just to keep my prepared remarks short, but we've got progress happening on all 5 elements of our Recipe for Growth. And for sure, we're making meaningful progress in personalization. It starts with data. Treasure troves of data of purchasing patterns and purchasing behavior and that data is now in the cloud. We've got machine learning and artificial intelligence technology going against that data to provide customers with offers that are unique to them, and those offers are now showing up through our Sysco shop platform. And the customer almost doesn't even know that it's happening. And that's what's brilliant about end of 1 personalization. And when we say 1, I mean, each specific customer getting an offer that's unique for them. I can assure you we're the only food service distributor that is doing that.
The second point, though, is our sales rep activation, which I mentioned briefly a moment ago. We've got the best trained sales team in the industry, and they are experts in food. These are chefs. These are former restaurant owners. We're now though teeing up for them, hey, as you're heading into the Bar & Grill on Main Street, this is specifically what they haven't been buying from us. Here's an offer specific for you for today only that you can talk to that customer about. There's a sample that will be on the next truck. There's a Sysco brand selling opportunity to save them money. And just the power of that data being provided to our sales reps and also to the customer through Sysco shop, it's going to increase penetration with existing customers, which is the best way to improve profitability for a distributor like us. But it's also going to enable us to win new business. As it relates to Sysco shop now being able to provide pricing at the item level for someone even before they have begun ordering from Sysco. That's a first for us.
Tied to your customer adoption question, that's a very good one. In the future, we will talk to you about our loyalty program. It's called Sysco Perks.

Second, I will provide some color on the current state of our business and the COVID environment. Third, I will detail our continued share gains despite a difficult macro environment. And finally, I will outline our approach to the long game with some highlights of our Recipe for Growth transformation. I'll then turn over to Aaron to discuss our financial results in more detail.
So let's get started with our financial results displayed on Slide 4. Earlier this morning, Sysco reported fiscal second quarter results that were fueled by substantial top line momentum and an acceleration of market share gains. Our sales and volume performance success is a testament to our supply chain strength and the advancement of our Recipe for Growth. Our operating expenses for the period were elevated due to the effects of COVID on our business, and as a result, our bottom line results were below our expectations this quarter. 
Key headlines for the quarter include strong sales results and market share gains. We delivered growth of more than 1.2x the market, which exceeded our expectations for the period. We delivered sales growth of 10.5% versus 2019 and sequential volume improvements throughout the quarter until the Omicron variant impacted our December performance. More on Omicron in a moment. 
As I mentioned, operational expenses within our supply chain were above expectations due to the challenges that COVID is presenting to our labor environment and our transportation costs. I will detail this complex operating environment in a moment, but we remain confident these incremental expenses driven by labor costs are near-term challenges that will improve over time. Our strong sales results and elevated operating expenses resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 for the quarter. 
We further advanced our Recipe for Growth strategy which we believe will uniquely position Sysco to win in the marketplace for the long term. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment. That strategic and economic reality will enable Sysco to outperform the market for quarters and years to come.
Topic 2 for today, an update on the state of the business. As I mentioned a moment ago, COVID continues to negatively impact supply chains across the globe, and the effect was elevated in Q2 relative to our first quarter. The impact is being felt in product availability shortages from our suppliers and higher-than-anticipated labor and transportation costs. I would like to further explain some of the labor cost pressures that we are addressing.
At Sysco, we have hired thousands of new associates over the past quarter to support the recovery of our industry, which is coming faster and stronger than had been anticipated. We are also winning market share across our business sectors which adds to our hiring needs. As a result of our hiring and an industry-wide higher rate of associate turnover, we have a higher ratio of new associates in our labor population than we had originally planned. A higher population of less experienced associates has a direct negative impact on our supply chain productivity. The punchline is that our tenured associates perform at a much higher rate of productivity than new associates. With that said, we are confident that we can and will move our newer associates up the productivity curve over time.
We have also incurred higher-than-planned expenses as COVID-related illnesses accelerated in the quarter and have [ continued ] into January. To provide a sense of the magnitude of this disruption, nearly 10% of our U.S. workforce tested positive for COVID during the month of January and were out for a minimum of several days. To cover these absences, we invested in overtime and supplemental third-party resources to ensure that we properly supported our customers. 
At Sysco, we cannot let our health care, education, hospitality and important restaurant partners go without food because of these labor challenges caused by COVID. Our customer-centric approach to ensure that we can ship on time and in full will benefit our relationship with our customers for the long term, positively impacting retention and growth. We are confident that our service performance is stronger than the industry as measured by our Net Promoter Score. In fact, our NPS performance versus the market expanded in the quarter.
Lastly, as I mentioned, Omicron negatively impacted our top line performance starting the weekend after Thanksgiving. Our business in Europe was impacted first with the reintroduction of major restrictions on our customers. Our sales and volume performances in December were impacted by those restrictions, most notably in the U.K., France and Canada. For example, restaurants in the majority of Canada began closing for on-premise dining at the end of the second quarter with restrictions slowly starting to ease in February. These types of restrictions impact our customers' performance and ordering patterns. 
As a result, we expect the top line impact from Omicron to continue into the third quarter. The speed of the return to pre-Omicron volume levels is uncertain but we are seeing signs of progress in Europe as restrictions have begun easing. I would like to highlight again that Sysco sequentially improved sales and volume performance every month compared to 2019 levels until the impact of Omicron began being felt Thanksgiving weekend, and we are confident that we will get back to that growth pattern as Omicron recedes.
Topic 3, let's turn to our market share performance highlighted on Slide 5. Despite the challenges presented by Omicron at the end of the quarter, as you can see on Slide 5, Sysco delivered exceptional growth versus the market in the second quarter. As a result, we are now confident we will exceed our 1.2x the market growth target for the full fiscal year. Our performance versus the market expanded this quarter. Furthermore, looking back over the last 3 quarters, we are beginning to pull ahead of the industry.
The next slide from NPD shows how, over the last 2 years, we have consistently increased the percentage of customers that purchased exclusively from Sysco. This compares to the dotted line that shows the percentage of customers not yet buying from Sysco. You can see that the dotted line is steadily declining. These slides are just 2 more proof points that our team is winning in the marketplace and that our strategy is working.
Lastly, Topic 4, I will highlight examples in our business transformation and how that progress will enable consistent profitable growth. Today, I will give an update on 2 of our growth initiatives: Sysco Your Way and our Italian cuisine program. As a reminder, Sysco Your Way is a new service model that we are piloting to better serve what we call restaurant-dense neighborhoods. Through this program, we are providing our customers with enhanced levels of service and sales support. We are very pleased with the success of the pilot locations, and we will be expanding the program to net new neighborhoods in the spring of 2022.
In addition to Sysco Your Way, I would like to provide an update on our Italian cuisine platform work. As a reminder, Italian is one of the largest cuisine segments and Sysco historically underpenetrated with this important customer segment. We did not have an optimal assortment, and we lacked the go-to-market selling strategy to win. Our Greco acquisition has changed that capability in a meaningful way. 
First off, Greco is off to a great start and is exceeding our year 1 top and bottom line expectations. We are really pleased with the Greco business and the great work that they are doing. As importantly, we are leveraging the Greco product assortment and selling prowess and bringing the bestselling items to Sysco houses across the country. More on that in due course. Winning in the specialty sectors like Italian is a priority for our Recipe for Growth strategy.
Turning to Slide 7. In summary for the quarter, we are winning as a company in the marketplace. We are growing our business with new and existing customers. Our year-to-date growth is exceeding our 1.2x the industry target for the year and is being driven by our supply chain strength and our Recipe for Growth strategy. We also returned over $650 million of cash to our shareholders during the quarter. We are confident that the impact of our initiatives will grow over time, enabling us to consistently outperform the market at large.
As I wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to thank all of our associates at Sysco. These past 2 years have been challenging. We continue to lead the industry from a service perspective and make deliveries to our customers regardless of the COVID conditions. I am proud of our sales, operations and global support center teams for their persistence and customer focus that they have displayed. I really want to thank them for their tenacity and I'll use another word, endurance. I am honored to serve these associates and work by their side.
I would also like to welcome the recently appointed members of our Board of Directors: Ali Dibadj, Jill Golder and Alison Kenney Paul. Together, they bring deep industry experience; a modern skills inventory, including finance, consumer; and digital and strategy capabilities. Our 3 new Board members will be extremely valuable to Sysco in our transformation for years to come.
I'll now turn it over to Aaron who'll provide additional financial details before we open it up for questions."

Good morning. Here are our second quarter fiscal 2022 financial headlines as seen on Slide 9: sales growth of 41.2% compared to last year, also up 10.5% versus fiscal 2019, leading to our highest Q2 sales ever; good management of our product cost inflation, recording the highest gross profit in absolute dollar terms for any Q2 at Sysco; a doubling of adjusted operating income and a 62.9% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year, notwithstanding a cost environment which worsened during the quarter; continued investment against our long-term Recipe for Growth with $44 million of operating expense investments against our strategic investments, creating momentum with our commercial capabilities; proactive action on the COVID-generated labor and safety environments in which we are operating with $73 million in transitory snapback operating investments such as recruiting costs, hiring marketing, vaccination promotion, contract labor and sign-on and retention bonuses in the quarter. 
And while the magnitude was greater than we could foresee last quarter, we experienced productivity challenges and much higher overtime costs in the quarter, resulting from the pandemic-related workforce transition and our prioritization of customer service. With respect to our capital allocation, we refinanced elements of our long-term debt during the quarter, and we returned $657 million of cash to shareholders. With those headlines on the table, let's turn to some details on the financials for the quarter and some thoughts on our outlook.
Second quarter sales were $16.3 billion, an increase of 41.2% from fiscal 2021 and a 10.5% increase from fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice, showed excellent progress, up 45.1% versus fiscal 2021 and up 14% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the pre-Thanksgiving and pre-Omicron resurgence in volumes and sales. Local case volume within the subset of USFS, our U.S. Broadline operations, increased 17.6% while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 22.5%. SYGMA sales were up 16.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up 15.3% versus fiscal 2019 even with the large customer rationalization we disclosed earlier, which we expect will be complete on a comparable basis following Q3.
International sales were up 43% versus fiscal 2021 and down approximately 3% versus fiscal 2019. Sales trends were accelerating nicely in our international segment before the onset of Omicron and restrictions in our key international markets such as the U.K., and we are watching post-lockdown trends carefully. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 0.3% on Sysco's sales results. We continue to monitor the impact on our customers and on our business as international restrictions are starting to ease, including in Ireland and the U.K. Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 14.6% in our U.S. Broadline business.
Gross profit for the enterprise was approximately $3 billion in the second quarter, increasing 37.8% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and also exceeding gross profit in fiscal 2019 by 4%. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal '21 and compared to the same quarter in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in gross profit dollars per case across all 4 of our reporting segments as we successfully managed increased costs from our product suppliers while addressing some but not all of our increased operating costs. Gross margin rate was 17.7% during the quarter with the margin rate math impacted by product inflation. Of course, it is gross profit dollars that count in an inflationary environment.
Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense came in at $2.4 billion with a combination of planned and unexpected expense increases from the prior year really driven by 4 things: first, the increased variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes; second, as you can see on Slide 10, more than $73 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, which we expect to decline in the third quarter. While we have increased wages in select locations, those increases are not material and have the opportunity to be offset by productivity and cost-out improvements going forward; third, $44 million of purposeful operating expense investments against our Recipe for Growth initiatives, like personalization, digital sales tools and assortment capabilities, which remain on track to be elevated for the rest of the year; and fourth, the productivity expense challenges Kevin referenced earlier, including ramp-up time associated with new hire productivity in our warehouses and trucks, elevated overtime and third-party labor support in the face of staff absences. 
 
I want to emphasize that the management team at Sysco has been aggressive in pursuing the root cause of the cost increases. While the transformation continues unabated, the team has also pushed hard to identify and action incremental profit opportunities and cost reduction initiatives which should help the company in the back half and beyond as the environment stabilizes. Together, the snapback investments and the transformation costs totaled approximately $116 million of operating expenses this quarter and negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.17. All in, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 14.7%, which is flat from fiscal 2019 and down 145 basis points from fiscal 2021. Our cost-out efforts are meaningfully benefiting our P&L, and we continue to assess and execute against new cost-out projects each quarter.
Finally, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted operating income increased $262 million from last year to $496 million. This was primarily driven by a 45% improvement in U.S. foodservice and continued progress on profitability from international partially offset by SYGMA. The second quarter SYGMA operating loss was driven by higher-than-expected labor costs, which will be offset in future quarters by specific actions already taken by the SYGMA management team. Adjusted earnings per share increased $0.40 to $0.57 for the second quarter compared to last year.
Now let me share a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $377 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by our higher income and lower interest, offset by higher tax payments and a significant investment in working capital. Net CapEx was $175.9 million, somewhat lower than expected given increased lead times on fleet and equipment. Adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $201 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand.
As seen on Slide 15, our results this quarter also reflected incremental progress against our capital allocation priorities. This included the further strengthening of our balance sheet by successfully refinancing debt during the quarter at longer maturities and more attractive rates, lowering our adjusted interest expense costs going forward. 
We also commenced our share repurchase program during the second quarter and repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares for a total of $416 million at an average share price of $72.30. This was in addition to paying our quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share in October. We remain committed to growing our dividend and as previously communicated, plan to next address decisions around our dividend per share during our fiscal Q4. While our track record goes back decades, as you can see on Slide 16, over the last 7 years cumulatively, we have returned over $12 billion of cash to shareholders.
Let's turn now to the look forward. Our Recipe for Growth transformation plan is on track. However, Omicron had a noticeable impact on our December and Q2 results, continuing into January and now February. As a result, we are reaffirming our long-term guidance that for fiscal 2024, Sysco will deliver adjusted EPS growth of at least 30% over our record 2019 EPS of $3.55. We are updating our view of the back half to reflect the realities of the disruption caused by Omicron and the labor environment. We expect to fall below our prior EPS guidance for fiscal year 2022. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS of approximately $3 to $3.10. This translates to adjusted EPS in the back half of about $1.60 to $1.70.
In a typical pre-COVID fiscal year, adjusted EPS for our second half is generally weighted around 40% to Q3 and 60% in Q4 due to normal seasonality of our business. This year, we expect our second half profitability to be weighted even more to the fourth quarter. We expect a stronger Q4 this year relative to Q3 as a result of anticipated volume recovery, lower snapback expenses, improved operating productivity and specific actions we are taking to offset Omicron. In offering this perspective, we are assuming no further COVID variant disruptions to our operating environment.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks."

First, this quarter included substantial top line momentum and an acceleration of our market share gains. We are winning in the marketplace, and we have confidence that we will continue to win share. 
With that said, Q2 presented challenges from Omicron on both our top and bottom line. Our sequential volume growth progress stalled post Thanksgiving, and that headwind has continued into January. More importantly, COVID-related staffing disruptions increased our operating expenses for the quarter. As a result, our bottom line results were below our expectations.
Second, despite the short-term impact of Omicron on our business, we are confident that we will resume our volume improvement as soon as the variant recedes, and we can see green shoots of progress in February from a volume perspective. As it relates to expenses, we have a management plan to improve our year-to-go operating expenses. We are meaningfully focused on improving associate retention, training and productivity. These activities are a core competency of Sysco, and our experienced field leadership team has a plan to deliver improvement for the remainder of the year.
Third, we remain confident in the long-term trajectory at Sysco. And as Aaron stated, we are reaffirming our long-term guidance that includes significant sales and EPS growth. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term. The customer-first solutions we are developing will enable us to grow our share profitably and also enable Sysco to be more efficient. There are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I am proud to be part of the journey.

I'm going to refer you back to our earlier remarks on pieces of that and then provide a couple of additional supplements. What was remarkable to us was the progress we were making up through the Thanksgiving holiday on the top line and indeed against the overall plan. With the onset of Omicron, we start to see the impact on volumes and certainly on our operating expenses. 
For the quarter, we incurred $73 million of snapback costs, which is the combination of contract labor, retention bonuses, sign-on bonuses, training, vaccination credits, et cetera. We also incurred more than $40 million on transformation costs. But what's not in those 2 numbers that I referenced in the script is $40 million of overtime and other productivity impacts driven by both our response ensuring that we're serving the customer but also then us working with the labor force in transition."

Again, we were sequentially improving each and every month, taking market share. As evidenced by our slide chart, we're really beginning to pull away from the rest of the market, so winning in aggregate. 
December was impacted. January was impacted because the restrictions were in place for all of January. We are beginning to see some signs of progress or green shoots in February as restrictions begin to ease but we're not fully yet back to the pre-Omicron levels. We have 50% restaurant restriction for on-premise dining in Canada. We have mandatory work-from-home work -- orders in France and in the U.K. And then in northern urban locations within the United States, still heavy, heavy work from home, which impacts daypart restaurant traffic, as you well know. So we're not quite back to where we were. 
What we are very confident in is as the restrictions on our customers ease, vaccine passports and things like that, mask mandates that impact people's psychology tied to going out, as those things ease, we see fast recovery from our customers. And we're prepared from an inventory perspective, we're prepared from a staffing perspective, we're prepared from a service level perspective to be able to serve when our customers are ready.

And you can see it in our performance results, that just our inventory management is significantly improved from 2 years ago when COVID first began. 
The second is in labor strategy. One of the things that -- I made the call with full support of our Board back in December when Omicron began impacting we were not going to furlough associates, our staff. That would be a penny-wise, dollar-foolish decision. Pennies that we could save from furloughing staff in December and January would cost us twice as much as we attempted to restock the bench and bring people back off furlough because in today's labor environment, we furlough someone, they're going to get a job in another industry at another company. So we made that very purposeful choice to not furlough any staff, not a single person over that period of time, December and January. That will pay dividends for our company. 
My guess would be smaller, less capitalized companies are not fortunate enough to be able to make those types of decisions. In fact, not only did we not furlough anyone, we hired thousands of people in our Q2 and have continued hiring December into January. At this moment in time, we literally have hundreds of drivers in the passenger seat of a truck getting trained on Sysco standards, Sysco processes, and they will be ready to be driving their own truck as the volume recovery begins because keep in mind that there's an entire sector that we serve that isn't yet even back in business sufficiently. And that's what we call business and industry. 
We had been anticipating that the business and industry sector would have kicked in, in January as most companies were planning a return to work after the holidays. That has not occurred, as you know, and that's future tailwind to the Sysco recovery as business and industry will begin kicking back in here. It's hard to predict when, but we will be prepared, we'll be ready. Alex, those are just a handful of things that are -- that we do different from March of 2020, and we've gotten pretty agile at dealing with these curveballs.

As you know, it's been double digit now for longer than any of us in the industry would like. We have not seen yet a reduction in consumer demand tied to that higher inflation, and it's hard to predict how long that will be able to persist. 
But we're not seeing elasticity of pricing impact consumer purchasing, and that is a positive. That has obviously helped our P&L. In the most recent quarter, as Aaron said, we increased GP dollars per case in each of our reportable segments. So we're doing a good job of passing through inflation. 
We're also doing a good job of helping our customers find lower-cost alternatives, so menu suggestions, narrowing the number of items on the menu so they can increase their profitability; portion size, as you know, optimization so that they can keep their ticket on the menu the same and do so from a lower COGS to them. So those things are going well. 
Protein is even higher than the overall basket of inflation. We need to see progress on supplier availability in protein. It's a priority for Sysco. We are working with our supplier partners in the protein category to work on longer-range forecasts so they have consistency of purchase volume from Sysco so that they can be efficient in their production. And we are working as hard as we can to find additional sources of supplies in the protein category because we need to bring the protein inflation down, John. That's the #1 focus for us from an inflation perspective.
As it relates to the second half of your question, which was can we grow faster than 1.5, we're pleased to report today that we are exceeding our goal for this year, which was 1.2. Prior quarter, we had said we are on track to deliver 1.2x. So those words matter. We changed our words from on track to exceed. We are confident we will exceed the 1.2x this year. 
Our third year goal of our 3-year plan, which is fiscal 2024, remains at this time at 1.5x. Do I have confidence we can do better than that? We'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but we like our strategy. It's winning in the marketplace. If you look at the chart in our prepared remarks, you can see the pulling away from the industry, and I don't anticipate that slowing down."

I'll answer directly as asked and then I'm going to add one point that we believe is on investors' minds tied to this. First and foremost, scale matters in this industry meaningfully. So purchasing scale matters so we can get b",567,"Jake, it's a good question. I'll answer directly as asked and then I'm going to add one point that we believe is on investors' minds tied to this. First and foremost, scale matters in this industry meaningfully. So purchasing scale matters so we can get best possible costs, so we can share value with our customers. Scale matters from a physicality perspective. 
So we have more distribution centers in the United States, our primary country, than anyone else, which means our last-mile delivery is a shorter route, a more dense route than others. And as we continue to grow, Aaron and I will make appropriate investments in incremental physical capabilities to put us even closer to the customer, which will lower our cost to serve. And you can see the flywheel that comes from the size, breadth and scale of Sysco, and we believe that will become an increasing strength capability over time. Because of the cash generation of this company and our strong balance sheet, we have the ability to invest in net new facilities to lower that cost to serve last-mile delivery. So we believe it will be an increasing strength formula for our company.
One of the questions that we believe is on investors' minds is, ""Kevin, aren't you worried about labor costs?"" Everyone we talked to is talking about labor costs going up. I just want to be clear on this topic. Labor wage rate is immaterial to the cost pressure that we experienced in Q2. I'll repeat that. The labor wage rate was immaterial in our Q2. 
Our wage -- excuse me, our operating cost pressure in this past quarter if you had to single it down to like the biggest thing was the percentage of people working for us that are new, tied to the hiring. And there was more turnover that occurred this past summer than is typical in our industry, tied to what some people call the Great Resignation. So we are working feverishly on improving associate retention, improving training of our associates, improving the productivity of our associates. As I mentioned, this is our core competence. This is what we do, and we are confident we will move up the productivity ladder. 
As Aaron said, that will be more Q4 impactful than Q3 because it takes time. As I mentioned earlier -- I gave a decent piece of color. When you start as a driver in our company, you're in the passenger seat for weeks, learning Sysco standards, learning our customer relations interface because that driver is the face of this company and also, of course, learning the challenging type of driving, which is mostly backing up to restaurant locations that our drivers have to do. So those investments we're making will reduce over time, which is why we are confident that we will improve our productivity, which will then begin to flow through to improved EBIT percent margin. So I just want to be clear. Labor rate increase is not something that is causing our current operating cost pressure.
As you look to the future, will that change? We do anticipate when we do our annual review process, that we will have a nominally higher wage rate increase provided to our associates. They work hard, they deserve to be paid fairly and appropriately. And we have productivity improvement efforts that can help offset those types of increases."

I think I said a couple of quarters ago, we've rehired 100% of people that we furloughed back in March from a supply chain perspective. So we've been fully open for business now for a long time and we're growing. So we're taking market share. We're winning new customers. Our sales are obviously well above '19. Our volumes, we anticipate, will be back to and then above '19 in the not-too-distant future. So we've got the open to hire shingle out there. In fact, we're getting much more effective at recruiting for open positions. Our marketing team is getting more sophisticated on how to target applicants, and we're getting better and better at training them. 
But in the future, to specifically answer your question, Jake, we're actually going to have to go to people from outside this industry to meet the hiring needs and hiring demands that we have. It's why we formed our driver academy. Just a little bit of color on that. We're now live in 2 physical driver academy locations. Our first CDL class has graduated from our driver academy. And we think we're going to have to eat our own cooking, pun intended, where we're going to have to find people who aren't today CDL class drivers, teach them the trade, train them and then have them work for a long time for Sysco. And again, that's an example of size and scale matter. 
We pay people to participate in that program, whereas, today, if you were an average person wanting to become a driver and you enter driver school, you actually have to pay the driver school. So think about that flip from having to go -- from having to pay to attend and lose time working to we actually pay you to attend the Sysco Driver Academy. And we're bullish about that and expanding that opportunity across the country. Jake, thank you for the questions."

The green shoot comment that I made was actually tied to cases -- excuse me, case volume, therefore, and sales beginning to improve. That's what that comment was tied to. As restrictions begin to ease -- Canada just in February has relaxed. They still have a very onerous restriction in place, which is 50% on-prem dining, but it was like literally restaurants were closed in Canada. In the GTA, Greater Toronto Area, in Quebec province, you couldn't eat at a restaurant for the month of January. So those restrictions have begun easing. 
In the U.K. and France, the restrictions have been very heavy, mandatory work from home. We're seeing restrictions ease there. And the green shoot comment was tied to as those restrictions ease, we can see a recovery of the business and a return of volume. 
And then in the U.S., I didn't give this color commentary. The southern 1/3 of the United States continues to perform very well. The headwind in the U.S. is in the urban centers in the north. And we anticipate recovery being made in those environments as, again, restrictions in these -- that's mostly a city mayor decision, as the restrictions they're putting on customers ease.
Point two, where else will progress come from? So we do expect volume and sales to make progress in Q3 and certainly into Q4. But operating expenses, we have a plan. We have a management action plan to address our operating expenses. It's a 5-part plan. I'll cover 3 quickly and then I'll toss to Aaron who will cover 2. 
First and foremost, it's about retention, training and productivity. We need to move the new hires up the productivity curve, and we are maniacally focused on improving that new hire productivity. Topic 2 is transportation efficiency. There's gold in them hills, we like to say, on ensuring that the trucks are being routed most optimally. There's work we can do, it's pick-and-shovel work, to ensure that our transportation efficiency is operating at the highest level. 
The third is Sysco Brand, the question that came up earlier in today's conversation from Alex. We are making progress in Sysco Brand. It will be a big focus in the year to go, and we anticipate profit improvement in the year to go tied to increasing penetration of Sysco Brand.
And I'll toss to Aaron for the 2 other topics we're addressing. Aaron, over to you."

If we go back to the beginning of COVID, fast food, QSR drive-thru, meaningful share winner. And you could see that in our SYGMA reportable segment for last year. SYGMA had a record year in both top line and bottom line in part because SYGMA indexes towards obviously serving that customer type. That was year 1 of COVID.
Year 2 of COVID, the big winners are the sophisticated restaurant chains that have a digital app that allows -- to go ordering that allows paperless -- contactless payment, I meant to say, and just frictionless ease of purchase and really loyalty. One of the things we're working on at Sysco is personalization. Well, there are select retailers -- or excuse me, restaurants, I won't name the names of them, that have pretty fantastic loyalty programs that prompt their customers to buy more from them and come back to their restaurants more often. Those are the big winners at this point in time.
As it relates to Sysco and how we can help the mom-and-pop, this is the sweet spot of who we are. So we are helping independent restaurants figure out how to connect to a delivery partner. We help them with a creation of a mobile version of their menu so that customers can shop remotely and pick up or take out. And also, we're helping them with things like contactless payment in the restaurant. 
So we have the largest sales force in the industry, and that literally is what they do. They don't just sell food. They consult with mom-and-pops to help them compete more effectively with some of the larger companies. And we believe that will earn loyalty to Sysco over time. We believe that will increase Sysco's stickiness. And I refer you back to the chart in our slide deck that talked about the percentage of Sysco customers now buying just from us and then the percentage of customers that weren't previously buying from us, and both of those indices are improving steadily.
So we're confident in the long term of the mom-and-pop independents. There are many of them out there, and we can help them succeed. And we believe that Sysco's independent customers are going to outperform the mom-and-pop that does not partner with Sysco. In fact, we've got data that shows that, in fact, is the case, and our sales reps use that in their selling process.
Point 2 is will inflation more negatively impact mom-and-pops. I would say yes, but then I would call it back to the Sysco thesis and why does a national chain perhaps have more mitigating buffering. Many of them have long-term supplier contracts with fixed pricing and/or scales tied to inflation, and the mom-and-pop has less of that. But that's what we are. 
We are essentially their purchasing agent. We are pushing back hard on cost increases, as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions from the other John, is what are we doing about this inflation component. We are working aggressively to find alternative suppliers, alternative items, lower-cost items that could be substituted too. And again, that's what motivates us at Sysco, is to serve that mom-and-pop. And we've got a lot of good things happening to help them with their inflation, which includes Sysco Brand, and our mom-and-pop restaurant customers love Sysco Brand for the fact that it saves them time and saves them money. And we anticipate making progress in that regard as well."

Aaron and I have invested to ensure that we have more inventory on hand at the present time than we did pre COVID. We also are investing in labor, as I mentioned earlier. And some less strong balance sheet and income statement competitors of ours aren't able to do that. They're holding on to get through. And we're hiring thousands of people while Omicron is in our midst, and that's intentional.
And yes, it impacted our operating expenses in Q2, but it will position us to be able to serve our customers in a proper way, win new business. And that's business we intend to keep forever. So those are our ambitions. We are confident in our ability to do so. And yes, size and scale matter.
Last comment for me is digital before I toss to Aaron. One of our transformation investments is to improve our digital capabilities, so modern pricing software, substantial improvements to our website. We've made substantial improvements to our sales force guiding tool, which we call [ Salesforce 360 ], which literally guides the sales rep on what the job to be done is at that restaurant on that given visit. We've made substantial improvements to that tool, which have increased our sales consultant success rate on penetrating new cases and winning new lines of business with existing customers. So those types of investments which are not immaterial, as Aaron quoted on the call today, $44 million worth of investments in those types of capabilities, were going to distance ourselves from those that we compete with. 
I'd toss to Aaron for additional comments."

We're going to get through the back half of this year and then we're going to work towards the long-term guidance. That important qualifier aside, a couple of observations.
The first is that the snapback costs we're calling out, they're transitory, short term or onetime in nature. And so we do not expect those to be long-term or even medium-term increases to our capital structure. And I want to -- or to our cost structure. And when I emphasize -- I want to emphasize something Kevin said earlier, which is wage rate increases are immaterial to our current results. And so there's not a -- those don't include structural changes, so to speak.
With respect to our transformation investments, we do -- we will continue to invest against the transformation. And we'll provide more clarity on what that looks like in '23 when we get to '23 guidance. Important caveat though, I think I've said before, let me say it again now, our -- we will continue to invest in the transformation.

As far as how far we go, it's a choice we have to make in the context of the environment where we're in.

I want to be clear on something that might not be obvious outside our company. There are certain customer types where our transaction with them is purely through the purchase of the food and how much the food costs. So Aaron just described that very well. And we're doing a good job in that regard for that customer type. 
We also have other customers that we transact from a fee per case basis. And it's in those contracts that, there are times, our provisions for food cost increases. But when our operating costs increase like they did in the most recent quarter, that's where we get pinched. And we are working aggressively on that. 
In fact, our SYGMA sector -- excuse me, SYGMA reporting segment -- our operating cost increased in SYGMA in the most recent quarter, tied to the same reasons that I described earlier. We've got a plan to meaningfully improve the productivity within SYGMA as our staffing is improving. And also, we are looking at the long-term contracts that we have in those types of fee-per-case arrangements so that we have fairness and partnership with the customers that we work with in that reporting segment. 
So I hope that gives you some color. Where it's item price, yes, we can do what you described. And if it's a fee per case, it's actually a conversation with our customers and that partnership -- long-term relationship management that I referenced a second ago."

We're not going to quote a percentage but I'll say down meaningfully. And that's business and industry, and we're the leading food provider in that space. So we partner with foodservice management companies, and we are the primary distributor to those companies for offices, catering and the rest. 
So that sector is still down meaningfully. We had anticipated that, that sector was going to really kick in, in January, and that did not occur. Most companies are still currently working from home. Those companies have actually stopped trying to predict when they're going to go back to working from the office. But we do anticipate progress being made in the year to go, but it will be a slower progress than we thought.
On the optimist longer-term view, it's additional tailwind fuel at Sysco. And what we've said is we'd be getting to flat volume to '19 kind of inclusive of our current business performance and trends that got delayed because of Omicron, as Aaron said very well in his prepared remarks. But we have tailwinds still in front of us on that business and industry.
The second is travel and hospitality. Again, we are a very large player in the travel and hospitality space. Business travel's currently down significantly. Leisure travel performed quite well last summer. We anticipate this summer will be a very strong leisure travel summer. But business travel conferences and the like that drives a big portion of that business isn't meaningfully recovered yet, and that will also be a further tailwind for us into the future."

Today, I chose to focus on Sysco Your Way and Italian cuisine just to keep my prepared remarks short, but we've got progress happening on all 5 elements of our Recipe for Growth. And for sure, we're making meaningful progress in personalization. 
It starts with data, treasure troves of data of purchasing patterns and purchasing behavior. And that data is now in the cloud. We've got machine learning and artificial intelligence technology going against that data to provide customers with offers that are unique to them, and those offers are now showing up through our Sysco Shop platform. And the customer almost doesn't even know that it's happening, and that's what's brilliant about N of 1 personalization. And when we say N of 1, it means each specific customer is getting an offer that's unique for them. I can assure you we're the only foodservice distributor that is doing that.
The second point though is our sales rep activation, which I mentioned briefly a moment ago. We've got the best trained sales team in the industry, and they are experts in food. These are chefs. These are former restaurant owners. We're now though teeing up for them, ""Hey, as you're heading into the bar and grill on Main Street, this is specifically what they haven't been buying from us. Here's an offer specific for you for today only that you can talk to that customer about. There's a sample that will be on the next truck. There's a Sysco Brand selling opportunity to save them money."" 
And just the power of that data being provided to our sales reps and also to the customer through Sysco Shop, it's going to increase penetration with existing customers, which is the best way to improve profitability for a distributor like us. But it's also going to enable us to win new business as it relates to Sysco Shop now being able to provide pricing at the item level for someone even before they have begun ordering from Sysco. That's a first for us.
Tied to your customer adoption question, that's a very good one. In the future, we will talk to you about our loyalty program. It's called Sysco Perks. That is an actual loyalty program that we are enrolling people into. And today, I'm not prepared to give an update on that endeavor other than the pilot is going well, and more to come at a future update on the expansion plans of that pilot."

Thank you for joining our call.

Thank you for joining our call. Our financial performance this quarter exceeded our internal expectations, driven by strong top line performance, accelerating market share gains, solid gross margin management and improvement in our operations expenses. Earlier today, we raised our full year guidance, and Aaron will walk you through the details in just a few moments. 
Our strong performance for the quarter demonstrates our focus on the customer and the advancement of our Recipe for Growth strategy. Simply put, we are winning in the marketplace. The best measure of this success is the continued market share gains that we are delivering. Our performance versus the market accelerated in the quarter, and we solidly exceeded our fiscal 2022 goal of growing 1.2x the market.
I will highlight 3 topics during our call today: first, I will touch on our financial results; second, I'll discuss the state of the current operating environment; and finally, I will highlight progress from our Recipe for Growth transformation. I'll then turn it over to Aaron to discuss our financial results in more detail. So let's get started with our financial results displayed on Slide #4. 
Our third quarter results were fueled by strong top line performance across the U.S. and international segments and progress made in lowering operating expenses as a percentage of sales. As a result, our profit results were ahead of our internal expectations this quarter. While our operational expenses remain elevated versus our historical standards, we've begun making progress in improving our productivity. We will continue to make progress in the coming quarters.
Key headlines this quarter include: market share gains that significantly exceeded our 1.2x the market growth target; significant volume improvements with U.S. Broadline volume up approximately 19% versus the same period in fiscal year 2021; and our USFS business delivering volume growth versus 2019 in total. This also included another quarter of profitable growth coming from our International segment. 
Our expense structure is improving. As I mentioned, we still have work to do in order to return to our standard of excellence but we have begun making progress. Importantly, our snapback investments were reduced by more than 50% versus the prior quarter. Our strong sales results and continued progress in improving operating expenses drove solid profit growth. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 for the quarter. 
We achieved these results while meaningfully advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. This included successfully closing on the Coastal Companies transaction during the quarter, further expanding our industry-leading produce business that is high growth at attractive margins. 
Topic 2 for today, an update on the current environment. The third quarter started with COVID-related disruptions from the Omicron variant. Recall that the negative impact from Omicron started in late November and the effects were felt through February. Sysco delivered a strong quarter of growth despite the headwind from Omicron. Two factors played to our favor: a strong market rebound in late February and into March and Sysco winning market share throughout the entire quarter. Combined, these factors enabled both our U.S. and international businesses to deliver volumes greater than our internal forecast for the period. As I mentioned a moment ago, volume in our U.S. Foodservice operations exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels for the quarter. The positive momentum was strong across geographies as well as across different customer types. With that said, we expect additional momentum over time from improved international volume as the recovery in the food-away-from-home market strengthens internationally. 
At Sysco, we have 2 business sectors that remain heavily impacted by COVID, business and industry, which includes customers such as office cafeterias and travel and hospitality, which is heavily impacted by conferences and large group catering events. We anticipate both segments making progress this summer and into the fall. For example, many major employers have begun returning to the office, and recent reports from airline and hotel CEOs have cited steadily improving bookings for this summer. 
An advantage of Sysco is that we are fully diversified across the food-away-from-home business. While high cost of fuel is being felt by our customers, we have not experienced a reduction of consumer demand. The fact that we cover all restaurant types up and down the price point spectrum provides us some protection in an unpredictable economy. Additionally, the pricing relationship between food-at-home and food-away-from-home is favorable to Sysco versus historical relationships, as you can see on Slide 6 in our presentation. With that said, we remain concerned about the long-term effect of elevated inflation, and we are taking strong actions to manage the situation. 
We are actively working to improve cost of goods sold inbound to Sysco so that we can pass along value to our customers. We are aggressively pursuing Sysco brand penetration opportunities as we know that Sysco products save our customers money. We are also working aggressively with our customers to help them with their menu design and, therefore, helping these customers find alternatives to step around highly inflationary items in sub categories. We're also helping them to have confidence in their menu pricing strategies. This work helps us go earn trust and respect with our large customer base. 
In regards to our supply chain, I'd like to report that conditions are improving. Applicant flow to open positions has increased, and our talent acquisition team has helped us make progress in improving our staffing health. As a result, we have been able to reduce associate overtime and improve our service levels to our customers over the past quarter. Our NPS, or net promoter score, results this quarter improved and continue to lead versus the market. It is still a very dynamic environment, but the size and scale advantages of Sysco are enabling us to succeed in a turbulent environment. 
Topic 3 for today, I'll provide select highlights of our Recipe for Growth progress. Last quarter, I provided an update on 2 of our growth initiatives: Sysco Your Way and our Italian cuisine platform. These 2 initiatives continue to progress well, driving profitable growth for the company. We expanded Sysco Your Way to additional neighborhoods in the quarter, and the recently added locations are performing consistent with the strong results from our pilot locations. 
Today, I'd like to provide an update on 2 additional topics, our supply chain transformation and progress that we are making in consultative sales. As I mentioned, our supply chain health has improved over the past quarter as applicant flow to our open jobs has improved and we're beginning to make progress in operations productivity. Improving the efficiency of our supply chain is a top priority for our entire leadership team. 
To ensure that we succeed at a higher level in the future, we are making substantial commitments to improve our associate experience within operations. A great example is our Driver Academy, which is now up and running in full swing. We've graduated our first class of drivers, and we have opened additional academy locations. We expect to be nationwide with this capability by the end of the calendar year. The Driver Academy will enable us to provide upward career path mobility for our warehouse associates and improve associate retention in this critical driver role. 
Our graduates are able to increase their career earnings potential by upskilling and becoming certified drivers. At Sysco, we pay a leading and competitive driver wage, and we are making the certification process easier, removing the barriers and costs of becoming certified. This action will open the door for more of our associates to advance their careers. The Driver Academy is a win-win-win for our associates, for Sysco and for our customers. 
Additionally, over the past quarter, we have converted our operations from an industry traditional 5-day workweek to a full 6-day delivery model. This might sound like a small endeavor but the reality is quite the opposite. We made the change to a full 6-day model for the following reasons. The change is better for our associates. Why? We have converted our associates from a standard 5-day schedule to a more work-life-friendly 4-day workweek. This will improve associate retention over time. The 6-day workweek increases the efficiency of our operations by further utilizing our physical assets, enabling us to better sweat the assets of our trucks and buildings. 
The model increases our weekly throughput and also provides us more flex capacity on each and every day, enabling us to better handle fluctuations of demand. These changes to our supply chain will help make Sysco an even more preferred employer, and that will enable us to serve our customers. 
As important as having an efficient and flexible supply chain, we are continuing to advance the capabilities of our industry-leading sales teams. Our sales associates have the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry, and we want to increase that competitive advantage. We have worked hard over the past year to bring stronger digital tools to the selling process to enable the success of our sales teams. I want to be very clear that these digital tools do not reduce the importance or quantity of our sales staff. These tools are intended to assist our sales teams with their consultative selling process. 
Our technology team has built a system that provides each sales rep with a next best action to be presented to our customers. For some customers, this may be a conversion from a national brand product to a Sysco brand item, saving them money. For other customers, this may be the introduction of a promotional offer for a category perhaps they've not traditionally purchased from Sysco, like produce. For others still, the tool can identify items that our customer used to buy but are no longer placing in their shopping basket with Sysco. Our sales consultants are then prompted with offers and suggestions to specifically enable success against those use cases. The goal of this work is to increase the productivity of the customer visit. This work positively impacted our performance versus the market in Q3, which was our strongest volume growth quarter versus the market for the year. Slide 7 in our presentation makes a clear case of our progress in becoming a growth company. 
Lastly, our working commitments in corporate social responsibility, or CSR, were recently recognized by Sustainalytics and JUST Capital. This recognition is due in no small part to our recent announcement of a science-based climate goal that is aligned with SBTi. As the leader in our industry, we are proud to be the first and only U.S. foodservice distributor with a science-based climate goal. Research from the World Economic Forum suggests that companies who make progress in these important areas drive improved CSR over time compared to their peers. To ensure that we walk the walk, our Board is prepared to incorporate ESG as a part of our executive compensation program beginning next year. The work we are doing is the right thing to do, and we strongly believe that it is also good for our business and our investors. 
Turning to Slide 8. In summary for the quarter, Sysco is winning, leading the industry and accelerating growth. We are growing our business with new and existing customers. Our supply chain is performing better than the industry at large, and we are driving strategic initiatives to further increase that strength advantage. Our continued transformation investments are enhancing our commercial selling capabilities and we are investing in our associates. The improved profitability in the quarter is encouraging, but there is more work to be done as our team is focused on our Recipe for Growth strategy and improving operations productivity. I'll now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details before we open it up for questions."

We are upbeat on our business, and we have several notable headlines for our third quarter, as seen on Slide 10. Sales growth of almost 43% compared to the prior year, which is also up more than 15% versus 2019, reflecting resilient demand and sequential improvements month-over-month. We recorded more than $3 billion of gross profit, the highest gross profit in absolute dollar terms for any quarter at Sysco ever as we continued significant efforts to optimize our assortment in COGS while effectively managing our product cost inflation. 
Our investments in snapback operating costs dropped in the quarter by more than half from $73 million in Q2 to $35 million in Q3. As promised, the impact of our workforce transition on productivity improved. Incremental training and overtime is estimated to have cost us approximately $30 million in the third quarter, down from approximately $40 million in the second quarter, and we expect further improvements as we head into Q4. As an aside, I would note that the actions we're taking around productivity are actually serving to accelerate our supply chain transformation as part of the Recipe for Growth. 
We invested $48 million of operating expense against our strategic investments, creating momentum with our commercial capabilities. All in, adjusted operating income more than doubled and adjusted EBITDA increased almost 73% compared to last year. With those headlines on the table, I'm going to provide some details on the financials for the quarter and some thoughts on our outlook. 
Third quarter sales were $16.9 billion, an increase of 42.9% for fiscal 2021 and a 15.3% increase from fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice were up dramatically by 43.6% versus fiscal 2021 and up 18.8% versus fiscal 2019. Local case volume within the U.S. Broadline operations, a subset of U.S. Foodservice, increased 14.1%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 18.8% compared to last year. 
SYGMA sales were up 13.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up 16.8% versus fiscal 2019. International sales were up 64.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up approximately 3% versus fiscal 2019. Sales trends accelerated nicely in our International segment with lower Omicron cases and as government-related restrictions on our customers eased in the quarter. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of 0.7% on Sysco's sales results. 
Let me pause here and call out 1 point of progress for the year-to-date period. We are really pleased with the profit contribution and improvements coming from International. In the last 9 months, the business has delivered an adjusted operating income swing of $265 million year-over-year. 
Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 16% in our U.S. Broadline business. We have been able to actively manage the impact of product inflation and those efforts will continue. Gross profit for the enterprise was above $3 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 42% versus fiscal 2021, an increase of 9.4% versus fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal 2021 and compared to the same quarter in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in GP dollars per case across all segments as we successfully managed to increase costs from our product suppliers and acted to optimize our business processes and performance. Of note, the enterprise and U.S. Foodservice both reached all-time highs for Q3 gross profit dollars. 
Gross margin rate was 17.8% or 18% on an adjusted basis during the quarter, with the adjusted margin rate moving upward as the was still impacted by inflation. Of course, it is gross profit dollars that counts in an inflationary environment, and gross profit per case increased in all 4 segments. We are focused on price relevancy, being right on price and are doing the right things to cover our costs while also supporting our customers. 
Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion as we delivered progress on our multiyear cost-out program and improved snapback costs. As we touched on earlier and as you can see on Slide 15, operating costs this quarter were impacted by variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes, more than $35 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, $48 million of purposeful investments to further accelerate our Recipe for Growth initiatives, and lastly, the still present but improving expense challenges associated with new hire productivity. 
Despite the dynamic operating environment, we expect additional improvements for snapback costs and productivity expenses during the fourth quarter as we balance cost reduction initiatives with continued transformation investments. Together, the snapback investments and the productivity-related costs totaled approximately $65 million of operating expenses this quarter. That's important because the simple math would say that these transitory expenses had a downward impact to our adjusted EPS of approximately $0.10, further proving our point that there is further opportunity for profit improvement in the future for Sysco as Q3 adjusted EPS without these expenses would have already exceeded 2019 levels. All in, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 14.6%, which was flat through fiscal 2019 and an improvement of 119 basis points for the same quarter in fiscal 2021. 
Finally, for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted operating income increased $319 million from last year to $575 million. This was primarily driven by a 43% improvement in U.S. Foodservice and continued progress on profitability from international. As Kevin called out, adjusted earnings per share increased an impressive $0.49 to $0.71 for the third quarter.
Now let's turn to a discussion of year-to-date cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $746 million on a year-to-date basis. Our company continues to transition from a period when sales, profit and working capital were all down during COVID to a period of high growth, growing profit and a focus on making the investments necessary to win the long game. A year ago at this time, we commented that we had a strategy and the balance sheet to invest in the business and support a Recipe for Growth, and that is exactly what we are doing. 
Free cash flow year-to-date was $434 million. EBITDA as the primary source of cash is up $900 million year-over-year in the year-to-date period as our sales increased, but we've not yet quite recovered to fiscal '19 levels. The rising sales and profitability were enabled by tactical investments and higher inventory levels this year, both in absolute cases on hand as we lap the purposeful inventory declines from the management of the COVID period and in dollar value, given inflation. 
And with our rapidly growing sales comes a higher balance in healthy accounts receivable, also a use of cash year-to-date, which our team continues to manage well, offset in part by higher accounts payable. In the year-to-date, we have also paid higher interest expense from COVID debt and refinancings, paid higher cash taxes, partly due to prior year refunds and deferrals and invested more in CapEx in support of the Recipe for Growth. This year is effectively a transition year from a free cash flow perspective, and we expect that future years will continue to reinforce the significant cash flow generated by Sysco as sales and profit grow and investments in working capital normalize. 
Let me emphasize, we are playing to win the long game and are leveraging our balance sheet and cash flow in support of the long-term growth of Sysco. Along those same lines, recall that we began the year with high cash balances, and we end the quarter with almost $900 million of cash on hand. Year-to-date, we've used that cash to invest in the business, spending $312 million on CapEx and paid for acquisitions such as Coastal with cash on hand. 
Our balance sheet is a key differentiator compared to our competition, and we are prepared -- we are better prepared than anyone else in the industry entering a rising interest rate environment. Why? Because we have strong cash generation, a strong investment-grade rating and a manageable debt profile, including some of the lowest rates ever achieved by Sysco in a 30-year tenure issued in December. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade rating and achieving a net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio of 2.5x to 2.75x. 
As previously announced, we expect to further reduce indebtedness by paying off the $450 million of debt coming due in June. And reflecting the world in which we all live, we also now have further liquidity and risk protection if we need it. Last week, Sysco announced that we successfully increased our revolver capacity from $2 billion to $3 billion with improved terms. 
Return of capital to shareholders is also part of our capital allocation framework. In May of 2021, our Board approved a 4% increase to our quarterly dividend, reflecting an $0.08 increase annually. And 2 weeks ago, Sysco's Board did it again, effectively announcing another $0.08 annual increase, reinforcing our status as a dividend aristocrat. What we want you to take away from this is that we are serious about all 3 parts of our capital allocation strategy. We are investing in the future growth of the business. We are maintaining a strong balance sheet, and we are returning surplus capital to shareholders. 
On this last point, our track record goes back decades. But as you can see on Slide 18, over the last 7 years, cumulatively, we've returned over $13 billion of cash to shareholders. We will remain disciplined with our balanced approach to capital allocation and rewarding our shareholders. 
Now before I turn to our positive update to guidance, I should address 1 set of questions we've been getting upfront: the impact of the invasion of Ukraine on our business. As a reminder, Europe represents only about 10% of our net sales. Our European portfolio is geographically distant from Ukraine and focused on Ireland, the U.K., France and Sweden. In the past, our exposure to Russian products was minimal. With respect to product inflation in Europe, while we are seeing costs rise more consistently with what we've seen in the U.S. in the last couple of quarters, we were prepared and have many of the same tools we developed in the U.S. to address the impact of product cost increases in Europe. Oil and the impact of rising gas prices have also been topics of interest. We benefit from having hedged 80% of our forecasted bulk fuel volume through fiscal 2023 in the U.S. and Europe. 
Let's now turn to look forward. We are upbeat about our business. We have witnessed the resiliency of our business as it has responded to the impact of 3 significant COVID-19 variants, significant inflation, the invasion of Ukraine and now, rising interest rates. We have made great progress in Q3, and we anticipate further progress in Q4, which is why we are upbeat about our business. We are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS in the second half by $0.16 to be from $1.76 to $1.86. Having delivered $0.71 of adjusted EPS in Q3, this means that we expect Q4 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15. On a full year basis, this will equate to adjusted EPS of $3.16 to $3.26. 
During our last earnings call, we highlighted that we expected a big Q4, and that's not changed with the results of our resilient Q3 results. Our continued optimism for Q4 includes a continued market recovery, continued market share gains, continued pass-through of inflation costs, improved operating expenses as a percentage of sales from lower snapback and productivity-related costs, all as partially offset by continued investments in our transformation and working through the workforce transition. Lastly, recall that Q4 of last year included 1 extra week, which will impact [indiscernible] With that, let me turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks."

Sysco already is the industry leader from an EBITDA margin perspective. You've heard me say this before, but we are now taking that robust foundation as the market leader in creating a growth company. Our financial performance this quarter reflects 3 key points: first, our volume grew 18.8% in U.S. Broadline compared to last year, and we significantly exceeded our market share target; second, we improved operations expenses, reducing snapback costs by more than 50% while continuing our transformation efforts; and third, we generated strong profit performance despite a dynamic operating environment. 
Turning to Slide 21. These recent results are also consistent with our long-term plans. We are generating substantial top line momentum and accelerating market share gains. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term and further build on our competitive scale advantages. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment while also rewarding our long-term shareholders with disciplined dividend growth and share repurchases. 
Lastly, we are committed to both our long-term financial outlook, which includes significant sales and EPS growth and returning value to shareholders along the way. There are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I am both excited and proud to be a part of the journey. As always, I'd like to thank all of our Sysco associates for the dedication they display to our customers each and every day. Operator, you can now turn over the line for questions."

So that implies, obviously, new customer acquisition, new customer growth. 
The second is the Recipe for Growth and our expectations for its capabilities to create market share capture with the existing customers. We had planned for it. It was a part of our budget for this year, and the Recipe for Growth is delivering. And that is the penetration opportunity. I mentioned on today's prepared remarks the tools that our sales consultants are now able to leverage and use to improve the effectiveness of a visit to a customer. We call it the next best action for that day's visit with that specific customer. They've got clear jobs to be done, and the data and the tools that are now available to them through our technology teams have driven significant performance. 
So mathematically, where it's coming from, it's a combination of accelerating new customer capture. We posted another very strong quarter of new customer wins and increasing penetration with existing customers through our Recipe for Growth. I think Aaron wants to make a comment as well.

I think consumers are concerned about inflation, and you can't read the paper and watch TV and not understand that high cost of fuel is on people's minds. We're not seeing a slowdown in demand. That's the good news and a headline from today. We're not seeing an impact to our food-away-from-home business. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do cover the entire spectrum of food-away-from-home across all price points: industrial needs, travel, hospitality, business industry and obviously, all restaurant forms and types. So we're a bit more diversified than others and I think that provides us some advantage. 
And I called out on the prepared remarks, food-away-from-home pricing relative to food-at-home pricing, which I believe is on Slide 6 in our presentation, is actually advantageous to Sysco at this period of time. You hit the nail on the head though, which is the pricing tool that we have, we're better positioned to be able to be, as Aaron said in his comments, right on price. What we mean by that is that we're not going to be too high and we're not going to be too low. We're not going to use price as a strategic lever to win share. That is, what we believe, a nonsustainable strategy and not something that we're interested in doing. 
We want to be right on price. So as inflation is occurring, we're able to leverage the technology to ensure that we're passing through the inflation at an appropriate level. And when we make improvements on our cost structure through cost of goods sold improvement, we can share in that savings with our customers, again leveraging that same technology. So what we say internally at Sysco is there's no better time than the current hyperinflationary environment to have a strategic pricing tool, and we're leveraging it to our advantage."

And at our May 20, 2021 earnings day, we talked about 3 numbers, 16% market share. We talked about 30% share of wallet and we talked about 50% of doors covered by Sysco in the restaurant space. Good news is the first number has already moved up. We're at 17% share from the most recent calendar year. We anticipate that we'll continue to make progress in that regard. 
And it's our Recipe for Growth strategy that will enable progress on the other 2 numbers, which drive the market share, which is increased penetration with existing customers and the continued pursuit of net new customers. And it's at both ends. And I'm not giving you a cop-out answer, I'm just being completely transparent and honest. We are doing more new customer prospecting than in our past, and we are successfully moving new customers up the profitability curve over time. So when we onboard them, you win X percentage of their business, and then we do what we call sell around the room, which is we penetrate additional categories. So we're having a lot of success on winning new customers. 
The fact that we remain the only foodservice distributor without an order minimum has helped us attract thousands of new customers. And then again, we penetrate further with those customers by selling around the room to move those customers up the profitability curve. And then the tools that I referenced on today's call that help our sales force are enabling us to win more cases and penetrate further with existing lines. 
So it's a both end answer. One is not more important than the other. We believe that we can significantly increase the number of restaurants that we serve and we can penetrate further. And not to repeat another point I made on the call, but the reason we converted to the 6-day full delivery model is to create more flex capacity and more throughput capacity on any individual given week, which will enable us to increase the number of customers that we serve profitably."

And also, I just don't want to lose the point. We had our highest growth versus the market in that quarter than we've been able to produce thus far. We're sequentially increasing our performance versus the market and also, the market performed nicely at the end of the last quarter. Here's my statement on April. We did not make a specific comment on the call tied to April, but we are seeing continued momentum in April.

I'll just start it and then I'll toss to Aaron for any comment. This is a question that I know is on people's minds, which is the impact of inflation on the end consumer and will they choose to go out to eat less often than they had been recently. And I would say 2 things. One, we're seeing continued momentum in consumer demand across our business segments that we serve. So that's notable and important. 
If that were to moderate, my second point that I would bring you to is what I just said a few moments ago. We have ""only"" 17% share of a very large business. So even in a business that begins to perhaps moderate, that does not mean that Sysco needs to be moderating. We can actually take increased share at a point in time when the market itself is perhaps not growing as robustly. 
And I'll just call you back to Slide 5 in our presentation materials. Food-away-from-home is increasingly popular for end consumers. If you look at it across the decades that are shown on this chart, it's pretty stark actually on how important food-away-from-home is. There's obviously the large disruption that occurred in March of 2020 when people were told to go home and stay home, but it's fully recovered. Look at the intersection of the lines, food-away-from-home is now, once again, more than the purchases for food-at-home. And then on the chart right below it on Slide 6, pricing in the retail grocery environment is such that food-away-from-home is price favorable versus historical trends. 
So put all that together, we believe that we, Sysco, will continue to grow. If the marketplace itself is a little softer, we have the opportunity to take share, grow share. Specific to your question about investments and would we pump the brakes, I'll toss to Aaron."

Look, I guess my reaction is this, we're wired for success in the long term at Sysco and whether it's the customer strategy and the opportunity that Kevin called out or the balance sheet and the resources we have to help us through any bump on the road, I want to emphasize we're investing for the long game. While we talk in this call relative to the quarter, relative to the year, really, we're talking about growth over the longer term, the 3-, the 5-, the 10-year period. 
And it kind of goes back to doing what we said we were going to do. If you go back to the Investor Day comments from, I guess, a year ago now, indeed, if you go back to our earnings calls for the last 18 months, what we said was we were going to invest in the snapback, right? We were going to do that because we wanted to be ahead of the curve. We wanted to be the company that the foodservice operators were coming to the restaurants because we were the best partner. So we've been investing in inventory down this path. 
We've been investing in technology down this path. We've been investing in our fleet, and we've been investing in our distribution nodes. And none of that has changed because of the ebbs and flows. And indeed, that's where we continue to be focused as we carry forward because we are holding ourselves accountable and Kevin is holding all of us accountable to the Recipe for Growth and the recipe for profitable growth that comes with it."

We were really pleased in the quarter on a couple of respects. The first is to have delivered record gross profit, both in absolute dollars for the enterprise but then also GP dollars per case across all 4 segments, really speaks to the hard work that the teams are doing to ensure that we are both recognizing the increase in costs that we are getting and then pulling the necessary levers in collaboration with our customers to pass those costs through. 
Now obviously, I get a lot of questions around gross margin rate as well. And I could tell you that while we were pleased with the sequential improvement in rate, the decline from the historical period is entirely due to the simple math tied to the inflation. And we'll continue to monitor both dollars per case and GM rate as we carry forward. 
But here's the good news about Sysco as we carry forward, which is we continue to have opportunities to optimize our gross profit, right? We continue to work with the customers on passing through things like fuel cost. You're right, that's there. But as we think about the strength of the Sysco brand portfolio, where we have further opportunity there, as we think about how we better leverage the scale that is Sysco relative to our purchasing opportunities, we have good news yet to unlock within Sysco unrelated to the external environment that we're going to continue to pursue as we carry forward.

So we are outperforming the market in average. We improved in the quarter. It's coming from 2 actions. Our suppliers are beginning to improve. It's still meaningfully down versus historical standards, supplier inbound fill rate to Sysco, but it is beginning to improve.
And Ed, we're doing an even better job at managing what we call subs and outs, substitutions and out-of-stocks. Our website improving to communicate more upfront to our customers options they have when an item is out of stock. And our sales reps and our merchandising teams are doing very good work to partner with customers in an environment where a specific item is out of stock. There's plenty of food. There's plenty of food available. It's about individual items being out of stock at moments in time, and Sysco working proactively with our customers to be able to serve their needs with something that meets the needs of their menu. 
So we're doing a better job in this most recent quarter at that, and we expect continued improvement into Q4 and into our fiscal 2023. As it relates to the overall environmental conditions, our staffing health has improved. It continues to steadily improve. We're not out of the woods. We still have work to do but we're making progress. And then your [indiscernible] point about things like maintenance of equipment. Yes, shortages are impacting all forms of supply chains, not just food. So access to parts is a challenge and access to new equipment is a challenge. 
Interestingly, we're doing better work in that regard to centralize that activity at Sysco, to have a better control over parts inventory and purchasing of equipment. And I would emphasize 1 important point there. Our size and scale can enable us to have preferred advantage with manufacturers who are on limited allocation, and we'll be at the front of the line for equipment. In fact, Aaron and I have preapproved and preordered equipment to support the Recipe for Growth."

We're not exposed from a sales perspective was Aaron's main point to what's happening in Eastern Europe because we're not domiciled there, right? We don't have actual business in those countries. So unlike other companies that are international, we're not exposed in that regard. We had purchased product previously from Russia, and we're no longer purchasing product from Russia, and we've been able to move to alternative sources of supply, mostly in seafood. And that was the work we needed to do was to get alternative product from alternative countries to be able to support the needs of our customers. 
As it relates to is Western Europe feeling the impact of the war. Ukraine is the bread basket of Europe. Sunflower oils and grains are produced there. You can get product -- we, Sysco, are able to get product. What it's had is an impact on inflation in those countries. Interestingly, those countries were behind the U.S. from an inflation perspective. So what's happening in Europe right now is an increase in inflation, but frankly, it's just catching up to the inflation that was already visible in the United States. 
And we're managing it well. We're managing the pass-through of that inflation, Jeff, well in our International segment. So that kind of bundles in macroeconomic environment, what's happening. What's happening is inflation increasing in Europe. Point 2, though, is this consumer demand. We are not seeing a decrease in consumer demand in our international geographies. And I'd just remind everyone, and I think Aaron did a good job in his prepared remarks of reminding everyone, international was hit earlier. It was hit harder and international has been slower to recover. So we see our international business as a tailwind in Q4 and into fiscal '23 because there's still much more recovery in front of us, international, relative to the U.S. business. So continued progress in international month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, and we see anticipated additional recovery happening in international."

The no order minimum can be measured through net promoter score satisfaction of our customers with Sysco and our ability to acquire and win net new customers. And I tried to mention a moment ago, and the only downside of that would be is if we're not moving customers up the profitability ladder over time by selling around the room, we would address that. And I mentioned, I'll repeat it. We're doing a very good job of selling around the room and increasing the net profitability of acquired customers by increasing penetration after we've acquired them. 
So we're really pleased with the no order minimum policy. We think having an order minimum is not a great customer policy. We need to be there for our customers when they need us, how they need us, and we don't anticipate making structural changes in that regard. 
The 6-day workweek makes us more efficient. That's not an increase in cost to Sysco. That's actually increasing Sysco's cost efficiency by leveraging our physical assets to a greater degree. A truck going out of 6 days is a good thing, not a bad thing. So it leverages our capability. And what it also provides is, as I mentioned, increased flexibility for any individual, singular day, and we can continue to go out and win net new business because of the incremental capacity that we have provided. 
The big transition was for our workforce. And as I mentioned, we've converted that incredibly important population of ours to a 4-day workweek. And what's really important is when we need them then to work overtime, they're working a fifth day voluntarily, which is much easier for someone to do than when they're asked to come in on a sixth day. It's just better for their life. Though their scheduled normal workweek is 4 days and when we need them for overtime, they work fifth. And obviously, there's overlapping schedules between Team A, Team B, et cetera, et cetera, to fill out the full 6-day workweek. 
So our customers are going to see more consistent on-time deliveries. We've increased our flexibility. We've increased our capacity and we can do it more cost effectively. Those are the reasons why we did it. But it's a change that's challenging to do, and we've got it in the rearview mirror."

We've not broken down the industries beyond that. And perhaps with your -- jumping to your aggregate point of how are we doing versus the competitor set or where might they be? We focus on what we're doing and our -- we were pleased to see that we were exceeding our own objective of being more than 1.2x market growth and that's really the headline for us. Kevin, anything you'd add?"

The fact that we're growing our business by more than 1.2x the market, Kelly, implies the volume is equivalent to that. There's a strong correlation between the volume trend and the sales trend, us versus others. So that's my best color in that regard. 
The only thing additional beyond that is we're winning big in specialty. Our produce business, our specialty meat business, we are doing very well. And I call your attention to the higher margin rates from those businesses. So specialty is a growth focus for Sysco. We're winning in Broadline. We're taking market share in Broadline and we are accelerating our momentum in specialty. And the fact that we closed on the Coastal Companies acquisition in the last quarter is a harbinger of good things to come even further in the high-growth, higher-margin produce business because that will pay dividend from a growth perspective for many years to come."

But very importantly, at the exact same time, our Recipe for Growth is advancing and the capabilities that we're building will have a bigger, more meaningful impact. 
And I'd just call your attention to the guidance that we provided in May of last year. We said we would accelerate our performance versus the market. This year's stated goal was 1.2x. We're doing much better than that. In the third year of our 3-year plan, which was fiscal '24, we said we would grow at 1.5x and we are confident in our ability to do that. The contribution of where that market share capture comes from in our forward-facing years will be less weakness of others, it will be more strength from Sysco."

Certainly, I've seen some things in the marketplace of people bringing in pre-prepared products I wouldn't have necessarily expected.

Just I think one of the points that sometimes people forget about Sysco is that we have the, by far, largest sales force in the industry. It is a vibrant, strong, capable group of people who are culinary experts. So these are chefs, these are ex-restaurant owners, they are culinary school grads, and they are absolutely pros. And we have the highest net satisfaction rate of the sales force versus the industry, and we do not intend to reduce the size of that sales force. We intend to increase their productivity through the digital tools I mentioned. 
But this topic that you just brought up, which is what's happening with food trends is exactly what our sales force does. They call upon customers. They go to the restaurant, they spend time in the back room of the kitchen. They talk about food trends to educate customers on things that are happening. And yes, there is a movement towards, because of labor shortages in restaurants, more available product upstream preparation and the like, and no one is better prepared to be able to drive and leverage trends like that than Sysco. 
Our cutting-edge solutions brand, which falls under Sysco brand, is doing just that. And we're bringing product to our customers oftentimes exclusive for a period of time to enable them to take work out of the kitchen but have incredibly high-quality taste and consistency on the plate. There's nobody better positioned than us to be able to leverage those types of trends and capabilities, including those kitchens, which I get asked about all the time, are ghost kitchens are bad for Sysco? Not at all. Because guess what, ghost kitchens order food, and there's absolutely no reason why we can't over-index in our ability to serve those customers. Many ghost kitchens are actually a full-fledged kitchen for a restaurant, which actually is good for Sysco because it increases our drop size of the delivery to that door."

I gave a good example of technology deployment on today's call, which is the turbocharging of the capability of the sales rep by teeing up on a silver platter for them the next best action for that day's visit that is using data, deep troves of purchasing data to provide a suggestion to the sales rep on something the customer will be interested in and then preapproving for them an offer that is financially good for Sysco that would be beneficial for the customer. It's a game-changer.
Our sales reps are excellent at building strong relationships with customers and they are experts in food. But what we're now providing them is an [ N-of-1 ] personalization for each and every customer on something that we know will be desired by the customer and an offer that will be compelling, again, financially for us and also for that customer. So that's a great example. 
We're making meaningful progress on our website improvement, which is the ordering platform, our digital ordering platform, which I want to be clear is not just a desktop. It's a mobile version. We have click-to-order through e-mails now where we can send an e-mail to a customer with an offer and/or with a suggested order. And with 1 click of 1 button, we will ship that product to them. They don't even have to go to an ordering platform. These are what we call removing points of friction, tools and capabilities, leveraging modern technology. 
We talked about pricing a lot. I don't need to repeat that. What we're working on now is supply chain improvement technology. We want to make the work that our supply chain associates do easier to do. And by making that work easier to do, it will improve the satisfaction of our associates for the job, will help us drive improved associate retention, which will drive improved productivity for Sysco.

Thank you for joining our call.

Thank you for joining our call. Our financial performance this quarter exceeded our internal expectations, driven by strong top line performance, accelerating market share gains, solid gross margin management and improvement in our operations expenses. Earlier today, we raised our full year guidance, and Aaron will walk you through the details in just a few moments. 
Our strong performance for the quarter demonstrates our focus on the customer and the advancement of our Recipe for Growth strategy. Simply put, we are winning in the marketplace. The best measure of this success is the continued market share gains that we are delivering. Our performance versus the market accelerated in the quarter, and we solidly exceeded our fiscal 2022 goal of growing 1.2x the market. 
I will highlight 3 topics during our call today: first, I will touch on our financial results; second, I'll discuss the state of the current operating environment; and finally, I will highlight progress from our Recipe for Growth transformation. I'll then turn it over to Aaron to discuss our financial results in more detail. So let's get started with our financial results displayed on Slide #4. 
Our third quarter results were fueled by strong top line performance across the U.S. and international segments and progress made in lowering operating expenses as a percentage of sales. As a result, our profit results were ahead of our internal expectations this quarter. While our operational expenses remain elevated versus our historical standards, we've begun making progress in improving our productivity. We will continue to make progress in the coming quarters. 
Key headlines this quarter include market share gains that significantly exceeded our 1.2x the market growth target, significant volume improvements with U.S. Broadline volume up approximately 19% versus the same period in fiscal year 2021 and our USFS business delivering volume growth versus 2019 in total. This also included another quarter of profitable growth coming from our international segment. 
Our expense structure is improving. As I mentioned, we still have work to do in order to return to our standard of excellence but we have begun making progress. Importantly, our snapback investments were reduced by more than 50% versus the prior quarter. Our strong sales results and continued progress in improving operating expenses drove solid profit growth. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 for the quarter. We achieved these results while meaningfully advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. This included successfully closing on The Coastal Companies transaction during the quarter, further expanding our industry-leading produce business that is high growth at attractive margins. 
Topic 2 for today, an update on the current environment. The third quarter started with COVID-related disruptions from the Omicron variant. Recall that the negative impact from Omicron started in late November and the effects were felt through February. Sysco delivered a strong quarter of growth despite the headwind from Omicron. Two factors played to our favor: a strong market rebound in late February and into March and Sysco winning market share throughout the entire quarter. Combined, these factors enabled both our U.S. and international businesses to deliver volumes greater than our internal forecast for the period. As I mentioned a moment ago, volume in our U.S. Foodservice Operations exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels for the quarter. The positive momentum was strong across geographies as well as across different customer types. With that said, we expect additional momentum over time from improved international volume as the recovery in the food-away-from-home market strengthens internationally. 
At Sysco, we have 2 business sectors that remain heavily impacted by COVID, business and industry, which includes customers such as office cafeterias and travel and hospitality, which is heavily impacted by conferences and large group catering events. We anticipate both segments making progress this summer and into the fall. For example, many major employers have begun returning to the office, and recent reports from airline and hotel CEOs have cited steadily improving bookings for this summer. 
An advantage of Sysco is that we are fully diversified across the food-away-from-home business. While high cost of fuel is being felt by our customers, we have not experienced a reduction of consumer demand. The fact that we cover all restaurant types up and down the price point spectrum provides us some protection in an unpredictable economy. Additionally, the pricing relationship between food at home and food away from home is favorable to Sysco versus historical relationships, as you can see on Slide 6 in our presentation. With that said, we remain concerned about the long-term effect of elevated inflation, and we are taking strong actions to manage the situation. 
We are actively working to improve cost of goods sold inbound to Sysco so that we can pass along value to our customers. We are aggressively pursuing Sysco brand penetration opportunities as we know that Sysco products save our customers' money. We are also working aggressively with our customers to help them with their menu design, and therefore, helping these customers find alternatives to step around highly inflationary items in subcategories. We are also helping them to have confidence in their menu pricing strategies. This work helps us go earn trust and respect with our large customer base. 
In regards to our supply chain, I'd like to report that conditions are improving. Applicant flow to open positions has increased, and our talent acquisition team has helped us make progress in improving our staffing health. As a result, we have been able to reduce associate overtime and improve our service levels to our customers over the past quarter. Our NPS, or Net Promoter Score, results this quarter improved and continue to lead versus the market. It is still a very dynamic environment, but the size and scale advantages of Sysco are enabling us to succeed in a turbulent environment. 
Topic 3 for today, I'll provide select highlights of our Recipe for Growth progress. Last quarter, I provided an update on 2 of our growth initiatives: Sysco Your Way and our Italian cuisine platform. These 2 initiatives continue to progress well, driving profitable growth for the company. We expanded Sysco Your Way to additional neighborhoods in the quarter, and the recently added locations are performing consistent with the strong results from our pilot locations. 
Today, I'd like to provide an update on 2 additional topics: Our supply chain transformation and progress that we are making in consultative sales. As I mentioned, our supply chain health has improved over the past quarter as applicant flow to our open jobs has improved, and we're beginning to make progress in operations productivity. Improving the efficiency of our supply chain is a top priority for our entire leadership team. 
To ensure that we succeed at a higher level in the future, we are making substantial commitments to improve our associate experience within operations. A great example is our Driver Academy, which is now up and running in full swing. We've graduated our first class of drivers, and we have opened additional academy locations. We expect to be nationwide with this capability by the end of the calendar year. The Driver Academy will enable us to provide upward career path mobility for our warehouse associates and improve associate retention in this critical driver role. Our graduates are able to increase their career earnings potential by upskilling and becoming certified drivers. At Sysco, we pay a leading and competitive driver wage, and we are making the certification process easier, removing the barriers and costs of becoming certified. This action will open the door for more of our associates to advance their careers. The Driver Academy is a win-win-win for our associates, for Sysco and for our customers. 
Additionally, over the past quarter, we have converted our operations from an industry traditional 5-day workweek to a full 6-day delivery model. This might sound like a small endeavor, but the reality is quite the opposite. We made the change to a full 6-day model for the following reasons. The change is better for our associates. Why? We have converted our associates from a standard 5-day schedule to a more work-life-friendly 4-day workweek. This will improve associate retention over time. The 6-day workweek increases the efficiency of our operations by further utilizing our physical assets, enabling us to better sweat the assets of our trucks and buildings. The model increases our weekly throughput and also provides us more flex capacity on each and every day, enabling us to better handle fluctuations of demand. These changes to our supply chain will help make Sysco an even more preferred employer, and that will enable us to serve our customers. 
As important as having an efficient and flexible supply chain, we are continuing to advance the capabilities of our industry-leading sales teams. Our sales associates have the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry, and we want to increase that competitive advantage. We have worked hard over the past year to bring stronger digital tools to the selling process to enable the success of our sales teams. I want to be very clear that these digital tools do not reduce the importance or quantity of our sales staff. These tools are intended to assist our sales teams with their consultative selling process. 
Our technology team has built a system that provides each sales rep with a next best action to be presented to our customers. For some customers, this may be a conversion from a national brand product to a Sysco brand item,  saving them money. For other customers, this may be the introduction of a promotional offer for a category perhaps they've not traditionally purchased from Sysco, like produce. For others still, the tool can identify items that our customer used to buy but are no longer placing in their shopping basket with Sysco. Our sales consultants are then prompted with offers and suggestions through specifically enabled success against those use cases. The goal of this work is to increase the productivity of the customer visit. This work positively impacted our performance versus the market in Q3, which was our strongest volume growth quarter versus the market for the year. Slide 7 in our presentation makes a clear case of our progress in becoming a growth company. 
Lastly, our working commitments in corporate social responsibility, or CSR, were recently recognized by Sustainalytics and JUST Capital. This recognition is due in no small part to our recent announcement of a science-based climate goal that is aligned with SBTi. As the leader in our industry, we are proud to be the first and only U.S. foodservice distributor with a science-based climate goal. Research from the World Economic Forum suggests that companies who make progress in these important areas drive improved CSR over time compared to their peers. To ensure that we walk the walk, our Board is prepared to incorporate ESG as a part of our executive compensation program beginning next year. The work we are doing is the right thing to do, and we strongly believe that it is also good for our business and our investors. 
Turning to Slide 8. In summary for the quarter, Sysco is winning, leading the industry and accelerating growth. We are growing our business with new and existing customers. Our supply chain is performing better than the industry at large, and we are driving strategic initiatives to further increase that strength advantage. Our continued transformation investments are enhancing our commercial selling capabilities, and we are investing in our associates. The improved profitability in the quarter is encouraging, but there is more work to be done as our team is focused on our Recipe for Growth strategy and improving operations productivity. 
I'll now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details before we open it up for questions."

We are upbeat on our business, and we have several notable headlines for our third quarter, as seen on Slide 10. Sales growth of almost 43% compared to the prior year, which is also up more than 15% versus 2019, reflecting resilient demand and sequential improvements month-over-month. We recorded more than $3 billion of gross profit, the highest gross profit in absolute dollar terms for any quarter at Sysco ever as we continue significant efforts to optimize our assortment in COGS while effectively managing our product cost inflation. 
Our investments in snapback operating costs dropped in the quarter by more than half from $73 million in Q2 to $35 million in Q3. As promised, the impact of our workforce transition on productivity improved. Incremental training and overtime is estimated to have cost us approximately $30 million in the third quarter, down from approximately $40 million in the second quarter, and we expect further improvements as we head into Q4. As an aside, I would note that the actions we're taking around productivity are actually serving to accelerate our supply chain transformation as part of the Recipe for Growth. 
We invested $48 million of operating expense against our strategic investments, creating momentum with our commercial capabilities. All in, adjusted operating income more than doubled and adjusted EBITDA increased almost 73% compared to last year. With those headlines on the table, I'm going to provide some details on the financials for the quarter and some thoughts on our outlook. 
Third quarter sales were $16.9 billion, an increase of 42.9% for fiscal 2021 and a 15.3% increase from fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice, were up dramatically by 43.6% versus fiscal 2021 and up 18.8% versus fiscal 2019. Local case volume within the U.S. Broadline Operations, a subset of U.S. Foodservice, increased 14.1%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 18.8% compared to last year. 
SYGMA sales were up 13.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up 16.8% versus fiscal 2019. International sales were up 64.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up approximately 3% versus fiscal 2019. Sales trends accelerated nicely in our international segment with lower Omicron cases and as government-related restrictions on our customers eased in the quarter. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of 0.7% on Sysco's sales results. 
Let me pause here and call out one point of progress for the year-to-date period. We are really pleased with the profit contribution and improvements coming from international. In the last 9 months, the business has delivered an adjusted operating income swing of $265 million year-over-year. 
Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 16% in our U.S. Broadline business. We have been able to actively manage the impact of product inflation and those efforts will continue. Gross profit for the enterprise was above $3 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 42% versus fiscal 2021, an increase of 9.4% versus fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal 2021 and compared to the same quarter in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019 increases in GP dollars per case across all segments as we successfully managed to increase costs from our product suppliers and acted to optimize our business processes and performance. Of note, the enterprise and U.S. Foodservice both reached all-time highs for Q3 gross profit dollars. 
Gross margin rate was 17.8% or 18% on an adjusted basis during the quarter with the adjusted margin rate moving upward as the math was still impacted by inflation. Of course, it is gross profit dollars that counts in an inflationary environment, and gross profit per case increased in all 4 segments. We are focused on price relevancy, being right on price and are doing the right things to cover our costs while also supporting our customers.
Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion as we delivered progress on our multiyear cost-out program and improved snapback costs. As we touched on earlier and as you can see on Slide 15, operating costs this quarter were impacted by variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes, more than $35 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, $48 million of purposeful investments to further accelerate our Recipe for Growth initiatives, and lastly, the still present but improving expense challenges associated with new hire productivity. Despite the dynamic operating environment, we expect additional improvements for snapback costs and productivity expenses during the fourth quarter as we balance cost reduction initiatives with continued transformation investments. 
Together, the snapback investments and the productivity-related costs totaled approximately $65 million of operating expenses this quarter. That's important because the simple math would say that these transitory expenses had a downward impact to our adjusted EPS of approximately $0.10, further proving our point that there is further opportunity for profit improvement in the future for Sysco as Q3 adjusted EPS without these expenses would have already exceeded 2019 levels. All in, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 14.6%, which was flat through fiscal 2019 and an improvement of 119 basis points for the same quarter in fiscal 2021. 
Finally, for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted operating income increased $319 million from last year to $575 million. This was primarily driven by a 43% improvement in U.S. Foodservice and continued progress on profitability from international. As Kevin called out, adjusted earnings per share increased an impressive $0.49 to $0.71 for the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to a discussion of year-to-date cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $746 million on a year-to-date basis. Our company continues to transition from a period when sales, profit and working capital were all down during COVID to a period of high growth, growing profit and a focus on making the investments necessary to win the long game. A year ago at this time, we commented that we had a strategy and the balance sheet to invest in the business and support our Recipe for Growth, and that is exactly what we are doing. 
Free cash flow year-to-date was $434 million. EBITDA as the primary source of cash is up $900 million year-over-year in the year-to-date period as our sales increased, but we've not yet quite recovered to fiscal '19 levels. The rising sales and profitability were enabled by tactical investments and higher inventory levels this year, both in absolute cases on hand as we lap the purposeful inventory declines from the management of the COVID period and in dollar value, given inflation. And with our rapidly growing sales comes a higher balance in healthy accounts receivable, also a use of cash year-to-date, which our team continues to manage well, offset, in part, by higher accounts payable. 
In the year-to-date, we have also paid higher interest expense from COVID debt and refinancings; paid higher cash taxes, partly due to prior year refunds and deferrals; and invested more in CapEx in support of the Recipe for Growth. This year is effectively a transition year from a free cash flow perspective, and we expect that future years will continue to reinforce the significant cash flow generated by Sysco as sales and profit grow and investments in working capital normalize. 
Let me emphasize, we are playing to win the long game and are leveraging our balance sheet and cash flow in support of the long-term growth of Sysco. Along those same lines, recall that we began the year with high cash balances, and we end the quarter with almost $900 million of cash on hand. Year-to-date, we've used that cash to invest in the business, spending $312 million on CapEx and paid for acquisitions such as Coastal with cash on hand. 
Our balance sheet is a key differentiator compared to our competition, and we are prepared -- we are better prepared than anyone else in the industry entering a rising interest rate environment. Why? Because we have strong cash generation, a strong investment-grade rating and a manageable debt profile, including some of the lowest rates ever achieved by Sysco in a 30-year tenure issued in December. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade rating and achieving a net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio of 2.5x to 2.75x. 
As previously announced, we expect to further reduce indebtedness by paying off the $450 million of debt coming due in June. And reflecting the world in which we all live, we also now have further liquidity and risk protection if we need it. Last week, Sysco announced that we successfully increased our revolver capacity from $2 billion to $3 billion with improved terms. 
Return of capital to shareholders is also part of our capital allocation framework. In May of 2021, our Board approved a 4% increase to our quarterly dividend, reflecting an $0.08 increase annually. And 2 weeks ago, Sysco's Board did it again, effectively announcing another $0.08 annual increase, reinforcing our status as a dividend aristocrat. What we want you to take away from this is that we are serious about all 3 parts of our capital allocation strategy: we are investing in the future growth of the business, we are maintaining a strong balance sheet, and we are returning surplus capital to shareholders. 
On this last point, our track record goes back decades. But as you can see on Slide 18, over the last 7 years, cumulatively, we've returned over $13 billion of cash to shareholders. We will remain disciplined with our balanced approach to capital allocation and rewarding our shareholders. 
Now before I turn to our positive update to guidance, I should address one set of questions we've been getting upfront. The impact of the invasion of Ukraine on our business. As a reminder, Europe represents only about 10% of our net sales. Our European portfolio is geographically distant from Ukraine and focused on Ireland, the U.K., France and Sweden. In the past, our exposure to Russian products was minimal. With respect to product inflation in Europe, while we are seeing costs rise more consistently with what we've seen in the U.S. in the last couple of quarters, we were prepared and have many of the same tools we developed in the U.S. to address the impact of product cost increases in Europe. Oil and the impact of rising gas prices have also been topics of interest. We benefit from having hedged 80% of our forecasted bulk fuel volume through fiscal 2023 in the U.S. and Europe. 
Let's now turn to look forward. We are upbeat about our business. We have witnessed the resiliency of our business as it has responded to the impact of 3 significant COVID-19 variants, significant inflation, the invasion of Ukraine, and now, rising interest rates. We have made great progress in Q3, and we anticipate further progress in Q4, which is why we are upbeat about our business. We are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS in the second half by $0.16 to be from $1.76 to $1.86. Having delivered $0.71 of adjusted EPS in Q3, this means that we expect Q4 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15. On a full year basis, this will equate to adjusted EPS of $3.16 to $3.26. 
During our last earnings call, we highlighted that we expected a big Q4, and that's not changed with the results of our resilient Q3 results. Our continued optimism for Q4 includes a continued market recovery, continued market share gains, continued pass-through of inflation costs, improved operating expenses as a percentage of sales from lower snapback and productivity-related costs, all is partially offset by continued investments in our transformation and working through the workforce transition. Lastly, recall that Q4 of last year included 1 extra week, which will impact the profitability. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks."

Sysco already is the industry leader from an EBITDA margin perspective. You've heard me say this before, but we are now taking that robust foundation as the market leader in creating a growth company. Our financial performance this quarter reflects 3 key points: first, our volume grew 18.8% in U.S. Broadline compared to last year, and we significantly exceeded our market share target; second, we improved operations expenses, reducing snapback costs by more than 50% while continuing our transformation efforts; and third, we generated strong profit performance despite a dynamic operating environment. 
Turning to Slide 21. These recent results are also consistent with our long-term plans. We are generating substantial top line momentum and accelerating market share gains. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term and further build on our competitive scale advantages. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment while also rewarding our long-term shareholders with disciplined dividend growth and share repurchases. Lastly, we are committed to both our long-term financial outlook, which includes significant sales and EPS growth and returning value to shareholders along the way. 
There are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I am both excited and proud to be a part of the journey. As always, I'd like to thank all of our Sysco associates for the dedication they display to our customers each and every day. 
Operator, you can now turn over the line for questions."

Our supply chain is performing stronger or better than the industry. And on a daily basis, we have customers coming to us asking for Sysco to become their new preferred supplier. So that implies, obviously, new customer acquisition, new customer growth. 
 The second is the Recipe for Growth and our expectations for its capabilities to create market share capture with existing customers. We had planned for it. It was a part of our budget for this year, and the Recipe for Growth is delivering. And that is the penetration opportunity. I mentioned on today's prepared remarks the tools that our sales consultants are now able to leverage and use to improve the effectiveness of a visit to a customer. We call it the next best action for that day's visit with that specific customer. They've got clear jobs to be done, and the data and the tools that are now available to them through our technology teams have driven significant performance. 
So mathematically, where it's coming from, it's a combination of accelerating new customer capture. We posted another very strong quarter of new customer wins and increasing penetration with existing customers through our Recipe for Growth. I think Aaron wants to make a comment as well. Aaron, to you."

I think consumers are concerned about inflation, and you can't read the paper and watch TV and not understand that high cost of fuel is on people's minds. We're not seeing a slowdown in demand. That's the good news and a headline from today. We're not seeing an impact to our food-away-from-home business. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do cover the entire spectrum of food away from home across all price points: industrial needs, travel, hospitality, business industry, and obviously, all restaurant forms and types. So we're a bit more diversified than others, and I think that provides us some advantage. 
And I called out on the prepared remarks, food-away-from-home pricing relative to food-at-home pricing, which I believe is on Slide 6 in our presentation, is actually advantageous to Sysco at this period of time. You hit the nail on the head, though, which is the pricing tool that we have, we're better positioned to be able to be, as Aaron said in his comments, right on price. What we mean by that is that we're not going to be too high and we're not going to be too low. We're not going to use price as a strategic lever to win share. That is, what we believe, a non-sustainable strategy and not something that we're interested in doing. We want to be right on price. So as inflation is occurring, we're able to leverage the technology to ensure that we're passing through the inflation at an appropriate level. And when we make improvements on our cost structure through cost of goods sold improvement, we can share in that savings with our customers, again leveraging that same technology. 
So what we say internally at Sysco is there's no better time than the current hyperinflationary environment to have a strategic pricing tool, and we're leveraging it to our advantage."

We had called out, from a Q4 guidance perspective, a strong Q4, and so I don't want to leave you with the impression. Other than that, we are assuming the continued market recovery in Q4. We're assuming continued market share gains and volume growth. We're assuming continued cost improvement that snapback costs will come down, that productivity improvements will continue. And that we'll continue to invest against the range -- against the transformation rather. 
And lastly, just a further math point for you, it's not lost on us that if we were to hit the bottom of the range for Q4, that would be the second-highest adjusted EPS quarter in Sysco history. And if we were to hit the top of the range for Q4, that will be the highest adjusted EPS quarter in Sysco history and ahead of fiscal '19. So we have a lot of work ahead of us this quarter.

I'm actually just going to bridge everyone back to kind of the thesis of Sysco and why we have such confidence in the long-term growth potential of the company. And at our May 20, 2021 earnings day, we talked about 3 numbers, 16% market share. We talked about 30% share of wallet, and we talked about 50% of doors covered by Sysco in the restaurant space. Good news is the first number has already moved up. We're at 17% share from the most recent calendar year. We anticipate that we'll continue to make progress in that regard. And it's our Recipe for Growth strategy that will enable progress on the other 2 numbers, which drive the market share, which is increased penetration with existing customers and the continued pursuit of net new customers. And it's at both ends. And I'm not giving you a cop-out answer, I'm just being completely transparent and honest. 
We are doing more new customer prospecting than in our past, and we are successfully moving new customers up the profitability curve over time. So when we onboard them, you win X percentage of their business, and then we do what we call sell around the room, which is we penetrate additional categories. So we're having a lot of success on winning new customers. The fact that we remain the only foodservice distributor without an order minimum has helped us attract thousands of new customers. And then again, we penetrate further with those customers by selling around the room to move those customers up the profitability curve. And then the tools that I referenced on today's call that help our sales force are enabling us to win more cases and penetrate further with existing lines. 
So it's a both end answer. One is not more important than the other. We believe that we can significantly increase the number of restaurants that we serve, and we can penetrate further. And not to repeat another point I made on the call, but the reason we converted to the 6-day full delivery model is to create more flex capacity and more throughput capacity on any individual given week, which will enable us to increase the number of customers that we serve profitably."

Yes, the beginning of Q3 was tough, given Omicron, and I think we did a good job of explaining that on our last earnings call. This is what we were experiencing. The impact of Omicron was felt through the material part of February. March was strong. It really recovered quicker than what we had been modeling and expecting. And also, I just don't want to lose the point. We had our highest growth versus the market in that quarter than we've been able to produce thus far. We are sequentially increasing our performance versus the market. And also, the market performed nicely at the end of the last quarter. 
Here's my statement on April. We did not make a specific comment on the call tied to April, but we are seeing continued momentum in April. We're seeing strong demand across our business segments and across geographies, including international, and we're bullish on Q4 as evidenced by what Aaron communicated to you all today."

I'll just start it, and then I'll toss to Aaron for any comment. This is a question that I know is on people's minds, which is the impact of inflation on the end consumer and will they choose to go out to eat less often than they had been recently, and I would say 2 things. One, we're seeing continued momentum in consumer demand across our business segments that we serve. So that's notable and important. If that were to moderate, my second point that I would bring you to is what I just said a few moments ago. We have ""only"" 17% share of a very large business. So even in a business that begins to perhaps moderate, that does not mean that Sysco needs to be moderating. We can actually take increased share at a point in time when the market itself is perhaps not growing as robustly. 
And I'll just call you back to Slide 5 in our presentation materials. Food away from home is increasingly popular for end consumers. If you look at it across the decades that are shown on this chart, it's pretty stark, actually, on how important food away from home is. There's obviously the large disruption that occurred in March of 2020 when people were told to go home and stay home, but it's fully recovered. Look at the intersection of the lines, food away from home is now, once again, more than the purchases for food at home. And then on the chart right below it on Slide 6, pricing in the retail grocery environment is such that food away from home is price-favorable versus historical trends. 
So put all that together, we believe that we, Sysco, will continue to grow. If the marketplace itself is a little softer, we have the opportunity to take share, grow share. Specific to your question about investments and would we pump the brakes, I'll toss to Aaron."

Look, I guess my reaction is this, we're wired for success in the long term at Sysco and whether it's the customer strategy and the opportunity that Kevin called out or the balance sheet and the resources we have to help us through any bump on the road, I want to emphasize we're investing for the long game. While we talk in this call relative to the quarter, relative to the year, really, we're talking about growth over the longer term, the 3-, the 5-, the 10-year period. 
And it kind of goes back to doing what we said we were going to do. If you go back to the Investor Day comments from, I guess, a year ago now, indeed, if you go back to our earnings calls for the last 18 months, what we said was we were going to invest in the snapback, right? We were going to do that because we wanted to be ahead of the curve. We wanted to be the company that the foodservice operators were coming to the restaurants because we were the best partner. So we've been investing in inventory down this path. 
We've been investing in technology down this path. We've been investing in our fleet, and we've been investing in our distribution nodes. And none of that has changed because of the ebbs and flows. And indeed, that's where we continue to be focused as we carry forward because we are holding ourselves accountable and Kevin is holding all of us accountable to the Recipe for Growth and the recipe for profitable growth that comes with it."

We were really pleased in the quarter on a couple of respects. The first is to have delivered record gross profit, both in absolute dollars for the enterprise but then also GP dollars per case across all 4 segments, really speaks to the hard work that the teams are doing to ensure that we are both recognizing the increase in costs that we are getting and then pulling the necessary levers in collaboration with our customers to pass those costs through. 
Now obviously, I get a lot of questions around gross margin rate as well. And I could tell you that while we were pleased with the sequential improvement in rate, the decline from the historical period is entirely due to the simple math tied to the inflation. And we'll continue to monitor both dollars per case and GM rate as we carry forward. 
But here's the good news about Sysco as we carry forward, which is we continue to have opportunities to optimize our gross profit, right? We continue to work with the customers on passing through things like fuel cost. You're right. That's there. But as we think about the strength of the Sysco brand portfolio, where we have further opportunity there, as we think about how we better leverage the scale that is Sysco relative to our purchasing opportunities, we have good news yet to unlock within Sysco unrelated to the external environment that we're going to continue to pursue as we carry forward.

It's hard to actually delineate specifically for you on this call the portion of our goodness, as Aaron says, tied to that versus inflation, and that's just the level of detail that we're not going to go into.

We are outperforming the market in average. We improved in the quarter. It's coming from 2 actions. Our suppliers are beginning to improve. It's still meaningfully down versus historical standards, supplier inbound fill rate to Sysco, but it is beginning to improve.
And Ed, we're doing an even better job at managing what we call subs and outs, substitutions and out-of-stocks. Our website improving to communicate more upfront to our customers options they have when an item is out of stock. And our sales reps and our merchandising teams are doing very good work to partner with customers in an environment where a specific item is out of stock. There's plenty of food. There's plenty of food available. It's about individual items being out of stock at moments in time and Sysco working proactively with our customers to be able to serve their needs with something that meets the needs of their menu. So we're doing a better job in this most recent quarter at that, and we expect continued improvement into Q4 and into our fiscal 2023. 
As it relates to the overall environmental conditions, our staffing health has improved. It continues to steadily improve. We're not out of the woods. We still have work to do, but we're making progress. And then -- to your point about things like maintenance of equipment, yes. Shortages are impacting all forms of supply chains, not just food. So access to parts is a challenge, and access to new equipment is a challenge. 
Interestingly, we're doing better work in that regard to centralize that activity at Sysco, to have a better control over parts inventory and purchasing of equipment. And I would emphasize one important point there. Our size and scale can enable us to have preferred advantage with manufacturers who are on limited allocation, and we'll be at the front of the line for equipment. In fact, Aaron and I have preapproved and preordered equipment to support the Recipe for Growth."

We're not exposed from a sales perspective was Aaron's main point to what's happening in Eastern Europe because we're not domiciled there, right? We don't have actual business in those countries. So unlike other companies that are international, we're not exposed in that regard. We had purchased product previously from Russia, and we're no longer purchasing product from Russia. And we've been able to move to alternative sources of supply, mostly in seafood. And that was the work we needed to do was to get alternative product from alternative countries to be able to support the needs of our customers. 
As it relates to is Western Europe feeling the impact of the war, Ukraine is the bread basket of Europe. Sunflower oils and grains are produced there. You can get product -- we, Sysco, are able to get product. What it's had is an impact on inflation in those countries. Interestingly, those countries were behind the U.S. from an inflation perspective. So what's happening in Europe right now is an increase in inflation. But frankly, it's just catching up to the inflation that was already visible in the United States. 
And we're managing it well. We're managing the pass-through of that inflation, Jeff, well in our international segment. So that kind of bundles in macroeconomic environment, what's happening. What's happening is inflation increasing in Europe. 
Point 2, though, is this consumer demand. We are not seeing a decrease in consumer demand in our international geographies. And I'd just remind everyone, and I think Aaron did a good job in his prepared remarks of reminding everyone, international was hit earlier. It was hit harder, and international has been slower to recover. So we see our international business as a tailwind in Q4 and into fiscal '23 because there's still much more recovery in front of us, international, relative to the U.S. business. So continued progress in international month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, and we see anticipated additional recovery happening in international."

The no order minimum can be measured through Net Promoter Score satisfaction of our customers with Sysco and our ability to acquire and win net new customers. And I tried to mention a moment ago, and the only downside of that would be is if we're not moving customers up the profitability ladder over time by selling around the room, we would address that. And I mentioned, I'll repeat it, we're doing a very good job of selling around the room and increasing the net profitability of acquired customers by increasing penetration after we've acquired them. So we're really pleased with the no order minimum policy. We think having an order minimum is not a great customer policy. We need to be there for our customers when they need us, how they need us, and we don't anticipate making structural changes in that regard. 
The 6-day workweek makes us more efficient. That's not an increase in cost to Sysco. That's actually increasing Sysco's cost efficiency by leveraging our physical assets to a greater degree. A truck going out of 6 days is a good thing, not a bad thing. So it leverages our capability. And what it also provides is, as I mentioned, increased flexibility for any individual, singular day, and we can continue to go out and win net new business because of the incremental capacity that we have provided. 
The big transition was for our workforce. And as I mentioned, we've converted that incredibly important population of ours to a 4-day workweek. And what's really important is when we need them then to work overtime, they're working a fifth day voluntarily, which is much easier for someone to do than when they're asked to come in on a sixth day. It's just better for their life. Though their scheduled normal workweek is 4 days. And when we need them for overtime, they work fifth. And obviously, there's overlapping schedules between team A, team B, et cetera, et cetera, to fill out the full 6-day workweek. 
So our customers are going to see more consistent on-time deliveries. We've increased our flexibility. We've increased our capacity, and we can do it more cost effectively. Those are the reasons why we did it. But it's a change that's challenging to do, and we've got it in the rearview mirror."

Now you might ask, well, where is that coming from? I refer back to Kevin's early remarks as well around where we still have opportunity, business and industry, corporate headquarters, which is a significant part of our business, those are still not open, right?

The only thing additional beyond that is we're winning big in specialty. Our produce business, our specialty meat business, we are doing very well.

Certainly, I've seen some things in the marketplace of people bringing in pre-prepared products I wouldn't have necessarily expected. And I think there's some things kind of written in the news of, I guess, how significant of a trend that this actually may be for restaurants. So wanted you to comment on that and how you feel if you do think that, that's going to be an acceleration and trend, how you think you'd be best advantaged to take advantage of it."

Just I think one of the points that sometimes people forget about Sysco is that we have the, by far, largest sales force in the industry. It is a vibrant, strong, capable group of people who are culinary experts. So these are chefs. These are ex-restaurant owners. They are culinary school grads. They are absolutely pros. And we have the highest net satisfaction rate of the sales force versus the industry, and we do not intend to reduce the size of that sales force. We intend to increase their productivity through the digital tools I mentioned. 
But this topic that you just brought up, which is what's happening with food trends is exactly what our sales force does. They call upon customers. They go to the restaurant, they spend time in the back room of the kitchen. They talk about food trends to educate customers on things that are happening. And yes, there is a movement towards because of labor shortages in restaurants, more available product upstream preparation and the like, and no one is better prepared to be able to drive and leverage trends like that than Sysco. 
Our cutting-edge solutions brand, which falls under Sysco brand, is doing just that. And we're bringing product to our customers oftentimes exclusive for a period of time to enable them to take work out of the kitchen but have incredibly high-quality taste and consistency on the plate. There's nobody better positioned than us to be able to leverage those types of trends and capabilities, including those kitchens, which I get asked about all the time. Are ghost kitchens are bad for Sysco? Not at all. Because guess what? Ghost kitchens order food, and there's absolutely no reason why we can't over-index in our ability to serve those customers. Many ghost kitchens are actually a full-fledged kitchen for a restaurant, which actually is good for Sysco because it increases our drop size of the delivery to that door."

It's a great question. I gave a good example of technology deployment on today's call, which is the turbocharging of the capability of the sales rep by teeing up on a silver platter for them the next best action for that day's visit that is using data, deep troves of purchasing data to provide a suggestion to the sales rep on something the customer will be interested in and then preapproving for them an offer that is financially good for Sysco that would be beneficial for the customer. It's a game changer.
Our sales reps are excellent at building strong relationships with customers, and they are experts in food. But what we're now providing them is an N-of-1 personalization for each and every customer on something that we know will be desired by the customer and an offer that will be compelling, again, financially for us and also for that customer. So that's a great example. 
We're making meaningful progress on our website improvement, which is the ordering platform, our digital ordering platform, which I want to be clear is not just a desktop. It's a mobile version. We have click-to-order through e-mails now, where we can send an e-mail to a customer with an offer and/or with a suggested order. And with one click of one button, we will ship that product to them. They don't even have to go to an ordering platform. These are what we call removing points of friction, tools and capabilities, leveraging modern technology. 
We talked about pricing a lot. I don't need to repeat that. What we're working on now is supply chain improvement technology. We want to make the work that our supply chain associates do easier to do. And by making that work easier to do, it will improve the satisfaction of our associates for the job, will help us drive improved associate retention, which will drive improved productivity for Sysco. So without getting into the specifics on today's call, for both our warehouse associates and for our drivers, we're making meaningful investments in the technology that those associates interact with to make the job easier.

Q4 marked another quarter of positive top and bottom line performance at Sysco. The quarter capped off strong financial performance in fiscal 2022 as we grew annual sales by 33.8% to over $68 billion. 
For the year, Sysco grew our business more than 1.3x the industry. This result exceeded our goal for the year and the second half of the year performance was even stronger than the first. 
The outperformance in the U.S. helped drive over $17 billion of total company sales growth for the year. Consistent with our focus on profitable growth, we grew adjusted EPS by 133.8%. Our team generated these results while advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy, improving our balance sheet and delivering compelling shareholder returns. 
I will highlight 2 topics during our call today. First, I will share progress we have made as a company over the past year that displays Cisco's unique position of strength in the market. 
Second, I'll convey why we are confident in our trajectory for profitable growth in fiscal '23. Before I get started, let me acknowledge that we are closely monitoring macroeconomic pressures that are impacting consumer confidence across the globe such as spikes in gas prices, food inflation and rising interest rates. Despite these external factors, Sysco was prepared to deliver significant market share gains and profitable growth this coming year. 
So let's get started with our unique position of strength and a bit more about who we are, displayed on Slides 5 and 6. I am often asked to describe Sysco. Simply put, Sysco is 50% a food supply chain company and 50% at food sales and marketing company. To be successful as a leader at Sysco and to be successful in this business, you need to be equally capable of leading in both arenas, supply chain and sales. Over the past 2.5 years, we have developed a strategy called our Recipe for Growth that is advancing our capabilities in supply chain and sales. We are transforming Sysco by building new capabilities that will further enable our position as a global leader in food distribution. 
Let me first highlight the 50% of Sysco that is our food supply chain by summarizing some of our biggest accomplishments of the past year. Throughout the year, we have led the industry from an OTIF perspective. For those not in logistics, that stands for on-time and in full. This past year was the most challenging OTIF year on record in our industry. 
During those challenging conditions, Sysco was able to be better in stock and better able to shift on time versus those that we compete against. As a result, we won substantial new business and provided stronger-than-industry average service levels to our existing customers. We're deeply committed to returning to and exceeding our historical OTIF levels over the coming quarters and years. 
We fully converted our supply chain to a full 6-day service week. Simultaneously, we converted the majority of our U.S. frontline associates to a 4-day work schedule, enabling improved work-life balance for our associates. The 6-day work model for our large network of DCs will enable Sysco to grow profitably for years to come by better leveraging our physical assets. 
Their transition to the 6-day model was a big lift. And I want to thank our associates and our customers for their partnership and the transition. The 6-day model will ensure industry-leading OTIF results for years to come. 
We launched our Sysco Driver Academy, opening our first training location and began building out a nationwide infrastructure that will be complete by the end of this calendar year. The Driver Academy is helping Sysco address the shortage of skilled drivers and our Academy will increase the number of skilled drivers at Sysco and will deliver increased lifetime earnings potential for the associates selected to participate. We have piloted and are scaling new picking methods at our warehouses that will improve the experience of our delivery drivers. 
In addition, we're providing our drivers with advanced material handling equipment that reduces the physicality of their day. These actions will improve the experience of our drivers, enabling improved productivity, improved retention and increased customer service. 
Lastly, we've built out a distributed order management system, or DOMS for short, that will enable omnichannel fulfillment at Sysco in fiscal '23. We have decoupled the front end of our network, sales from the back end of our network operations through this project. No longer will a customer need to order just from their local sites inventory assortment. We are opening up our vast network of inventory to our customers through the DOM implementation, while also improving the productivity of our working capital through this industry-leading project. We will be launching our first [indiscernible] soon with plans to expand and scale in '23 and beyond. 
Our supply chain mission at Sysco is clear, enable profitable growth by delivering the industry's leading assortment of products delivered on time and in full at a delivery frequency that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations. Our supply chain greatly enhanced our capabilities to deliver on that mission in fiscal '22. 
Now I would like to highlight the progress that we have made in the other 50% of our company's key work focus, food sales and marketing. We live our food credentials every day with over 7,500 sales consultants in hundreds of culinary partners and product specialists across the globe. I dare say there are a few, if any, that know more about food and food trends than our culinary teams. Our sales associates have the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry, with NPS overall satisfaction rates, a full point higher than our competitors. Please see Chart 7. 
Our sales consultants are experts in everything from menus with our customers, identifying and introducing new food trends and importantly, partnering with our customers to help save them money. From a product perspective, we've the broadest assortment of food in the industry, and we have expanded that assortment strength with the recent acquisitions of Greco, Paragon Foods and the Coastal Companies. Our product assortment is second to none, and we offer fair and appropriate prices to our customers. 
Like I summarize with our supply chain, I would like to highlight some of the progress that we have made over the past year with regards to food sales and marketing. We implemented an intelligent data-driven pricing system to improve our ability to be what we call right on price at the customer item level. We built and scaled a customer personalization engine, which provides our customers with unique offers that their specific needs. We upgraded and improved our digital shopping platform. We improved search navigation, We made it even easier to reorder Common Essentials, and we introduced product recommendation engines that increase customer basket size. We improved what we call team-based selling, better leveraging our sales teams across Broadline and our collection of specialty businesses. 
Lastly, we can measure success over the past year in several ways. I'd highlight, too. Firstly, during the great resignation, our sales consultant retention in fiscal 2022 exceeded our historical average. RSEs look the new tools that we have built, and they have deeply embraced our Recipe for Growth. 
And secondly, we successfully grew more than 1.3x the industry in 2022. This result exceeded our goal for the year and the second half of the year performance was even stronger than the first. Our customers are rewarding us with more of their business because of the relationships they have with our sales teams and because of the new tools and services that we have deployed in food sales and marketing. 
Defining excellence in food sales and distribution, that is Sysco. We are confident that we have the size, scale and expertise to be the leader in these 2 arenas, bringing innovation to our customers every day. 
Topic 2 for today, I'd like to discuss the current economic climate and our view for the upcoming year. We're closely monitoring macroeconomic pressures and data points related to food inflation, gas prices and consumer confidence. There is no doubt that end consumers have a lot on their minds these days. We think it's important to remember the resilience of our industry and how we have adapted over the past few years. We submit respectively that food away from home has proven to be resilient. And quite frankly, essential. Over the last 2.5 years, our industry has dealt with challenge after challenge with 3 major ways of COVID, double-digit inflation and innovation in Ukraine impacting the food supply. Despite these challenges, we have delivered profitable growth. We have learned to operate in an abnormal environment and we are prepared to navigate another dynamic year ahead. 
While we anticipate that recent macroeconomic headwinds make REIT less robust industry-wide growth rate in '23 than we had originally planned, we are prepared to generate sales growth of at least 10% in 2023. Aaron will address guidance in more detail in a moment. 
There are several reasons why we believe we will deliver on our financial targets. First, as the industry leader, we're fully diversified, covering every corner of the food away from home market. We serve restaurants up and down the price point spectrum and across all restaurant types. We deliver food to health care and education facilities that are less prone to recession. We delivered to travel and recreation facilities into any office buildings. These last 2 sectors continue to rebound and will provide a source of growth in the coming years. 
Additionally, we still have big opportunities to grow in the restaurant space. Even if traffic is more muted than originally forecasted by Technomic, remember that we serve roughly 50% of the total restaurant door locations, and we have roughly 30% share of wallet with existing customers. Sysco can still grow our business even if the market growth is less compelling. And given the strict step downs internationally in 2022, we have strong growth potential year-over-year from our International division. 
Simply put, we intend to win share profitably in fiscal '23. 
Second, regarding inflation, we continue to work with our customers to pass through the majority of cost inflation. Interestingly, the relative price of eating out has been less impacted by inflation than the cost of food at the grocery store as seen on Slides 8 to 9. When coupled with people's desire to eat out, we believe that restaurants will once again prove resilient. 
Third, our investments include sales and marketing capabilities through our Recipe for Growth strategy will deliver increased value in the coming years. The topics I highlighted on this call today, coupled with new programs like Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks will drive increased market share growth. Once again, we plan to grow faster than the overall industry, with a target in fiscal '23 of growing 1.35x the industry. This trend will put us on the trajectory needed to deliver our fiscal year '24 target of growing 1.5x the industry. We are increasingly confident in our longer-term guidance provided in May of 2021 at our Investor Day. 
In addition to ensuring that we drive compelling market share growth, Aaron, our entire leadership team and I will be focused on productivity improvement and structural cost out. We're proud of the progress that we have made in reducing structural costs over the past year and we will be relentlessly focused on improving operations efficiency in fiscal '23. 
Lastly, we are excited to welcome Paulo Peereboom as the newly appointed leader of our international operations. Paulo has an extensive track record of driving transformation and building high-performing customer-focused teams across multiple geographies. This includes over 30 years of experience across 7 countries, all in the food business. 
Our international team had a strong year of improvement in '22, and we are increasingly confident in our future. Paulo will take some momentum we are building to the next level. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details. Aaron, over to you."
189096,1792319554,2623897,"Sysco Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2022",2022-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. The Sysco team delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full financial year giving us many reasons to be upbeat about our business. Let's talk about some of the highlights. We achieved an all-",1681,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. The Sysco team delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full financial year giving us many reasons to be upbeat about our business. 
Let's talk about some of the highlights. We achieved an all-time record for quarterly and annual sales of Sysco landing at $19 billion for the quarter and almost $69 million for the year. 
For the fourth quarter, our enterprise sales grew 17.5% with U.S. Foodservice Operations growing at 16.4% and international growing at 30%. At the enterprise level, adjusting out the extra week in Q4 of fiscal year '21, our sales growth was even higher at 26.5%.
With respect to volume, U.S. Broadline volume increased 5.4% on a 13- to 13-week comparison basis. We baked $3.5 billion in adjusted gross profit for the quarter and $12.4 billion for the year, up almost 20% versus last year for the fourth quarter and up 32.5% for the year. 
Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.4% for the fourth quarter with the rate rising from last quarter and up 33 basis points to Q4 fiscal '21, even with the impact of incremental inflation. GP dollars per case grew in all 4 segments versus prior year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of such growth. 
We continue to pass along product inflation, which was around 15% in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, while passing along part of our operating cost inflation. 
Our Snapback operating costs dropped to $29 million in Q4. Productivity gaps, however, were a continuing factor as, on the one hand, we returned to employment levels higher than fiscal '19, but on the other, we invested to cover over time to address growing demand and lower productivity of the new staff. We invested $67 million of operating expenses for the recipe for growth in the quarter, with supply chain investments ramping up significantly. 
Overall adjusted operating expenses were $2.6 billion for the quarter or 13.8% of our sales. Operating leverage improved by 55 basis points for the quarter and 117 basis points for the year. Adjusted operating income increased by 45% versus last year to $87 million in the quarter, also exceeding our pre-COVID Q4 2019 results, an excellent sign of progress. 
Operating income for the year was $2.6 billion. We are particularly pleased with the progress of our U.S. Foodservice segment which delivered record operating income for the quarter and with the continued sequential progress of our international operations, which once again made progress in the direction of pre-COVID profitability. 
At the enterprise level, we continue to have the highest EBITDA margin in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA surpassed $1 billion for the first time ever in a quarter at Sysco and we delivered $3.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year, notwithstanding COVID, Omicron inflation, the invasion of Ukraine and high fuel prices. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.15, which is an all-time high for the fourth quarter or any quarter for that matter at Sysco. 
In regards to the balance sheet, we paid down $450 million of debt as it came due in Q4. We ended the year at 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and during the fiscal year, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through 500 million of share repurchase completed in the fourth quarter and $959 million of dividends. Since year-end, we have also repurchased additional shares. More on that to come. 
Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion, and free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the year. With our focus on driving rising sales and profitability comes rising inventory and a higher balance healthy accounts receivable, both the use of cash for the year. Our team continues to manage our receivables balance as well and we also benefited from higher accounts payable. We ended the quarter with approximately $867 million in cash on hand. 
So let's turn to look forward. In recent months and indeed at the start of my comments today, I observed that Kevin and I are a beat about our business. And that view carries through to future quarters for Sysco. The upbeat guidance we are providing is reflective of our ongoing investments and our extensive efforts to reposition Sysco as a growth company. 
As Kevin mentioned earlier, we are well positioned and prepared to operate through another dynamic year and are assessing whether and to what degree a recession will impact the economy and our business. It's worth repeating that we benefit from the scale at which we're operating, our diversification as the industry leader across customer types, product categories and geographies, the discipline enabled by our pricing tool, our strong balance sheet and demonstrated focus on cost takeout. We have carefully examined Cisco's results during the '08-'09 recession, and importantly, we benefit from the fact that our company has just operated through and learned from the business interruption of COVID. 
Here's the real punch line. We are better positioned today to address macro events than we have ever been before. 
So with all of that said, during fiscal '23, from a growth algorithm perspective, we expect to grow at least 1.35x the market regardless of the economic environment. While it is difficult to be precise from the current macro environment, based on initial estimates of market growth and inflation, we expect top line growth of at least 10% over fiscal year 2022, which will move Sysco above the $75 billion annual sales mark for the first time. Bolt-on acquisitions will also contribute to our growth. 
We are expecting mid-single-digit inflation for the full year on an enterprise basis across all categories, moderating from high single digits in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis to low single digits in Q4. We are not planning for a deflationary environment, though some categories may be individually inflationary. We do expect elevated operating expenses during the year as we continue to deal with the hiring environment that is still recovering associate tenure driven productivity issues that we expect to improve over the course of this year and continued planned investments for our transformation, all these mitigated in part by cost-out efforts. 
Speaking of cost out, we delivered significant cost out in fiscal 2022, helping offset incremental operating expenses this year. We have now exceeded our cumulative cost-out target of $750 million. And we're going back for more, the achievement of which is already included in our EPS growth expectations. 
All in, we are growing our adjusted EPS with both volume growth and profit improvements contributing to our substantial increases in earnings per share. We are guiding adjusted EPS for fiscal year '23 of $4.09 to $4.39. The midpoint of this range equals a 30% increase in adjusted EPS over fiscal year 2022. It also represents a 20% increase in our adjusted EPS from our previous high point, fiscal '19. 
Please take note of the fact that even the low end of our adjusted EPS range for fiscal year '23 reflects the highest adjusted EPS achieved at Sysco ever in a year. 
While I do not intend to debate the definition of recession with economist, the low end of our range reflects a modest recession impacting our year. And the midpoint reflects the current operating environment and the top end reflects a strong economic recovery. 
The macro environment, our productivity improvement efforts and the timing of our recipe for growth investments will impact the cadence of our earnings growth with stronger profit growth expected in the second half. For Q1, we expect adjusted EPS to be at or near our prior first quarter high point from back in 2020. The stronger earnings growth in the second half reflects continued progress with our rescue for growth, progress on productivity initiatives, lapping last year's Omicron related slowdown and the fact that Q4 is always our seasonal profit high point. 
You may recall that in May 2021, we provided long-term guidance for fiscal year '24 to achieve adjusted EPS 30% higher than fiscal '19. The midpoint of our fiscal year '23 guidance, which is 20% above fiscal '19 reflects that we are well on our way to achieving our previous long-term EPS guidance. 
The midpoint of our guidance also translates to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4 billion in the year. We are forecasting continued strong cash generation and an increase from 2022 levels driven by profit increases, offset by investments in working capital as AR grows with our sales, and we continue to our strategy with tactical investments in inventory. 
Our capital allocation strategy remains sustained going forward, invest in the business, including through M&A, maintain our strong investment-grade rating and continue our return of capital to shareholders. 
With EBITDA growing, we expect to make further progress on our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in service of our target of 2.5x to 2.75x. 
Also note that we are positioned well in the current rising interest rate environment as approximately 95% of our debt is fixed. Just last week, Moody's reaffirmed Sysco's strong investment-grade credit rating and stabilized our rating outlook. We are committed to completing up $500 million of share repurchases in fiscal '23, and indeed have already completed $267 million of that repurchase commitment during Q1 of this year. We will be assessing the operating environment and the cash as of further M&A opportunities before committing to an incremental share repurchase activity beyond the $500 million during the year. Our status for the dividend aristocrat is important to us and we already announced the effective $0.08 annual dividend increase for our fiscal year '23. 
In summary, we view fiscal '23 as an excellent build upon fiscal '22 as we grow both the top line and the bottom line, while playing the long game and investing for the future at Sysco. All of these efforts are consistent with fulfilling our long-term guidance from Investor Day, which includes exceeding 1.5x market share growth by the end of fiscal year 2024 and adjusted EPS growth of at least 30% over our record 2019 levels. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for remarks."

Sysco already is the industry leader from an EBITDA margin perspective. And as you heard from Aaron, we plan to build on that position of strength in fiscal 2023. Our key takeaways from today's call reflects 3 points. First, we advanced our Recipe per Growth strategy and grew more than 1.3x the market for the year, with the second half even stronger than the first; second, we improved profitability with sequential progress in both gross profit and operating margin rates; and third, recognizing macroeconomic pressures as well as the resiliency of our industry, we're confident in our external guidance for fiscal year 2023. This assumes at least 10% sales growth and 30% EPS growth at the midpoint as we continue to grow with new and existing customers. We will also remain disciplined in expense management with a strong plan to drive increased operating leverage. 
Turning to the next slide. We are generating substantial top line momentum and accelerating market charities. Our recipe for growth transformation is winning in the marketplace and creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term. We are further building the fun and enhancing our competitive scale advantages. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment, while also rewarding our long-term shareholders with disciplined dividend growth and share repurchases. 
Lastly, we are committed to our long-term financial outlook, which includes significant sales and EPS growth and returning value to our shareholders along the way. There are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I'm both excited and proud to be a part of the journey. 
Operator, you can now open the line for questions."

So flattish is the answer from a Q4 same number of weeks year-over-year. And just keep in mind, as you look at this past year, when we were comping against recovery, which Q4, we were comping against a pretty strong recovery in '21. So flattish volumes on 13 to 13 against prior year, pretty strong recovery. What we're seeing right now from a volume perspective is when you couple that with inflation that was higher than what we had modeled and expected, really strong sales results for the quarter. And obviously, that strong sales, coupled with the flattish volume for local flowed through to a profit number that was robust for the quarter, exceeded our guide. As Aaron mentioned, highest quarter ever for Sysco. As we think about this coming year, I'd point you to Slide 10 that was in our prepared remarks, that chart does include all business. It's not just local, but it speaks for itself, the performance of Sysco over time that we're pulling away from the market. I stated on the call this morning that we grew at 1.3 times the industry for the year. And I also was pretty clear that we grew in the second half even faster than the first. 
So in the chart shows that, if you look at the lines in the separation that's occurring. So we're building momentum. At that moment, to answer your question just on trends is carrying through at the national level and also at the local level. We're winning more new national business at profit rates that meet or exceed our expectations, and we're having a lot of success at the local level.as well. My comments in regards to macroeconomics do apply to all customer types, including the mom-and-pop local independent. We view cost of fuel as one of the primary drivers of consumer sentiment and that high cost of fuel that was impacting consumers began in the Q4 and is included in the business trends that we're producing, and it was thoughtful in the guide that we provided today. 
Last but not least, Aaron's comments of at least 10% sales growth this year and 30% EPS growth, and we're confident in our ability to deliver against those mile-markers."

I'm going to start just talking about overall supply chain productivity, and then I'll toss to Aaron, who can comment on overall expense leverage and anything he'd like to share in that regard. 
Aaron called out in our prepared remarks where we're winning as a company. There are elements where we're doing really well. We're winning from a top line perspective. We're gaining share, both national and local. We're doing an excellent job at GP management passing through inflation, using strategic sourcing to purchase product at a competitive rate and having that impact positively our margin rates, and we had a disappointment from an expense perspective versus where we expected to be. I want to be clear on what the driver of that is and it's just in general, our overall productivity within our supply chain being behind where we expected it to be. And I want to unpack that a little bit, make some comments about it and then toss to Aaron.
 I want to be clear, we are properly staffed within our supply chain at this point in time, and that has a dramatic improvement year-over-year. This time last year, with the recovery of the business was occurring and the great resignation was happening. We were understaffed as well as the industry and it created a lot of pain within our supply chain. We are properly staffed at this time. Our hiring has improved, applicant flow has improved and the training that we are providing to our new associates has simply never been better. In fact, we're heading to one of our sites this afternoon to go spend time with our training academy and celebrate the success that, that team is having on providing literally the industry's best training program to our associates. 
So we are properly staffed, we are investing in training at a level that we have not performed. We have a challenge in overall math, which is the simple following point. Roughly half of our supply chain associates have been with the company for under a year. And it's that point, that point alone, that results in a productivity rate that is below, therefore, our historical average. These are challenging jobs. They're skilled labor positions, and it takes time for someone to move up the productivity curve. 
The reason for my calling out that data point, that roughly half of our associates were in job under a year, is that is absolutely an addressable topic by Sysco's leadership, myself, our team and the driver and selector academies that I referenced on today's call. We will improve associate retention in the process of improving that retention and improving our training efforts, we will move people up the productivity curve. And in the process of moving up there the productivity curve, it will lower our logistics cost as a percent of sales and our logistics cost to serve. It's taking a little bit longer than we would have liked, but we will improve retention. We will improve productivity, and that has been included in the guidance that we provided today for fiscal '23. 
Aaron, I'll toss to you for additional comments."

Let me touch a couple of the elements as apparent on the face of Kevin's remarks, we're going to increase volume over the course of fiscal '23. And of course, with increased incomes, increased cost of service. we would all expect that. 
During the quarter, we did also have to address increased costs of things like fuel, recruiting, et cetera, cost to hire, and those are moderating, right? And we have steps in place hedging or other programs to address those as well. But as we look forward, we expect those to improve in fiscal '23. Kevin has already touched on the impact of productivity. As we called out in our guidance, we expect that to improve over the course of the year. Our transformation expenses were higher in Q4. And indeed, we will continue to invest heavily in the year as we play the long game against our transformation expense, but those are costs that over time will moderate. 
And then snap back, they came down in Q4, and we expect them to continue to come down over the course of the year. Now the thing we haven't talked about so far yet is cost out, right? We were pleased that we had surpassed our original cost-out objective of $750 million during the year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going back for more, and there is more opportunity. 
One of the benefits of operating of a company of the size of Sysco is where we find a good idea and we deploy it, we can recognize what works and that we can deploy to other parts of our enterprise. And so we've actually recently revised our structure of cost leadership to go after more and are confident that we can continue to help to offset some of the costs elsewhere in the network, at least through cost out as we carry forward. The benefits, they're all baked into the guidance that we've provided for fiscal year '23. Thank you."

The step-up is just go back to our original guide from May of '21, our Investor Day was to grow 1.2 in the year that just ended into grout 1.5 in fiscal 2024. And essentially, fiscal '23 was going to be a midpoint between those 2 things as we ramped up our Recipe for Growth. 
What happened in fiscal 2022, the year that just ended, is we had 2 primary contributions to our success. One was our Recipe for Growth, which I'm going to come back to in a second. The second was our ability to ship on time and in full, as I mentioned on today's call, was greater than the industry at large. And we had national customers and local customers coming to Sysco and essentially asking us to take on their business, and we were able to take on that business at above historical profit rates because of the economic macro conditions as they were. 
So that relative supply chain strength was a large contributor to our success and the recipe for growth was a large contributor to success. And what we guided today is a 1.35x market growth. As Aaron said, regardless of how the market performs, we're going to perform better than that market in total. What will happen in '23 is the relative supply chain strength contribution will be smaller because we expect for the overall marketplace to be more stable in this coming year and the relative impact of the Recipe for Growth will be greater in '23. 
And the reason it steps up to 1.5 in fiscal '20 again, that Recipe for Growth contribution gets bigger and stronger each year. 
Why is that? I'll just point to a couple of examples. We're an agile development health from a tech perspective, and we're rolling out new functionality to our website literally every 2 weeks. And those contributions of increasing the efficiency of placing an order, add value. The work we're doing with data and analytics to provide suggested orders to our customers get smarter and better over time, it adds value. 
I mentioned in my prepared remarks today, 2 of our newer efforts, which is Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks, there's still an implementation mode at the current time. Here's the good news. Both programs are exceeding our internal expectations for the neighborhoods and customers that have been enrolled, and we will roll those programs out nationwide over the coming quarters and years. And so that's a relative contribution. 
So what we see is a sequential increase in the effective power and weight of those programs, and it's why we reiterated today our overall macro confidence in our ability to grow 1.5x in the market in fiscal '24. And we think given everything that's going on in the overall environment, the 1.35x guide that we provided today is prudent.

Yes, mathematically implied in what you just said is if the overall market grows less than what we expected, and we communicated today that we see our ability to deliver at least a 10% sales lift. We will then take more share. And we will do so profitably. I want to be crystal clear, I've said before, many times, I'll say again, we will not use price as a primary lever to try to win business. We think that's irrational. And we want to win through assortment, our service, our capabilities, our programs, et cetera, et cetera.
If you pick just one thing to focus on to improve profitability, it would be increased penetration with existing customers. That's the direct answer to your question. If we could focus on one thing and one thing only, it's increased penetration with existing customers. we are really pleased with what we're seeing, John, with Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks on penetration by providing customers in Sysco Your Way with late in the evening, caught off increased delivery frequency, no order minimums in a compelling service coverage model, meaning dedicated sales reps, dedicated driver, partner, et cetera, et cetera. The reward we are experiencing in those neighborhoods is increased penetration with existing customers. 
And Sysco Perks is a loyalty program tied to our most important customers. Essentially, it's a VIP club, you get invited into. The entire purpose of that club is to increase penetration, increase share of wallet with existing customers. 
So we're bullish on those 2 strategic arrows in our quiver. But we believe that we can win new business as well. Our sales reps are motivated financially to win new customers. We've got the largest and most qualified sales force in the industry, and they're doing a very good job of new customer prospecting, and we continue to win net new customers at accelerated rates. So it's actually the 2 together is what's causing that separation on Slide 10 of us versus the market. But if you can do one and one only, it's increased penetration with existing customers."

So we call it team-based selling and our ability to deliver that high-end fine protein center of plate along with broad line value is second to none in the industry. And we're doing an even better job than ever before and have been able to bring that specialty price point, that specialty product, along with bags of rice and flower, et cetera, et cetera, that Broadline is known for. So we're doing that very well. 
John, I'd say in the current economic environment and the reality of COVID the biggest challenge, the biggest barrier has been product availability, believe it or not. The ability to be in stock at all times with key volume items that our customers need, and there have been challenges with long-term out on product that if you can't deliver, guess what, their customer is going to go somewhere else to get that product. And then if they do go somewhere else, do they get sticky with that source of purchasing on that product and then you need to win it back over time. 
So that's not a problem that's unique to Sysco. Fill rate from suppliers, inbound distributors has been difficult over the last 18 months because of staffing issues and challenges in the supplier base. And then that has shown up with a customer telling us, ""Hey, listen, I need 2 or 3 distributors because if you can't fill my order, I need to be able to have my menu in stock."" We're making meaningful progress on that topic at Sysco. We are leading the industry from an OTIF perspective, as I mentioned. 
So we don't view that as a point of weakness. We view it as a point of strength, but I'm meaningfully answering your question that, that has been for our industry, the biggest challenge, product availability. 
Topic 2, which is the more historical answer to your question is its price. A competitor comes in on one item and undercuts you on price with that 1 item and then the customer says, ""Well, hey, wait a minute, I can get this product 10% cheaper somewhere else."" We don't price a business just 1 item. It's a book of business. And so there's this that constant, I call it [ ankle biters ], a competitor coming in, trying to undercut you on price on a single item trying to get in the door. And that's not a new topic. People coming in and trying to undercut on a single item. 
But again, our pricing tool gives us the sophistication that we need to make sure that our sales reps are confident in the prices that they're representing in the marketplace are fair and appropriate, and I think we're better equipped to be able to manage that in the future than ever before. 
John, back to you if you have a follow-up."

Strong quarter for the quarter that disclosed, wrapped up a strong year versus where we expected that business to be and we're building momentum. 
As we think about this upcoming year, Omicron impacted the United States, and we had some softening in the business in Q2 and Q3. Well, that softening was even greater internationally. Europe was in complete lockdown. The country of France, in particular, like shut all restaurants down again during Omicron. I mean it's really different how Europe handled COVID. 
And in Canada, while the lockdowns weren't as robust as Europe, consumer psyche risk tolerance was much lower than the U.S. and just overall food away-from-home volumes were down. 
So we're bullish about the year ahead. Paulo joining our company, as I announced today on the call, is going to be just a great addition to our team, and we have confidence that this coming year will be a sequential increase in both the top line and the bottom line contribution from international. 
Specific to your question about initiatives, I love that question. It's exactly what we are doing. We are taking the recipe for growth, which is meaningfully working in the U.S., and we are bringing the best practices from now these programs to our international domain, starting with Canada. 
So we're deploying a new modern website this year in Canada. We are deploying a new pricing tool in Canada this year, and we will be bringing programs like Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks to Canada as well. 
The same goes to Ireland and GB and France to round out our larger international sectors. We are bringing to each of those countries the main elements of our strength portfolio, including advancing Sysco brand as a represented product offering in each of those countries. 
So we're thoughtful about it. We are pragmatic about it. We can't do everything overnight, but we are meaningfully rigorously prioritizing which initiatives are taken to which country when. And obviously, that's been built into our guidance for this coming year. Aaron, I'll toss to you for any additional comments."

And so what we came out with from a guidance perspective with our $0.30 range was a balanced view, we believe, of if things continue as they are down the midpoint relative to our ability to deliver the profitability. Of course, if there is a modest impact from a recession perspective, again, looking at it across the portfolio as we do the math, you see the lower end of our guide. And indeed, if that doesn't materialize, some are saying it won't not going to comment on that. We wanted to also reflect the fact that there is some further upside in the opportunity as well.

I'll start just kind of what's happening with SYGMA and then I'll toss to Aaron to answer your question about the numbers in whatever manner he would like. 
So just a reminder for those that are new covering our company -- just a little bit about our SYGMA business. It's very different. It's very unique in relation to everything else we do. It is a cost per case business on a multiyear contract basis. 
So let's just be honest and clear. It was a very difficult year for SYGMA as fuel costs rose significantly, as labor costs because of retention challenges and productivity challenges tied to that rose significantly. SYGMA got pinched and pinched hard on rising expenses, essentially the inability to pass through rising costs because of the way that business is run on a fee per case basis, challenging year. 
Last point is it's a stretch miles business, where the route distances are substantially longer than what I call the pedal runs or Broadline where we started in D.C., do a little run come back home. SYGMA is long-distance driving in what we call stretch miles. 
So the rising cost of fuel was a real particular pain point. If I look at this upcoming year, I'll just give color commentary on where we have confidence the improvement will come from, and then I'll toss to Aaron. 
And the higher turnover and the negative impact of that higher turnover had on our productivity and overtime rates that we were incurring because of the open jobs was a major pain point, and that is meaningfully addressable through the work that we're doing with hiring stability, which is meaningfully improving. Training effectiveness, which I've already spoken to on this call, and our ability to reduce over time, reduce the use of third-party labor and just frankly, run the model more efficiently. 
So we can get back to more historical standards of cost to serve and improve the profitability of SYGMA, and that is our intention this year. 
Aaron, I'll toss to you for additional comment."

What we are commenting is that within each of our sectors, from white table go all the way down to QSR, we see winners and losers within each of those sectors. And I think you see that in the coverage that you do across that sector. There are winners and there are losers within each segment. We are not seeing meaningful shift from the top end of the spectrum to QSR are within the sectors. 
What we are seeing, point number two, for some additional color is that customers within each of the sectors wanting to partner with Sysco to provide value to their customers to help offset the cost of inflation. 
So because of that would be Sysco brand penetration is increasing, which is a good thing for us. and we will be sticky on that. I want to be clear about that. When we make progress in Sysco brand, when customers give it a try and we do product quality cuttings, they love the product quality. They obviously enjoy the savings from a cost perspective and then we can be very sticky in that regard. 
So that's a key point. And then I think you've heard from some of the manufacturers, some shift from the beef category into poultry that was publicly communicated yesterday. And I would say, yes, beef has been highly inflationary. It was the most inflationary category over the last couple of years and customers of ours are looking at portion size. They're looking at alternative protein options. And that's what our sales results -- excuse me, sales consultants do. They helped our customers with that. 
The good news on the protein side specific to beef prices have normalized, and I know you're aware of that as well.

Think about slow-moving SKUs and fewer warehouses that then get cross-docked through the last mile delivery location and really being strategic and optimized of increasing the ability of our inventory but actually doing it with overall over time, less inventory, less working capital.

Q4 marked another quarter of positive top and bottom line performance at Sysco. The quarter capped off strong financial performance in fiscal 2022 as we grew annual sales by 33.8% to over $68 billion.For",2015,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Q4 marked another quarter of positive top and bottom line performance at Sysco. The quarter capped off strong financial performance in fiscal 2022 as we grew annual sales by 33.8% to over $68 billion.
For the year, Sysco grew our business more than 1.3x the industry. This result exceeded our goal for the year and the second half of the year's performance was even stronger than the first. 
The outperformance in the U.S. helped drive over $17 billion of total company sales growth for the year. Consistent with our focus on profitable growth, we grew adjusted EPS by 133.8%. Our team generated these results while advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy, improving our balance sheet and delivering compelling shareholder returns.
I will highlight 2 topics during our call today. First, I will share progress we have made as a company over the past year that displays Sysco's unique position of strength in the market.
Second, I'll convey why we are confident in our trajectory for profitable growth in fiscal '23. Before I get started, let me acknowledge that we are closely monitoring macroeconomic pressures that are impacting consumer confidence across the globe such as spikes in gas prices, food inflation and rising interest rates. Despite these external factors, Sysco is prepared to deliver significant market share gains and profitable growth this coming year.
So let's get started with our unique position of strength and a bit more about who we are, displayed on Slides 5 and 6. I am often asked to describe Sysco. Simply put, Sysco is 50% a food supply chain company and 50% at food sales and marketing company. To be successful as a leader at Sysco and to be successful in this business, you need to be equally capable of leading in both arenas, supply chain and sales. Over the past 2.5 years, we have developed a strategy called our Recipe for Growth that is advancing our capabilities in supply chain and sales. We are transforming Sysco by building new capabilities that will further enable our position as a global leader in food distribution.
Let me first highlight the 50% of Sysco that is our food supply chain by summarizing some of our biggest accomplishments of the past year. Throughout the year, we have led the industry from an OTIF perspective. For those not in logistics, that stands for on-time and in-full. This past year was the most challenging OTIF year on record in our industry.
During those challenging conditions, Sysco was able to be better in stock and better able to shift on time versus those that we compete against. As a result, we won substantial new business and provided stronger-than-industry average service levels to our existing customers. We're deeply committed to returning to and exceeding our historical OTIF levels over the coming quarters and years.
We fully converted our supply chain to a full 6-day service week. Simultaneously, we converted the majority of our U.S. frontline associates to a 4-day work schedule, enabling improved work-life balance for our associates. The 6-day work model for our large network of DCs will enable Sysco to grow profitably for years to come by better leveraging our physical assets.
Their transition to the 6-day model was a big lift. And I want to thank our associates and our customers for their partnership and the transition. The 6-day model will ensure industry-leading OTIF results for years to come.
We launched our Sysco Driver Academy, opening our first training location and began building out a nationwide infrastructure that will be complete by the end of this calendar year. The driver academy is helping Sysco address the shortage of skilled drivers and our Academy will increase the number of skilled drivers at Sysco and will deliver increased lifetime earnings potential for the associates selected to participate. We have piloted and are scaling new picking methods at our warehouses that will improve the experience of our delivery drivers.
In addition, we're providing our drivers with advanced material handling equipment that reduces the physicality of their day. These actions will improve the experience of our drivers, enabling improved productivity, improved retention and increased customer service.
Lastly, we've built out a distributed order management system, or DOMS for short, that will enable omnichannel fulfillment at Sysco in fiscal '23. We have decoupled the front end of our network sales from the back end of our network operations through this project. No longer will a customer need to order just from their local sites inventory assortment. We are opening up our vast network of inventory to our customers through the DOMS implementation, while also improving the productivity of our working capital through this industry-leading project. We will be launching our first [indiscernible] soon with plans to expand and scale in '23 and beyond.
Our supply chain mission at Sysco is clear, enable profitable growth by delivering the industry's leading assortment of products delivered on-time and in-full at a delivery frequency that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations. Our supply chain greatly enhanced our capabilities to deliver on that mission in fiscal '22.
Now I would like to highlight the progress that we have made in the other 50% of our company's key work focus, food sales and marketing. We live our Foodie credentials every day with over 7,500 sales consultants in hundreds of culinary partners and product specialists across the globe. I dare say there are a few, if any, that know more about food and food trends than our culinary teams. Our sales associates have the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry, with NPS overall satisfaction rates, a full point higher than our competitors. Please see Chart 7.
Our sales consultants are experts in everything from menus with our customers, identifying and introducing new food trends and importantly, partnering with our customers to help save them money. From a product perspective, we've the broadest assortment of food in the industry, and we have expanded that assortment strength with the recent acquisitions of Greco, Paragon Foods and The Coastal Companies. Our product assortment is second to none, and we offer fair and appropriate prices to our customers.
Like I summarize with our supply chain, I would like to highlight some of the progress that we have made over the past year with regards to food sales and marketing. We implemented an intelligent data-driven pricing system to improve our ability to be what we call right on price at the customer item level. We built and scaled a customer personalization engine, which provides our customers with unique offers that meet their specific needs. We upgraded and improved our digital shopping platform. We improved search navigation, We made it even easier to reorder Common Essentials, and we introduced product recommendation engines that increase customer basket size. We improved what we call team-based selling, better leveraging our sales teams across broadline and our collection of specialty businesses.
Lastly, we can measure success over the past year in several ways. I'd highlight, too. Firstly, during the great resignation, our sales consultant retention in fiscal 2022 exceeded our historical average. Our SCs loved the new tools that we have built, and they have deeply embraced our Recipe for Growth.
And secondly, we successfully grew more than 1.3x the industry in 2022. This result exceeded our goal for the year and the second half of the year performance was even stronger than the first. Our customers are rewarding us with more of their business because of the relationships they have with our sales teams and because of the new tools and services that we have deployed in food sales and marketing.
Defining excellence in food sales and distribution, that is Sysco. We are confident that we have the size, scale and expertise to be the leader in these 2 arenas, bringing innovation to our customers every day.
Topic 2 for today, I'd like to discuss the current economic climate and our view for the upcoming year. We're closely monitoring macroeconomic pressures and data points related to food inflation, gas prices and consumer confidence. There is no doubt that end consumers have a lot on their minds these days. We think it's important to remember the resilience of our industry and how we have adapted over the past few years. We submit respectively that food away from home has proven to be resilient. And quite frankly, essential. Over the last 2.5 years, our industry has dealt with challenge after challenge with 3 major ways of COVID, double-digit inflation and innovation in Ukraine impacting the food supply.
Despite these challenges, we have delivered profitable growth. We have learned to operate in an abnormal environment and we are prepared to navigate another dynamic year ahead. While we anticipate that recent macroeconomic headwinds make REIT less robust industry-wide growth rate in '23 than we had originally planned, we are prepared to generate sales growth of at least 10% in 2023. Aaron will address guidance in more detail in a moment.  
There are several reasons why, we believe, we will deliver on our financial targets. First, as the industry leader, we're fully diversified, covering every corner of the food away from home market. We serve restaurants up and down the price point spectrum and across all restaurant types. We deliver food to health care and education facilities that are less prone to recession. We deliver to travel and recreation facilities into any office buildings. These last 2 sectors continue to rebound and will provide a source of growth in the coming years.
Additionally, we still have big opportunities to grow in the restaurant space. Even if traffic is more muted than originally forecasted by Technomic, remember that we serve roughly 50% of the total restaurant door locations, and we have roughly 30% share of wallet with existing customers. Sysco can still grow our business even if the market growth is less compelling. And given the strict shutdowns internationally in 2022, we have strong growth potential year-over-year from our International division. Simply put, we intend to win share profitably in fiscal '23.
Second, regarding inflation, we continue to work with our customers to pass through the majority of cost inflation. Interestingly, the relative price of eating out has been less impacted by inflation than the cost of food at the grocery store as seen on Slides 8 to 9. When coupled with people's desire to eat out, we believe that restaurants will once again prove resilient.
Third, our investments include sales and marketing capabilities through our Recipe for Growth strategy will deliver increased value in the coming years. The topics I highlighted on this call today, coupled with new programs like Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks will drive increased market share growth. Once again, we plan to grow faster than the overall industry, with a target in fiscal '23 of growing 1.35x the industry. This trend will put us on the trajectory needed to deliver our end of fiscal year '24 target of growing 1.5x the industry. We are increasingly confident in our longer-term guidance provided in May of 2021 at our Investor Day.
In addition to ensuring that we drive compelling market share growth, Aaron, our entire leadership team and I will be focused on productivity improvement and structural cost out. We're proud of the progress that we have made in reducing structural costs over the past year and we will be relentlessly focused on improving operations efficiency in fiscal '23.
Lastly, we are excited to welcome Paulo Peereboom as the newly appointed leader of our international operations. Paulo has an extensive track record of driving transformation and building high-performing customer-focused teams across multiple geographies. This includes over 30 years of experience across 7 countries, all in the food business. Our international team had a strong year of improvement in '22, and we are increasingly confident in our future. Paulo will take some momentum we are building to the next level.
I'd now like to turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details. Aaron, over to you."
189096,1792319554,2624176,"Sysco Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2022",2022-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. The Sysco team delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full financial year, giving us many reasons to be upbeat about our business.Let's talk about some of the highlights. We achieved an all-",1681,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. The Sysco team delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full financial year, giving us many reasons to be upbeat about our business.
Let's talk about some of the highlights. We achieved an all-time record for quarterly and annual sales of Sysco landing at $19 billion for the quarter and almost $69 million for the year.
For the fourth quarter, our enterprise sales grew 17.5% with U.S. Foodservice growing at 16.4% and international growing at 30%. At the enterprise level, adjusting out the extra week in Q4 of fiscal year '21, our sales growth was even higher at 26.5%.
With respect to volume, U.S. Broadline volume increased 5.4% on a 13- to 13-week comparison basis. We baked $3.5 billion in adjusted gross profit for the quarter and $12.4 billion for the year, up almost 20% versus last year for the fourth quarter and up 32.5% for the year.
Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.4% for the fourth quarter with the rate rising from last quarter and up 33 basis points to Q4 fiscal '21, even with the impact of incremental inflation. GP dollars per case grew in all 4 segments versus prior year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of such growth. We continue to pass along product inflation, which was around 15% in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, while passing along part of our operating cost inflation.
Our Snap-back operating costs dropped to $29 million in Q4. Productivity gaps, however, were a continuing factor as, on the one hand, we returned to employment levels higher than fiscal '19, but on the other, we invested to cover over time to address growing demand and lower productivity of the new staff. We invested $67 million of operating expenses for the Recipe for Growth in the quarter, with supply chain investments ramping up significantly.
Overall adjusted operating expenses were $2.6 billion for the quarter or 13.8% of our sales. Operating leverage improved by 55 basis points for the quarter and 117 basis points for the year. Adjusted operating income increased by 45% versus last year to $877 million in the quarter, also exceeding our pre-COVID Q4 2019 results, an excellent sign of progress.
Operating income for the year was $2.6 billion. We are particularly pleased with the progress of our U.S. Foodservice segment which delivered record operating income for the quarter and with the continued sequential progress of our international operations, which once again made progress in the direction of pre-COVID profitability.
At the enterprise level, we continue to have the highest EBITDA margin in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA surpassed $1 billion for the first time ever in a quarter at Sysco and we delivered $3.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year, notwithstanding COVID, Omicron, inflation, the invasion of Ukraine and high fuel prices. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.15, which is an all-time high for the fourth quarter or any quarter for that matter at Sysco.
In regards to the balance sheet, we paid down $450 million of debt as it came due in Q4. We ended the year at 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and during the fiscal year, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through 500 million of share repurchase completed in the fourth quarter and $959 million of dividends. Since year-end, we have also repurchased additional shares. More on that to come.
Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion, and free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the year. With our focus on driving rising sales and profitability comes rising inventory and a higher balance of healthy accounts receivable, both the use of cash for the year. Our team continues to manage our receivables balance as well and we also benefited from higher accounts payable. We ended the quarter with approximately $867 million in cash on hand.  
So let's turn to look forward. In recent months and indeed at the start of my comments today, I observed that Kevin and I are upbeat about our business. And that view carries through to future quarters for Sysco. The upbeat guidance we are providing is reflective of our ongoing investments and our extensive efforts to reposition Sysco as a growth company.
As Kevin mentioned earlier, we are well positioned and prepared to operate through another dynamic year and are assessing whether and to what degree a recession will impact the economy and our business. It's worth repeating that we benefit from the scale at which we're operating, our diversification as the industry leader across customer types, product categories and geographies, the discipline enabled by our pricing tool, our strong balance sheet and demonstrated focus on cost takeout. We have carefully examined Sysco's results during the '08-'09 recession, and importantly, we benefit from the fact that our company has just operated through and learned from the business interruption of COVID. Here's the real punch line. ""we are better positioned today to address macro events than we have ever been before.""
So with all of that said, during fiscal '23, from a growth algorithm perspective, we expect to grow at least 1.35x the market regardless of the economic environment. While it is difficult to be precise from the current macro environment, based on initial estimates of market growth and inflation, we expect top line growth of at least 10% over fiscal year 2022, which will move Sysco above the $75 billion annual sales mark for the first time. Bolt-on acquisitions will also contribute to our growth. 
We are expecting mid-single-digit inflation for the full year on an enterprise basis across all categories, moderating from high single digits in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis to low single digits in Q4. We are not planning for a deflationary environment, though some categories may be individually inflationary. 
We do expect elevated operating expenses during the year as we continue to deal with the hiring environment that is still recovering associate tenure driven productivity issues that we expect to improve over the course of this year and continued planned investments for our transformation, all these mitigated in part by cost-out efforts.
Speaking of cost out, we delivered significant cost out in fiscal 2022, helping offset incremental operating expenses this year. We have now exceeded our cumulative cost-out target of $750 million. And we're going back for more, the achievement of which is already included in our EPS growth expectations.
All in, we are growing our adjusted EPS with both volume growth and profit improvements contributing to our substantial increases in earnings per share. We are guiding adjusted EPS for fiscal year '23 of $4.09 to $4.39. The midpoint of this range equals a 30% increase in adjusted EPS over fiscal year 2022. It also represents a 20% increase in our adjusted EPS from our previous high point, fiscal '19. 
Please take note of the fact that even the low end of our adjusted EPS range for fiscal year '23 reflects the highest adjusted EPS achieved at Sysco ever in a year.
While I do not intend to debate the definition of recession with economist, the low end of our range reflects a modest recession impacting our year. And the midpoint reflects the current operating environment and the top end reflects a strong economic recovery.
The macro environment, our productivity improvement efforts and the timing of our Recipe for Growth investments will impact the cadence of our earnings growth with stronger profit growth expected in the second half. For Q1, we expect adjusted EPS to be at or near our prior first quarter high point from back in 2020. The stronger earnings growth in the second half reflects continued progress with our Recipe for Growth, progress on productivity initiatives, lapping last year's Omicron related slowdown and the fact that Q4 is always our seasonal profit high point.
You may recall that in May 2021, we provided long-term guidance for fiscal year '24 to achieve adjusted EPS 30% higher than fiscal '19. The midpoint of our fiscal year '23 guidance, which is 20% above fiscal '19 reflects that we are well on our way to achieving our previous long-term EPS guidance.
The midpoint of our guidance also translates to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4 billion in the year. We are forecasting continued strong cash generation and an increase from 2022 levels driven by profit increases, offset by investments in working capital as AR grows with our sales, and we continue to our strategy with tactical investments in inventory.
Our capital allocation strategy remains sustained going forward, invest in the business, including through M&A, maintain our strong investment-grade rating and continue our return of capital to shareholders. With EBITDA growing, we expect to make further progress on our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in service of our target of 2.5x to 2.75x. 
Also note that we are positioned well in the current rising interest rate environment as approximately 95% of our debt is fixed. Just last week, Moody's reaffirmed Sysco's strong investment-grade credit rating and stabilized our rating outlook. We are committed to completing up to $500 million of share repurchases in fiscal '23, and indeed have already completed $267 million of that repurchase commitment during Q1 of this year.
We will be assessing the operating environment and the cash needs for further M&A opportunities before committing to an incremental share repurchase activity beyond the $500 million during the year. Our status for the dividend aristocrat is important to us and we already announced the effective $0.08 annual dividend increase for our fiscal year '23.
In summary, we view fiscal '23 as an excellent build upon fiscal '22 as we grow both the top line and the bottom line, while playing the long game and investing for the future at Sysco. All of these efforts are consistent with fulfilling our long-term guidance from Investor Day, which includes exceeding 1.5x market share growth by the end of fiscal year 2024 and adjusted EPS growth of at least 30% over our record 2019 levels.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for remarks."

Sysco already is the industry leader from an EBITDA margin perspective. And as you heard from Aaron, we plan to build on that position of strength in fiscal 2023. Our key takeaways from today's call reflects 3 points. First, we advanced our Recipe for Growth strategy and grew more than 1.3x the market for the year, with the second half even stronger than the first; second, we improved profitability with sequential progress in both gross profit and operating margin rates; and third, recognizing macroeconomic pressures as well as the resiliency of our industry, we're confident in our external guidance for fiscal year 2023. 
This assumes at least 10% sales growth and 30% EPS growth at the midpoint as we continue to grow with new and existing customers. We will also remain disciplined in expense management with a strong plan to drive increased operating leverage.
Turning to the next slide. We are generating substantial top line momentum and accelerating market charities. Our recipe for growth transformation is winning in the marketplace and creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term. We are further building upon and enhancing our competitive scale advantages. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment, while also rewarding our long-term shareholders with disciplined dividend growth and share repurchases.
Lastly, we are committed to our long-term financial outlook, which includes significant sales and EPS growth and returning value to our shareholders along the way. There are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I'm both excited and proud to be a part of the journey.

I'll just start with math to answer to your question, and I'll talk a little bit about what we're seeing from a volume perspective. So flattish is the answer from a Q4 same number of weeks year-over-year. And just keep in mind, as you look at this past year, when we were comping against recovery, which Q4, we were comping against a pretty strong recovery in '21. So flattish volumes on 13 to 13 against prior year, pretty strong recovery. 
What we're seeing right now from a volume perspective is when you couple that with inflation that was higher than what we had modeled and expected, really strong sales results for the quarter. And obviously, that strong sales, coupled with the flattish volume for local flowed through to a profit number that was robust for the quarter, exceeded our guide. As Aaron mentioned, highest quarter ever for Sysco. 
As we think about this coming year, I'd point you to Slide 10 that was in our prepared remarks, that chart does include all business. It's not just local, but it speaks for itself, the performance of Sysco over time that we're pulling away from the market. I stated on the call this morning that we grew at 1.3 times the industry for the year. And I also was pretty clear that we grew in the second half even faster than the first.
So and the chart shows that, if you look at the lines in the separation that's occurring. So we're building momentum, that moment, answer your question just on trends is carrying through at the national level and also at the local level. We're winning more new national business at profit rates that meet or exceed our expectations, and we're having a lot of success at the local level.as well. 
My comments in regards to macroeconomics do apply to all customer types, including the mom-and-pop local independent. We view cost of fuel as one of the primary drivers of consumer sentiment and that high cost of fuel that was impacting consumers began in the Q4 and is included in the business trends that we're producing, and it was thoughtful in the guide that we provided today.
Last but not least, Aaron's comments of at least 10% sales growth this year and 30% EPS growth, and we're confident in our ability to deliver against those mile-markers."

Point two, Sysco brand improvement in the quarter because of the value that Sysco brand provides to our customers. We're helping to save them money at high quality rates and our sales force did a really good job in the most recent quarter of introducing Sysco brand to our customers.
Last point, only 3, the intelligent data-driven pricing system that we are leveraging is enabling us to be very sophisticated and thoughtful on how we're passing through that inflation. So we are confident that we can pass through inflation to our customers. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and our sales team then worked with those exact same customers to help them be successful. Think about portion size. Think about ingredients on the menu. Think about the menu itself and how it can adjust, modify change to help that end restaurant be successful and for them to be profitable during this period of high inflation.
So we are confident in our ability to continue to pass through inflation and we are confident in the guide that we provided today.

I'm going to start just talking about overall supply chain productivity, and then I'll toss to Aaron, who can comment on overall expense leverage and anything he'd like to share in that regard.
Aaron called out in our prepared remarks where we're winning as a company. There are elements where we're doing really well. We're winning from a top line perspective. We're gaining share, both national and local. We're doing an excellent job at GP management passing through inflation, using strategic sourcing to purchase product at a competitive rate and having that impact positively our margin rates, and we had a disappointment from an expense perspective versus where we expected to be. I want to be clear on what the driver of that is and it's just in general, our overall productivity within our supply chain being behind where we expected it to be. And I want to unpack that a little bit, make some comments about it and then toss to Aaron.
 I want to be clear, we are properly staffed within our supply chain at this point in time, and that is a dramatic improvement year-over-year. This time last year, with the recovery of the business was occurring and the great resignation was happening, we were understaffed as well as the industry and it created a lot of pain within our supply chain. We are properly staffed at this time. Our hiring has improved, applicant flow has improved and the training that we are providing to our new associates has simply never been better. In fact, we're heading to one of our sites this afternoon to go spend time with our training academy and celebrate the success that, that team is having on providing literally the industry's best training program to our associates.
So we are properly staffed, we are investing in training at a level that we have not before. We have a challenge in overall math, which is the simple following point. Roughly half of our supply chain associates have been with the company for under a year. And it's that point, that point alone, that results in a productivity rate that is below, therefore, our historical average. These are challenging jobs. They're skilled labor positions, and it takes time for someone to move up the productivity curve. 
The reason for my calling out that data point, that roughly half of our associates were in job under a year, is that is absolutely an addressable topic by Sysco's leadership, myself, our team and the driver and selector academies that I referenced on today's call. We will improve associate retention in the process of improving that retention and improving our training efforts, we will move people up the productivity curve. And in the process of moving up there the productivity curve, it will lower our logistics cost as a percent of sales and our logistics cost to serve. It's taking a little bit longer than we would have liked, but we will improve retention. We will improve productivity, and that has been included in the guidance that we provided today for fiscal '23. 
Aaron, I'll toss to you for additional comments."

Let me touch a couple of the elements as apparent on the face of Kevin's remarks, we're going to increase volume over the course of fiscal '23. And of course, with increased incomes, increased cost of service. We would all expect that. 
During the quarter, we did also have to address increased costs of things like fuel, recruiting, et cetera, cost to hire, and those are moderating, right? And we have steps in place, hedging or other programs to address those as well. But as we look forward, we expect those to improve in fiscal '23. 
Kevin has already touched on the impact of productivity. As we called out in our guidance, we expect that to improve over the course of the year. Our transformation expenses were higher in Q4. And indeed, we will continue to invest heavily in the year as we play the long game against our transformation expense, but those are costs that over time will moderate.
And then snap back, they came down in Q4, and we expect them to continue to come down over the course of the year. Now the thing we haven't talked about so far yet is cost out, right? We were pleased that we had surpassed our original cost-out objective of $750 million during the year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going back for more, and there is more opportunity.
One of the benefits of operating of a company of the size of Sysco is where we find a good idea and we deploy it, we can recognize what works and that we can deploy to other parts of our enterprise. And so we've actually recently revised our structure of cost leadership to go after more and are confident that we can continue to help to offset some of the costs elsewhere in the network, at least through cost out as we carry forward. The benefits, they're all baked into the guidance that we've provided for fiscal year '23. Thank you."

The step-up is just go back to our original guide from May of '21, our Investor Day was to grow 1.2x in the year that just ended into grout 1.5x in fiscal 2024. And essentially, fiscal '23 was going to be a midpoint between those 2 things as we ramped up our Recipe for Growth.
What happened in fiscal 2022, the year that just ended, is we had 2 primary contributions to our success. One was our Recipe for Growth, which I'm going to come back to in a second. The second was our ability to ship on-time and in-full, as I mentioned on today's call, was greater than the industry at large. And we had national customers and local customers coming to Sysco and essentially asking us to take on their business, and we were able to take on that business at above historical profit rates because of the economic macro conditions as they were.
So that relative supply chain strength was a large contributor to our success and the Recipe for Growth was a large contributor to success. And what we guided today is a 1.35x market growth. As Aaron said, regardless of how the market performs, we're going to perform better than that market in total. What will happen in '23 is the relative supply chain strength contribution will be smaller because we expect for the overall marketplace to be more stable in this coming year and the relative impact of the Recipe for Growth will be greater in '23. 
And the reason it steps up to 1.5x in fiscal '20 again, that Recipe for Growth contribution gets bigger and stronger each year. Why is that? I'll just point to a couple of examples. We're an agile development health from a tech perspective, and we're rolling out new functionality to our website literally every 2 weeks. And those contributions of increasing the efficiency of placing an order, add value. The work we're doing with data and analytics to provide suggested orders to our customers get smarter and better over time, it adds value.
I mentioned in my prepared remarks today, 2 of our newer efforts, which is Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks, there's still an implementation mode at the current time. Here's the good news. Both programs are exceeding our internal expectations for the neighborhoods and customers that have been enrolled, and we will roll those programs out nationwide over the coming quarters and years. And so that's a relative contribution. 
So what we see is a sequential increase in the effective power and weight of those programs, and it's why we reiterated today our overall macro confidence in our ability to grow 1.5x in the market in fiscal '24. And we think given everything that's going on in the overall environment, the 1.35x guide that we provided today is prudent.

We will then take more share. And we will do so profitably. I want to be crystal clear, I've said before, many times, I'll say again, we will not use price as a primary lever to try to win business. We think that's irrational. And we want to win through assortment, our service, our capabilities, our programs, et cetera, et cetera.
If you pick just one thing to focus on to improve profitability, it would be increased penetration with existing customers. That's the direct answer to your question. If we could focus on one thing and one thing only, it's increased penetration with existing customers. we are really pleased with what we're seeing, John, with Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks on penetration by providing customers in Sysco Your Way with late in the evening, caught off increased delivery frequency, no order minimums in a compelling service coverage model, meaning dedicated sales reps, dedicated driver, partner, et cetera, et cetera. The reward we are experiencing in those neighborhoods is increased penetration with existing customers.
And Sysco Perks is a loyalty program tied to our most important customers. Essentially, it's a VIP club, you get invited into. The entire purpose of that club is to increase penetration, increase share of wallet with existing customers.
So we're bullish on those 2 strategic arrows in our quiver. But we believe that we can win new business as well. Our sales reps are motivated financially to win new customers. We've got the largest and most qualified sales force in the industry, and they're doing a very good job of new customer prospecting, and we continue to win net new customers at accelerated rates.

So we call it team-based selling and our ability to deliver that high-end fine protein center of plate along with Broadline value is second to none in the industry. And we're doing an even better job than ever before and have been able to bring that specialty price point, that specialty product, along with 50 pounds bags of rice and flour, et cetera, et cetera, that Broadline is known for. So we're doing that very well.
John, I'd say in the current economic environment and the reality of COVID the biggest challenge, the biggest barrier has been product availability, believe it or not. The ability to be in stock at all times with key volume items that our customers need, and there have been challenges with long-term outs on product that if you can't deliver, guess what, their customer is going to go somewhere else to get that product. And then if they do go somewhere else, do they get sticky with that source of purchasing on that product and then you need to win it back over time.
So that's not a problem that's unique to Sysco. Fill rate from suppliers, inbound distributors has been difficult over the last 18 months because of staffing issues and challenges in the supplier base. And then that has shown up with a customer telling us, ""Hey, listen, I need 2 or 3 distributors because if you can't fill my order, I need to be able to have my menu in stock."" We're making meaningful progress on that topic at Sysco. We are leading the industry from an OTIF perspective, as I mentioned. 
So we don't view that as a point of weakness. We view it as a point of strength, but I'm meaningfully answering your question that, that has been for our industry, the biggest challenge, product availability.
Topic 2, which is the more historical answer to your question is its price. A competitor comes in on one item and undercuts you on price with that 1 item and then the customer says, ""Well, hey, wait a minute, I can get this product 10% cheaper somewhere else."" We don't price -- a business just 1 item. It's a book of business. And so there's this that constant, I call it [ ankle biters ], a competitor coming in, trying to undercut you on price on a single item trying to get in the door. And that's not a new topic. People coming in and trying to undercut on a single item.
But again, our pricing tool gives us the sophistication that we need to make sure that our sales reps are confident in the prices that they're representing in the marketplace are fair and appropriate, and I think we're better equipped to be able to manage that in the future than ever before. 
John, back to you if you have a follow-up."

We appreciate it. We're bullish on our international business. Strong quarter for the quarter that disclosed, wrapped up a strong year versus where we expected that business to be and we're building momentum. 
As we think about this upcoming year, Omicron impacted the United States, and we had some softening in the business in Q2 and Q3. Well, that softening was even greater internationally. Europe was in complete lockdown. The country of France, in particular, like shut all restaurants down again during Omicron. I mean it's really different how Europe handled COVID. 
And in Canada, while the lockdowns weren't as robust as Europe, consumer psyche and consumer risk tolerance was much lower than the U.S. and just overall food away-from-home volumes were down.
So we're bullish about the year ahead. Paulo joining our company, as I announced today on the call, is going to be just a great addition to our team, and we have confidence that this coming year will be a sequential increase in both the top line and the bottom line contribution from international.
Specific to your question about initiatives, I love that question. It's exactly what we are doing. We are taking the Recipe for Growth, which is meaningfully working in the U.S., and we are bringing the best practices from now these programs to our international domain, starting with Canada. 
So we're deploying a new modern website this year in Canada. We are deploying a new pricing tool in Canada this year, and we will be bringing programs like Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks to Canada as well.
The same goes to Ireland and GB and France to round out our larger international sectors. We are bringing to each of those countries the main elements of our strength portfolio, including advancing Sysco brand as a represented product offering in each of those countries. 
So we're thoughtful about it. We are pragmatic about it. We can't do everything overnight, but we are meaningfully rigorously prioritizing, which initiatives are taken to which country when. And obviously, that's been built into our guidance for this coming year.
Aaron, I'll toss to you for any additional comments."

And so what we came out with from a guidance perspective with our $0.30 range was a balanced view, we believe, of if things continue as they are down the midpoint relative to our ability to deliver the profitability. Of course, if there is a modest impact from a recession perspective, again, looking at it across the portfolio as we do the math, you see the lower end of our guide. And indeed, if that doesn't materialize, some are saying it won't, not going to comment on that. We wanted to also reflect the fact that there is some further upside in the opportunity as well.

I'll start just kind of what's happening with SYGMA and then I'll toss to Aaron to answer your question about the numbers in whatever manner he would like. 
So just a reminder for those that are new covering our company -- just a little bit about our SYGMA business. It's very different. It's very unique in relation to everything else we do. It is a cost per case business on a multiyear contract basis.
So let's just be honest and clear. It was a very difficult year for SYGMA as fuel costs rose significantly, as labor costs because of retention challenges and productivity challenges tied to that rose significantly. SYGMA got pinched and pinched hard on rising expenses, essentially the inability to pass through rising costs because of the way that business is run on a fee per case basis, challenging year.
Last point is it's a stretch miles business, where the route distances are substantially longer than what I call the pedal runs or Broadline where we started in D.C., do a little run come back home. SYGMA is long-distance driving in what we call stretch miles. 
So the rising cost of fuel was a real particular pain point. If I look at this upcoming year, I'll just give color commentary on where we have confidence the improvement will come from, and then I'll toss to Aaron. 
The higher turnover and the negative impact of that higher turnover had on our productivity and overtime rates that we were incurring because of the open jobs was a major pain point, and that is meaningfully addressable through the work that we're doing with hiring stability, which is meaningfully improving. Training effectiveness, which I've already spoken to on this call, and our ability to reduce over time, reduce the use of third-party labor and just frankly, run the model more efficiently.
So we can get back to more historical standards of cost to serve and improve the profitability of SYGMA, and that is our intention this year.
Aaron, I'll toss to you for additional comment."

What we are commenting is that within each of our sectors, from white table cost all the way down to QSR, we see winners and losers within each of those sectors. And I think you see that in the coverage that you do across that sector. There are winners and there are losers within each segment. We are not seeing meaningful shift from the top end of the spectrum to QSR are within the sectors. What we are seeing, point number two, for some additional color is that customers within each of the sectors wanting to partner with Sysco to provide value to their customers to help offset the cost of inflation.
So because of that would be Sysco brand penetration is increasing, which is a good thing for us. and we will be sticky on that. I want to be clear about that. When we make progress in Sysco brand, when customers give it a try and we do product quality cuttings, they love the product quality. They obviously enjoy the savings from a cost perspective and then we can be very sticky in that regard.
So that's a key point. And then I think you've heard from some of the manufacturers, some shift from the beef category into poultry that was publicly communicated yesterday. And I would say, yes, beef has been highly inflationary. It was the most inflationary category over the last couple of years and customers of ours are looking at portion size. They're looking at alternative protein options. And that's what our sales results -- excuse me, sales consultants do. They help our customers with that. 
The good news on the protein side specific to beef, beef prices have normalized, and I know you're aware of that as well. So the overall rate of inflation in beef has stabilized meaningfully and we do expect for inflation in aggregate to moderate this coming year as Aaron has called out in our guidance."

And by doing that, we can ensure that we decrease miles driven, meaning serve the customer from the closest possible warehouse. That sounds basic and obvious, but it is a meaningful unlock technologically, but it also is going to help us with our strategic stocking of product, what product is where. 
Think about slow-moving SKUs and fewer warehouses that then get cross-docked through the last mile delivery location and really being strategic and optimized of increasing the ability of our inventory but actually doing it with overall over time, less inventory, less working capital.

Our Q1 results reflected continued positive momentum in our business to start the fiscal year. Our share gains continued this quarter as we posted sales growth of more than 1.4x the industry. We",1538,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Our Q1 results reflected continued positive momentum in our business to start the fiscal year. Our share gains continued this quarter as we posted sales growth of more than 1.4x the industry. We delivered double-digit growth in the top line and bottom line of our business. 
Beginning with the top line. We delivered sales growth of 16.2%, driven by a combination of effectively managing inflation and delivering case volume growth. Our U.S. Foodservice volumes and local case volumes continued to grow this quarter. 
Turning to the bottom line, double-digit growth across operating income and net income resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, which was in line with our expectations. The strong start to the year gives us confidence in reaffirming our full year guidance. 
I will highlight 2 topics during our call today. First, I will put into context Sysco's sales and volume growth for the quarter by highlighting some of the drivers of our strength. Second, I will detail our progress in our supply chain and our efforts to improve service levels and operations cost efficiency. 
So let's get started with our unique position of strength in a growing industry displayed on Slide 7. Beginning with the Foodservice industry, the total addressable market is approximately $350 billion. Sysco grew 17% and the rest of the market grew 12% in the quarter, a strong start to the fiscal year. 
Restaurants continued to be resilient and our travel hospitality, plus our business and industry segments of our business posted year-on-year improvements. We see continued strength coming as tailwinds in the noncommercial sector should continue. We are closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions for signs of a business slowdown. At this time, we are not seeing recession concerns negatively impacting our business outcomes. 
With that said, we are prepared to take additional cost reduction actions if or when the recession does begin to impact our P&L. In the backdrop of what has been a strengthening overall market, Sysco continues to outperform. Our sales teams continue to win market share, with Q1 being 1 of our strongest quarters of net new customer wins. Our national sales team posted an outstanding quarter, winning substantial new business in the education, health care and restaurant sectors. These wins are on top of the more than $2 billion of net new national sales wins delivered over the past 2 years. 
It is important to note that we are winning this business at strong profit profiles versus historical averages and these are multiyear contracts. 
In addition to our success with national sales, our Recipe for Growth is delivering results persist at the local level. Local case volume for the quarter grew 5.4% versus Q1 of 2022, successfully lapping a 26.7% increase from the prior year. Our strong start to the year in national and local sales has us gaining market share overall as we grew more than 1.4x the market for the period. As a result, we are on track to deliver our stated growth objective for the year. 
As seen on Slide 8, our Recipe For Growth includes 5 pillars, focused on building new capabilities that will further enable our leadership position in supply chain and food sales and marketing. As is customary for our quarterly updates, I would like to highlight a couple of our growth drivers. 
Today, I will highlight progress that we are making in the products and solutions pillar with our Sysco Your Way program, and I will also provide an update on select future horizons work. 
Within our Products and Solutions growth pillar, we meaningfully advanced our Sysco Your Way program over the past quarter. As a reminder, Sysco Your Way is our service and delivery model for what we call restaurant dense neighborhoods. Think a large number of restaurants and a few block radius. We provide these neighborhoods with a next level of service from Sysco. Examples of that service include a late in the evening order cut off, daily delivery service, dedicated sales and delivery partner representation and additional white glove culinary and marketing services. 
The constructs of the Sysco Your Way program were developed in partnership with our customers. And as a result, customers are responding favorably. 
The top and bottom line results from the program are exceeding our expectations. We are winning substantial new customers within these neighborhoods and existing customers are buying more product on a weekly basis. Over the past quarter, we ramped up our implementation efforts, and we will continue to roll out the program to applicable neighborhoods in the coming quarters. We are also bringing the program to international cities with recent implementations in Toronto and Dublin. 
The scale of Sysco Your Way's impact on our overall results will grow each quarter as we add net new neighborhoods. 
From our future horizons growth pillar, we are pleased to announce that we have closed on 2 independent Italian distributor acquisitions over the past quarter. These acquisitions will give us access to premium Italian products in areas that were previously geographic white spaces for Sysco. We have plans to meaningfully scale these businesses by bringing the Greco go-to-market Italian selling strategy to these geographies. We  are very pleased with the status of our work to expand Sysco's Italian specialty platform nationally. 
In addition to these 2 examples highlighted today, we are advancing our Recipe For Growth within our International segment as well. Canada, our largest international business is also making good progress with these initiatives. This year in Canada, we will be upgrading our digital platforms, implementing a modern pricing tool, enhancing our team-based selling capabilities and launching Sysco Your Way. Canada is already a large and profitable market for Sysco that generated over $5 billion of sales last year, while posting #1 market share at 17%. The  the Recipe for Growth strategy will enable our Canadian business to further enhance our competitive advantages and better serve our customers. I'm very excited for the progress that we will be making in Canada to deliver profitable sales growth. 
These are just a few examples of the good work that is happening, and I look forward to keeping you posted on our domestic and international progress across the 5 pillars in future quarterly calls. 
Topic 2 for today. I'd like to discuss the state of our supply chain improvement and highlight the status of some important work. Our global supply chain work continues to progress. We are simultaneously building on our long-term strategic initiatives like omnichannel while improving productivity levels and cost performance within our supply chain. Our strategic initiatives continue to move forward with 6-day deliveries, improving the driver experience, implementing best-in-class associate training and omnichannel fulfillment, all advancing forward in the quarter, and we can see the early signs of progress that these initiatives are delivering. 
As they progress, they will enable profitable sales growth and improve our supply chain cost efficiency. Our supply chain is a strategic differentiator and the strategic work we are doing will widen that competitive moat in the coming quarters and years. Simply put,  no 1 is doing more than Sysco to improve service levels to customers and to improve cost efficiencies within the Foodservice supply chain. 
In addition to advancing our strategic initiatives,  our teams have remained relentlessly focused on improving productivity in the near term. We made progress over the past quarter in improving associate retention. Retention improvement will enable us to improve associate productivity, and therefore, lower our operating costs in future quarters. It is important to understand that Sysco's staffing levels remain healthy across our sites. We are staffed properly to support our current business and also to enable future profitable growth. Given our overall staffing health, we are meaningfully focused on associate retention and best-in-class training of our newer associates to improve productivity levels. 
We are also teaching our supervisors how to leverage our engineered labor standards to deliver performance-based coaching. As our staffing levels have improved in recent quarters, we have been able to spend more of our leadership time and communication muscle on training to our work methods and standards. And this is where the intersection between our future strategy and our current improvement efforts intersect. A driver academy is graduating cohorts of trainees that are now hitting the streets. These drivers are already showing strong service, safety and productivity standards. 
As importantly, we are tracking retention by training class, and we can see meaningfully higher retention rates of associates trained by Sysco versus hired from the external market. Over time, the percentage of associates trained from within Sysco will grow, and this ratio growth will improve retention and productivity. 
Cost of turnover is high in this industry, and improving associate retention is imperative. I'm confident that our training academies will give Sysco a meaningful advantage in the industry. We believe the advancements we are making in our physical capabilities and the investments we are making in improved training will provide improved service levels to our customers and strengthen Sysco's ability to profitably win market share in the coming quarters and years. 
I'll now turn it over to Neil, who will provide an update on our sustainability efforts. Neil, over to you."

As we have mentioned, our efforts are anchored around 3 pillars: people, products and planet. We are proud that Sysco was a partner organization at the recent White House Conference on hunger, nutrition and health. At the conference, Sysco's sustainability efforts were recognized for our previously communicated $500 million commitment to global good in our communities by 2025. This includes a donation of 200 million meals to [ 500 ] cash donations to food banks and volunteer hours associated with our colleagues actively participating in the communities we serve. .
Earlier this year, our Board also approved plans to include ESG and DEI metrics in our annual incentive plan and important best practice. Every leader at Sysco is now held accountable to making tangible progress on both DEI and climate change efforts for the company, directly impacting our own compensation. These efforts are consistent with our purpose of connecting the world to share food and care for 1 another. This focus is not only the right thing to do, it will be good for business in the long term. 
As I have explained recently to investors, the majority of Sysco's greenhouse gas emissions are the Scope 3 emissions of our customers. Many of our largest customers have set forth their own climate commitments and Sysco's improvement will help enable those partners to achieve their goals. 
I will now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details."
189096,1803040404,2670261,"Sysco Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2022",2022-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and Neil, and good morning. the Sysco team delivered another quarter of progress with our recipe for growth, resulting in growth across volume, sales and profit giving us many reasons to be upbeat about our business while being appropria",1263,"Thank you, Kevin, and Neil, and good morning. the Sysco team delivered another quarter of progress with our recipe for growth, resulting in growth across volume, sales and profit giving us many reasons to be upbeat about our business while being appropriately cautious given the complex operating environment. 
Turning to a summary of our Q1 reported results. Q1 was the highest sales quarter at Sysco ever. We achieved 16.2% sales growth at Sysco for the quarter, with U.S. Foodservice growing at 17.2% and international growing at 13.4%. Reflecting our focus on serving our local and independent customers through both our Broadline and specialty businesses, we are expanding our disclosure of total and local case volumes to, in aggregate, include our FreshPoint U.S. produce, U.S. Italian and other specialty businesses in the metrics. For clarity, our specialty meats business is not yet in this metric as it measures volume in pounds. 
With respect to volume, total U.S. food service volume increased 7.3% compared to last year. All in, our inclusive local case volumes grew by 5.4% in Q1 2023 over the prior year's comparable period in the U.S. You can see the history of this metric on Slide 18 compared to our year-end 2019 levels. We banked $3.5 billion in adjusted gross profit for the quarter, up 17.3% versus last year. Adjusted gross margin improved 17 basis points to 18.2% for the first quarter. GP per case grew in all 4 segments versus prior year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of such growth. 
Our gross profit and margin improvement reflected our ability to continue to manage product inflation, which was at 9.7% at the total enterprise level, consistent with our guidance as well as incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as we continue to partner with our suppliers. 
U.S. Broadline inflation was 12% in the quarter. Our inflation metric is in dollars, so the enterprise metric was reduced by the local currency declines against the dollar. 
Overall adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 14.2% of our sales, a 30 basis point increase as a percentage of sales over the same quarter in the prior year. Cost this quarter increased in workers' compensation, pension expense, health care and some operational elements like shrink, all of which are being addressed. We have more to do in this area but believe that our supply chain and North American teams has Sysco on the path to improving our operating expense profile. 
Additionally, this quarter included progress against capturing cost out which represents incremental efforts on top of the more than $750 million of cumulative cost out. Recall that last quarter, we outlined expectations for operating costs to be more heavily weighted in the first half based on the need to work through operating cost inflation, operating productivity challenges and our planned investments in the business. 
Consistent with that, this quarter included transformation investments of $63 million and new associate related productivity costs of $41 million and an improvement in snapback costs, which are becoming immaterial. All 4 segments showed increases in profitability year-over-year with SYGMA returning to profitability from the prior year's modest loss in Q1. 
Additionally, adjusted operating income in our International segment grew over the prior year also exceeding pre-COVID 2019 levels. Adjusted operating income for the enterprise increased by 12.4% versus last year to $770 million. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 7.5% to $917 million. We often refer to exceeding fiscal '19 adjusted EPS levels as part of our long-term guidance. It is worth noting that in the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased by 16.9% over prior year  and for the first time since the onset of COVID exceeded adjusted EPS from the same quarter in fiscal '19 by $0.06. 
Applying a macro financial lens, I will point out 2 financial factors that had an impact on profitability this quarter different from recent years. First, the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar in our international operations. Second, an increase in pension expense tied to the rapid rise in interest rates. In total, those 2 externalities had a $0.03 negative impact on GAAP and adjusted EPS. 
On the pension point, to be clear,  our largely frozen pension plan remains fully funded and the above reflects the noncash impact of pension accounting that is a result of extreme movements in the global capital markets. You may have noticed an 8-K about a pension liability transfer exercise in October, subsequent to the end of our first quarter. That transaction decreases Sysco's plan size, risk and overall administrative costs while protecting retirees as they will be in the hands of an A-rated insurance company. This transaction will result in a noncash charge in Q2 of $250 million to $300 million, which we expect to be a certain item. Other than the certain items, we expect the income statement impact of the transaction to be largely immaterial to our year. 
In regards to the balance sheet, our strong investment-grade rated balance sheet remains a competitive advantage for us and we ended the quarter at 3.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We returned $258 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and paid our increased quarterly dividend, returned $517 million in total to shareholders this past quarter. Had we not executed the early share repurchase, our leverage ratio would have been 3x. 
Given the focus on interest rates lately, I want to remind listeners that approximately 95% of Sysco's debt is fixed rate. 
Let's turn to cash. Recall that the first quarter is typically the quarter in which we have the lowest in-quarter cash flow generation. This year, for the first quarter, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $158.6 million, a $48 million improvement over the prior year. However, net CapEx almost doubled in Q1 of fiscal '23 to $145 million as we continue to invest in our Recipe For Growth, particularly with respect to our planned investments in fleet and distribution notes. As a result, free cash flow was $14 million for the quarter. 
Working capital was a use of cash, though we are watching our inventory balances closely as part of our supply chain transformation and are monitoring our accounts receivable closely given the economic environment. We ended the quarter with approximately $438 million in cash on hand. 
Let's return to the look forward. As I said at the start of my remarks, we are upbeat about our business while remaining appropriately cautious given the operating environment. While we have work to do on our expense structure, as Kevin called out, Sysco has not yet seen any broad impact on our business from concerns around the risk of recession impacting consumer behavior. As a result, we are sticking with our full year guidance for fiscal year 2023 for adjusted EPS of $4.09 to $4.39. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we are well positioned and prepared to operate through another dynamic year. We have a plan, and our team is executing against it with the benefit of all the learnings that our company and our industry have worked through in the last couple of years. 
Lastly, I hope you noticed that we are reporting Q1 a week early. As part of our transformation efforts, we have worked to accelerate our financial close process, increasing the speed of [indiscernible] data to faster decisions and looking forward, not back. We plan to report earnings faster than our historical cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks."

We advanced our Recipe for Growth strategy, and we are on target to grow more than 1.35x the market in a growing U.S. market. 
Our financial results this quarter reflected double-digit top and bottom line growth in the backdrop of a large industry that has proven resilient during very challenging macro conditions. Sysco is taking share profitably in a growing industry. 
Lastly, Sysco remains deeply committed to our strong investment-grade credit rating, a strong and stable balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation. We are committed to our long-term financial outlook, and we have reiterated today our full year guidance for fiscal year '23. Just as we have done with COVID  and the related disruptions over the past few years, we are prepared to navigate the potentially choppy macroeconomic waters in coming quarters. 
Our strong financial foundation gives  Sysco the opportunity to continue to advance our strategy during potentially challenging environments. This reality will enable Sysco to win for the longer term as our capabilities improve and our initiatives progress.

But across the pond in Europe meaningfully advancing forward core Sysco capabilities. Sysco brand penetration improvement this year. We're filling in assortment gaps that we have in select countries. We're bringing our team-based selling model that we have optimized in the United States. 
And as I mentioned, programs like Sysco Your Way, we went live in Dublin at the end of Q1, and that program is off to just an absolutely great start in Dublin, and we will be expanding it. So really pleased with our leadership team, strong, capable, talented team led by Paul Oak, who joined our company back in August and upward progress in the forward-facing quarters and years. 
Things like Latin American growth, we have an export business called IFG, which is doing well and we're really optimistic about our future with international. As you mentioned, there are select countries that we are watching extremely closely. Great Britain being the country of biggest concern from a macroeconomic perspective.

What I highlighted in my prepared remarks is that the strength is coming from both national and local business. On the national side, our sales teams are just doing a remarkably good job in the health care space, in the education space, large national restaurant space on working with our customers and customer prospects on kind of selling the values and capabilities of Sysco, the strength of our supply chain, our nationwide capability within the U.S. to support those national customer partners. 
And as I mentioned, profit profiles for those contracts that are above historical standards, and these are multiyear contracts. 
On the local side, the combination of our specialty businesses that Aaron highlighted that are doing extremely well. Team-based selling, which is leveraging those capabilities within our Broadline segment and the Recipe For Growth beginning to take noticeable traction. So that is why we reiterated our guide for the full year in total, and I'll toss to Aaron for comments on the inflation and sales ports of your question, too."

Thanks, Kevin. Good morning. We are really pleased with the market share gains and the sales increases over the course of the quarter, as you can imagine, that, of course, is coming as a result of the combination between the volume growth and the impact of inflation on the portfolio. If you think back to the guidance that we provided in Q4, we -- the sales reference we had was that we would grow at least 10%. And I believe at the time, I commented that at 10% without knowing what was coming from a macroeconomic perspective was tied to the lower end of our range. .
And so indirectly, yes, in answer to your question, we do expect that the 10% is achievable and that's at the lower end of our range. I would observe that inflation we guided in Q4, high single digits in Q1, working its way down to low single digits in Q4. Certainly, as we sit here today, the enterprise number in dollars was high single digits, just under 10%. And so things are playing out in that respect as we had expected."

I think you'd like us to comment on the volume metrics and then comment on the look forward relative to GP dollars per case, if I summarize your question really. Let me start with the first part of your question on the volume, which is to touch on our disclosure today of the fact that our U.S. Foodservice segment, which is the combination as it has been of our Broadline and specialty businesses had total case growth of 7.3% and local case growth of 5.4%. 
From the outside, you might say, well, are you lumping the recent acquisitions in and that's a small part of what in the case volume disclosure. But keep in mind that we have had a multibillion-dollar business what we call specialty, which is part of U.S. Foodservice, the segment we do most of our disclosures against that is not part of the U.S. Broadline. 
And so I want to take you back to the why, and we're now disclosing a total U.S. food service number, it's simply this. The Recipe For Growth is designed to bring all of our assets to bear in support of specific customers. And we have customers that are serviced by Broadline, serviced by specialty. Kevin will probably comment on that more as we carry forward. 
What we're trying to give you the true view of what's going on with our total case growth and our local customer growth as we push ahead. And recognizing that this is different, we did provide many quarters of historical look on Page 18 of our earnings presentation to give you that perspective. 
Maybe before jumping to the second part of your question, Kevin, anything you want to add?  We're good ,got it. 
So now let's talk about the gross profit per case point now that you raised. We have been pleased over the last several quarters with the fact that while our environment is interesting, right? And indeed, we -- our OpEx costs have been increasing our gross profit dollars per case has also been increasing, right? And that is a result of really 2 initiatives. 
The first is our ability to work with our customers to pass through our product cost inflation when our costs go up we pass through the cost to our customers as well. And we've been pleased with our ability to do that. It also goes to what we've been talking about for a couple of quarters on the work we're doing to buy at scale and the work of our merchants and our commercial services organization to better negotiate what we're buying with our vendors as we carry forward. 
It is likely that inflation will pass. Indeed, our own guidance has inflation coming down, still growing but coming down to low single digits.  What will not ask is the capabilities that Kevin and Judy and others have built within merchandising and sourcing. Indeed, our pricing systems that allow us to be right on price as we carry forward. And 1 of the factors of that is both market what's going to the marketplace and what's going with inflation. So we feel good that the team has built the capability to address whatever comes. 
Kevin, anything you want to add to that?"

We've been able to, because we're properly staffed pivot to focusing on associate retention, associate training and associate engagement. And we see progress within our internal dashboards on those 3 very critical components. And these are leading indicators of what will become outcomes metrics of things like cost per piece shipped and our transportation efficiency metrics. 
So as I just said, we can see the leading indicators of success focusing on associate retention, which is improving associate training, which has meaningfully increased versus prior periods and associate engagement, which retains that individual for longer periods of time. We are confident that we will make progress in our operations outcomes metrics. And as Aaron and I have both stated that improvement will be mostly in the second half. And we have the line of sight towards the improvement that we will make. 
As I said in my prepared remarks, we're not just though focusing on that component, which is to improve the day-to-day operations within our buildings, we are also transforming the supply chain for long-term success, 6-day deliveries, the launching of our Driver Academy, the deployment of a distributed order management system, which fuels omnichannel fulfillment and improving our overall driving experience. We are simultaneously moving both of these efforts forward at the same time, helping drive efficiency in the day-to-day and also transforming for the long term because we're playing the long game at Sysco. And we know that the capabilities that we're building are going to enable us to take profitable share for the long term. 
Aaron, is there anything you want to add?."

On the first part, leading indicators, obviously, there's external data that we mine and capture traffic to restaurants but remind everyone that we are much bigger than just restaurants. We serve large sectors outside of the restaurant chain business, restaurant business, in general, travel hospitality business and industry education, just to name a few. And we have data coming from each of those sectors and from our major customer partners in those sectors on what they see in the forward-facing trends for their business, and we combine all of that, Aaron, through FP&A manages all of that to come up with an overarching forecast view of where we're headed and that was obviously factored into what we have guided today. 
On the second part of your question, it's a good one, which is what would you do in a recession? And what are the types of things that you action upon and what types of things would you not action upon. What we're prepared to do, if a recession begins to impact our business, which we said on today's call has not begun. But if, in fact, we do begin to see an impact, there are discretionary expenses that we can tighten. 
There are, let's call it, strategic initiatives that from a timing perspective on how fast they deploy and how fast they move that can be worked through and just belt tightening, I think travel, things of that nature. Here's what we won't do, and it's the spirit of your point, John, on the ability to profitably take share during a disruption.  We're not going to reduce staffing in our supply chain. We're not going to reduce drivers as an example. It was proven through COVID that expense reduction efforts at the beginning of COVID because of how extreme it was resulted in an understaffing scenario for the industry that was extremely difficult to dig out of, and we're still digging out of it vis-a-vis the number of new employees we have at our company. 
So our supply chain is something that we will invest in if volumes were to decrease because we believe that, that will put us in a position of strength which will enable us to win business during that type of disruption. And that business that we win would then be retainable and therefore, very accretive to our longer-term macro algo. So I know you understand that, that's just something that we are meaningfully focused on to ensure we stay properly staffed, and we're playing the long game, as I mentioned."

And so what I'm going to observe is that  we are effectively reaffirming the guidance we gave Q4 overall without giving you a breakdown on a quarterly basis for EBITDA. Keep in mind, from a seasonal perspective, from a profitability perspective, Q4 is always the highest quarter profitability for Sysco, pre-Covid and certainly in recent years as well, followed by Q1 and then Q2 and Q3 are a little bit lower, just given the seasonality of our business. 
The EBITDA disclosure is relatively new. We've been providing it, I believe, in the last year or so. And if I were you, I would look carefully at the definition of how the -- we and our competitors that define the calculation of EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure to work through the mechanics there."

Things like very late in the evening order cutoff. I think a chef who is in a fine dining establishment and had a run on seafood or run on steak  that evening. They want the confidence of being able to place an order after the evening rush and have it be on the truck that delivers that very next morning, and that happens 6-plus days per week. That's what we mean by a different level of service and capability. 
And we afford the service capability to everyone who is in the neighborhood, whether they were previously a Sysco customer or not because the route density is tremendous in these neighborhoods. As I said on the call, I think 50-plus restaurants and a very dense geographic radius. So we're very pleased. We're seeing a dual win. We're seeing the customers that were previously with Sysco are buying meaningfully more from us, and we're seeing customers that weren't previously ours signing up because they see our truck there every day. They see the delivery partner there every day. They see a sales rep who's walking the street every day, and I mean that literally, they're at the neighborhood every day. 
The aggregate of the performance is strong, robust. The focus now is rolling it out and getting it out to as many eligible neighborhoods as possible, as efficiently as we can because we have to honor that service commitment that I just said for it to work. We know if we don't deliver upon the promise that it will not deliver the overall outcome. So we're going to go at an appropriate pace to make sure we can deliver the service. 
And as I highlighted, this is not just domestic U.S. We went live in Toronto, we went live in Dublin, and we will be taking this capability to GB, to Sweden and to many other places across the globe in a pragmatic and thoughtful way. But Josh, we're really pleased with the performance thus far."

We're making steady progress on what we call on time and in full shipment. So supplier fill rate inbound to Sysco has been steadily improving our merchandising teams have been doing extremely good work to improve that effort, provide more substitutions when they're available to our customers. And the ability for us to ship on time has improved as our staffing health has improved. 
Both metrics are still slightly below historical norms, mostly because of the number of new people working within the supply chain, but we're making steady progress. 
As it relates to the impact of a recession on our ability to take market share. I think we've proved over the last 2.5 years during an even much bigger than a recession, COVID, even go back to Omicron last winter. I mean, we saw meaningful negative impact to our business in the month of December, January and February last winter because of Omicron and we took share all throughout that period of time. 
And why is our inventory health, our staffing health and our ability to be there and available for customers is a strain point versus others.

Things that we would do, as I mentioned, expense tightening. Sysco Brand as a point of positive highlight, we improved our penetration in Sysco brand over the past quarter, and we would expect that to continue as we're doing good work on assortment management, pricing management in selling skills capabilities and Sysco brand would become even more important.

And indeed, that's what we've been doing. 
Our treasury team has set us up for success by having a highly fixed portfolio at this moment. Having paid down substantial debt, we've paid down billions of dollars of indebtedness over the last couple of years. And we're in a place now where we have financial flexibility. We -- there is no maturity coming due that we don't already have plans for that would require us to enter into high interest rate environment, even with our credit rating to carry forward, which means that we have every dollar available to us that we need, either through cash on hand, through our cash flow or our revolver or other sources if we needed it to both invest organically and the capital that we need to buy the fleet, build the distribution notice investment technology.

And by the way, we're going to continue to optimize our balance sheet, and we're going to continue our firm focus on return of capital to shareholders. You will have noticed that we paid -- so I misspoken that we purchased shares in the first quarter of $267 million. We got out early on our $500 million commitment.

I just want to be crystal clear about that. That is not the primary driver. The primary driver is productivity levels being below our historical performance averages. And the net productivity impact is hurting the flow-through from the top line to the bottom line, and I'll talk about that in just a second. 
The other is volume. Volume is strong. And obviously, volume up drives expense up. That's an obvious. So let's talk about the variable cost per piece, which is the metric that we're most focused on that has the biggest impact. Why is it down? Why is it taking time to improve. I'd like to just kind of walk through the history of where we've been, where we are, where we're going. Where we've been is we were understaffed because of a very strong rebound in our business and what was this time last year, the great resignation. 
We were in a position where we were understaffed. So over time, rates were up days and hours out on truck too long, which caused folks to then leave the industry, not leave to go to a competitor, but leave the industry. So we had meaningful work we needed to do to get the company back to properly staffed and Aaron called those snapback expenses, expenses that we needed to incur to get properly staffed.  
Here's the good news. We are now properly staffed. That type of work, that type of investment is behind us, which is why today, Aaron described that as now immaterial and our going forward the snapback investments. 
As I mentioned on our last quarterly call, roughly half of our supply chain associates are now new to job new to the company. So we're investing in training to educate our folks to what we call our work standards, which are about working safely and working productively and that takes time. It takes time to matriculate an order select or up the curve or productivity. It takes even longer time to matriculate a driver up the productivity curve. 
The good news is we are properly staffed. We are investing our leadership time, our communication muscle and our investment dollars into improving the training that our associates are receiving, which will drive improved retention. And as I said, those are the internal leading indicators that will result in future periods is cost per piece, excuse me, improving, which is why both Aaron and I have said the second half of this fiscal year, our operating cost metrics will be better than the first half as we're still working up that productivity curve at Sysco."

We",1540,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Our Q1 results reflected continued positive momentum in our business to start the fiscal year. Our share gains continued this quarter as we posted sales growth of more than 1.4x the industry. We delivered double-digit growth in the top line and bottom line of our business.  
Beginning with the top line. We delivered sales growth of 16.2%, driven by a combination of effectively managing inflation and delivering case volume growth. Our U.S. Foodservice volumes and local case volumes continued to grow this quarter.  
Turning to the bottom line, double-digit growth across operating income and net income resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, which was in line with our expectations. The strong start to the year gives us confidence in reaffirming our full year guidance.  
I will highlight 2 topics during our call today. First, I will put into context Sysco's sales and volume growth for the quarter by highlighting some of the drivers of our strength. Second, I will detail our progress within our supply chain and our efforts to improve service levels and operations cost efficiency.  
So let's get started with our unique position of strength in a growing industry displayed on Slide 7. Beginning with the Foodservice industry, the total addressable market is approximately $350 billion. Sysco grew 17% and the rest of the market grew 12% in the quarter, a strong start to the fiscal year.  
Restaurants continued to be resilient and our travel hospitality, plus our business and industry segments of our business posted year-on-year improvements. We see continued strength coming as tailwinds in the noncommercial sector should continue. We are closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions for signs of a business slowdown. At this time, we are not seeing recession concerns negatively impacting our business outcomes.  
With that said, we are prepared to take additional cost reduction actions if or when the recession does begin to impact our P&L. In the backdrop of what has been a strengthening overall market, Sysco continues to outperform. Our sales teams continue to win market share, with Q1 being 1 of our strongest quarters of net new customer wins. Our national sales team posted an outstanding quarter, winning substantial new business in the education, health care and restaurant sectors. These wins are on top of the more than $2 billion of net new national sales wins delivered over the past 2 years.
It is important to note that we are winning this business at strong profit profiles versus historical averages and these are multiyear contracts.
In addition to our success with national sales, our Recipe for Growth is delivering results persist at the local level. Local case volume for the quarter grew 5.4% versus Q1 of 2022, successfully lapping a 26.7% increase from the prior year. Our strong start to the year in national and local sales has us gaining market share overall as we grew more than 1.4x the market for the period. As a result, we are on track to deliver our stated growth objective for the year. 
As seen on Slide 8, our Recipe For Growth includes 5 pillars, focused on building new capabilities that will further enable our leadership position in supply chain and food sales and marketing. As is customary for our quarterly updates, I would like to highlight a couple of our growth drivers. 
Today, I will highlight progress that we are making in the products and solutions pillar with our Sysco Your Way program, and I will also provide an update on select future horizons work.
Within our Products and Solutions growth pillar, we meaningfully advanced our Sysco Your Way program over the past quarter. As a reminder, Sysco Your Way is our service and delivery model for what we call restaurant dense neighborhoods. Think a large number of restaurants and a few block radius. We provide these neighborhoods with a next level of service from Sysco. Examples of that service include a late in the evening order cut off, daily delivery service, dedicated sales and delivery partner representation and additional white glove culinary and marketing services.
The constructs of the Sysco Your Way program were developed in partnership with our customers. And as a result, customers are responding favorably. The top and bottom line results from the program are exceeding our expectations. We are winning substantial new customers within these neighborhoods and existing customers are buying more product on a weekly basis. 
Over the past quarter, we ramped up our implementation efforts, and we will continue to roll out the program to applicable neighborhoods in the coming quarters. We are also bringing the program to international cities with recent implementations in Toronto and Dublin. 
The scale of Sysco Your Way's impact on our overall results will grow each quarter as we add net new neighborhoods.
From our future horizons growth pillar, we are pleased to announce that we have closed on 2 independent Italian distributor acquisitions over the past quarter. These acquisitions will give us access to premium Italian products in areas that were previously geographic [ white ] spaces for Sysco. We have plans to meaningfully scale these businesses by bringing the Greco go-to-market Italian selling strategy to these geographies. We are very pleased with the status of our work to expand Sysco's Italian specialty platform nationally. 
In addition to these 2 examples highlighted today, we are advancing our Recipe For Growth within our International segment as well. Canada, our largest international business is also making good progress with these initiatives. This year in Canada, we will be upgrading our digital platforms, implementing a modern pricing tool, enhancing our team-based selling capabilities and launching Sysco Your Way. 
Canada is already a large and profitable market for Sysco that generated over $5 billion of sales last year, while posting #1 market share at 17%. The Recipe for Growth strategy will enable our Canadian business to further enhance our competitive advantages and better serve our customers. I'm very excited for the progress that we will be making in Canada to deliver profitable sales growth.
These are just a few examples of the good work that is happening, and I look forward to keeping you posted on our domestic and international progress across the 5 pillars in future quarterly calls. 
Topic 2 for today. I'd like to discuss the state of our supply chain improvement and highlight the status of some important work. Our global supply chain work continues to progress. We are simultaneously building on our long-term strategic initiatives like omnichannel while improving productivity levels and cost performance within our supply chain. Our strategic initiatives continue to move forward with 6-day deliveries, improving the driver experience, implementing best-in-class associate training and omnichannel fulfillment, all advancing forward in the quarter, and we can see the early signs of progress that these initiatives are delivering.
As they progress, they will enable profitable sales growth and improve our supply chain cost efficiency. Our supply chain is a strategic differentiator and the strategic work we are doing will widen that competitive moat in the coming quarters and years. Simply put, no one is doing more than Sysco to improve service levels to customers and to improve cost efficiencies within the Foodservice supply chain.
In addition to advancing our strategic initiatives,  our teams have remained relentlessly focused on improving productivity in the near term. We made progress over the past quarter in improving associate retention. Retention improvement will enable us to improve associate productivity, and therefore, lower our operating costs in future quarters. 
It is important to understand that Sysco's staffing levels remain healthy across our sites. We are staffed properly to support our current business and also to enable future profitable growth. Given our overall staffing health, we are meaningfully focused on associate retention and best-in-class training of our newer associates to improve productivity levels.
We are also teaching our supervisors how to leverage our engineered labor standards to deliver performance-based coaching. As our staffing levels have improved in recent quarters, we have been able to spend more of our leadership time and communication muscle on training to our work methods and standards. And this is where the intersection between our future strategy and our current improvement efforts intersect. A driver academy is graduating cohorts of trainees that are now hitting the streets. These drivers are already showing strong service, safety and productivity standards. 
As importantly, we are tracking retention by training class, and we can see meaningfully higher retention rates of associates trained by Sysco versus hired from the external market. Over time, the percentage of associates trained from within Sysco will grow, and this ratio of growth will improve retention and productivity.
Cost of turnover is high in this industry, and improving associate retention is imperative. I'm confident that our training academies will give Sysco a meaningful advantage in the industry. We believe the advancements we are making in our physical capabilities and the investments we are making in improved training will provide improved service levels to our customers and strengthen Sysco's ability to profitably win market share in the coming quarters and years.
I'll now turn it over to Neil, who will provide an update on our sustainability efforts. Neil, over to you."

As we have mentioned, our efforts are anchored around 3 pillars: people, products and planet. We are proud that Sysco was a partner organization at the recent White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. At the conference, Sysco's sustainability efforts were recognized for our previously communicated $500 million commitment to global good in our communities by 2025. This includes a donation of 200 million meals to fight hunger, cash donations to food banks and volunteer hours associated with our colleagues actively participating in the communities we serve.
Earlier this year, our Board also approved plans to include ESG and DEI metrics in our annual incentive plan, an important best practice. Every leader at Sysco is now held accountable to making tangible progress on both DEI and climate change efforts for the company, directly impacting our own compensation. These efforts are consistent with our purpose of connecting the world to share food and care for 1 another. This focus is not only the right thing to do, it will be good for business in the long term. 
As I have explained recently to investors, the majority of Sysco's greenhouse gas emissions are the Scope 3 emissions of our customers. Many of our largest customers have set forth their own climate commitments and Sysco's improvement will help enable those partners to achieve their goals.
I will now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details."

Turning to a summary of our Q1 reported results. Q1 was the highest sales quarter at Sysco ever. We achieved 16.2% sales growth at Sysco for the quarter, with U.S. Foodservice growing at 17.2% and international growing at 13.4%. Reflecting our focus on serving our local and independent customers through both our Broadline and specialty businesses, we are expanding our disclosure of total and local case volumes to, in aggregate, include our FreshPoint U.S. produce, U.S. Italian and other specialty businesses in the metrics. For clarity, our specialty meats business is not yet in this metric as it measures volume in pounds.  
With respect to volume, total U.S. food service volume increased 7.3% compared to last year. All in, our inclusive local case volumes grew by 5.4% in Q1 2023 over the prior year's comparable period in the U.S. You can see the history of this metric on Slide 18 compared to our year-end 2019 levels. We banked $3.5 billion in adjusted gross profit for the quarter, up 17.3% versus last year. Adjusted gross margin improved 17 basis points to 18.2% for the first quarter. GP per case grew in all 4 segments versus prior year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of such growth.  
Our gross profit and margin improvement reflected our ability to continue to manage product inflation, which was at 9.7% at the total enterprise level, consistent with our guidance as well as incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as we continue to partner with our suppliers.  
U.S. Broadline inflation was 12% in the quarter. Our inflation metric is in dollars, so the enterprise metric was reduced by the local currency declines against the dollar.  
Overall adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 14.2% of our sales, a 30 basis point increase as a percentage of sales over the same quarter in the prior year. Cost this quarter increased in workers' compensation, pension expense, health care and some operational elements like shrink, all of which are being addressed. We have more to do in this area but believe that our supply chain and North American teams has Sysco on the path to improving our operating expense profile.  
Additionally, this quarter included progress against capturing cost out which represents incremental efforts on top of the more than $750 million of cumulative cost out. Recall that last quarter, we outlined expectations for operating costs to be more heavily weighted in the first half based on the need to work through operating cost inflation, operating productivity challenges and our planned investments in the business.  
Consistent with that, this quarter included transformation investments of $63 million and new associate related productivity costs of $41 million and an improvement in snapback costs, which are becoming immaterial. All 4 segments showed increases in profitability year-over-year with SYGMA returning to profitability from the prior year's modest loss in Q1.  
Additionally, adjusted operating income in our International segment grew over the prior year also exceeding pre-COVID 2019 levels. Adjusted operating income for the enterprise increased by 12.4% versus last year to $770 million. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 7.5% to $917 million. We often refer to exceeding fiscal '19 adjusted EPS levels as part of our long-term guidance. It is worth noting that in the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased by 16.9% over prior year and for the first time since the onset of COVID exceeded adjusted EPS from the same quarter in fiscal '19 by $0.06.  
Applying a macro financial lens, I will point out 2 financial factors that had an impact on profitability this quarter different from recent years. First, the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar in our international operations. Second, an increase in pension expense tied to the rapid rise in interest rates. In total, those 2 externalities had a $0.03 negative impact on GAAP and adjusted EPS.  
On the pension point, to be clear, our largely frozen pension plan remains fully funded and the above reflects the noncash impact of pension accounting that is a result of extreme movements in the global capital markets. You may have noticed an 8-K about a pension liability transfer exercise in October, subsequent to the end of our first quarter.
That transaction decreases Sysco's plan size, risk and overall administrative costs while protecting retirees as they will be in the hands of an A-rated insurance company. This transaction will result in a noncash charge in Q2 of $250 million to $300 million, which we expect to be a certain item. Other than the certain items, we expect the income statement impact of the transaction to be largely immaterial to our year.  
In regards to the balance sheet, our strong investment-grade rated balance sheet remains a competitive advantage for us and we ended the quarter at 3.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We returned $258 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and paid our increased quarterly dividend, returned $517 million in total to shareholders this past quarter. Had we not executed the early share repurchase, our leverage ratio would have been 3x.  
Given the focus on interest rates lately, I want to remind listeners that approximately 95% of Sysco's debt is fixed rate. 
Let's turn to cash. Recall that the first quarter is typically the quarter in which we have the lowest in-quarter cash flow generation. This year, for the first quarter, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $158.6 million, a $48 million improvement over the prior year. However, net CapEx almost doubled in Q1 of fiscal '23 to $145 million as we continue to invest in our Recipe For Growth, particularly with respect to our planned investments in fleet and distribution notes. As a result, free cash flow was $14 million for the quarter.  
Working capital was a use of cash, though we are watching our inventory balances closely as part of our supply chain transformation and are monitoring our accounts receivable closely given the economic environment. We ended the quarter with approximately $438 million in cash on hand.  
Let's return to the look forward. As I said at the start of my remarks, we are upbeat about our business while remaining appropriately cautious given the operating environment. While we have work to do on our expense structure, as Kevin called out, Sysco has not yet seen any broad impact on our business from concerns around the risk of recession impacting consumer behavior. As a result, we are sticking with our full year guidance for fiscal year 2023 for adjusted EPS of $4.09 to $4.39. 
As Kevin mentioned earlier, we are well positioned and prepared to operate through another dynamic year. We have a plan, and our team is executing against it with the benefit of all the learnings that our company and our industry have worked through in the last couple of years.  
Lastly, I hope you noticed that we are reporting Q1 a week early. As part of our transformation efforts, we have worked to accelerate our financial close process, increasing the speed of finding data to faster decisions and looking forward, not back. We plan to report earnings faster than our historical cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year.  
With that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks."

We advanced our Recipe for Growth strategy, and we are on target to grow more than 1.35x the market in a growing U.S. market.  
Our financial results this quarter reflected double-digit top and bottom line growth in the backdrop of a large industry that has proven resilient during very challenging macro conditions. Sysco is taking share profitably in a growing industry.  
Lastly, Sysco remains deeply committed to our strong investment-grade credit rating, a strong and stable balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation. We are committed to our long-term financial outlook, and we have reiterated today our full year guidance for fiscal year '23. Just as we have done with COVID  and the related disruptions over the past few years, we are prepared to navigate the potentially choppy macroeconomic waters in coming quarters.  
Our strong financial foundation gives  Sysco the opportunity to continue to advance our strategy during potentially challenging environments. This reality will enable Sysco to win for the longer term as our capabilities improve and our initiatives progress.

But across the pond in Europe meaningfully advancing forward core Sysco capabilities. Sysco brand penetration improvement this year. We're filling in assortment gaps that we have in select countries. We're bringing our team-based selling model that we have optimized in the United States.

So really pleased with our leadership team, strong, capable, talented team led by Paul Oak, who joined our company back in August and upward progress in the forward-facing quarters and years.
Things like Latin American growth, we have an export business called IFG, which is doing well and we're really optimistic about our future with international.

What I highlighted in my prepared remarks is that the strength is coming from both national and local business. On the national side, our sales teams are just doing a remarkably good job in the health care space, in the education space, large national restaurant space on working with our customers and customer prospects on kind of selling the values and capabilities of Sysco, the strength of our supply chain, our nationwide capability within the U.S. to support those national customer partners.  
And as I mentioned, profit profiles for those contracts that are above historical standards, and these are multiyear contracts.  
On the local side, the combination of our specialty businesses that Aaron highlighted that are doing extremely well. Team-based selling, which is leveraging those capabilities within our Broadline segment and the Recipe For Growth beginning to take noticeable traction. So that is why we reiterated our guide for the full year in total, and I'll toss to Aaron for comments on the inflation and sales parts of your question, too."

Thanks, Kevin. Good morning. We are really pleased with the market share gains and the sales increases over the course of the quarter, as you can imagine, that, of course, is coming as a result of the combination between the volume growth and the impact of inflation on the portfolio. If you think back to the guidance that we provided in Q4, we -- the sales reference we had was that we would grow at least 10%. And I believe at the time, I commented that at 10% without knowing what was coming from a macroeconomic perspective was tied to the lower end of our range. 
And so indirectly, yes, in answer to your question, we do expect that the 10% is achievable and that's at the lower end of our range. I would observe that inflation we guided in Q4, high single digits in Q1, working its way down to low single digits in Q4. Certainly, as we sit here today, the enterprise number in dollars was high single digits, just under 10%. And so things are playing out in that respect as we had expected."

I think you'd like us to comment on the volume metrics and then comment on the look forward relative to GP dollars per case, if I summarize your question really. Let me start with the first part of your question",552,"So Ed, I'm going to go back and summarize. I think you'd like us to comment on the volume metrics and then comment on the look forward relative to GP dollars per case, if I summarize your question really. Let me start with the first part of your question on the volume, which is to touch on our disclosure today of the fact that our U.S. Foodservice segment, which is the combination as it has been of our Broadline and specialty businesses had total case growth of 7.3% and local case growth of 5.4%.  
From the outside, you might say, well, are you lumping the recent acquisitions in and that's a small part of what in the case volume disclosure. But keep in mind that we have had a multibillion-dollar business what we call specialty, which is part of U.S. Foodservice, the segment we do most of our disclosures against that is not part of the U.S. Broadline.  
And so I want to take you back to the why, and we're now disclosing a total U.S. food service number, it's simply this. The Recipe For Growth is designed to bring all of our assets to bear in support of specific customers. And we have customers that are serviced by Broadline, serviced by specialty. Kevin will probably comment on that more as we carry forward. 
What we're trying to give you the true view of what's going on with our total case growth and our local customer growth as we push ahead. And recognizing that this is different, we did provide many quarters of historical look on Page 18 of our earnings presentation to give you that perspective.  
Maybe before jumping to the second part of your question, Kevin, anything you want to add?  We're good, got it.  
So now let's talk about the gross profit per case point now that you raised. We have been pleased over the last several quarters with the fact that while our environment is interesting, right? And indeed, we -- our OpEx costs have been increasing our gross profit dollars per case has also been increasing, right? And that is a result of really 2 initiatives.  
The first is our ability to work with our customers to pass through our product cost inflation, when our costs go up we pass through the cost to our customers as well. And we've been pleased with our ability to do that. It also goes to what we've been talking about for a couple of quarters on the work we're doing to buy at scale and the work of our merchants and our commercial services organization to better negotiate what we're buying with our vendors as we carry forward.  
It is likely that inflation will pass. Indeed, our own guidance has inflation coming down, still growing but coming down to low single digits. What will not ask is the capabilities that Kevin and Judy and others have built within merchandising and sourcing. Indeed, our pricing systems that allow us to be white on price as we carry forward. And 1 of the factors of that is both marketplace, what's going to the marketplace and what's going with inflation. So we feel good that the team has built the capability to address whatever comes.  
Kevin, anything you want to add to that?"

And I think that's about all we're going to say in that regard. 
As it relates to the operating expense parts of your question, I completely understand the question. Our operating costs are elevated versus our historical standards, and we are meaningfully focused on it. 
I want to highlight a couple of key components here. Point 1 is that we are properly staffed across our network. And by being properly staffed, that allows us to support growth, reduce overtime, improve safety, and those are actions that will lead to lowering our future costs. We've been able to, because we're properly staffed pivot to focusing on associate retention, associate training and associate engagement. And we see progress within our internal dashboards on those 3 very critical components. And these are leading indicators of what will become outcomes metrics of things like cost per piece shipped and our transportation efficiency metrics. 
So as I just said, we can see the leading indicators of success focusing on associate retention, which is improving associate training, which has meaningfully increased versus prior periods and associate engagement, which retains that individual for longer periods of time. We are confident that we will make progress in our operations outcomes metrics. And as Aaron and I have both stated that improvement will be mostly in the second half. And we have the line of sight towards the improvement that we will make. 
As I said in my prepared remarks, we're not just though focusing on that component, which is to improve the day-to-day operations within our buildings, we are also transforming the supply chain for long-term success, 6-day deliveries, the launching of our Driver Academy, the deployment of a distributed order management system, which fuels omnichannel fulfillment and improving our overall driving experience. We are simultaneously moving both of these efforts forward at the same time, helping drive efficiency in the day-to-day and also transforming for the long term because we're playing the long game at Sysco. And we know that the capabilities that we're building are going to enable us to take profitable share for the long term. 
Aaron, is there anything you want to add?"

And then secondly, right, maybe talk about the balance, right? You mentioned making adjustments to OpEx but by the same token, right, the real opportunity is long-term share gains. So you don't want to do anything that would compromise that. So when you think about taking cost out, where is -- how do you balance that?

On the first part, leading indicators, obviously, there's external data that we mine and capture traffic to restaurants but remind everyone that we are much bigger than just restaurants. We serve large sectors outside of the restaurant chain business, restaurant business, in general, travel hospitality business and industry education, just to name a few. And we have data coming from each of those sectors and from our major customer partners in those sectors on what they see in the forward-facing trends for their business, and we combine all of that, Aaron, through FP&A manages all of that to come up with an overarching forecast view of where we're headed and that was obviously factored into what we have guided today. 
On the second part of your question, it's a good one, which is what would you do in a recession? And what are the types of things that you action upon and what types of things would you not action upon? What we're prepared to do, if a recession begins to impact our business, which we said on today's call has not begun. But if, in fact, we do begin to see an impact, there are discretionary expenses that we can tighten. 
There are, let's call it, strategic initiatives that from a timing perspective on how fast they deploy and how fast they move that can be worked through and it's just belt tightening, I think travel, things of that nature. Here's what we won't do, and it's the spirit of your point, John, on the ability to profitably take share during a disruption. We're not going to reduce staffing in our supply chain. We're not going to reduce drivers as an example. It was proven through COVID that expense reduction efforts at the beginning of COVID because of how extreme it was resulted in an understaffing scenario for the industry that was extremely difficult to dig out of, and we're still digging out of it vis-a-vis the number of new employees we have at our company. 
So our supply chain is something that we will invest in if volumes were to decrease because we believe that, that will put us in a position of strength which will enable us to win business during that type of disruption. And that business that we win would then be retainable and therefore, very accretive to our longer-term macro algo. So I know you understand that, that's just something that we are meaningfully focused on to ensure we stay properly staffed, and we're playing the long game, as I mentioned."

Your question around your EBITDA, we didn't provide EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And so what I'm going to observe is that we are effectively reaffirming the guidance we gave Q4 overall without giving you a breakdown on a quarterly basis for EBITDA. Keep in mind, from a seasonal perspective, from a profitability perspective, Q4 is always the highest quarter profitability for Sysco, pre-Covid and certainly in recent years as well, followed by Q1 and then Q2 and Q3 are a little bit lower, just given the seasonality of our business. 
The EBITDA disclosure is relatively new. We've been providing it, I believe, in the last year or so. And if I were you, I would look carefully at the definition of how the -- we and our competitors that define the calculation of EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure to work through the mechanics there."

We're pleased with our performance of the initiatives that we are putting forward and the impact that those initiatives are having on share of wallet. We're not going to today disclose or share of wallet update.

Where we are now is rollout. We're in implementation. And some of those initiatives are still in their embryonic phase, we're a big company. We do over $1 billion of sales per week, and these initiatives will move the needle for the longer term. They're just very early from an innings perspective on their impact on customers.

As I said in my prepared remarks, the contracts of that program were developed in concert with our customers. We asked them essentially what's important to you, what could we Sysco do for you that would result in your increasing your business with us? Or how could we serve you if we're not currently your partner?  
Things like very late in the evening order cutoff. I think a chef who is in a fine dining establishment and had a run on seafood or run on steak that evening. They want the confidence of being able to place an order after the evening rush and have it be on the truck that delivers that very next morning, and that happens 6-plus days per week. That's what we mean by a different level of service and capability. 
And we afford this service capability to everyone who is in the neighborhood, whether they were previously a Sysco customer or not because the route density is tremendous in these neighborhoods. As I said on the call, I think 50-plus restaurants and a very dense geographic radius. So we're very pleased. We're seeing a dual win. We're seeing the customers that were previously with Sysco are buying meaningfully more from us, and we're seeing customers that weren't previously ours signing up because they see our truck there every day. They see the delivery partner there every day. They see a sales rep who's walking the street every day, and I mean that literally, they're at the neighborhood every day. 
The aggregate of the performance is strong, robust. The focus now is rolling it out and getting it out to as many eligible neighborhoods as possible, as efficiently as we can because we have to honor that service commitment that I just said for it to work. We know if we don't deliver upon the promise that it will not deliver the overall outcome. So we're going to go at an appropriate pace to make sure we can deliver the service. 
And as I highlighted, this is not just domestic U.S. We went live in Toronto, we went live in Dublin, and we will be taking this capability to GB, to Sweden and to many other places across the globe in a pragmatic and thoughtful way. But Josh, we're really pleased with the performance thus far."

We're making steady progress on what we call on time and in full shipment. So supplier fill rate inbound to Sysco has been steadily improving our merchandising teams have been doing extremely good work to improve that effort, provide more substitutions when they're available to our customers. And the ability for us to ship on time has improved as our staffing health has improved. 
Both metrics are still slightly below historical norms, mostly because of the number of new people working within the supply chain, but we're making steady progress. 
As it relates to the impact of a recession on our ability to take market share. I think we've proved over the last 2.5 years during an event much bigger than a recession, COVID. Even go back to Omicron last winter, I mean, we saw meaningful negative impact to our business in the month of December, January and February last winter because of Omicron and we took share all throughout that period of time. 
And why is our inventory health, our staffing health and our ability to be there and available for customers is a strength point versus others.  The balance sheet that we have affords us the opportunity to make those longer-term decisions. And I would suspect that would be a pattern that would continue the future if a recession would occur.

We are winning across the board from a national sales perspective or as we call it contract management, CMU business. I just gave examples of what that means for everyone out there and wins came in this most recent quarter from healthcare, from education and also from national restaurants. Because when we talk about national sales, people tend to assume it must mean restaurants and we are putting a meaningful focus on winning across the portfolio of national sales business. 
And as I said, the team did a really great job in Q1 and that the rates for those contracts are solid. What I -- a separate point from that, my prepared remarks referenced strains that we are experiencing in the non-restaurant space as those customer types are continuing to move up the recovery curve.

And we get a chest board of things we're interested in, and we're very thankful for the strong balance sheet that Aaron and his team have helped us developed and deliver over time that gives us the flexibility that we need to want."

I think most of it or the majority of it is just market-driven wage rate increases. Maybe you could help us understand that. And it sounds like Sysco is deliberately one, you have a lot of volume but also being fully staffed. A lot of it might be headcount as well. And as you look forward, when those numbers flatten out, so that we can sort of incorporate that in our modeling."

I just want to be crystal clear about that. That is not the primary driver. The primary driver is productivity levels being below our historical performance averages. And the net productivity impact is hurting the flow-through from the top line to the bottom line, and I'll talk about that in just a second. 
The other is volume. Volume is strong. And obviously, volume up drives expense up. That's an obvious. So let's talk about the variable cost per piece, which is the metric that we're most focused on that has the biggest impact. Why is it down? Why is it taking time to improve. I'd like to just kind of walk through the history of where we've been, where we are, where we're going. Where we've been is we were understaffed because of a very strong rebound in our business and what was this time last year, the great resignation. 
We were in a position where we were understaffed. So over time, rates were up days and hours out on truck too long, which caused folks to then leave the industry, not leave to go to a competitor, but leave the industry. So we had meaningful work we needed to do to get the company back to properly staffed and Aaron called those snapback expenses, expenses that we needed to incur to get properly staffed.  
Here's the good news. We are now properly staffed. That type of work, that type of investment is behind us, which is why today, Aaron described that as now immaterial and our going forward the snapback investments. 
As I mentioned on our last quarterly call, roughly half of our supply chain associates are now new to job, new to the company. So we're investing in training to educate our folks to what we call our work standards, which are about working safely and working productively and that takes time. It takes time to matriculate an order select or up the curve or productivity. It takes even longer time to matriculate a driver up the productivity curve. 
The good news is we are properly staffed. We are investing our leadership time, our communication muscle and our investment dollars into improving the training that our associates are receiving, which will drive improved retention. And as I said, those are the internal leading indicators that will result in future periods is cost per piece, excuse me, improving, which is why both Aaron and I have said the second half of this fiscal year, our operating cost metrics will be better than the first half as we're still working up that productivity curve at Sysco."
