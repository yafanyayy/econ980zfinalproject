Stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operating performance resulted in robust profit and earnings growth. Demand remains strong and broad-based across our end markets, leading to superb order growth and a record backlog as we enter 2022. 
We are integrating 6 recent acquisitions into the AMETEK growth model and are well positioned to deploy capital on additional acquisitions, given our excellent cash flow generation and strong balance sheet. We asked a lot of our teams in 2021 and as the pandemic and supply chain tightness led to disruption and uncertainty. As always, our colleagues stepped up to these challenges and delivered tremendous results. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your hard work and tremendous contributions to our success. 
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.50 billion, up 25% over the same period in 2020 and above our expectation. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added 9 points and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind in the quarter. 
Overall, orders in the fourth quarter were $1.61 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an impressive 22% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.73 billion, which is up over 50% from the start of the year driven by strong underlying orders across our businesses plus the contributions from acquisitions. 
Fourth quarter operating income was a record $361 million, up 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 24%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 25.8%, up a very strong 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2020. 
EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $437 million, up 21% over the prior year, and EBITDA margins were 29.1%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.37 per diluted share, up 27% over the fourth quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.28 to $1.30. 
Our record performance in the fourth quarter speaks to the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to drive strong growth throughout economic cycles. While the pandemic impacted results in 2020, we have quickly recovered and are now running well above pre-pandemic levels. For example, AMETEK's fourth quarter 2021 sales were 15% higher than our sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic, while core operating margins were up 300 basis points and earnings were up 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for EIG were a record $1.06 billion, up 29% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales were up 17%. Acquisitions added 13% and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. Growth remains strong and broad-based across EIG with particularly strong growth in our Gatan and CAMECA businesses. EIG's fourth quarter operating income was a record $280 million up 18% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins were 26.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's core margins were excellent at 29.3% up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020. 
The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Fourth quarter sales for EMG were $447 million up 18% versus the prior year driven by broad-based organic sales growth. Our automation businesses saw continued strong demand across a wide range of end markets. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $105 million, up 32% compared to the prior year. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 260 basis points to 23.6%. 
Now for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2021, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $5.5 billion up 22% from 2020. Organic sales increased 15%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency, a modest tailwind. Overall orders were up 40% versus the prior year with 26% organic orders growth leading to a record backlog and providing us solid visibility as we look ahead to 2022. 
Operating income for 2021 was $1.3 billion up 22%, and operating margins were 23.6% with core margins up 110 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $1.6 billion, up 20% from 2020. And full year 2021 earnings were $4.85 per diluted share, up 23% versus the prior year. 
In addition to the excellent financial results in 2021, we also positioned AMETEK for long-term success by continuing to invest in our businesses to support their organic growth initiatives. One important initiative is new product development, as we look to further expand our differentiated technology solutions in attractive growth markets. 
In 2021, we invested $300 million in research, development and engineering or approximately 5.5% of sales. This level of investment was up 22% over 2021. One way we measure the success of new product development efforts is through our vitality index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past 3 years. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index was a very strong 25%. 
These investments are driving outstanding innovation, including a growing number of important solutions in support of our customers' sustainability initiatives. We're supporting the development and expansion of renewable energy solutions, providing important technologies used to monitor, measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, assisting scientists and the understanding of the impacts of climate change and supporting the development and testing of electric vehicles, to name just a few of the important applications AMETEK plays a key role in supporting. 
We are expanding our research, development and engineering investments and expect to invest approximately $340 million or 5.5% of sales in RD&E in 2022. This is a 13% increase over 2021 RD&E spend. 
We are also deploying our capital and strategic acquisitions, adding to our portfolio of market-leading industrial technology businesses and driving excellent returns for our shareholders. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of 6 businesses. Our latest acquisition, Alphasense, was completed in the fourth quarter. 
Alphasense develops and manufactures gas and particulate sensors for use in environmental, health and safety and air quality applications. Their sensors are used in both fixed and portable systems to detect a variety of gases, including oxygen, volatile organic compounds and harmful toxic gases.  Alphasense's sensor projects and technologies are highly complementary with our MOCON business and provide our sensor offering serving -- and broaden our sensor offering, serving critical health, safety and environmental applications. Alphasense is based in Essex, U.K. and has annual sales of approximately $30 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, and we expect to remain very busy in 2022. 
As our results reflect, our businesses are doing an excellent job managing the ongoing operational challenges caused by the pandemic. AMETEK's flexible, agile operating structure, including our global supply chain capabilities, provide us the ability to quickly adjust and react to challenges. 
These supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing given our differentiated product offering. Overall, the operating environment remains similar to what we experienced during the third quarter with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components, along with logistics and labor availability issues. We remain focused in the short term on managing our supply chain and ensuring we can safely operate our factories while also continuing to drive long-term operational excellence initiatives across our businesses. 
Moving to our outlook for 2022. We remain cautious in the short term, given ongoing COVID-19 and supply chain challenges. However, we are confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid- to high single digits versus 2021. 
Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.42, up 9% to 12% compared to 2021. For the first quarter, overall sales are expected to be up approximately 20% compared to the same period last year, and first quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.28 per diluted share up 16% to 20% versus the prior year. 
In summary, I would like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts this past year. AMETEK's fourth quarter and full year results were excellent and reflective of the resilience and strength of our workforce and the AMETEK growth model. Our strong orders and record backlog position us nicely for 2022, and we look forward to the new year and continuing to build on the momentum gained in 2021. 
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2021 with outstanding operating performance, leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2022. 
Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $23.7 million, up $6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $19 million, also driven largely by higher compensation costs. For 2022, general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales. 
The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% down from 20.1% in the fourth quarter 2020. This lower tax rate was due to return to provision adjustments. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. 
Working capital in the quarter was excellent at 15.2% of sales. This reflects the strong work from our teams in managing working capital. We have also strategically added inventory in certain areas to help address the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. 
Capital expenditures were $43 million in the fourth quarter and $111 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2022 are expected to be approximately $125 million or about 2% of sales. 
Depreciation amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million and for the full year was $292 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share. 
We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. Operating cash flow was $282 million in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion for the full year. Free cash flow was $238 million in the quarter and $1.05 billion or 106% of net income for the full year. Total debt at the year-end was $2.54 billion up only $131 million from the end of 2020 despite having deployed approximately $2 billion on acquisitions in 2021. 
Despite the record level of capital deployment, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 1.8x at the end of 2020 to 1.5x at the end of 2021, a testament to the strength of our operating model. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $347 million. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. 
In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2022 remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and our world-class workforce. Kevin?"

But it's across the board. And on top of that, it was -- for the quarter, the way the quarter played out, it was each month of the quarter got better. And on orders, December was the highest month we had in the whole year. So we ended on strength and we have a very healthy backlog. 
And the one thing I mentioned a few calls ago is I think our customers, because of some supply chain challenges across all the market, are giving us a look into what their demand patterns are. So we're seeing orders earlier, but that doesn't take away from the strength that we're feeling in the business."

I mean everything that you said is true, and we're experiencing the same challenges as everyone is with supply chain, logistics, labor availability. And the Omicron variant certainly added a lot fourth quarter and Q1. 
But our overall response to these challenges has been outstanding. And I think the first point is our distributed business model. where we have committed P&L managers running their business units with their own supply chain teams, which allows them to react quickly to changing conditions. And at the same time we have these business teams, we have a corporate centralized supply chain team that acts with all the combined leverage in the forte of AMETEK. And these teams work seamlessly together, and this overall approach has been extremely effective for us. 
As I mentioned, in the last quarter and this quarter, it's directly what you said, semiconductor chip availability, we have a lot of shortages, but that's the biggest area. And that's the one that's the most challenging. And we're going after that a few ways. I mean, we're using our leverage of AMETEK. We have relationships built up over a long period of time with the supply base. Our engineering capability is second to none, and we use it to qualify second sources, find alternatives, new redesigns. And we've also taken a team of people across the company. Some of them are based on our Bangalore engineering office. Some of them are based in Germany. Some of them are based in the U.S., and that team is available to quickly help our business units for shortages and find alternatives, and that's working quite well. 
So we don't really improve -- anticipate improvements in availability of semiconductor chips until the second half of '22 at the earliest, and it's certainly a challenge. But I think we've had an effective response to it for the reasons that I just mentioned."

I'll start with the Process business. the process overall sales were up 20% -- low 20% in the quarter driven by strong organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisitions of Magnetrol and Alphasense, Organic sales were up high teens for process. Our Materials Analysis businesses showed the strongest growth. They were driven by, as I said in my prepared remarks, like Gatan and CAMECA. The businesses have leading positions providing high-end instrumentation into life sciences and semiconductor markets. And looking ahead for Process, we expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up mid- to high single digits for the full year. 
Now I'll switch to Aerospace. Overall sales for Aerospace & Defense businesses were up over 40% in the fourth quarter, driven by the acquisition of Abaco and mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Our commercial businesses led to growth in the quarter driven by strong aftermarket and business jet growth, while our defense businesses were down slightly in the quarter due to some shipment delays, it still had another strong year. 
Shifting to 2020. While we remain cautious about the patient the commercial aerospace recovery we're still well positioned to benefit from the recovery, given our attractive positions in a diverse set of commercial and business jet platforms. So for '22, we expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Aerospace & Defense businesses with both defense and commercial expected to be up mid-single digits. 
And I go to our Power & Industrial market segment next -- overall sales for Power & Industrial were up over 25% in the fourth quarter and a very good fourth quarter, driven by mid-teens organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisition of NSI-MI. And for all of we expect Power & Industrial to be up mid-single digits with similar growth across our Power and Industrial segments. 
And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Both overall and organic growth for Automation & Engineered Solutions were up low 20% in the quarter. Automation businesses delivered outstanding growth in the quarter and full year with continued solid demand across their end markets. And in 2022, we expect organic sales for automation and Engineered Solutions to be up mid- to high single digits with similar growth across our Automation & Engineered Solutions. So if you look at the big picture, our Process and Automation & Engineered Solutions, market segments are going to be up mid- to high single digits. And Aerospace and Power and Industrial will be up mid-single digits."

And then I'll just put the other one in there now. 
Just on long-term runway, it seems like there's a ton of momentum in automation and semiconductors. Maybe that's evident in your backlog a little bit. I don't know how far out your visibility goes on projects and bidding and quoting and just what your feel for those end markets is throughout the year."

I believe we have a lot of statistics when you look at outside the world, and we also have our own internal statistics for AMETEK. And it looks like the peak infections are cresting. So I think the last 2 weeks, we were down a bit, and we had the highest level of infections prior to that. So it's clearly the same things that are happening outside of AMETEK are happening inside of AMETEK, but we're doing a pretty good job of managing through it. But it does cause absenteeism and it does cause labor availability and it's a challenge every day when something changes to manage through that. So that's clearly -- that's part of the issue we're dealing with Q1. And our guide range is a little bit broader because of that. And -- but our people are doing a fantastic job. 
When you talk about the long-term and runway and automation and semiconductors, we're seeing that. And if you think -- I talked a little about the automation market and how we've done past acquisitions to acquire pieces of the automation, motion control, subassemblies that we've now put together, and we're very capable of quickly develop custom designs for our customers. We're kind of unique in that capability, and we're winning a lot there. And I think that's going to continue. 
And when you look at the semiconductor market, really solid growth in Q4, but it's continuing. And we're competing in 2 parts of that market. We work in the research market. And I mentioned our CAMECA business did very well. That business is benefiting from the research side of semiconductors. And then you got some new technology that are going into the ramp in chip production. And some of the new technology uses something called EUV optics, and our Zygo business is an expert in that and there's only a couple of people in the world that are an expert in that. So we're benefiting from the transition to EUV optics in the semiconductor industry. and that trend is just getting started. 
So I'm not saying there's going to be some ups and downs as we go forward, but we're really well positioned in both automation and semiconductors as we look forward."

So broad-based firing on all cylinders. 
Your point is a good one. The reaction to COVID is handled differently in parts of the world. So you can have semiconductor plants are being shut down or blocking access to certain countries at times, and we've been managing through that at the start of the pandemic. But in particular, you asked about China, and we were up 2% in China, very solid because we had a really strong comparison, and we had a really strong year.

Stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operating performance resulted in robust profit and earnings growth. Demand remains strong and broad-based across our end markets, leading to superb order growth and a record backlog as we enter 2022.  
We are integrating 6 recent acquisitions into the AMETEK growth model and are well positioned to deploy capital on additional acquisitions, given our excellent cash flow generation and strong balance sheet. We asked a lot of our teams in 2021, as the pandemic and supply chain tightness led to disruption and uncertainty. As always, our colleagues stepped up to these challenges and delivered tremendous results. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your hard work and tremendous contributions to our success.  
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.50 billion, up 25% over the same period in 2020 and above our expectation. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added 9 points and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind in the quarter.  
Overall orders in the fourth quarter were $1.61 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an impressive 22% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.73 billion, which is up over 50% from the start of the year driven by strong underlying orders across our businesses plus the contributions from acquisitions.  
Fourth quarter operating income was a record $361 million, up 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 24%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 25.8%, up a very strong 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2020.  
EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $437 million, up 21% over the prior year, and EBITDA margins were 29.1%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.37 per diluted share, up 27% over the fourth quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.28 to $1.30.  
Our record performance in the fourth quarter speaks to the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to drive strong growth throughout economic cycles. While the pandemic impacted results in 2020, we have quickly recovered and are now running well above pre-pandemic levels. For example, AMETEK's fourth quarter 2021 sales were 15% higher than our sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic, while core operating margins were up 300 basis points and earnings were up 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for EIG were a record $1.06 billion, up 29% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales were up 17%. Acquisitions added 13%, and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. Growth remains strong and broad-based across EIG with particularly strong growth in our Gatan and CAMECA businesses. EIG's fourth quarter operating income was a record $280 million up 18% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins were 26.4%.  
Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's core margins were excellent at 29.3% up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020.  
The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Fourth quarter sales for EMG were $447 million up 18% versus the prior year driven by broad-based organic sales growth. Our automation businesses saw continued strong demand across a wide range of end markets. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $105 million, up 32% compared to the prior year. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 260 basis points to 23.6%.  
Now for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2021, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $5.5 billion up 22% from 2020. Organic sales increased 15%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency, a modest tailwind. Overall orders were up 40% versus the prior year with 26% organic orders growth leading to a record backlog and providing us solid visibility as we look ahead to 2022.  
Operating income for 2021 was $1.3 billion up 22%, and operating margins were 23.6% with core margins up 110 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $1.6 billion, up 20% from 2020. And full year 2021 earnings were $4.85 per diluted share, up 23% versus the prior year.  
In addition to the excellent financial results in 2021, we also positioned AMETEK for long-term success by continuing to invest in our businesses to support their organic growth initiatives. One important initiative is new product development, as we look to further expand our differentiated technology solutions in attractive growth markets.  
In 2021, we invested $300 million in research, development and engineering or approximately 5.5% of sales. This level of investment was up 22% over 2021. One way we measure the success of new product development efforts is through our vitality index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past 3 years. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index was a very strong 25%.  
These investments are driving outstanding innovation, including a growing number of important solutions in support of our customers' sustainability initiatives. We're supporting the development and expansion of renewable energy solutions, providing important technologies used to monitor, measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, assisting scientists and the understanding of the impacts of climate change and supporting the development and testing of electric vehicles, to name just a few of the important applications AMETEK plays a key role in supporting.  
We are expanding our research, development and engineering investments and expect to invest approximately $340 million or 5.5% of sales in RD&E in 2022. This is a 13% increase over 2021 RD&E spend.  
We are also deploying our capital and strategic acquisitions, adding to our portfolio of market-leading industrial technology businesses and driving excellent returns for our shareholders. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of 6 businesses. Our latest acquisition, Alphasense, was completed in the fourth quarter.  
Alphasense develops and manufactures gas and particulate sensors for use in environmental, health and safety and air quality applications. Their sensors are used in both fixed and portable systems to detect a variety of gases, including oxygen, volatile organic compounds and harmful toxic gases. 
Alphasense's sensor projects and technologies are highly complementary with our MOCON business and provide our sensor offering serving -- and broaden our sensor offering, serving critical health, safety and environmental applications. Alphasense is based in Essex, U.K. and has annual sales of approximately $30 million.  
Our acquisition pipeline remains active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, and we expect to remain very busy in 2022.  
As our results reflect, our businesses are doing an excellent job managing the ongoing operational challenges caused by the pandemic. AMETEK's flexible, agile operating structure, including our global supply chain capabilities, provide us the ability to quickly adjust and react to challenges.  
These supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing given our differentiated product offering. Overall, the operating environment remains similar to what we experienced during the third quarter with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components, along with logistics and labor availability issues. We remain focused in the short term on managing our supply chain and ensuring we can safely operate our factories while also continuing to drive long-term operational excellence initiatives across our businesses.  
Moving to our outlook for 2022. We remain cautious in the short term, given ongoing COVID-19 and supply chain challenges. However, we are confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid- to high single digits versus 2021.  
Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.42, up 9% to 12% compared to 2021. For the first quarter, overall sales are expected to be up approximately 20% compared to the same period last year, and first quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.28 per diluted share up 16% to 20% versus the prior year.  
In summary, I would like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts this past year. AMETEK's fourth quarter and full year results were excellent and reflective of the resilience and strength of our workforce and the AMETEK growth model. Our strong orders and record backlog position us nicely for 2022, and we look forward to the new year and continuing to build on the momentum gained in 2021.  
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2021 with outstanding operating performance, leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2022.  
Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $23.7 million, up $6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $19 million, also driven largely by higher compensation costs. For 2022, general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales.  
The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% down from 20.1% in the fourth quarter 2020. This lower tax rate was due to return to provision adjustments. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate.  
Working capital in the quarter was excellent at 15.2% of sales. This reflects the strong work from our teams in managing working capital. We have also strategically added inventory in certain areas to help address the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain.  
Capital expenditures were $43 million in the fourth quarter and $111 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2022 are expected to be approximately $125 million or about 2% of sales.  
Depreciation amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million and for the full year was $292 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share.  
We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. Operating cash flow was $282 million in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion for the full year. Free cash flow was $238 million in the quarter and $1.05 billion or 106% of net income for the full year. Total debt at the year-end was $2.54 billion up only $131 million from the end of 2020 despite having deployed approximately $2 billion on acquisitions in 2021.  
Despite the record level of capital deployment, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 1.8x at the end of 2020 to 1.5x at the end of 2021, a testament to the strength of our operating model. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $347 million. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.  
In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2022 remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and our world-class workforce. Kevin?"

I mean everything that you said is true, and we're experiencing the same challenges as everyone is with supply chain, logistics, labor availability.

I mean everything that you said is true, and we're experiencing the same challenges as everyone is with supply chain, logistics, labor availability. And the Omicron variant certainly added a lot fourth quarter and Q1.  
But our overall response to these challenges has been outstanding. And I think the first point is our distributed business model, where we have committed P&L managers running their business units with their own supply chain teams, which allows them to react quickly to changing conditions. And at the same time, we have these business teams, we have a corporate centralized supply chain team that acts with all the combined leverage in the forte of AMETEK. And these teams work seamlessly together, and this overall approach has been extremely effective for us.  
As I mentioned, in the last quarter and this quarter, it's directly what you said, semiconductor chip availability, we have a lot of shortages, but that's the biggest area. And that's the one that's the most challenging. And we're going after that a few ways. I mean we're using our leverage of AMETEK. We have relationships built up over a long period of time with the supply base. 
Our engineering capability is second to none, and we use it to qualify second sources, find alternatives, new redesigns. And we've also taken a team of people across the company. Some of them are based on our Bangalore engineering office. Some of them are based in Germany. Some of them are based in the U.S., and that team is available to quickly help our business units for shortages and find alternatives, and that's working quite well.  
So we don't really improve -- anticipate improvements in availability of semiconductor chips until the second half of '22 at the earliest, and it's certainly a challenge. But I think we've had an effective response to it for the reasons that I just mentioned."

I'll start with the Process business. the process overall sales were up 20% -- low 20% in the quarter driven by strong organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisitions of Magnetrol and Alphasense, Organic sales were up high teens for process. Our Materials Analysis businesses showed the strongest growth. They were driven by, as I said in my prepared remarks, like Gatan and CAMECA. The businesses have leading positions providing high-end instrumentation into life sciences and semiconductor markets. And looking ahead for Process, we expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up mid- to high single digits for the full year.  
Now I'll switch to Aerospace. Overall sales for Aerospace and Defense businesses were up over 40% in the fourth quarter, driven by the acquisition of Abaco and mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Our commercial businesses led to growth in the quarter driven by strong aftermarket and business jet growth, while our defense businesses were down slightly in the quarter due to some shipment delays, it still had another strong year.  
Shifting to 2020. While we remain cautious about the patient the commercial aerospace recovery, we're still well positioned to benefit from the recovery, given our attractive positions in a diverse set of commercial and business jet platforms. So for '22, we expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Aerospace & Defense businesses with both defense and commercial expected to be up mid-single digits.  
And I go to our Power & Industrial market segment next. Overall sales for Power & Industrial were up over 25% in the fourth quarter and a very good fourth quarter, driven by mid-teens organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisition of NSI-MI. And for all of '22, we expect Power & Industrial to be up mid-single digits with similar growth across our Power & Industrial segments.  
And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Both overall and organic growth for Automation & Engineered Solutions were up low 20% in the quarter. Automation businesses delivered outstanding growth in the quarter and full year with continued solid demand across their end markets. And in 2022, we expect organic sales for Automation & Engineered Solutions to be up mid- to high single digits with similar growth across our Automation & Engineered Solutions. So if you look at the big picture, our Process and Automation & Engineered Solutions, market segments are going to be up mid- to high single digits. And Aerospace and Power & Industrial will be up mid-single digits."

So I think the last 2 weeks, we were down a bit, and we had the highest level of infections prior to that. So it's clearly the same things that are happening outside of AMETEK are happening inside of AMETEK, but we're doing a pretty good job of managing through it. But it does cause absenteeism and it does cause labor availability and it's a challenge every day when something changes to manage through that.  
So that's clearly -- that's part of the issue we're dealing with Q1. And our guide range is a little bit broader because of that. And -- but our people are doing a fantastic job. When you talk about the long-term and runway and automation and semiconductors, we're seeing that. And if you think -- I talked a little about the automation market and how we've done past acquisitions to acquire pieces of the automation, motion control, subassemblies that we've now put together, and we're very capable of quickly develop custom designs for our customers. We're kind of unique in that capability, and we're winning a lot there. And I think that's going to continue.  
And when you look at the semiconductor market, really solid growth in Q4, but it's continuing. And we're competing in 2 parts of that market. We work in the research market. And I mentioned our CAMECA business did very well. That business is benefiting from the research side of semiconductors. And then you got some new technology that are going into the ramp in chip production. And some of the new technology uses something called EUV optics and our Zygo business is an expert in that and there's only a couple of people in the world that are an expert in that. So we're benefiting from the transition to EUV optics in the semiconductor industry, and that trend is just getting started.  
So I'm not saying there's going to be some ups and downs as we go forward, but we're really well positioned in both automation and semiconductors as we look forward."

Your point is a good one. The reaction to COVID is handled differently in parts of the world. So you can have -- semiconductor plants are being shut down or blocking access to certain countries at times, and we've been managing through that at the start of the pandemic. But in particular, you asked about China, and we were up 2% in China, very solid because we had a really strong comparison, and we had a really strong year.

I think with our budget and increases sequentially each quarter, which is typical of an AMETEK budget, but we're seeing strong growth in Q1. So your point's taken. 
When I look at our budget, just based on simple economics, we've guided to be up about 10%, and that's about $500 million. And if you apply a 30% to 35% contribution margin on that increase. You'll get a number that's in the range of the guidance that we gave you.  
Now in that number, there's a lot of new investments. There's cost savings. There's acquisitions that we did last year. There are some headwinds with below-the-line type things, taxes, shares, a little bit higher interest cost. But when you bake the cake and you put it all together, it's a pretty simple picture.  
Sales are up 10%. That's about $500 million, and we're going to get a 30% to 35% contribution margin on. So it's pretty clear from that perspective."

AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the first quarter, with strong sales growth and excellent operating performance, driving robust core margin expansion and earnings which exceeded our expectations. We are also seeing continued strong demand. This demand remains broad-based across our diverse set of niche markets, leading to outstanding orders growth and a record backlog. I'm very proud of the way our teams are managing a challenging and uncertain macro environment. AMETEK's flexible operating model allows our businesses to quickly adjust and adapt to changing economic conditions and deliver exceptional results. 
Before I provide more details on the results for the quarter, I wanted to comment on the ongoing geopolitical events in Ukraine. We are deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine. Our hearts and thoughts with all those affected. To assist with the immediate needs of this mass humanitarian crisis, the AMETEK Foundation has made donations to several charities that are actively providing food, shelter and medical supplies to those impacted. Additionally, many AMETEK colleagues in our businesses have mobilized to help in whatever way they can through donations to charities supporting the crisis. Thank you to all employees who are supporting those in need. 
Now let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.46 billion, up 20% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 14%. Acquisitions added 7 points, and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind in the quarter. Overall orders in the first quarter were $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up 18% in the quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.17 in the first quarter, reflecting continued robust and broad-based demand. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3 billion, up approximately $1.2 billion from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was $353 million, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.2% in the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins were 25.5%, up an impressive 140 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, with strong core margin expansion in each operating group. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating capability and the great work of our teams in managing inflationary and supply chain impacts across our business. 
EBITDA in the first quarter was $434 million, up 22% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 29.7%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.33 per diluted share, up 24% versus the first quarter of 2021, and above our guidance range of $1.24 to $1.28. 
Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $987.8 million, up 25% from last year's first quarter. Organic sales were up 15% in the quarter, while recent acquisitions contributed 11% and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. Organic growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies division, with Creaform record technologies and TMC Precitech businesses leading to growth. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $244.8 million, up 18% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter. EIG's core margins were up a very strong 130 basis points over the prior year to 27.5%. The Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter with excellent organic sales growth driven by broad-based demand and strong operating performance. EMG's first quarter sales increased 11% versus the prior year to $470.8 million. Organic sales growth was 12%, and foreign currency a 1 point headwind. Demand within our automation businesses remains excellent, reflecting AMETEK's highly differentiated motion control capabilities and leadership positions within our niche applications. EMG's operating income in the first quarter was a record $128.2 million, up 22% to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 250 basis points to 27.2%, which includes an approximate $7 million gain on the sale of the facility in the quarter. On a core basis, excluding this gain, EMG margins were up a very strong 100 basis points versus last year's first quarter. 
Our teams continue to deliver outstanding performance in a very challenging and dynamic operational environment. In addition to ensuring we successfully navigate the current macro environment, we are focused on ensuring AMETEK is positioned for long-term success and sustainable growth by making investments in our organic growth initiatives. 
In 2022, we expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives including strong growth across our research, development and engineering groups. AMETEK's leadership positions in our niche markets are driven by deep industry expertise and the differentiation of our technology. Our research and engineering teams do a wonderful job developing innovative next-generation products and technologies to support their customers' applications. 
For the full year, we now expect to invest more than $345 million or over 5.5% of sales in RD&E. Our Vitality Index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past 3 years, was a very strong 26% in the first quarter. 
One way we recognize and celebrate the great work of our businesses' new product development efforts is through the AMETEK Innovation Award. This award provided annually to the AMETEK businesses who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded growth opportunity. The most recent innovation award winner was our Used Trailer Rotron business unit, a leading provider of advanced thermal management systems for use and support of critical aerospace, defense, industrial and commercial applications. Utilizing various elements of the AMETEK new product development process, the team developed a highly innovative heat exchanger that provides meaningful improvements in aircraft engine performance versus the incumbent technologies. This new product will deliver strong incremental sales for AMETEK, while providing important sustainability benefits to the reduction of approximately 1 million tons of carbon dioxide over a 10-year period due to a advance more thermally and aerodynamically efficient design of the heat-exchanger. Driving such benefits aligned with AMETEK's core value of social responsibility by using innovative solutions to help our customers create a more sustainable future. Congratulations to the Used Trailer Rotron team and all the AMETEK colleagues contributing to the development of outstanding new products and technologies. 
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of 6 businesses. Those businesses are integrating nicely, and we expect contributions from the acquisitions in the coming years as they further implement key elements of the AMETEK growth model. Our acquisition pipelines remain strong, and our M&A teams remain busy in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. We have ample balance sheet capacity and strong cash flows to support our acquisition strategy, and expect to remain active over the coming quarters. 
Now let me touch on the supply chain issues. Overall, the global supply chain and logistics channels remain tight and unreliable. The supply chain and logistics environment in the first quarter was similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter, with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components. These issues are leading to higher inflation, but given our product differentiation, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread and outstanding margin expansion.
Now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we are bullish on the future, we remain cautious in the short term given uncertainty related to the supply chain challenges, the war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in China. However, given the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage these ongoing headwinds. Additionally, our record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid- and long-cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth. For the full year, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be up mid- to high single digits. While overall sales growth are expected to be up high single digits, down slightly versus our prior guidance given increased foreign currency headwinds. Given our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44, up 10% to 12% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.30 to $5.42 per diluted share. 
While confident in our increased outlook for the year, the COVID-19 lockdowns throughout China are expected to shift some sales from the second quarter into the second half. For the second quarter, overall sales are expected to be up low to mid-single digits compared to the same period last year and second quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.30 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% versus the prior year. 
To summarize, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter, with solid orders and sales growth strong margin expansion and a high quality of earnings, allowing us to increase our earnings guidance for the year. These outstanding results speak to the strength of the AMETEK growth model, along with the resilience of our world-class workforce. Our differentiated technology solutions and market-leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through these difficult economic cycles. While we expect these challenges will continue throughout '22, we remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. 
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results to start the year, highlighted by strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. I'll provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. 
First quarter general and administrative expenses were $19.7 million, up $1 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expenses in the quarter. For 2022, general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels, and approximately 1.5% of sales. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated grade. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $26 million. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million, or approximately 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share. 
For the quarter, working capital was 17.1% of sales. Operating cash flow was $201 million, and free cash flow was $175 million. Our first quarter working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and as a hedge against longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. While this investment resulted in lower cash flows and free cash flow conversion in the first quarter, we continue to expect a strong 110% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $152 million. Total debt ended the first quarter at $2.54 billion, unchanged from the end of 2021, and offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of about $340 million. The end of the first quarter, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.5x, and the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3. 
We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities at March 31 to support our growth initiatives. As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions, as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. 
In summary, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter, delivering strong earnings growth in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges while continuing to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin?"

We have about 9% of our sales are out of China, and we've been successful running a profitable growing operation there for many years. We have tremendous customer base, improving manufacturing processes, making the environment cleaner, improving research and development capabilities, and that's going to continue. But right now, several of our major facilities are in the Shanghai area and they're in a lockdown situation, either not operating or operating in a significantly reduced capacity. And that's impacting a lot of our business. And our best assessment of what we know right now is about a half of our China sales will be impacted in the quarter. So that's about 4% or 5% of our sales are $65 million or $70 million. So if you take that out of the guide, you'll see that the balance of AMETEK is going up in Q2. So it's really the fact that -- of lower business activities in China because of a lockdown situations, and because of our proximity to Shanghai in some of our major operations. Now those sales are just going to be delayed. They're going to get delayed from the second quarter to the second half of the year. And so we have to get through the lockdown in Q2."

I'll take you through the major markets first. Our process business were up 20% in the quarter. Strong demand, organic sales growth, contribution from the acquisitions of Magnetrol and Alphasense, so organic sales for Process were up mid-teens in the quarter. Growth, broad-based. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the Ultra Precision Technologies business really saw excellent growth in the quarter. End market demand remains strong. All key end markets, including semiconductor research and medical are very strong. Additionally, we're seeing increased demand for our solutions serving sustainability initiatives, with our instrumentation being used to reduce harmful emissions and process -- improved process efficiency. So for -- look at process, our biggest segment for all of 2022, we continue to expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up mid- to high single digits. 
Next, our Aerospace business. Our Aerospace business was organically up low single digits in the quarter, up in the mid-20s range for the first quarter in overall sales. In the quarter, we saw a strength in commercial aerospace being partially offset by delays in defense shipments caused by U.S. government spending. So our commercial side of that business was up low double digits, and our defense side of that business was down mid-single digits. And for the full year, we expect to be up mid-single digits with commercial up high single digits and defense up low single digits for Aerospace. 
Next, Power & Industrial. Overall sales were also up in the mid-20s, so good quarter at Power & Industrial. We had mid-teens organic sales growth and the contributions from our acquisition of NSI-MI. So strong balanced sales growth across both Power & Industrial, and we expect organic sales for our Power & Industrial businesses to be up mid-single digits with similar growth across both segments. 
And then finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Both overall and organic sales for Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the quarter, with solid demand continuing across our end markets. For the full year, we expect -- we continue to expect organic sales to be up for our Automation & Engineered Solutions business up mid- to high single digits with similar growth across each business. So strong performance across the entire business. I'll talk about the geography you asked that question too, strong broad-based growth across all geographies. mid-teens in Europe, U.S. and Asia. China, we were up 10% on an as-reported basis. So good quarter there also. So when you look across the globe, there's really not a blemish in terms of growth. So we're feeling good about that also. With our orders, we think there's strong road ahead."

And actually, we don't have hedging strategy, because we're naturally hedged. So pretty much across the board. We spent a lot of time, and this is about 10-year worth of time. It's a long period of time. We're naturally hedged in each of our locations that we operate. So our revenues and expenses naturally offset. And to give you an example, in this quarter where you had a strong dollar and it was some currency implementations, it did impact our top line. But our bottom line across the whole enterprise, it was less than a $0.01 impact on earnings. So we've got this natural hedging strategy. And through the past 10 years, you can go back and look at it, it works very well. We are a U.S. exporter, but we got the pricing leveraged through our differentiated technology. So a strong dollar is not usually an insurmountable win for us."

We ar",1611,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the first quarter, with strong sales growth and excellent operating performance, driving robust core margin expansion and earnings which exceeded our expectations. We are also seeing continued strong demand. This demand remains broad-based across our diverse set of niche markets, leading to outstanding orders growth and a record backlog. I'm very proud of the way our teams are managing a challenging and uncertain macro environment. AMETEK's flexible operating model allows our businesses to quickly adjust and adapt to changing economic conditions and deliver exceptional results. 
Before I provide more details on the results for the quarter, I wanted to comment on the ongoing geopolitical events in Ukraine. We are deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine. Our hearts and thoughts are with all those affected. To assist with the immediate needs of this mass humanitarian crisis, the AMETEK Foundation has made donations to several charities that are actively providing food, shelter and medical supplies to those impacted. Additionally, many AMETEK colleagues in our businesses have mobilized to help in whatever way they can through donations to charities supporting the crisis. Thank you to all employees who are supporting those in need. 
Now let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.46 billion, up 20% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 14%. Acquisitions added 7 points, and foreign currency was a 1-point headwind in the quarter. Overall, orders in the first quarter were $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year period while organic orders were up 18% in the quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.17 in the first quarter, reflecting continued robust and broad-based demand. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3 billion, up approximately $1.2 billion from the end of 2020. 
Operating income in the quarter was $353 million, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.2% in the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins were 25.5%, up an impressive 140 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, with strong core margin expansion in each operating group. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating capability and the great work of our teams in managing inflationary and supply chain impacts across our business. 
EBITDA in the first quarter was $434 million, up 22% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 29.7%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.33 per diluted share, up 24% versus the first quarter of 2021, and above our guidance range of $1.24 to $1.28. 
Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $987.8 million, up 25% from last year's first quarter. Organic sales were up 15% in the quarter while recent acquisitions contributed 11% and foreign currency was a 1-point headwind. Organic growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies division, with Creaform record technologies and TMC Precitech businesses leading to growth. 
EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $244.8 million, up 18% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter. EIG's core margins were up a very strong 130 basis points over the prior year to 27.5%. 
The Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter, with excellent organic sales growth driven by broad-based demand and strong operating performance. EMG's first quarter sales increased 11% versus the prior year to $470.8 million. Organic sales growth was 12%, and foreign currency, a 1-point headwind. Demand within our automation businesses remains excellent, reflecting AMETEK's highly differentiated motion control capabilities and leadership positions within our niche applications. 
EMG's operating income in the first quarter was a record $128.2 million, up 22% to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 250 basis points to 27.2%, which includes an approximate $7 million gain on the sale of a facility in the quarter. On a core basis, excluding this gain, EMG margins were up a very strong 100 basis points versus last year's first quarter. 
Our teams continue to deliver outstanding performance in a very challenging and dynamic operational environment. In addition to ensuring we successfully navigate the current macro environment, we are focused on ensuring AMETEK is positioned for long-term success and sustainable growth by making investments in our organic growth initiatives. 
In 2022, we expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives, including strong growth across our research, development and engineering groups. AMETEK's leadership positions in our niche markets are driven by deep industry expertise and the differentiation of our technology. Our research and engineering teams do a wonderful job developing innovative, next-generation products and technologies to support their customers' applications. 
For the full year, we now expect to invest more than $345 million or over 5.5% of sales in RD&E. Our Vitality Index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past 3 years, was a very strong 26% in the first quarter. 
One way we recognize and celebrate the great work of our businesses' new product development efforts is through the AMETEK innovation award, this award provided annually to the AMETEK businesses who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded growth opportunity. The most recent innovation award winner was our used trailer Rotron business unit, a leading provider of advanced thermal management systems for use and support of critical aerospace, defense, industrial and commercial applications. 
Utilizing various elements of the AMETEK new product development process, the team developed a highly innovative heat exchanger that provides meaningful improvements in aircraft engine performance versus the incumbent technologies. This new product will deliver strong incremental sales for AMETEK while providing important sustainability benefits to the reduction of approximately 1 million [ tonnes ] of carbon dioxide over a 10-year period due to an advanced, more thermally and aerodynamically efficient design of the heat exchanger. 
Driving such benefits aligned with AMETEK's core value of social responsibility by using innovative solutions to help our customers create a more sustainable future. Congratulations to the used trailer Rotron team and all the AMETEK colleagues contributing to the development of outstanding new products and technologies. 
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of 6 businesses. Those businesses are integrating nicely, and we expect contributions from the acquisitions in the coming years as they further implement key elements of the AMETEK Growth Model. Our acquisition pipelines remain strong, and our M&A teams remain busy in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. We have ample balance sheet capacity and strong cash flows to support our acquisition strategy and expect to remain active over the coming quarters. 
Now let me touch on the supply chain issues. Overall, the global supply chain and logistics channels remain tight and unreliable. The supply chain and logistics environment in the first quarter was similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter, with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components. These issues are leading to higher inflation, but given our product differentiation, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread and outstanding margin expansion. 
Now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we are bullish on the future, we remain cautious in the short term given uncertainty related to the supply chain challenges, the war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in China. However, given the strength of the AMETEK Growth Model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage these ongoing headwinds. Additionally, our record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid- and long-cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth. 
For the full year, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be up mid- to high single digits while overall sales growth are expected to be up high single digits, down slightly versus our prior guidance given increased foreign currency headwinds. Given our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44, up 10% to 12% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.30 to $5.42 per diluted share. 
While confident in our increased outlook for the year, the COVID-19 lockdowns throughout China are expected to shift some sales from the second quarter into the second half. For the second quarter, overall sales are expected to be up low to mid-single digits compared to the same period last year, and second quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.30 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% versus the prior year. 
To summarize, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter, with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion and a high quality of earnings, allowing us to increase our earnings guidance for the year. These outstanding results speak to the strength of the AMETEK Growth Model, along with the resilience of our world-class workforce. Our differentiated technology solutions and market-leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through these difficult economic cycles. While we expect these challenges will continue throughout '22, we remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. 
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results to start the year, highlighted by strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. I'll provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. 
First quarter general and administrative expenses were $19.7 million, up $1 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expenses in the quarter. For 2022, general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated grade. 
Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $26 million. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million or approximately 2% of sales. 
Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share. 
For the quarter, operating working capital was 17.1% of sales. Operating cash flow was $201 million, and free cash flow was $175 million. Our first quarter working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and as a hedge against longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. While this investment resulted in lower cash flows and free cash flow conversion in the first quarter, we continue to expect a strong 110% free cash flow-to-net income conversion for the full year. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $152 million. Total debt ended the first quarter at $2.54 billion, unchanged from the end of 2021, and offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of about $340 million. The end of the first quarter, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.5x, and the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3. 
We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility, with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities at March 31 to support our growth initiatives. As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. 
In summary, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter, delivering strong earnings growth in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges while continuing to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives.

We have about 9% of our sales are out of China, and we've been successfully running a profitable growing operation there for many years. We have tremendous customer base, improving manufacturing processes, making the environment cleaner, improving research and development capabilities, and that's going to continue. But right now, several of our major facilities are in the Shanghai area, and they're in a lockdown situation, either not operating or operating in a significantly reduced capacity. And that's impacting a lot of our business. 
And our best assessment of what we know right now is about a half of our China sales will be impacted in the quarter. So that's about 4% or 5% of our sales or $65 million or $70 million. So if you take that out of the guide, you'll see that the balance of AMETEK is going up in Q2. So it's really the fact that -- of lower business activities in China because of the lockdown situations and because of our proximity to Shanghai in some of our major operations. Now those sales are just going to be delayed. They're going to get delayed from the second quarter to the second half of the year. And so we have to get through the lockdown in Q2."

I'll take you through the major markets first. 
Our Process businesses were up 20% in the quarter. Strong demand, organic sales growth, contribution from the acquisitions of Magnetrol and Alphasense, so organic sales for Process were up mid-teens in the quarter. Growth, broad-based. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the Ultra Precision Technologies business really saw excellent growth in the quarter. End market demand remains strong. All key end markets, including semiconductor research and medical are very strong. Additionally, we're seeing increased demand for our solutions-serving sustainability initiatives, with our instrumentation being used to reduce harmful emissions and process -- improve process efficiency. So for -- look at process, our biggest segment for all of 2022, we continue to expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up mid- to high single digits. 
Next, our Aerospace business. Our Aerospace business was organically up low single digits in the quarter, up in the mid-20s range for the first quarter in overall sales. In the quarter, we saw a strength in commercial aerospace being partially offset by delays in defense shipments caused by U.S. government spending. So our commercial side of that business was up low double digits, and our defense side of that business was down mid-single digits. And for the full year, we expect to be up mid-single digits, with commercial up high single digits and defense up low single digits for Aerospace. 
Next, Power & Industrial. Overall sales were also up in the mid-20s, so good quarter at Power & Industrial. We had mid-teens organic sales growth and the contributions from our acquisition of NSI-MI. So strong balanced sales growth across both Power & Industrial, and we expect organic sales for our Power & Industrial businesses to be up mid-single digits, with similar growth across both segments. 
And then finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Both overall and organic sales for Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the quarter, with solid demand continuing across our end markets. For the full year, we expect -- we continue to expect organic sales to be up for our Automation & Engineered Solutions business, up mid- to high single digits, with similar growth across each business. So strong performance across the entire business. 
I'll talk about the geography. You asked that question, too. Strong broad-based growth across all geographies, up mid-teens in Europe, U.S. and Asia. China, we were up 10% on an as-reported basis. So good quarter there also. So when you look across the globe, there's really not a blemish in terms of growth. So we're feeling good about that also. With our orders, we think there's strong growth ahead."

The second point is our hedging strategy. And actually, we don't have hedging strategy because we're naturally hedged. So pretty much across the board, we spent a lot of time, and this is about 10 years' worth of time. It's a long period of time. We're naturally hedged in each of our locations that we operate. So our revenues and expenses naturally offset. And to give you an example, in this quarter where you had a strong dollar and it was some currency implementations, it did impact our top line. But our bottom line across the whole enterprise, it was less than a $0.01 impact on earnings. So we've got this natural hedging strategy.

AMETEK had another excellent quarter, with stronger-than-expected organic sales growth, outstanding operating performance, robust margin expansion and record earnings. Importantly, demand remains strong and",1423,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. 
AMETEK had another excellent quarter, with stronger-than-expected organic sales growth, outstanding operating performance, robust margin expansion and record earnings. Importantly, demand remains strong and broad-based across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record $3.1 billion backlog. Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2022, we have increased our earnings guidance for the year. 
Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were a record $1.51 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 12%. Acquisitions added a point and foreign currency was a 3-point headwind in the quarter. Organic orders were up a very strong 11%, despite a highly challenging prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.09 in the second quarter, our eighth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. 
Operating income in the quarter was a record $365 million, a 15% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.1% in the quarter, up 130 basis points from the prior year with strong incremental margins. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $444 million, about 15% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 29.3%. 
This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up 20% versus the second quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30, driven by stronger-than-expected sales and excellent operating performance. 
Now let provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.03 billion, up 10% from last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 12% in the quarter, with foreign currency headwinds more than offsetting acquisition contributions. 
Organic growth remains very strong across our EIG businesses with particularly impressive growth across our Ultra Precision Technologies and P&I division. EIG's operating performance was impressive, resulting in record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $265.1 million, up 70% versus the prior year and operating income margins were 25.8% in the quarter. 
The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $486.3 million, up 7% versus the prior year with organic sales growing 11% in the quarter. EMG's growth was also broad-based, with strong growth across both our EMIP and automation businesses. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was $124.4 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second quarter operating margins were excellent at 25.6%, up 70 basis points versus the prior year. 
Overall, outstanding results in the quarter, reflecting the quality of our differentiated businesses, the strength of our operating model and the tremendous efforts of our employees. I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your commitment to AMETEK and for the many important contributions you make to our sustained success. 
Now let me touch on the supply chain. Overall, the global supply chain remains constrained, with the largest challenging -- challenges continuing to be the availability of electronic components. As we noted previously, we have strategically decided to hold additional inventory of select components to support the strong customer demand and as a hedge against the tight supply chain. 
Additionally, AMETEK's global sourcing teams are doing an outstanding job working to identify additional sources of supply. While these supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation, we have been able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread again this quarter and outstanding margin expense. 
The combination of our global supply chain capabilities and pricing power provides us the confidence in our ability to manage through these uncertain times. During our first quarter earnings call, we noted that the COVID-driven lockdowns across parts of China were expected to delay some China sales from the second quarter into the second half of the year. These lockdowns caused less impact on the business in the quarter than we anticipated. 
Due to the excellent efforts of our China team, we were able to operate in a closed loop system and adjust our logistics and supply chain networks to support production and shipments. Additionally, during the last 2 weeks of the quarter, as restrictions were lifted, we were able to resumed multi-ship production and recover much of the delayed shipments. 
The impact of China's zero-COVID policy is something we are closely watching as we need to react and adjust in the future. Thank you to our entire team in China for your tremendous commitment and resilience during this time. 
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. Our top priority for capital allocation remains the value-enhancing strategic acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline is very strong. Our business unit and corporate development teams are busy managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. 
As Bill will highlight in a moment, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow providing us with meaningful capacity to support our acquisition strategy, and we expect to be active in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on driving higher levels of organic growth by consistently investing in our businesses to support their strategic growth initiatives. We're seeing the benefits of these investments in stronger organic growth. Our investments in research, development and engineering continues to yield advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. 
One measure of the success of these efforts is our Vitality Index, which was a very strong 26% of sales in the second quarter. This level of vitality reflects our business' ability to develop new products aligned with compelling growth opportunities. 
One example of this is AMETEK's expansion into the high-growth areas of Precision Optics. AMETEK's Zygo business, based in Middlefield, Connecticut, provides leading-edge extreme precision optics for the design and protection of very large complicated aspheric lenses. These capabilities supported the manufacture of 18 hexagonal-shaped mirrors, which make up the James Webb Space Telescope's primary mirror. 
The James Webb Telescope very recently produced the deepest and sharpest infrared images of the deep universe. Truly amazing images due in part to Zygo's capability. Zygo also provides advanced optical systems for use in the next generation of semiconductor production equipment. 
Their incredibly precised mirrors are playing an important role in supporting the development of EUV, or extreme ultraviolet optics, for the next generation of semiconductor technologies. Just 2 of the many examples across AMETEK of the unique and highly differentiated capabilities and technologies we provide our customers. 
Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the second quarter, continued solid order momentum and record backlog, we have increased our full year earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up high single digits, with organic sales now also expected to be up high single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid- to high single digits. 
Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.46 to $5.54, up 13% to 14% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.34 to $5.44 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we expect overall sales to be up in the high single digits compared to the same period last year, and third quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.38 per diluted share, up 8% to 10% versus the prior year. 
While we are closely monitoring the various macroeconomic headwinds, we are not seeing slowing in our businesses as demand remains solid and our businesses are operating level. We are confident in our ability and improved outlook for the year, given our strong backlog, ability to offset inflation with price increases and outstanding operating capability. 
In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses are well positioned with differentiated technology solutions serving a diverse set of growing niche markets. Our organic growth initiatives are driving higher levels of growth, and our portfolio is aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets. 
Additionally, our asset-light business model and strong cash flow provides us the flexibility to navigate challenging environments, while continuing to deploy capital and drive increased shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the second quarter led by strong sales and orders growth and tremendous operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter gene",542,"Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the second quarter led by strong sales and orders growth and tremendous operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. 
Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million, up $2 million from the prior year. And as a percentage of total sales was 1.6%, in line with the second quarter of 2021. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. 
The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 15.5%, down from 20.6% in the second quarter of 2021. The lower rate this quarter was driven by lower tax on foreign income. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. 
Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million for the full year, or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $77 million. And for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $315 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share. 
For the quarter, operating working capital was 18% of sales. Operating cash flow was $236 million and free cash flow was $210 million in the second quarter. We expect approximately 100% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year. Our working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add select inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and to hedge against the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.44 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $173 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares, for a total of $330 million. 
As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. Total debt ended the second quarter at $2.5 billion, down slightly from the $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $349 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2x. 
As Dave noted, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2024, modest levels of leverage and strong cash flows. As a result, we are well positioned to deploy meaningful capital investment in our acquisition strategy with approximately $2.3 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. 
To conclude, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, delivering strong sales growth, outstanding operating performance and a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned going into the back half of the year, and we'll continue to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin?"

We're looking for -- to leverage our spend more and develop closer relationships with both the semiconductor chip manufacturers and the distributors for that matter. So it will be a little bit of a change in that area. That's one thing I can put to. We're being more direct as opposed to relying on distribution. 
But fundamentally, it's navigating through this as we did, dealing with these challenges, we've had excellent results. And it's -- as I said, key from my view is our distributed business model.

AMETEK had another excellent quarter, with stronger-than-expected organic sales growth, outstanding operating performance, robust margin expansion and record earnings.

AMETEK had another excellent quarter, with stronger-than-expected organic sales growth, outstanding operating performance, robust margin expansion and record earnings. Importantly, demand remains strong and broad-based across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record $3.1 billion backlog.  
Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2022, we have increased our earnings guidance for the year.  
Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were a record $1.51 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 12%. Acquisitions added a point and foreign currency was a 3-point headwind in the quarter. Organic orders were up a very strong 11% despite a highly challenging prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.09 in the second quarter, our eighth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill.  
Operating income in the quarter was a record $365 million, a 15% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.1% in the quarter, up 130 basis points from the prior year with strong incremental margins. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $444 million, about 15% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 29.3%.  
This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up 20% versus the second quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30, driven by stronger-than-expected sales and excellent operating performance.  
Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.03 billion, up 10% from last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 12% in the quarter, with foreign currency headwinds more than offsetting acquisition contributions.  
Organic growth remains very strong across our EIG businesses with particularly impressive growth across our Ultra Precision Technologies and P&AI division. EIG's operating performance was impressive, resulting in record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter.  
Second quarter operating income was $265.1 million, up 17% versus the prior year and operating income margins were 25.8% in the quarter.  
The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $486.3 million, up 7% versus the prior year with organic sales growing 11% in the quarter. EMG's growth was also broad-based, with strong growth across both our EMIP and Automation businesses. 
EMG's operating income in the second quarter was $124.4 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second quarter operating margins were excellent at 25.6%, up 70 basis points versus the prior year.  
Overall, outstanding results in the quarter, reflecting the quality of our differentiated businesses, the strength of our operating model and the tremendous efforts of our employees. I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your commitment to AMETEK and for the many important contributions you make to our sustained success.  
Now let me touch on the supply chain. Overall, the global supply chain remains constrained, with the largest challenging -- challenges continuing to be the availability of electronic components. As we noted previously, we have strategically decided to hold additional inventory of select components to support the strong customer demand and as a hedge against the tight supply chain. Additionally, AMETEK's global sourcing teams are doing an outstanding job working to identify additional sources of supply. 
While these supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation, we have been able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread again this quarter and outstanding margin trends.  
The combination of our global supply chain capabilities and pricing power provides us the confidence in our ability to manage through these uncertain times. During our first quarter earnings call, we noted that the COVID-driven lockdowns across parts of China were expected to delay some China sales from the second quarter into the second half of the year. These lockdowns caused less impact on the business in the quarter than we anticipated.  
Due to the excellent efforts of our China team, we were able to operate in a closed loop system and adjust our logistics and supply chain networks to support production and shipments. Additionally, during the last 2 weeks of the quarter, as restrictions were lifted, we were able to resume multi-ship production and recover much of the delayed shipments.  
The impact of China's zero-COVID policy is something we are closely watching as we will need to react and adjust in the future. Thank you to our entire team in China for your tremendous commitment and resilience during this time.  
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. Our top priority for capital allocation remains the value-enhancing strategic acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline is very strong. Our business unit and corporate development teams are busy managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates.  
As Bill will highlight in a moment, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow providing us with meaningful capacity to support our acquisition strategy, and we expect to be active in the second half of the year. 
We also remain focused on driving higher levels of organic growth by consistently investing in our businesses to support their strategic growth initiatives. We're seeing the benefits of these investments in stronger organic growth. Our investments in research, development and engineering continues to yield advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets.  
One measure of the success of these efforts is our Vitality Index, which was a very strong 26% of sales in the second quarter. This level of vitality reflects our business' ability to develop new products aligned with compelling growth opportunities.  
One example of this is AMETEK's expansion into the high-growth areas of precision optics. AMETEK's Zygo business, based in Middlefield, Connecticut, provides leading-edge extreme precision optics for the design and protection of very large complicated aspheric lenses. These capabilities supported the manufacture of the 18 hexagonal-shaped mirrors, which make up the James Webb Space Telescope's primary mirror. The James Webb Telescope very recently produced the deepest and sharpest infrared images of the deep universe. Truly amazing images due in part to Zygo's capability. 
Zygo also provides advanced optical systems for use in the next generation of semiconductor production equipment. Their incredibly precised mirrors are playing an important role in supporting the development of EUV, or extreme ultraviolet optics, for the next generation of semiconductor technologies. Just two of the many examples across AMETEK of the unique and highly differentiated capabilities and technologies we provide our customers.  
Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the second quarter, continued solid order momentum and record backlog, we have increased our full year earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up high single digits, with organic sales now also expected to be up high single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid- to high single digits.  
Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.46 to $5.54, up 13% to 14% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.34 to $5.44 per diluted share. 
For the third quarter, we expect overall sales to be up in the high single digits compared to the same period last year, and third quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.38 per diluted share, up 8% to 10% versus the prior year.  
While we are closely monitoring the various macroeconomic headwinds, we are not seeing slowing in our businesses as demand remains solid and our businesses are operating at a high level. We are confident in our ability and improved outlook for the year, given our strong backlog, ability to offset inflation with price increases and outstanding operating capability.  
In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses are well positioned with differentiated technology solutions serving a diverse set of growing niche markets. Our organic growth initiatives are driving higher levels of growth, and our portfolio is aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets.  
Additionally, our asset-light business model and strong cash flow provides us the flexibility to navigate challenging environments, while continuing to deploy capital and drive increased shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth.  
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"
31860,1790833836,2611925,"AMETEK, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2022",2022-08-02,"Earnings Calls","AMETEK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the second quarter led by strong sales and orders growth and tremendous operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.  Second quarter gen",543,"Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the second quarter led by strong sales and orders growth and tremendous operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.  
Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million, up $2 million from the prior year, and as a percentage of total sales was 1.6%, in line with the second quarter of 2021. 
For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021.  
The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 18.5%, down from 20.6% in the second quarter of 2021. The lower rate this quarter was driven by lower tax on foreign income. 
For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate.  
Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million for the full year, or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. 
Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $77 million. And for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $315 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share.  
For the quarter, operating working capital was 18% of sales. Operating cash flow was $236 million and free cash flow was $210 million in the second quarter. We expect approximately 100% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year. Our working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add select inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and to hedge against the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain.  
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.44 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $173 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares, for a total of $330 million.  
As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. 
Total debt ended the second quarter at $2.5 billion, down slightly from the $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $349 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2x.  
As Dave noted, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2024, modest levels of leverage and strong cash flows. As a result, we are well positioned to deploy meaningful capital to invest in our acquisition strategy with approximately $2.3 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.  
To conclude, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, delivering strong sales growth, outstanding operating performance and a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned going into the back half of the year, and we'll continue to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives.

But clearly, there are different dynamics that are happening right now where some things are coming back in and some things are still inflating, but the net is still increasing costs. So -- but we've got a good system to manage that, but that may change over the next quarter, and we'll tell you about it. But right now, that's where it is."

AMETEK delivered record results in the third quarter with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution leading to earnings above our expectations. 
Operationally, our businesses are performing exceptionally well and successfully offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in impressive margin expansion. We are also seeing continued strong and broad-based demand across our diversified niche markets leading to impressive organic order growth and a record backlog of $3.2 billion. And this morning, we announced the acquisition of two excellent businesses, Navitar and RTDS Technologies, expanding our presence in high-end precision optics and in testing solutions for the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly. Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. 
Now let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.55 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 11%. Acquisitions added 1 point and foreign currency was an approximate 4-point headwind in the quarter. Demand also remains solid across our niche markets with organic orders growing 9% in the quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.07, our ninth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3.2 billion, up approximately $1.4 billion from the end of 2020. 
Operating income in the quarter was a record $385 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2021, while operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter, up a robust 140 basis points from the prior year with strong margin expansion in each operating group. Our ability to drive meaningful margin expansion despite the inflationary environment reflects the differentiation of our technology solutions and our flexible operating model. 
EBITDA in the quarter was also a record of $463 million, up 12% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins a record 29.8%. This outstanding performance led to a record of earnings of $1.45 per diluted share, up 15% versus the third quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.36 to $1.38. 
Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered excellent operating performance with continued strong and broad-based growth. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.05 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 10% with a 1 point contribution from acquisitions being more than offset by an approximate 3 point foreign currency headwind. 
Growth was again broad-based across our EIG businesses with particularly strong growth within our Roland, TMC Precitech and thermal process management businesses. Third quarter operating income was $272.7 million, up 11% versus the prior year. And operating margins were 25.9% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year. 
The performance of our Electromechanical Group in the quarter was exceptional, with excellent sales growth and record operating results. EMG's third quarter sales were a record $497.7 million, up 8% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 13% in the quarter and foreign currency at [ 4.81 ]. 
Growth was very broad-based across all of our EMG businesses. EMG's operating income in the third quarter was a record $136.5 million, up 19% compared to the prior year period. EMG's third quarter operating margins were a record 27.4%, up an impressive 240 basis points versus the prior year. 
Overall, our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter, allowing us to manage an uncertain macro environment, meaningfully expand margins and drive earnings ahead of our expectations. 
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. We are very pleased to announce the acquisition of two highly strategic [ systems ]. Navitar and RTDS Technologies are both excellent businesses and highly strategic acquisitions for AMETEK, expanding our presence with -- in attractive secular growth markets. 
Now let me take a moment to provide additional color on both these acquisitions, starting with Navitar. Navitar is a leading provider of optical solutions for critical applications across several markets, including medical and life sciences research, machine vision and robotics, semiconductor and industrial automation. Their comprehensive suite of high-precision, custom optical solutions includes fully integrated imaging systems, sensors, cameras, optics and software. Navitar is an excellent strategic and complementary fit with our Zygo business unit as their technical capabilities around cameras and optical systems further expand Zygo's product offering. Additionally, Navitar is a high-growth business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for precision optical solutions across attractive growth markets. Navitar was privately held and is based in Rochester, New York. 
Now seeing to RTDS Technologies. RTDS provides real-time digital simulation systems used by utilities and research and educational institutions in the development and testing of the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. Their simulation solutions allow engineers to rapidly prototype, verify and test the performance of the electric grid, our instruments and networks and close-looped systems to help accelerate product development life cycles and decreased testing costs. RTDS' simulation solutions are playing a key role in the modernization of the electric grid infrastructure as well as supporting secular growth drivers, including renewable energy, distributed power generation and energy storage. The acquisition of RTDS broadens our Power Instruments businesses testing and simulation capabilities while expanding our exposure to the renewable energy space. RTDS is privately held and based in Winnipeg, Canada. 
We are very excited to welcome the Navitar and RTDS teams to the AMETEK family. We deployed approximately $430 million on these acquisitions, acquiring approximately $100 million in annual sales. 
Over the past 2 years, we deployed more than $2.4 billion in capital and acquisitions and acquired eight businesses. Our acquisition pipeline remains solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital on strategic acquisitions. In addition to the recent acquisitions, we continue to focus on ensuring AMETEK is strategically positioned for long-term sustainable growth. 
Our businesses are driving broader adoption of our organic growth initiatives, including growth presence, digitalization and new product development. This includes making strategic growth investments across our businesses to help support and accelerate growth. For all of 2022, we now expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives. We are seeing great results from these efforts over both the short term and long term. 
In the third quarter, sales from new products introduced over the last 3 years was 27%, a record level for our Vitality Index, reflecting the great work of our teams. These efforts have helped lead to double-digit organic sales growth in each of the past 6 quarters. 
Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. While we remain cautious in the short term, given the dynamic macro environment, we are highly confident in the quality of our businesses and our ability to manage through these challenging times. Given our strong third quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance. 
For the full year, we now expect overall and organic sales to be up approximately 10% versus our prior guidance of up high single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.63, up 16% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.46 to $5.54 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, all sales are expected to be up mid-single digits compared to the same period last year, and fourth quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.47 per diluted share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. 
To summarize, AMETEK had another excellent quarter. We delivered record performance, strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, increased our earnings guidance for the year and acquired two strategic businesses. The strength of the AMETEK growth model and our talented global workforce is evident in our results, thus far this year and will continue to allow us to operate at a high level through challenging market conditions. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. 
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.
Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $3 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense in the quarter. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels, approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the third quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $28 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. 
Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $76 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $310 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18.4% of sales. 
We generated strong levels of cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $327 million, up 7% versus the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $299 million in the third quarter, up 6% from the prior year and free cash flow to net income conversion was 100%. Total debt ended the third quarter at $2.36 billion, down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $310 million. At the end of the third quarter, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x. 
As Dave noted, we've been active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we acquired Navitar. And subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired RTDS Technologies. Combined, we deployed approximately $430 million on these two acquisitions. 
We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have no material debt maturities due until 2024 and modest levels of leverage. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and a strong balance sheet. Following our two recent acquisitions, we still have over $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. 
In summary, our business has performed exceptionally well in the third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and world-class workforce. Kevin?"

In terms of next year, really not ready to talk about pricing and inflation next year. I will say that we do expect that we will be able to offset inflation with price in 2023 from a philosophy and an operating capability. But we're going to refrain from discussing 2023 until we get to -- go through our bottoms-up reviews with each of our businesses. So there's no ranges and think it's not going to be positive next year, but we don't have the data yet. So I'm going to hold off on that one.

So that is really good. 
And you talk about 2023, I think our portfolio is in much better shape to -- as we're going forward because if you think about what's happened, we've continued to shift our portfolio to exposures in attractive growth markets, growth markets like automation, health care, power. This recent acquisition is more renewables. And the market shifts are attractive for us. And our technology, our differentiation is stronger than it was 6 or 7 years ago. And we see that playing out in our organic growth in both relative and absolute performance, we think. And the big picture, we've incrementally improved our portfolio without sacrificing a couple of years of growth to do it and have delivered an exceptional way along the path. 
I'll give you some examples. Our health care portfolio, it was about 10% 6 years ago. Now, it's 15%. Aerospace and defense, it was about -- it was low double digits part of the business about 6 or 7 years ago. Now, it's high teens. Our automation business went from about 7% to 12%. So good improvements in all those areas as a percentage of our total portfolio. And on the flip side, more cyclical businesses like our oil and gas and metals, they were more than 20% of sales 6 years ago. And right now, combined, these sales are about 8%.

Yes, a good question about the underlying orders. And the way I think about it, we'll certainly be running into more difficult comparisons for order input in the coming quarters. And we do expect our orders to moderate due to the fact that you're talking about, our customers placed orders early due to supply chain dynamics. And we believe that the return to more normalized ordering patterns and -- but even with these factors, I expect our backlog to be in an excellent position as we enter 2023."

I think in 2023 as the supply chain shortages abate, we believe our working capital will decrease to a more normalized level. 
In the vertical markets, I'm going to wait and see what we learn from our businesses but we do expect our longer cycle businesses to be strong in both A&D and energy, and we do expect to have a historically strong backlog when we enter 2023. 
And in terms of a recession playbook, let's say we do see slowing and we start to see a recession, we'll react and manage our business appropriately as we have done in the past. And we think we have a proven model that works well in both up markets and down markets. And the most recent example of this was during the COVID-driven recession in 2020. And if you look at how we performed through that, despite the weakness in sales during the time, our margins actually grew 80 basis points and decremental margins were only 17%. So we've got the capability to manage in both up cycles and down cycles. And I believe that the next recession will be no different whenever it comes."

Operationally, our businesses",1398,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered record results in the third quarter, with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution leading to earnings above our expectations.  
Operationally, our businesses are performing exceptionally well and successfully offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in impressive margin expansion. We are also seeing continued strong and broad-based demand across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record backlog of $3.2 billion. 
And this morning, we announced the acquisition of two excellent businesses, Navitar and RTDS Technologies, expanding our presence in high-end precision optics and in testing solutions for the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly.  
Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. Now let me turn to our third quarter results. 
Third quarter sales were a record $1.55 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 11%. Acquisitions added 1 point and foreign currency was an approximate 4-point headwind in the quarter. 
Demand also remains solid across our niche markets, with organic orders growing 9% in the quarter while book-to-bill was 1.07, our ninth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3.2 billion, up approximately $1.4 billion from the end of 2020.  
Operating income in the quarter was a record $385 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2021. While operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter, up a robust 140 basis points from the prior year, with strong margin expansion in each operating group. Our ability to drive meaningful margin expansion despite the inflationary environment reflects the differentiation of our technology solutions and our flexible operating model.  
EBITDA in the quarter was also a record of $463 million, up 12% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins a record 29.8%. This outstanding performance led to a record of earnings of $1.45 per diluted share, up 15% versus the third quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.36 to $1.38.  
Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered excellent operating performance with continued strong and broad-based growth. 
Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.05 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 10%, with a 1 point contribution from acquisitions being more than offset by an approximate 3-point foreign currency headwind.  
Growth was again broad-based across our EIG businesses, with particularly strong growth within our Rauland, TMC/Precitech and Thermal Process Management businesses. Third quarter operating income was $272.7 million, up 11% versus the prior year. And operating margins were 25.9% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year.  
The performance of our Electromechanical Group in the quarter was exceptional, with excellent sales growth and record operating results. EMG's third quarter sales were a record $497.7 million, up 8% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 13% in the quarter and foreign currency at [ 4.81 ]. 
Growth was very broad-based across all of our EMG businesses. EMG's operating income in the third quarter was a record $136.5 million, up 19% compared to the prior year period. EMG's third quarter operating margins were a record 27.4%, up an impressive 240 basis points versus the prior year.  
Overall, our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter, allowing us to manage an uncertain macro environment, meaningfully expand margins and drive earnings ahead of our expectations. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. 
We are very pleased to announce the acquisition of two highly strategic businesses. Navitar and RTDS Technologies are both excellent businesses and highly strategic acquisitions for AMETEK, expanding our presence with -- in attractive secular growth markets. Now let me take a moment to provide additional color on both these acquisitions, starting with Navitar. 
Navitar is a leading provider of optical solutions for critical applications across several markets, including medical and life sciences research, machine vision and robotics, semiconductor and industrial automation. Their comprehensive suite of high-precision, custom optical solutions includes fully integrated imaging systems, sensors, cameras, optics and software. 
Navitar is an excellent strategic and complementary fit with our Zygo business unit as their technical capabilities around cameras and optical systems further expand Zygo's product offering. Additionally, Navitar is a high-growth business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for precision optical solutions across attractive growth markets. Navitar was privately held and is based in Rochester, New York.  
Now switching to RTDS Technologies. RTDS provides real-time digital simulation systems used by utilities and research and educational institutions in the development and testing of the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. Their simulation solutions allow engineers to rapidly prototype, verify and test the performance of the electric grid, power instruments and networks in a closed-loop systems to help accelerate product development life cycles and decrease testing costs. 
RTDS' simulation solutions are playing a key role in the modernization of the electric grid infrastructure as well as supporting secular growth drivers, including renewable energy, distributed power generation and energy storage. The acquisition of RTDS broadens our Power Instruments business' testing and simulation capabilities while expanding our exposure to the renewable energy space. RTDS is privately held and based in Winnipeg, Canada.  
We are very excited to welcome the Navitar and RTDS teams to the AMETEK family. We deployed approximately $430 million on these acquisitions, acquiring approximately $100 million in annual sales.  
Over the past 2 years, we deployed more than $2.4 billion in capital on acquisitions and acquired eight businesses. Our acquisition pipeline remains solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital on strategic acquisitions. 
In addition to the recent acquisitions, we continue to focus on ensuring AMETEK is strategically positioned for long-term sustainable growth. Our businesses are driving broader adoption of our organic growth initiatives, improving growth presence, digitalization and new product development. 
This includes making strategic growth investments across our businesses to help support and accelerate growth. For all of 2022, we now expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives. We are seeing great results from these efforts over both the short term and long term.  
In the third quarter, sales from new products introduced over the last 3 years was 27%, a record level for our Vitality Index, reflecting the great work of our teams. These efforts have helped lead to double-digit organic sales growth in each of the past 6 quarters.  
Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. While we remain cautious in the short term, given the dynamic macro environment, we are highly confident in the quality of our businesses and our ability to manage through these challenging times. Given our strong third quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance.  
For the full year, we now expect overall and organic sales to be up approximately 10% versus our prior guidance of up high single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.63, up 16% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.46 to $5.54 per diluted share. 
For the fourth quarter, overall sales are expected to be up mid-single digits compared to the same period last year. And fourth quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.47 per diluted share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year.  
To summarize, AMETEK had another excellent quarter. We delivered record performance, strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, increased our earnings guidance for the year and acquired two strategic businesses. The strength of the AMETEK growth model and our talented global workforce is evident in our results, thus far, this year and will continue to allow us to operate at a high level through challenging market conditions. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth.  
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. 
Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $3 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense in the quarter. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. 
The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the third quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. 
Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $28 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $76 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $310 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share. 
For the quarter, operating working capital was 18.4% of sales. We generated strong levels of cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $327 million, up 7% versus the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $299 million in the third quarter, up 6% from the prior year, and free cash flow to net income conversion was 100%. 
Total debt ended the third quarter at $2.36 billion, down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $310 million. At the end of the third quarter, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x.  
As Dave noted, we've been active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we acquired Navitar. And subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired RTDS Technologies. Combined, we deployed approximately $430 million on these two acquisitions.  
We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have no material debt maturities due until 2024 and modest levels of leverage. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and a strong balance sheet. Following our two recent acquisitions, we still have over $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.  
In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and world-class workforce. Kevin?"

And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of our product portfolio and our leadership position in niches.  
In terms of next year, really not ready to talk about pricing and inflation next year. I will say that we do expect that we will be able to offset inflation with price in 2023 from a philosophy and an operating capability. But we're going to refrain from discussing 2023 until we get to -- go through our bottoms-up reviews with each of our businesses. 
So there's no ranges that we think is not going to be positive next year, but we don't have the data yet. So I'm going to hold off on that one. But really good performance on pricing in Q3, and we expect it to continue in Q4. Did that answer your question, Matt?"

We're growing a healthy growth rates in all major regions of the world, as I just went through. And so we feel good about that, and we ended the quarter with a record backlog. So that is really good.  
And if you talk about 2023, I think our portfolio is in much better shape to -- as we're going forward because, if you think about what's happened, we've continued to shift our portfolio to exposures in attractive growth markets, growth markets like automation, health care, power. This recent acquisition is more renewables, and the market shifts are attractive for us. 
And our technology, our differentiation is stronger than it was 6 or 7 years ago. And we see that playing out in our organic growth in both relative and absolute performance, we think. And the big picture, we've incrementally improved our portfolio without sacrificing a couple of years of growth to do it, and have delivered an exceptional way along the path.  
I'll give you some examples. Our Healthcare portfolio, it was about 10% 6 years ago, now it's 15%. Aerospace & Defense, it was about -- it was low double digits, part of the business, about 6 or 7 years ago, now it's high teens. Our Automation business went from about 7% to 12%. So good improvements in all those areas as a percentage of our total portfolio. 
And on the flip side, more cyclical businesses like our Oil & Gas and Metals, they were more than 20% of sales 6 years ago. And right now, combined, these sales are about 8%.

The segment that grew the fast -- second fastest was our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Very strong third quarter with organic sales up low double digits, a balanced growth across both Automation & Engineered Solutions. And for that subsegment, we now expect organic sales to be up approximately 10%, up from high single digits, up to 10% for the full year, with similar growth across each segment. 
Then I take you to the Power & Industrial business, up mid-single digits on a percentage basis in the quarter. We saw a notable strength across our Power Instruments and Programmable Power business. And we now expect that subsegment to grow 10% also. So that was -- we rose that from high single digits to 10%. 
And I'll talk about the Aerospace & Defense business. Organic sales for our Aerospace & Defense businesses were up mid-single digits in the third quarter. Commercial sales were really strong, up mid-teens in the quarter, driven by strong underlying demands across the industry. 
Commercial OE, aftermarket and business jet all grew nicely. The strongest were aftermarket and business jet. And Defense sales were up low single digits in the quarter.

And we -- during this year, I mean, we've expanded our facilities in Mexico. We expanded our facility in Serbia. We expanded our facility in Malaysia.

So we're dealing with our volume in low-cost regions, and it provides a synergy to -- and local market access for us. So we've been investing heavily in low-cost production manufacturing. And Malaysia is becoming a good facility for us. Again, Eastern Europe, Serbia and Mexico for the U.S. So it's -- we have these regional hubs that we're building up, and it's very successful for us. And we've put a lot of capacity in place this year."

The first thing is, not only is the Vitality Index, it helps us with our pricing. Because we're continually adding new features and benefits to our products and our customers, and it enables us to garner a higher price because of the engineering investment that we're making, very consistent engineering investment over 5% over many years.
We first started tracking the Vitality, it was in the mid-teens. And over the past 10 or 15 years, it got into the 20s and the mid-20s. And now, I'm just very pleased with 27% Vitality. Clearly, our new product development process is working. We're developing products our customers want to buy. And 27% of sales for our end markets, we think that's a really good number. 
And in general, I put a range around it, I think between 20% and 30% is a very good number for AMETEK. And again, the Vitality helps not only from new products, having fresh new products that you can win share with, but it also helps with pricing -- realized pricing."

But as I said, I think our portfolio has been improved dramatically. And I think that when you think about all the other things that I mentioned, we would stay in front of inflation with pricing. I think in 2023, as the supply chain shortages abate, we believe our working capital will decrease to a more normalized level. 
In the vertical markets, I'm going to wait and see what we learn from our businesses, but we do expect our longer-cycle businesses to be strong in both A&D and Energy. And we do expect to have a historically strong backlog when we enter 2023. 
And in terms of a recession playbook, let's say we do see slowing and we start to see a recession, we'll react and manage our business appropriately as we have done in the past. And we think we have a proven model that works well in both up markets and down markets. 
And the most recent example of this was during the COVID-driven recession in 2020. And if you look at how we performed through that, despite the weakness in sales during the time, our margins actually grew 80 basis points and decremental margins were only 17%. So we've got the capability to manage in both up cycles and down cycles. And I believe that the next recession will be no different, whenever it comes."
