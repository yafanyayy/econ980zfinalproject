Well, we've been busy, and we have a lot to talk about today. I'm going to start with an update on our strategy refresh. Then I'll share my thoughts on our fourth quarter and end on all the progress that we've made against our major priorities. 
As you saw earlier this week, we announced that we intend to focus our franchise in Mexico solely on our institutional and wealth management businesses, and therefore, to exit the consumer small business and middle-market banking operations there. This was not a decision we took lightly. We took a clinical look at our franchise in Mexico, and we drew the hard conclusion that the noninstitutional businesses do not fit our new strategic direction. Now to be clear, these are terrific, they're scaled, high returning franchises. But our strategic goal is to invest in businesses that are fully aligned with our core strengths and to simplify our firm. 
As we did the work, it was also clear that there continues to be a tremendous opportunity for our Institutional Clients Group in Mexico. Citi is Mexico's leading institutional bank. We've served corporate clients and investors there for almost a century, and that isn't going to change. Mexico has a bright future, and we are committed to playing an important role in building it. We expect Mexico will be a major recipient of global investment and trade flows in the years ahead. Therefore, we plan to maintain a significant, locally licensed bank there and invest to capture growth in a core and high-returning hub of our institutional network. 
This won't be a simple transaction. We have spent the last several months working through how to get the best results for our shareholders and be true to our local stakeholders. We will begin the separation process immediately and expect to begin the sales process in the spring. And of course, there will be an opportunity to return excess capital from the transaction to our shareholders. This is our final decision in terms of market exits as we conclude our strategy refresh and approach Investor Day. 
I'm really looking forward to talking to you about the future Citi on March 2. Today, we are going to talk you through the changes we're making to align our organization and financial reporting with our refreshed strategy. Now these changes will also allow us to reduce structural complexity and its associated costs. Amongst other things, this is going to help make Citi easier for our investors to understand. You'll be able to see and assess more simply the core businesses that make up Citi going forward. 
First, we're creating a new personal banking and wealth management segment, which will be run by Anand Selva. This will consist of 2 distinct reporting units: Our U.S. personal banking businesses; and our global wealth management business, which is going to include the private bank. 
Second, on the institutional side of the house, which will continue to be run by Paco Ybarra. We will begin reporting under 3 units: services, banking and markets. Services will include Treasury and Trade Solutions and security services, and this reflects just how important we believe these businesses are to Citi's future. 
Finally, we will create a new segment, legacy franchises, which will house all the businesses we intend to exit. We're going to begin reporting our financials along these segments and reporting units no later than the second quarter, to ensure you have the information you need to measure our progress and hold us accountable, and we really look forward to sharing our strategy and plans for how these businesses will work together and deliver for our shareholders on Investor Day in March. 
Now turning to earnings. We had a decent end to 2021. As you can see on Slide 2, we closed out the quarter with net income of $3.2 billion and EPS of $1.46. That includes a $1.2 billion hit to EBIT primarily related to the wind down of our Korean consumer business. Excluding those impacts, our net income would be $4.2 billion with an EPS of $1.99. Our net income for the full year of $22 billion reflects an improved credit environment and we had a resulting RoTCE of 13.4%. In ICG, we had another strong quarter in investment banking and gained share for the year in M&A. And we continue to make significant investments in talent, and we see a very solid pipeline of transactions ahead of us. 
Now while we could have had a better balanced performance in fixed income in the quarter, equities finished 2021 up 25% for the year. The rebound TTS is seeing in trade flows and cash volumes was not quite enough to offset the current rate environment, but it bodes well for 2022. Indeed, we think the cycle has turned for this business and it is poised to benefit as monetary policy changes and growth accelerates. You've heard Mark and I talk about improving the revenue mix of our institutional businesses as a priority, and it's yielding results with another quarter of strong momentum in fee growth across products. 
Parts of our consumer businesses are still weathering COVID's disruptive impact on customer behavior. In the U.S., strong purchase sales continued to be offset by elevated payment rates, but we did see loans increase in branded cards this quarter. Deposits and AUM continued to grow, with digital deposits up nearly 20% for the full year. For the year, we returned nearly $12 billion in capital to our shareholders and we grew our tangible book value per share by 7% to $79.16. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% on a standardized basis as we built the capital needed to resolve the impact of [indiscernible]. Now keep in mind, that regulatory change didn't take effect until January 1. While this caused us to temporarily pause our stock buyback, we will resume buybacks this quarter now that, that impact has been addressed. 
Finally, as Slide 3 shows, we are executing and delivering against our priorities: The strategy refresh, the transformation and our culture, and we are doing so with a real sense of urgency. First, on the strategy. We are laser focused on swiftly and successfully implementing the strategic decisions we made over the past year to improve returns to our investors. We have signed deals in 6 of the Asia consumer markets including the agreement to sell 4 markets that we announced yesterday. This means that within 8 months of making the decision to exit these 13 businesses, we have a clear path in a majority of them, and we are well into the process in the remaining markets. 
In Korea, we were decisive in determining the best path for our shareholders was to wind down our consumer operation, and we're able to get most of that charge behind us this quarter. Another area where we haven't wasted any time is wealth management, where we grew our ranks by a net 800 advisers relationship managers and others over the course of the year. They helped us add about 750 private bank clients and 45,000 Citi gold clients in 2021. In what we know as U.S. Personal Banking, we've seen good uptake of new products such as the custom cash card, and we've been building out digital platforms to capture opportunities in installment lending. And in addition to the progress we're seeing in TTS, we've also been building out our security services platform. 
We couldn't be more pleased to deepen our relationship with BlackRock by becoming the largest custodian for their iShares ETF. Second priority, we continue to execute on our transformation agenda in order to demonstrably strengthen our risk and controls as well as modernize our bank for a digital world. This work, it's foundational for everything we want to achieve. We are enhancing our operating model to improve long-term efficiency and our service to clients. 
As it relates to the consent orders, we are deep into execution mode. We continue to be in constructive dialogue with our regulators as we get their feedback and incorporate it into our ongoing execution and project plans. 
Third, and relatedly, we are building a culture that expects excellence and demands accountability. We're driving this effort in a variety of ways, including a more robust performance management process at this past year-end, shifting the mix of compensation to better align with shareholders' interest and various culture-changing initiatives. A culture of excellence also means creating a record of achievement that our people can be proud of. One area that our people take particular pride in is our ESG efforts. Later this month, we will share with you our plan to reach net zero by 2050, a commitment I made on my first day as CEO 10 months ago. 
And of course, we are going to do all this with a singular focus on our clients as we help them navigate COVID. We certainly hope Omicron is the final disruptive phase of this pandemic, but there are also quite a few other issues to navigate, whether macroeconomic, such as inflation, or geopolitical such as tensions with Russia. We have seen the resilience and the importance of Citi as we supported our clients through unchartered waters, and we will be with them in the next chapter as well. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we would be delighted to take your questions."

I'm going to start by walking you through the financial reporting changes we plan on making in more detail. Then I'm going to walk you through the 2021 financial impact from the 13 Asia market exits as well as Mexico, and changes we are making to our financial disclosure. And then finally, the quarterly results. 
As part of our strategy refresh, we've started to make changes to better align with our vision and strategy. We refreshed our earnings presentation and included additional metrics and key drivers for the ICG businesses. Our goal is to simplify our financial reporting to make it much easier for our investors to understand our performance and our key assets. 
Turning to Slide 4, we lay out the details of the changes in the financial reporting that Jane mentioned. First, we intend to move the consumer, small business and middle market banking operations of Citi Banamex, and the 13 Asia consumer exits under a new segment called Legacy Franchises. This will allow you to better understand the financials of the remaining company that will exist post these exits. We've experienced managing businesses being divested and are putting a dedicated team in place to manage the new segment. This will free up the management teams of the go-forward businesses to fully focus on executing on the firm's strategy. 
Second, we are reorganizing our reporting units to help you better understand the financials of our businesses and the value they bring to Citi. Starting with ICG, we will move TTS and security services to a reporting unit called Services. These businesses are foundational for us as they have a unique position given their global footprint and full suite product offering. Markets will, therefore, no longer include security services and instead will only include equity and fixed income markets. 
And lastly on ICG, banking will only include advisory, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and corporate lending. The Global Consumer Bank, GCB, will be renamed Personal Banking and Wealth Management, PBWM. The Private Bank will move from ICG to PBWM. As a reminder, we announced in January of last year that we created a single wealth management organization under Citi Global Wealth, now called Global Wealth Management, which is a distinct reporting unit. The creation of this unit unifies the wealth management teams creating a single, integrated platform serving clients across the wealth continuum from the affluent segment to the ultra-high net worth clients. 
North America Consumer will be renamed to U.S. Personal Banking and will remain a reporting unit under PBWM. This unit will continue to include branded cards, retail services and retail banking. We plan on providing the financials for the new reporting units on this page under the ICG and PBWM segments, starting no later than the second quarter earnings. And our Investor Day will be a natural opportunity to bring together all the work over the past year and lay out our medium-term vision and strategy for the firm. 
Slide 5 shows the contribution of the Citi Banamex businesses that we plan to exit as well as the contribution from the 13 Asia markets. Hopefully, this gives you a better sense of the financial results for the combined exits. And in the appendix on Page 18, we have more detail on the 13 Asia exit markets and the deals that we've announced to date. 
Turning to Mexico. As Jane mentioned, we remain committed to Mexico and will continue to serve our institutional and private bank clients there. That said, upon very careful consideration and analysis, we decided that we are no longer the optimal owner for the businesses that we're exiting. Mexico consumer and small business banking operations included in the intended exit represents the entirety of the Latin America Global Consumer Banking unit and the Mexico middle market banking business that is currently included in Citi's Institutional Clients Group segment. 
On the left side of the page, we show key figures for 2020 and 2021 for the businesses we intend to exit in Mexico. In 2021, the businesses contributed $4.7 billion of revenue and $1.1 billion of net income. The businesses in total had $20 billion of loans, $31 billion of deposits and approximately $4 billion of allocated TCE. Again, we do not yet have a transaction and are pursuing multiple divestiture path, so the ultimate financial impact of a transaction is not yet known. We will keep you updated on our progress as we run a thoughtful process that takes into consideration what is in the best interest of our shareholders as well as our clients and employees in Mexico. 
In addition to the opportunity to return additional capital to shareholders, these divestitures will also allow us to simplify the management and organizational structure across the firm. 
Now turning to Slide 6. As we've gone through our strategy refresh and simplification, we've been reviewing our disclosure in terminology and have decided that now is the right time to more closely align with our peers. First, revenue that we previously referred to as net interest revenue will now be called net interest income, and revenue that we previously referred to as non-NIR will now be called noninterest revenue. 
Second, as you can see on the page, we've revised how we account for insurance paid on our deposits, including FDIC and foreign deposit insurance. We have previously accounted for the deposit insurance as a control revenue and net interest income. However, beginning this quarter, we will report it as an expense and remove it from net interest income. And as a reminder, this change is earnings neutral. We've made this change to make it easier for you to compare us to our peers, and we have revised prior years to reflect the same reporting treatment to assist with comparability for 2019 to 2021, and the rest of the presentation will also reflect these 2 changes. 
On Slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and an EPS of $1.46, an RoTCE of 7.4% on $17 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are costs of approximately $1.2 billion primarily related to the voluntary retirement program we offered in conjunction with the wind down of our Korea consumer business, as well as some additional Asia exit impacts which I will collectively refer to as the Asia divestiture impacts going forward. Excluding these impacts, EPS would have been $1.99, with an RoTCE of approximately 10%.  
In the quarter, total revenues increased by 1% from last year as strength in noninterest revenue driven by ICG, specifically TTS, Security Services and Investment Banking, was mostly offset by lower net interest income across GCB and ICG. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, an increase of 18% versus the prior year. Excluding the Asia divestiture cost, expenses would have increased by 8%. Increased expenses were largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit in the quarter, primarily driven by an ACL release of approximately $1.4 billion related to the improved macro backdrop and continued improvement in portfolio quality. 
Now turning to the full year. Our revenues were down 5%, driven by the normalization in markets as well as elevated payment rates in consumer, somewhat offset by strong noninterest revenue growth across ICG and in particular, in investment banking, TTS and security services. Our full year expenses were up 9%, but excluding Asia divestiture costs, our expenses were up 6%. Also for the full year, we generated RoTCE of 13% and 14% excluding Asia-related divestiture impacts. As a reminder, we had a benefit of close to $9 billion in ACL releases for the full year. 
On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2021, excluding Asia divestiture impacts, expenses were up 6%, in line with previous guidance. Looking forward, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do. The divestitures provide an opportunity to simplify our management and organizational structure. We're also taking a hard look at our structural expenses, with an eye towards operating as efficiently and soundly as possible and self-funding investments. We have a lot more to say about this at our Investor Day. 
On Slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $130 million on a sequential basis, driven by North America Consumer. Sequentially, net interest margin remained relatively stable. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was flat. Also on a year-over-year basis, average deposits grew in the quarter as we continue to deepen relationships with our institutional clients as well as our consumer clients, particularly in North America. Average loans were roughly flat year-over-year as growth in the ICG was offset by a decline in GCB. 
As the probability of higher rates has increased over the last few quarters, let me make a few comments regarding the potential impact from higher rates. In our 10-Q, we disclosed interest rate sensitivity assuming a parallel shift and a runoff balance sheet. This is different from our peers' methodology, which tends to assume a static balance sheet. Assuming a static balance sheet and a 100 basis point parallel shift, we would expect Citi's total net interest income across all currencies to increase by over 3x more than what was disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q, or roughly $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income. 
On Slide 10, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.3 trillion balance sheet, about 25% or $530 billion consists of HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. And we continue to optimize our balance sheet, deploying excess liquidity into securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the market, as well as reducing our short-term and long-term debt sequentially and year-over-year. On the loan side, corporate loans represent approximately 60% of total loans with loans to corporates outside of the U.S., representing approximately 30% of total loans. And as we've mentioned in the past, about 80% of our total corporate loans are investment grade. 
From a capital perspective, we ended the year with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 12.2%, as we prepared to adopt SACR on January 1. Having adopted SACR and maintained our capital ratio target, we are resuming buybacks this quarter to similar levels to what you saw in the second and third quarter of 2021. As we look into the remainder of the year, there are a number of variables with respect to capital. These include regulatory headwinds that are impacting us, along with the rest of the industry, such as elevated GCIB surcharges, as well as the timing and impact from the divestitures of the 13 Asia exits and Mexico. 
In light of this, you should expect us to manage to a CET1 ratio closer to 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase at the beginning of 2023. That said, we remain focused on all aspects of capital with the goal of maintaining a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. And as you know, under the SCB framework, we can assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year with the goal of returning excess capital to shareholders. 
On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year, driven by investment banking, private bank and security services fees, partially offset by a decline in markets. Expenses increased 10% year-over-year, driven by transformation, business-led investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit of approximately $300 million as net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL release. And we continue to see strong credit performance, with net credit losses declining on a year-over-year basis and nonaccrual loans down sequentially and year-over-year. This resulted in net income of $2.5 billion, down approximately 22% from the prior year, largely driven by the higher expenses and a smaller ACL release versus the prior year. And ICG delivered a 10.8% RoTCE for the quarter. 
We also saw a 5% growth in both loans and deposits on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. As for the full year, ICG delivered approximately $16 billion of net income on $44 billion of revenue with an RoTCE of roughly 17%. 
On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and key drivers for our ICG business for the fourth quarter. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were slightly down versus the prior year, driven by continued headwinds from rates offset by 18% growth in fees, in fact our highest fee quarter ever. And revenue did increase sequentially, driven by both net interest income and strong fee growth. We continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS on a year-over-year basis that indicate continued strong client activity. Since this is the first time we are showing key metrics that demonstrate this momentum, I want to briefly walk you through each one and what it represents. 
U.S. dollar clearing transactions are up 4%, which reflect the clearing and settlement activity of commercial and treasury flows for financial institutions. Cross-border flows were up 15%. These flows represent our global payment flows, where we provide cross-border solutions for our clients that are fully integrated across our TTS and Markets business and over 145 currencies. And importantly, this client activity drives recurring fee revenues and generate significant operating deposits. Commercial card volumes, which reflect travel, purchase and virtual card activity across all clients are up 48%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and, on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% and of total TTS fee revenue. 
Investment banking revenues were up 43% year-over-year, driven by growth across products, including record advisory performance the best advisory quarter we've had in over a decade. Private Bank revenues were up 6% year-over-year as we continue to see strong momentum in new client acquisitions. Overall markets revenues were down 17% versus last year. And while there were different dynamics that played through fixed income and equity markets performance, the performance is against a very strong quarter last year. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 20% year-over-year. While we had solid growth in FX and commodities, this was more than offset by a decline in rates and spread products. 
Equity Markets revenues were down 3% year-over-year as continued growth in prime finance balances and structured activities was offset by a decline in cash. Security Services revenues grew 5% year-over-year as fees grew 11%, driven by higher settlement volumes and higher assets under custody, partially offset by interest rate headwinds. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Here we show the results for our Global Consumer Banking business for the fourth quarter in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues across regions. Expenses were up 34% year-over-year, driven by the Asia divestiture costs. Excluding these costs, expenses were up 9%, driven by transformation and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $105 million benefit this quarter as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. The NCL rate for the quarter was 1.2%, a decline of 61 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. We released over $900 million of ACL this quarter related to continued improvement in our economic outlook and portfolio quality, partially offset by volume growth. This resulted in a net income decline of 42% and an RoTCE of 8%. Excluding the Asia divestitures impacts, Net income would have grown 44% and resulted in an RoTCE of 20%. As for the full year, GCB delivered $6 billion of net income on $27 billion of revenues, with an RoTCE of 17% and 22% excluding Asia divestiture impacts. 
On Slide 14, we show GCB revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics for the fourth quarter. Branded cards revenues declined 3% year-over-year on higher payment rates and portfolio mix. We're seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 43%, card sales volumes up 24% and average loans up 3%. In fact, the fourth quarter acquisitions exceeded the same quarter in 2019 by 2%, the first quarter to do so since the onset of the pandemic. Retail Services revenues declined 10% year-over-year, driven by a 2% decline in net interest income due to elevated payment rates as well as by higher partner payments driven by improved credit performance. But despite this, we are seeing positive underlying drivers with account acquisitions up 6% and spend up 16% on a year-over-year basis. 
While we're encouraged by these underlying drivers in both cards businesses, payment rates do remain stubbornly high, impacting our loan growth and revenue growth in both cards businesses. Retail banking revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower deposit spreads as well as lower mortgage revenue. However, underlying drivers remained strong, with deposits up 13%, Citigold households up 9% and  assets under management up 8% year-over-year as we continue to execute on our North America retail strategy with a focus on our global wealth unit. 
Asia revenues declined 7% year-over-year largely driven by rate headwinds and higher payment rates. Performance in the wealth hubs exceeded that of the overall region with deposit growth of 12%, AUM growth of 13% and 16% growth in Citigold and CPC clients. Latin America revenues declined 3% year-over-year, mainly due to lower loan volumes in both retail and cards. 
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased year-over-year, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down year-over-year, largely due to the wind down of legacy assets. Cost of credit was benign. At this point, we typically give a full year outlook. However, since we have our Investor Day coming up on March 2, we plan on bringing everything together at that point to talk about 2022 in the full context of our strategy and medium-term performance expectations. As part of our strategy refresh, our goal is to be as simple and transparent as possible. And I hope you like the new earnings presentation, and we will continue to evolve it going forward. 
And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

You will recall, John, that historically, we have looked in our disclosure at a run-off balance sheet. And that obviously has deposits running off as they term out, that has loans running off as they mature. Others take an approach where they look at a static balance sheet, right? And so we've run the analysis around assuming a static balance sheet and assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in a rising rate environment, obviously, across all currencies. We obviously have a mix of U.S. dollar and foreign currencies as well. .
And when we run that analysis, now assuming that the balance sheet is static, that is the deposit levels, loan levels, et cetera, that delivers 3x more than what we disclosed in the Q in the third quarter. So that's the $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income. So obviously, retaining -- or assuming that the deposit levels stay the same, allow us to generate more net interest income and that's a major driver in the number range or the range that I provided. 
In terms of the forward look, I'm not going to give you guidance, as you mentioned. But I think there are a couple of things that are important to keep in mind that we're looking at for 2022. One is the drivers that we mentioned earlier. So a lot of the underlying drivers in our franchise look very strong and are driving healthy fee revenue growth. And I would expect with an outlook for positive GDP that, that's going to continue to play to our advantage in 2022. 
The second thing I'd point out is the assumptions around interest rate hikes in 2022. I have many as 3 or 4 depending on the economists' view that you listen to. And that obviously is going to play to our favor as well when you think about the number of accrual businesses that we have, whether it's our TTS franchise, or our private bank, et cetera, et cetera. So those are important factors that impact the top line, and that we expect to help contribute to some growth coming out of 2022. 
I mentioned the loan growth on the branded cards portfolio. For cards it's really going to be about payment rates. I mean, how they taper off -- hopefully taper off. They've been stubbornly high through all of 2021. So hopefully, we start to see some of that taper off and we get a little bit of growth in average interest-earning balances in the back half of the year, but those are important factors that need to play through into 2022."

So we are looking at, obviously, how we continue to invest in the franchise, particularly where there are areas of growth. At the same time, ensure that we're delivering buybacks or share, return to shareholders. 
As I look at the CET1 ratio, we're ending the year at about 12.2%. As you know, SACR kicks in -- or has kicked in on January 1. We're ending therefore, on January 1 at roughly around where our target is. And over the course of the year, we'll be able to absorb growth in the businesses where there is a need to do that while continuing to identify offsets to both SACR but also low-returning assets that we may have and ridding ourselves of those and generating income as well as the capital from the divestitures that we will be able to close throughout the course of the year. 
And so as we look at that plan, the start of the year, which is close to our target, towards the end of 2022 we will have to build that back up to about 12% in order to absorb the GCIB headwind, assuming there's no relief provided to that, which then kicks in at the beginning of 2023. And so through the course of the year, we'll utilize through RWA, we'll free up capital and return capital to shareholders. We'll generate more earnings. But at the end of the year, we'll need to kind of end on the higher end or towards that 12%."

The total for the divestitures that were -- that we've earmarked, it's about $85 billion in deposits. And so you can do the math that we'd get some benefit from that. You're right, and I don't have numbers that I would share at this point, but -- and in part because the Fed has to run their analysis. But you're right, from a CCAR point of view, when you think about the stress capital buffer, there's an impact to PPNR, but more importantly, to stress losses that will play through as well. 
As you know, that impact as well as the deposit impact won't really come into play until we've closed on these transactions.

I'm not going to give guidance on 2022, but let me try and frame out how we're thinking about it because I think it is important.

I'm not going to give guidance on 2022, but let me try and frame out how we're thinking about it because I think it is important. Both Jane and I recognize that we've got -- a lot of static we're getting, excuse me. 
So in terms of the expenses, we obviously have a large expense base. We've seen growth play out this year. But I think there's some real opportunities over time to attack the expense base, and that's exactly what we intend to do. So if you think about the divestitures, I'll start there for a second. There's some $6.8 billion of expenses tied to divestitures. As those divestitures get closed out, some of that will naturally go away. The balance of that, which tends to be referred to as stranded cost, we are already putting in place a team to focus on attacking and driving out that stranded cost. 
The second point that I'll bring up around this is the transformation. The transformation has driven 3 percentage points of growth this year. I do expect that there's more growth associated with that, particularly since we're still doing more hiring. There's more tech spend that will be required. But the transformation over time will deliver efficiencies, will reduce the manual touch points, will drive straight-through processing and therefore, will allow for us to bring our expenses down. 
And the final piece that I'll mention is the strategy. And so Jane mentioned in our strategy, a focus on core businesses. And that's going to allow for us to look at the organizational structure and identify more simplification opportunities in the way we manage and run the firm. We do about $300 million to $400 million of productivity savings a quarter. That's not enough. We think there's more opportunity for efficiencies than that. And it's those opportunities that we're going to chase down in order to fund some of this investment spend that we expect in the next couple of years. More on that at Investor Day."

So -- as I've mentioned before, I mean when you look at what's going on with cards across the board, we are seeing increases in spend volume. So branded card spend volume is up 24%. Retail services spend volume is up 16%. So very healthy spend",444,"Yes, sure. So -- as I've mentioned before, I mean when you look at what's going on with cards across the board, we are seeing increases in spend volume. So branded card spend volume is up 24%. Retail services spend volume is up 16%. So very healthy spend volume. 
People are using our cards, which is a good thing. In terms of the liquidity that's still out there in the market, even though savings rates have started to normalize, there's still a significant amount of liquidity that's out there in the market. And that's showing up in payment rates in both branded cards and retail services and, frankly, in some of the international card businesses as well. And that has not subsided. 
And so we did start to see growth in branded cards loans. Average loans are up 3%, branded cards. The end-of-period loans were up 5%. What matters a lot when you come out of a crisis like this is how you reinvest. And so we've spent a lot of time focused on targeting new customers and driving new account acquisitions. Our new account acquisitions are up 43% in branded cards. And we've been also driving that just generally across the board in retail services as well. 
So getting a good -- a very good response in terms of new accounts coming on board. We've also been focused on how we drive installment lending activity, just kind of to broaden the lending that we're doing with this customer base, and we've seen significant growth in our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products as we've targeted customers who have historically been transactors to really move them onto that product. 
So very good growth there. In fact, in 2021, we've not only gotten the growth just in aggregate. But if I look at kind of installment lending, we've got 90% of the total installment sales are in digital sales, which is another kind of low-cost acquisition approach that we've taken. So good underlying indicators there. But again, it's not until payment rates start to subside we would expect, hope that, that would start to show up towards the back half of 2022. 
In terms of the losses, which was the other part of your question, very low loss levels. You heard me mention the delinquency rates earlier. When I look at -- well, the loss rates earlier, when I look at delinquency trends, there's really nothing to focus on there. They remain quite low. And we don't see any signs or any areas of concern, I would say. But I would imagine those 2 would start to normalize as payment rates start to come down."

Okay, and then in terms of that growth, I think a couple of questions danced around this, so it will be short. But given your answer to what Citi is and wants to be in terms of premier franchise and all those industries or business lines, I should say, how do you balance the -- doing what's right for stockholders in the near term, drive stock return versus making sure you invest for the future? Because each one of those is super competitive. Each one of them has competitors as early as today or as recent as today, spending a ton of money to compete in those spaces.

The second thing I'd say is that we are investing in the franchise for the long term, right, as opposed to trying to hit some short-term metric. And so that does involve us putting that money to work where there is client demand and where it leverages the competitive advantages that we have developed. And so that is the way we approach this with, again, an eye towards ensuring that we're clear and transparent with our investors. And that if there's excess, that we're returning that to our shareholders, so that is not just sitting on the sidelines and not generating returns that they would expect of us."

The other layer of complexity is around the CTA, and you've heard us spend some time on that when we talked about the Australia sale. And I introduce it as a complexity because there's an accounting treatment associated with the CTA that happens at signing, that is separate from the capital implication that happens at closing. So with a CTA, the capital impact flows through AOCI, but it's neutral once the deal is closed. And Mexico, the consumer business would have a DTA of a little bit less than $3 billion or so.

Mark, I was going to ask -- well, I guess technically one question, but it's really a 3-parter. You might need to grab a pen and paper. But I wanted to just unpack some of the comments you made on the NII sensitivity and reporting differences versus peers. You noted a more than 3x increase in NII, assuming a static balance sheet, but there's still a lot of investors that just question your rate sensitivity profile given the fairly modest NII growth that we saw in the last cycle. 
And the first question, I just wanted to start by asking, given your heavier institutional deposit gearing, wouldn't it be reasonable for us to expect that your deposit runoff would actually be greater than peers? Two, does the NII guidance contemplate liability sensitivity in the markets business? And could you help us size that potential drag? And then just lastly, it's more of a catch all. Any idiosyncratic factors that you could speak to that would support a better NII outcome or higher rate benefit versus what we saw in the last cycle?"

And you can see the magnitude of that difference is pretty sizable. There's still going to be a difference between us and peers, but that difference narrows when you put it on a comparable basis. 
We do have a skew towards institutional clients, and they do carry a higher beta associated with them. But we also have a skew towards international currencies and we make good spreads there as well. In terms of the impact through markets, the impact -- I think the market's impact can come in any number of ways. I think rate moves and other uncertainty and volatility in the market can drive broader markets revenues, which we would potentially see depending on how investors have to reposition their books. 
In terms of the last part of your question, I don't think there's anything else that I would point to. I mean, obviously, with the excess liquidity that we've seen and been carrying in the market, we've been putting that to work in investments. We've increased our investment portfolio by some $70 billion. We expanded the duration to about 2.85, and we still have significant dry powder to with the work with either client demand or in an increasing rate environment, which we expect."

Well, we've been busy, and we have a lot to talk about today. I'm going to start with an update on our strategy refresh. Then I'll share my thoughts on our fourth quarter and end on all the progress that we've made against our major priorities.  
As you saw earlier this week, we announced that we intend to focus our franchise in Mexico solely on our institutional and wealth management businesses, and therefore, to exit the consumer small business and middle-market banking operations there. This was not a decision we took lightly. We took a clinical look at our franchise in Mexico, and we drew the hard conclusion that the noninstitutional businesses do not fit our new strategic direction. Now to be clear, these are terrific, they're scaled, high-returning franchises, but our strategic goal is to invest in businesses that are fully aligned with our core strengths and to simplify our firm.  
As we did the work, it was also clear that there continues to be a tremendous opportunity for our Institutional Clients Group in Mexico. Citi is Mexico's leading institutional bank. We've served corporate clients and investors there for almost a century, and that isn't going to change. Mexico has a bright future, and we are committed to playing an important role in building it. We expect Mexico will be a major recipient of global investment and trade flows in the years ahead. Therefore, we plan to maintain a significant, locally licensed bank there and invest to capture growth in a core and high-returning hub of our institutional network.  
This won't be a simple transaction. We have spent the last several months working through how to get the best results for our shareholders and be true to our local stakeholders. We will begin the separation process immediately and expect to begin the sales process in the spring. And of course, there will be an opportunity to return excess capital from the transaction to our shareholders. 
This is our final decision in terms of market exits as we conclude our strategy refresh and approach Investor Day.  
I'm really looking forward to talking to you about the future Citi on March 2. Today, we are going to talk you through the changes we're making to align our organization and financial reporting with our refreshed strategy. Now these changes will also allow us to reduce structural complexity and its associated costs. Amongst other things, this is going to help make Citi easier for our investors to understand. You'll be able to see and assess more simply the core businesses that make up Citi going forward.  
First, we're creating a new personal banking and wealth management segment, which will be run by Anand Selva. This will consist of 2 distinct reporting units: our U.S. personal banking businesses; and our global wealth management business, which is going to include the private bank.  
Second, on the institutional side of the house, which will continue to be run by Paco Ybarra. We will begin reporting under 3 units: services, banking and markets. Services will include Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services, and this reflects just how important we believe these businesses are to Citi's future.  
Finally, we will create a new segment, Legacy Franchises, which will house all the businesses we intend to exit. We're going to begin reporting our financials along these segments and reporting units no later than the second quarter to ensure you have the information you need to measure our progress and hold us accountable, and we really look forward to sharing our strategy and plans for how these businesses will work together and deliver for our shareholders on Investor Day in March.  
Now turning to earnings. We had a decent end to 2021. As you can see on Slide 2, we closed out the quarter with net income of $3.2 billion and EPS of $1.46. That includes a $1.2 billion hit to EBIT primarily related to the wind down of our Korean consumer business. Excluding those impacts, our net income would be $4.2 billion with an EPS of $1.99. Our net income for the full year of $22 billion reflects an improved credit environment and we had a resulting RoTCE of 13.4%. 
In ICG, we had another strong quarter in investment banking and gained share for the year in M&A. And we continue to make significant investments in talent, and we see a very solid pipeline of transactions ahead of us.  
Now while we could have had a better balanced performance in fixed income in the quarter, equities finished 2021 up 25% for the year. The rebound TTS has seen in trade flows and cash volumes was not quite enough to offset the current rate environment, but it bodes well for 2022. Indeed, we think the cycle has turned for this business and it is poised to benefit as monetary policy changes and growth accelerates. You've heard Mark and I talk about improving the revenue mix of our institutional businesses as a priority, and it's yielding results with another quarter of strong momentum in fee growth across products. 
Parts of our consumer businesses are still weathering COVID's disruptive impact on customer behavior. In the U.S., strong purchase sales continued to be offset by elevated payment rates, but we did see loans increase in branded cards this quarter. Deposits and AUM continued to grow, with digital deposits up nearly 20% for the full year. For the year, we returned nearly $12 billion in capital to our shareholders and we grew our tangible book value per share by 7% to $79.16. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% on a standardized basis as we built the capital needed to absorb the impact of SACR. Now keep in mind, that regulatory change didn't take effect until January 1. While this caused us to temporarily pause our stock buyback, we will resume buybacks this quarter now that, that impact has been addressed.  
Finally, as Slide 3 shows, we are executing and delivering against our priorities: the strategy refresh, the transformation and our culture, and we are doing so with a real sense of urgency. First, on the strategy. We are laser focused on swiftly and successfully implementing the strategic decisions we made over the past year to improve returns to our investors. We have signed deals in 6 of the Asia consumer markets including the agreement to sell 4 markets that we announced yesterday. This means that within 8 months of making the decision to exit these 13 businesses, we have a clear path in a majority of them, and we are well into the process in the remaining markets.  
In Korea, we were decisive in determining the best path for our shareholders was to wind down our consumer operation, and we're able to get most of that charge behind us this quarter. Another area where we haven't wasted any time is wealth management, where we grew our ranks by a net 800 advisers relationship managers and others over the course of the year. They helped us add about 750 private bank clients and 45,000 Citi Gold clients in 2021. 
In what we've known as U.S. Personal Banking, we've seen good uptake of new products such as the custom cash card, and we've been building out digital platforms to capture opportunities in installment lending. And in addition to the progress we're seeing in TTS, we've also been building out our security services platform. We couldn't be more pleased to deepen our relationship with BlackRock by becoming the largest custodian for their iShares ETF. 
Second priority, we continue to execute on our transformation agenda in order to demonstrably strengthen our risk and controls as well as modernize our bank for a digital world. This work, it's foundational for everything we want to achieve. We are enhancing our operating model to improve long-term efficiency and our service to clients.  
As it relates to the consent orders, we are deep into execution mode. We continue to be in constructive dialogue with our regulators as we get their feedback and incorporate it into our ongoing execution and project plans.
Third, and relatedly, we are building a culture that expects excellence and demands accountability. We're driving this effort in a variety of ways, including a more robust performance management process at this past year-end, shifting the mix of compensation to better align with shareholders' interests and various culture-changing initiatives. A culture of excellence also means creating a record of achievement that our people can be proud of. 
One area that our people take particular pride in is our ESG efforts. Later this month, we will share with you our plan to reach net zero by 2050, a commitment I made on my first day as CEO 10 months ago.  And of course, we are going to do all this with a singular focus on our clients as we help them navigate COVID. We certainly hope Omicron is the final disruptive phase of this pandemic, but there are also quite a few other issues to navigate, whether macroeconomic, such as inflation, or geopolitical such as tensions with Russia. We have seen the resilience and the importance of Citi as we supported our clients through unchartered waters, and we will be with them in the next chapter as well.  
So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we would be delighted to take your questions."

We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start by walking you through the financial reporting changes we plan on making in more detail. Then I'm going to walk you through the 2021 financial impact from",3112,"Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start by walking you through the financial reporting changes we plan on making in more detail. Then I'm going to walk you through the 2021 financial impact from the 13 Asia market exits as well as Mexico, and changes we are making to our financial disclosure. And then finally, the quarterly results.  
As part of our strategy refresh, we've started to make changes to better align with our vision and strategy. We refreshed our earnings presentation and included additional metrics and key drivers for the ICG businesses. Our goal is to simplify our financial reporting to make it much easier for our investors to understand our performance and our key assets.
Turning to Slide 4, we lay out the details of the changes in the financial reporting that Jane mentioned. First, we intend to move the consumer, small business and middle market banking operations of Citibanamex, and the 13 Asia consumer exits under a new segment called Legacy Franchises. This will allow you to better understand the financials of the remaining company that will exist post these exits. We've experienced managing businesses being divested and are putting a dedicated team in place to manage the new segment. This will free up the management teams of the go-forward businesses to fully focus on executing on the firm's strategy.  
Second, we are reorganizing our reporting units to help you better understand the financials of our businesses and the value they bring to Citi. Starting with ICG, we will move TTS and security services to a reporting unit called Services.  These businesses are foundational for us as they have a unique position given their global footprint and full suite product offering. Markets will, therefore, no longer include security services and instead will only include equity and fixed income markets.  
And lastly on ICG, banking will only include advisory, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and corporate lending. The Global Consumer Bank, GCB, will be renamed Personal Banking and Wealth Management, PBWM. The Private Bank will move from ICG to PBWM. As a reminder, we announced in January of last year that we created a single wealth management organization under Citi Global Wealth, now called Global Wealth Management, which is a distinct reporting unit. The creation of this unit unifies the wealth management teams creating a single, integrated platform serving clients across the wealth continuum from the affluent segment to the ultra-high net worth clients.  
North America Consumer will be renamed to U.S. Personal Banking and will remain a reporting unit under PBWM. This unit will continue to include branded cards, retail services and retail banking. We plan on providing the financials for the new reporting units on this page under the ICG and PBWM segments, starting no later than the second quarter earnings. And our Investor Day will be a natural opportunity to bring together all the work over the past year and lay out our medium-term vision and strategy for the firm.
Slide 5 shows the contribution of the Citibanamex businesses that we plan to exit as well as the contribution from the 13 Asia markets. Hopefully, this gives you a better sense of the financial results for the combined exits. And in the appendix on Page 18, we have more detail on the 13 Asia exit markets and the deals that we've announced to date.  
Turning to Mexico. As Jane mentioned, we remain committed to Mexico and will continue to serve our institutional and private bank clients there. That said, upon very careful consideration and analysis, we decided that we are no longer the optimal owner for the businesses that we're exiting. Mexico consumer and small business banking operations included in the intended exit represents the entirety of the Latin America Global Consumer Banking unit and the Mexico middle market banking business that is currently included in Citi's Institutional Clients Group segment.  
On the left side of the page, we show key figures for 2020 and 2021 for the businesses we intend to exit in Mexico. In 2021, the businesses contributed $4.7 billion of revenue and $1.1 billion of net income. The businesses in total had $20 billion of loans, $31 billion of deposits and approximately $4 billion of allocated TCE. Again, we do not yet have a transaction and are pursuing multiple divestiture paths, so the ultimate financial impact of a transaction is not yet known. We will keep you updated on our progress as we run a thoughtful process that takes into consideration what is in the best interest of our shareholders as well as our clients and employees in Mexico.  
In addition to the opportunity to return additional capital to shareholders, these divestitures will also allow us to simplify the management and organizational structure across the firm.  
Now turning to Slide 6. As we've gone through our strategy refresh and simplification, we've been reviewing our disclosure and terminology and have decided that now is the right time to more closely align with our peers. First, revenue that we previously referred to as net interest revenue will now be called net interest income, and revenue that we previously referred to as non-NIR will now be called noninterest revenue.  
Second, as you can see on the page, we've revised how we account for insurance paid on our deposits, including FDIC and foreign deposit insurance. We have previously accounted for the deposit insurance as a contra revenue and net interest income. However, beginning this quarter, we will report it as an expense and remove it from net interest income. And as a reminder, this change is earnings neutral. We've made this change to make it easier for you to compare us to our peers, and we have revised prior years to reflect the same reporting treatment to assist with comparability for 2019 to 2021, and the rest of the presentation will also reflect these 2 changes.  
On Slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and an EPS of $1.46, an RoTCE of 7.4% on $17 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are costs of approximately $1.2 billion, primarily related to the voluntary retirement program we offered in conjunction with the wind down of our Korea consumer business, as well as some additional Asia exit impacts which I will collectively refer to as the Asia divestiture impacts going forward. Excluding these impacts, EPS would have been $1.99, with an RoTCE of approximately 10%.   
In the quarter, total revenues increased by 1% from last year as strength in noninterest revenue driven by ICG, specifically TTS, Security Services and Investment Banking, was mostly offset by lower net interest income across GCB and ICG. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, an increase of 18% versus the prior year. Excluding the Asia divestiture cost, expenses would have increased by 8%. Increased expenses were largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit in the quarter, primarily driven by an ACL release of approximately $1.4 billion related to the improved macro backdrop and continued improvement in portfolio quality.  
Now turning to the full year. Our revenues were down 5%, driven by the normalization in markets as well as elevated payment rates in consumer, somewhat offset by strong noninterest revenue growth across ICG, and in particular, in investment banking, TTS and security services. Our full year expenses were up 9%, but excluding Asia divestiture costs, our expenses were up 6%. Also for the full year, we generated RoTCE of 13% and 14% excluding Asia-related divestiture impacts. As a reminder, we had a benefit of close to $9 billion in ACL releases for the full year.  
On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2021, excluding Asia divestiture impacts, expenses were up 6%, in line with previous guidance. Looking forward, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do. The divestitures provide an opportunity to simplify our management and organizational structure. We're also taking a hard look at our structural expenses, with an eye towards operating as efficiently and soundly as possible and self-funding investments. We have a lot more to say about this at our Investor Day.  
On Slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $130 million on a sequential basis, driven by North America Consumer. Sequentially, net interest margin remained relatively stable. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was flat. Also on a year-over-year basis, average deposits grew in the quarter as we continue to deepen relationships with our institutional clients as well as our consumer clients, particularly in North America. Average loans were roughly flat year-over-year as growth in the ICG was offset by a decline in GCB.  
As the probability of higher rates has increased over the last few quarters, let me make a few comments regarding the potential impact from higher rates. In our 10-Q, we disclosed interest rate sensitivity assuming a parallel shift and a runoff balance sheet. This is different from our peers' methodology, which tends to assume a static balance sheet. Assuming a static balance sheet and a 100 basis point parallel shift, we would expect Citi's total net interest income across all currencies to increase by over 3x more than what was disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q, or roughly $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income.  
On Slide 10, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.3 trillion balance sheet, about 25% or $530 billion consists of HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. And we continue to optimize our balance sheet, deploying excess liquidity into securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the market, as well as reducing our short-term and long-term debt sequentially and year-over-year. On the loan side, corporate loans represent approximately 60% of total loans, with loans to corporates outside of the U.S. Representing approximately 30% of total loans. And as we've mentioned in the past, about 80% of our total corporate loans are investment grade.  
From a capital perspective, we ended the year with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 12.2%, as we prepared to adopt SACR on January 1. Having adopted SACR and maintained our capital ratio target, we are resuming buybacks this quarter to similar levels to what you saw in the second and third quarter of 2021. As we look into the remainder of the year, there are a number of variables with respect to capital. These include regulatory headwinds that are impacting us, along with the rest of the industry, such as elevated GCIB surcharges, as well as the timing and impact from the divestitures of the 13 Asia exits and Mexico.  
In light of this, you should expect us to manage to a CET1 ratio closer to 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase at the beginning of 2023. That said, we remain focused on all aspects of capital with the goal of maintaining a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. And as you know, under the SCB framework, we can assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year with the goal of returning excess capital to shareholders.  
On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year, driven by investment banking, private bank and security services fees, partially offset by a decline in markets. Expenses increased 10% year-over-year, driven by transformation, business-led investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit of approximately $300 million as net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL release. And we continue to see strong credit performance, with net credit losses declining on a year-over-year basis and nonaccrual loans down sequentially and year-over-year. This resulted in net income of $2.5 billion, down approximately 22% from the prior year, largely driven by the higher expenses and a smaller ACL release versus the prior year. And ICG delivered a 10.8% RoTCE for the quarter.  
We also saw a 5% growth in both loans and deposits on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. As for the full year, ICG delivered approximately $16 billion of net income on $44 billion of revenue with an RoTCE of roughly 17%.  
On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and key drivers for our ICG business for the fourth quarter. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were slightly down versus the prior year, driven by continued headwinds from rates offset by 18% growth in fees. In fact, our highest fee quarter ever. And revenue did increase sequentially, driven by both net interest income and strong fee growth. We continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS on a year-over-year basis that indicate continued strong client activity. Since this is the first time we are showing key metrics that demonstrate this momentum, I want to briefly walk you through each one and what it represents.  
U.S. dollar clearing transactions are up 4%, which reflect the clearing and settlement activity of commercial and treasury flows for financial institutions. Cross-border flows were up 15%. These flows represent our global payment flows, where we provide cross-border solutions for our clients that are fully integrated across our TTS and Markets business and over 145 currencies. And importantly, this client activity drives recurring fee revenues and generate significant operating deposits. 
Commercial card volumes, which reflect travel, purchase and virtual card activity across all clients are up 48%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue.  
Investment banking revenues were up 43% year-over-year, driven by growth across products, including record advisory performance, the best advisory quarter we've had in over a decade. Private Bank revenues were up 6% year-over-year as we continue to see strong momentum in new client acquisitions. Overall markets revenues were down 17% versus last year. And while there were different dynamics that played through fixed income and equity markets performance, the performance is against a very strong quarter last year. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 20% year-over-year. While we had solid growth in FX and commodities, this was more than offset by a decline in rates and spread products.  
Equity Markets revenues were down 3% year-over-year as continued growth in prime finance balances and structured activities was offset by a decline in cash. Security Services revenues grew 5% year-over-year as fees grew 11%, driven by higher settlement volumes and higher assets under custody, partially offset by interest rate headwinds.  
Now turning to Slide 13. Here we show the results for our Global Consumer Banking business for the fourth quarter in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues across regions. Expenses were up 34% year-over-year, driven by the Asia divestiture costs. Excluding these costs, expenses were up 9%, driven by transformation and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $105 million benefit this quarter as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. The NCL rate for the quarter was 1.2%, a decline of 61 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. We released over $900 million of ACL this quarter related to continued improvement in our economic outlook and portfolio quality, partially offset by volume growth. This resulted in a net income decline of 42% and an RoTCE of 8%. Excluding the Asia divestitures impacts, net income would have grown 44% and resulted in an RoTCE of 20%. As for the full year, GCB delivered $6 billion of net income on $27 billion of revenues, with an RoTCE of 17% and 22% excluding Asia divestiture impacts.  
On Slide 14, we show GCB revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics for the fourth quarter. Branded cards revenues declined 3% year-over-year on higher payment rates and portfolio mix. We're seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 43%, card sales volumes up 24% and average loans up 3%. In fact, the fourth quarter acquisitions exceeded the same quarter in 2019 by 2%, the first quarter to do so since the onset of the pandemic. 
Retail Services revenues declined 10% year-over-year, driven by a 2% decline in net interest income due to elevated payment rates as well as by higher partner payments driven by improved credit performance. But despite this, we are seeing positive underlying drivers with account acquisitions up 6% and spend up 16% on a year-over-year basis.  While we're encouraged by these underlying drivers in both cards businesses, payment rates do remain stubbornly high, impacting our loan growth and revenue growth in both cards businesses. 
Retail banking revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower deposit spreads as well as lower mortgage revenue. However, underlying drivers remained strong, with deposits up 13%, Citigold households up 9% and assets under management up 8% year-over-year as we continue to execute on our North America retail strategy with a focus on our global wealth unit.  
Asia revenues declined 7% year-over-year, largely driven by rate headwinds and higher payment rates. Performance in the wealth hubs exceeded that of the overall region with deposit growth of 12%, AUM growth of 13% and 16% growth in Citigold and CPC clients. Latin America revenues declined 3% year-over-year, mainly due to lower loan volumes in both retail and cards.  
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased year-over-year, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down year-over-year, largely due to the wind down of legacy assets. Cost of credit was benign. At this point, we typically give a full year outlook. However, since we have our Investor Day coming up on March 2, we plan on bringing everything together at that point to talk about 2022 in the full context of our strategy and medium-term performance expectations. As part of our strategy refresh, our goal is to be as simple and transparent as possible. And I hope you like the new earnings presentation, and we will continue to evolve it going forward.  
And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

You will recall, John, that historically, we have looked in our disclosure at a run-off balance sheet. And that obviously has deposits running off as they term out. That has loans running off as they mature. Others take an approach where they look at a static balance sheet, right? And so we've run the analysis around assuming a static balance sheet and assuming 100 basis point parallel shift in a rising rate environment, obviously, across all currencies. We obviously have a mix of U.S. dollar and foreign currencies as well. And when we run that analysis, now assuming that the balance sheet is static, that is the deposit levels, loan levels, et cetera, that delivers 3x more than what we disclosed in the Q in the third quarter. So that's the $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income. So obviously, retaining -- or assuming that the deposit levels stay the same, allow us to generate more net interest income and that's a major driver in the number range or the range that I provided."

But I think there are a couple of things that are important to keep in mind that we're looking at for 2022. One is the drivers that we mentioned earlier. So a lot of the underlying drivers in our franchise look very strong and are driving healthy fee revenue growth. And I would expect with an outlook for positive GDP that, that's going to continue to play to our advantage in 2022.  
The second thing I'd point out is the assumptions around interest rate hikes in 2022. I have as many as 3 or 4 depending on the economists' view that you listen to. And that obviously is going to play to our favor as well when you think about the number of accrual businesses that we have, whether it's our TTS franchise or our private bank, et cetera, et cetera. So those are important factors that impact the top line, and that we expect to help contribute to some growth coming out of 2022.  
I mentioned the loan growth on the branded cards portfolio. For cards it's really going to be about payment rates and how they taper off -- hopefully taper off. They've been stubbornly high through all of 2021. So hopefully, we start to see some of that taper off and we get a little bit of growth in average interest-earning balances in the back half of the year, but those are important factors that need to play through into 2022."

But in terms of a stock price that's this low, I mean, the stock price relative to the financial index is one of the all-time lows. Wouldn't you move buybacks up in the priority order? Or what else can you do or say to show that shareholders matter?  
Jane, I mean, you've done so much on the E side. You certainly have done a lot on the S side. But the G in ESG, when it relates to shareholders, shareholders have been left back for so long. Just seeing what else you might be able to do or say as it relates to recognizing shareholders and their desire to have a stock price that does better?"

And Mike, I know we need to make the bank more shareholder-aligned and friendly, and we are doing so. So let me give you 4 examples. 
Our strategy will generate and we will return excess capital to shareholders. And as you say, given where the stock is trading, it makes buybacks highly attractive. 
Second, we're taking the structure and strategic decisions to put the bank in the best position to drive shareholder value. And you can see we're executing and we are delivering with urgency, and we're very driven to get the valuation in a far higher place than it is today.  
Third, we're changing many elements of the financial reporting that's easier for our shareholders to understand the bank, and we're going to be as transparent as possible so you can measure our progress and results. And I think the structure that Mark laid out and I gave a high level on, it will make that job much easier. 
And then finally, and a topic I know you've been quite vocal around, we are also making changes to compensation. So more of our senior business leaders will be on the PSUs for this coming year. We've moved to 100% deferred stock versus a mix of stock and cash in the geographies that we're permitted to do so. And we're increasing the importance of returns in determining performance evaluations. There is a myriad of -- and rounds of different actions that we're taking because our shareholders matter to us. And we want to get our valuation up to one that we think has -- realizes its full potential."

And at the same time, I would expect that you'd probably want to grow your RWAs? I know your RWAs were down 5% Q2 and maybe that was part of the reason why FICC was a little light. So could you help me understand just how we should think about that trajectory and the drivers of that CET1 change, because it will have some impact on how we're thinking about the rev growth in the markets business."

So we are looking at, obviously, how we continue to invest in the franchise, particularly where there are areas of growth. At the same time, ensure that we're delivering buybacks or share, return to shareholders.  
As I look at the CET1 ratio, we're ending the year at about 12.2%. As you know, SACR kicks in -- or has kicked in on January 1. We're ending therefore, on January 1 at roughly around where our target is. And over the course of the year, we'll be able to absorb growth in the businesses where there is a need to do that while continuing to identify offsets to both SACR but also low-returning assets that we may have and ridding ourselves of those and generating income as well as the capital from the divestitures that we will be able to close throughout the course of the year.  
And so as we look at that plan, the start of the year, which is close to our target, towards the end of 2022, we will have to build that back up to about 12% in order to absorb the GCIB headwind, assuming there's no relief provided to that, which then kicks in at the beginning of 2023. And so through the course of the year, we'll utilize through RWA, we'll free up capital and return capital to shareholders. We'll generate more earnings. But at the end of the year, we'll need to kind of end on the higher end or towards that 12%."

That would drive about 10 basis points or so, or 10 points I should say, on the GCIB score.  
The total for the divestitures that were -- that we've earmarked, it's about $85 billion in deposits. And so you can do the math that we'd get some benefit from that. You're right, and I don't have numbers that I would share at this point, but -- and in part because the Fed has to run their analysis. But you're right, from a CCAR point of view, when you think about the stress capital buffer, there's an impact to PPNR, but more importantly, to stress losses that will play through as well.  
As you know, that impact as well as the deposit impact won't really come into play until we've closed on these transactions. But it certainly is a factor to how we think about the longer-term capital planning, and it certainly is something that I'm going to talk more about at Investor Day on March 2."

I'm not going to give guidance on 2022, but let me try and frame out how we're thinking about it because I think it is important.

I'm not going to give guidance on 2022, but let me try and frame out how we're thinking about it because I think it is important. Both Jane and I recognize that we've got -- there's a lot of static we're getting, excuse me.  
So in terms of the expenses, we obviously have a large expense base. We've seen growth play out this year. But I think there's some real opportunities over time to attack the expense base, and that's exactly what we intend to do. So if you think about the divestitures, I'll start there for a second. There's some $6.8 billion of expenses tied to divestitures. As those divestitures get closed out, some of that will naturally go away. The balance of that, which tends to be referred to as stranded cost, we are already putting in place a team to focus on attacking and driving out that stranded cost.  
The second point that I'll bring up around this is the transformation. The transformation has driven 3 percentage points of growth this year. I do expect that there's more growth associated with that, particularly since we're still doing more hiring. There's more tech spend that will be required. But the transformation over time will deliver efficiencies, will reduce the manual touch points, will drive straight-through processing and therefore, will allow for us to bring our expenses down.  
And the final piece that I'll mention is the strategy. And so Jane mentioned in our strategy, a focus on core businesses. And that's going to allow for us to look at the organizational structure and identify more simplification opportunities in the way we manage and run the firm. We do about $300 million to $400 million of productivity savings a quarter. That's not enough. We think there's more opportunity for efficiencies than that. And it's those opportunities that we're going to chase down in order to fund some of this investment spend that we expect in the next couple of years. More on that at Investor Day."

So -- as I've mentioned before, I mean when you look at what's going on with cards, across the board, we are seeing increases in spend volume. So branded card spend volume is up 24%. Retail services spend volume is up 16%. So very healthy spend volume. People are using our cards, which is a good thing. 
In terms of the liquidity that's still out there in the market, even though savings rates have started to normalize, there's still a significant amount of liquidity that's out there in the market. And that's showing up in payment rates in both branded cards and retail services and, frankly, in some of the international card businesses as well. And that has not subsided. 
And so we did start to see growth in branded cards loans. Average loans are up 3%, branded cards. The end-of-period loans were up 5%. What matters a lot when you come out of a crisis like this is how you reinvest. And so we've spent a lot of time focused on targeting new customers and driving new account acquisitions. Our new account acquisitions are up 43% in branded cards. And we've been also driving that just generally across the board in retail services as well. So getting a good -- a very good response in terms of new accounts coming on board. 
We've also been focused on how we drive installment lending activity, just kind of to broaden the lending that we're doing with this customer base, and we've seen significant growth in our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products as we've targeted customers who have historically been transactors to really move them onto that product. So very good growth there. In fact, in 2021, we've not only gotten the growth just in aggregate. But if I look at kind of installment lending, we've got 90% of the total installment sales are in digital sales, which is another kind of low-cost acquisition approach that we've taken. 
So good underlying indicators there. But again, it's not until payment rates start to subside. We would expect, hope that, that would start to show up towards the back half of 2022. 
In terms of the losses, which was the other part of your question, very low loss levels. You heard me mention the delinquency rates earlier. When I look at -- or the loss rates earlier, when I look at delinquency trends, there's really nothing to focus on there. They remain quite low. And we don't see any signs or any areas of concern, I would say. But I would imagine those 2 would start to normalize as payment rates start to come down."

EMEA and North America are both up year-over-year due to continued momentum in M&A. 
So we feel very good about it. We think the pipeline still looks very strong. We think the investments that we've made in bringing on bankers in some of the sectors we needed to beef up, sectors such as health care, technology, sponsors group, those investments are certainly starting to pay off.

The second thing I'd say is that we are investing in the franchise for the long term, right, as opposed to trying to hit some short-term metric. And so that does involve us putting that money to work where there is client demand and where it leverages the competitive advantages that we have developed. And so that is the way we approach this with, again, an eye towards ensuring that we're clear and transparent with our investors.

The other layer of complexity is around the CTA, and you've heard us spend some time on that when we talked about the Australia sale. And I introduce it as a complexity because there's an accounting treatment associated with the CTA that happens at signing, that is separate from the capital implication that happens at closing. So with a CTA, the capital impact flows through AOCI, but it's neutral once the deal is closed. And Mexico, the consumer business would have a DTA of a little bit less than $3 billion or so.

Mark, I was going to ask -- well, I guess technically one question, but it's really a 3-parter. You might need to grab a pen and paper. But I wanted to just unpack some of the comments you made on the NII sensitivity and reporting differences versus peers. You noted a more than 3x increase in NII, assuming a static balance sheet, but there's still a lot of investors that just question your rate sensitivity profile given the fairly modest NII growth that we saw in the last cycle. 
And the first question, I just wanted to start by asking, given your heavier institutional deposit gearing, wouldn't it be reasonable for us to expect that your deposit runoff would actually be greater than peers? Two, does the NII guidance contemplate liability sensitivity in the markets business? And could you help us size that potential drag? And then just lastly, it's more of a catch all. Any idiosyncratic factors that you could speak to that would support a better NII outcome or higher rate benefit versus what we saw in the last cycle?"

And you can see the magnitude of that difference is pretty sizable. There's still going to be a difference between us and peers, but that difference narrows when you put it on a comparable basis. 
We do have a skew towards institutional clients, and they do carry a higher beta associated with them. But we also have a skew towards international currencies and we make good spreads there as well. In terms of the impact through markets, the impact -- I think the market's impact can come in any number of ways. I think rate moves and other uncertainty and volatility in the market can drive broader markets revenues, which we would potentially see depending on how investors have to reposition their books. 
In terms of the last part of your question, I don't think there's anything else that I would point to. I mean, obviously, with the excess liquidity that we've seen and been carrying in the market, we've been putting that to work in investments. We've increased our investment portfolio by some $70 billion. We expanded the duration to about 2.85, and we still have significant dry powder too with the work with either client demand or in an increasing rate environment, which we expect."

And I'd like to start by reiterating my appreciation to those of you who participated in our Investor Day last month. We greatly value the opportunity to walk you through our refreshed strategy and our plans for the next few years. Given how much time we spent on our strategy that day, today, we'll be focusing on the quarter. Nonetheless, as we committed, we will keep you updated on our progress, and you can see the latest report card on Slide 2. 
Today is also the first time we're reporting quarterly results under our new segmentation, which will help you track our efforts. I got to say it feels like an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Investor Day. So I'm going to talk about the macro environment first. And then after I talk about the quarter, I'll discuss how we're handling Russia, and Mark is also going to go through it in more detail. 
We've been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged, and we intend to remain so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world, further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure. Back recently from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, it is security, energy, food, defense, cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialogue. The macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain. And while my job is to prepare for all outcomes,  our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support near-term growth in the U.S. economy in the face of inflationary pressures. But we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in Europe hit hardest. 
With central banks responding to inflation, we're entering a period of higher and a flatter U.S. yield curve. Energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally, but we don't believe we're at the start of a new long super cycle, and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels. So that as a backdrop, I think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter. Earlier today, we reported net income of $4.3 billion, EPS of $2.02 and an RoTCE of 10.5%. These numbers include impacts related to the divestitures, so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about 150 basis points of RoTCE. 
And let's turn to the performance of our 5 main reporting units. Well, given our emphasis on Services, I'm particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions, fee growth, trade loans and cross-border transactions buoyed by higher rates led to year-over-year revenue growth of 18%. Security Services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up 6%. In our Markets business, our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well, aided by our mix with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and commodities. This led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of 2021. 
As you might expect, Investment Banking is a different story. While our performance on the advisory side was respectable, I think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward, even if the wallet remains smaller. Our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise. Having said that, we don't expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry until the geopolitical situation and client sentiment improve. 
In U.S. Personal Banking, we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and spend volume growth. So we like where this business is headed. Geopolitics dampened performance in Global Wealth Management this quarter. While revenues improved in the U.S., Our clients in Asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our Markets franchise as well. As you know, we're hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as Citi Alliance, which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisers. As a result of these efforts, we continue to add clients in both the private bank and in Citi Gold. 
Turning to capital. We returned $4 billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter. We now have about 6% fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago. At the same time, a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through OCI and largely caused our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to come in at 11.4% this quarter. 
I want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment, which I spoke about, combined with the impacts of our divestitures, create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year. Now whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year, we have a path to our year-end target of 12%. And Mark is going to walk you through these details. And let me be clear, we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders. 
As you heard at Investor Day, we're focused on our transformation, and we're making the investments in our infrastructure, risk and controls and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make Citi a winning firm. I recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run. But I firmly believe that success here will not only lead to [indiscernible] our regulatory obligations, but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term. 
So far this year, we've announced new agreements to sell a further 7 consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA, the most recent of which were India and Bahrain. We are beginning the sales process in Mexico, and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise. As you've heard me say, this is not an uncomplicated transaction, given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence.  We will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will keep you posted on any developments concerning the 3 remaining markets: China, Poland and of course, Russia. 
We started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to Russia in January, and we benefited from being on the front foot here. We've been managing down our financial exposures, both in level and composition and there at a reasonable level, especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter. We've also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond Russia and Ukraine. And our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in Russia remains. We are in continuous communication with the U.S. government, and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime. 
But I've run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm. Our people in Ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country where they can help NGOs deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible. And many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees, and we will continue to help in any way we can. 
So with all that is going on in the world, we remain laser-focused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation. I expect macro environment to remain unpredictable to say the least in the backdrop of a war, which is equally tragic and unnecessary and a persistent pandemic. And I can speak to the last one personally, having just recovered from a brief encounter with COVID, as much as I would like to, I can't blame [indiscernible] for it. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted to take your questions."

I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end with the results of each segment. 
On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02 and with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are Asia consumer divestiture-related impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. In the quarter, total revenues decreased 2% as strength in net interest income driven by Services and PBWM, was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue across businesses. That said, we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on Investor Day, which I will walk you through in detail shortly. 
Total expenses of $13.2 billion increased 15% or 10% excluding the Asia divestiture-related impacts I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $755 million as net credit losses of $872 million were partially offset by a net ACL release. Embedded in the net ACL release is a Russia-related build of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $1 billion related to exposure to Russia and about $900 million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment. This was more than offset by a release related to a COVID-19 uncertainty reserve, primarily in U.S. Personal Banking, given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio, specifically in the U.S. As of today, we have about $17.9 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.35%. 
On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, we incurred some divestiture-related costs this quarter. These costs largely related to a goodwill write-down that we incurred in legacy franchise as part of our resegmentation and divestitures. It is important to note the goodwill impact is capital neutral. Excluding the divestiture-related costs, expenses increased by approximately 10%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to the risks, controls, data and finance programs, and approximately 30% of that is related to technology investments. About 2% of the increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers. In addition, we are investing in technology across services, wealth and cards. 1% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in markets and cards. And approximately 4% and was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Across all of these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 12% for the quarter. 
On Slide 6, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. As Jane mentioned, as of the end of the quarter, our remaining exposure to Russia stood at about $7.8 billion, down from $9.8 billion at year-end. And importantly, the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way. We have reduced our direct Russia country risk exposure from $5.4 billion to about $3.7 billion, which consists of loans, AFS, derivatives and off-balance sheet exposure. The remaining exposure, which previously totaled $4.4 billion, now totals $4.1 billion and consist of deposits and cash with the Central Bank, reverse repos and cross-border exposure. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $700 million, down from about $1 billion at year-end. And the currency translation adjustment or CTA related to our net investment stands at $1 billion. 
And as I mentioned previously, we took credit reserves of about $1.9 billion, with about $1 billion for direct exposure to Russia and another approximately $900 million for broader impacts given the macro environment. So we feel we have reserved prudently at this point. In the normal course of our planning and risk management, we run a range of stress scenarios, and we've taken the same approach with our exposure to Russia. And as a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down meaningfully from what I described at our Investor Day. 
On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $50 million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count. Excluding day count, net interest income increased by approximately $290 million. Sequentially, net interest margin increased by 7 basis points as lower average deposits in services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in Markets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million, driven by cards, deposits volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets, and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM. 
On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 23% or $551 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. From a capital perspective, we ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 11.4% under both standardized and advanced approaches, with standardized remaining the binding ratio, down from 12.2% at year-end. During the quarter, we adopted SACR and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates. We will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter. However, it is important to note that despite these impacts, we continue to expect to manage to a CET1 ratio of 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2023.  We expect the combination of net income generation, DTA utilization and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in Asia to be sufficient to reach the 12% CET1 ratio by the end of the year. 
As we said at Investor Day, we're committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio, reversing that $4 billion interest rate-driven impact, we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time. And as you know, under the SCB framework and given the uncertain macro environment,  we assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. For the second quarter, we expect only a modest amount of buybacks, and we'll evaluate that level throughout the quarter, taking into account market conditions. 
On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 capital ratio to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. As I just mentioned, our CET1 capital ratio ended the year at 12.2% as we build capital to absorb the impact of SACR on our RWA. Post SACR adoption, our ratio stood at 11.8% as of January 1, 2022. Given the sizable impact of some of the drivers, I wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of about 11.4%. First, we generated net income, which added 35 basis points. Second, over $4 billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about 36 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 35 basis point reduction. Fourth,  the increase in disallowed DTA, largely driven by the reduction in CET1 due to the interest rate impact I just mentioned, drove another 15 basis point reduction. Finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors, including a reduction in RWA. With all of that said, as I just mentioned, we have a path to a 12% CET1 capital ratio by year-end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. 
On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues decreased 2%, largely driven by Investment Banking partially offset by an increase in services revenue. And Markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year. Expenses increased 13% driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was nearly $1 billion, largely driven by a $1.5 billion build related to our exposures in Russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment. And outside of Russia, we continue to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients' balance sheets remain healthy. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51%, largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by trade finance. Average deposits grew 2% as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 11.2%. 
On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you each quarter. In Services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients and we expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 18%, driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients. And we continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and and commercial card volumes up 54%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. 
Securities Services revenues grew 6% as net interest income grew 17%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and fee revenues grew 2% due to higher assets under custody. Overall markets revenues were down 2% versus a strong quarter last year. In the quarter, activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of Fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 1%. We saw strong client engagement, particularly with our corporate clients in FX and commodities, with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility. Spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity. Equity Markets revenues were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year period. In the quarter, we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains or losses on loan hedges, were down 32% as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets. Investment Banking revenues were down 43% and driven by the contraction in capital markets activity, partially offset by growth in M&A. Corporate Lending revenues were down 6%, largely driven by lower average loans. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues declined 1% as net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue. Expenses were up 14%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $376 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. We had a net release of over $1 billion of ACL related to COVID-19 uncertainty reserves. I would note that even after this release, we maintained over $9.8 billion in credit reserves against our U.S. cards portfolios or approximately 7.6% of total loans. This resulted in a net income decline of 23% and an RoTCE of just over 23%. Adjusting for the ACL release, RoTCE would have been approximately 13%. 
On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Credit cards revenues declined 1% on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continue to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 24%, card spend volumes also up 24% and average loans up 7%. Retail services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments, driven by improved credit performance. And we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up 14% and average loans up 1%. 
While payment rates remain elevated, we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization. As a result, interest earning balances in branded cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis, while Retail Services grew interest-earning balances by 3% sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes. Retail banking revenues declined 6%, largely driven by lower mortgage originations. Wealth revenues declined 1%, driven by less client activity and investments, partially offset by higher deposits. Investment revenues declined as geopolitical tensions impacted the capital markets, which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity, particularly in Asia. However, underlying drivers remain strong, with average deposits up 14%, average loans up 5%, client assets up 4% and client advisers up 6%. 
On Slide 14, we show results for the legacy franchises. Revenues declined 14%, driven by lower revenue across the exit markets, largely driven by the Korea wind down as well as the muted investment activity in Asia. Expenses were up 31%, largely driven by the goodwill impairment I mentioned earlier, but again, this is neutral to capital. Cost of credit was $160 million in the quarter, driven by net credit losses, and as a result, net income declined significantly. 
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased significantly, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down largely on lower compensation expenses. 
And to briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook, at this point, we still expect to see low single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit expense growth, both excluding divestiture-related impacts this year. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

As we thought about these scenarios, as you know, we run a base scenario. We did tweak that a bit in bringing the GDP assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter, and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption. And the other piece is, when we look at the downside scenario, so our analysis for CECL is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario. Under the downside scenario, we did increase the severity of the downside to account for again a bit of the current environment that we're all managing through. So those puts and takes kind of netted out to what you see that we've reported, which is a net release, but largely driven by those 2 drivers."

Number two, what is the desire to increase the dividend even nominally in this stress test year? And third, how does the DTA impact that was negative in the first quarter turned to a positive impact?

But let's start with the beginning of your question, just kind of the 12% and how we build back up to the 12%. So we ended the quarter at an estimated 11.4 to get to the 12%, that would be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion of capital that will be required. Jane mentioned, I mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that. You pointed out a few of them. So you all have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter. So you can forecast that what that would be. There's probably another $1.6-or-so billion of a benefit from the DTA. So what I mean by that, there's the $800 million that I've referenced in the past of utilization of the DTA. And the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter. So there are 2 components that carry forwards that impact the DTA. And then there's the timing difference, which has equated to about 10% of our capital. So this quarter, we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed DTA, in part because of how the OCI reduction play through. So as that bleeds back in over time, we would expect to have capital buildup, which increases that threshold and therefore, be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the DTA. The third component would be the capital from exits. So you didn't mention that one. As you know, there are a number of exits that we're looking to close at the end of the year -- by the end of the year, they'll contribute about $4 billion of capital to that equation. And then there's the bleeding back in of the OCI impact, which will give or take, give us another $1 billion. So those are the pluses. Those are the things that kind of play in on the on the capital generation side. And then on the offsets, you've got preferred dividends, you've got common dividends, whatever growth we play out or put to work from an RWA point of view, and that leaves the balance for share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect in the second quarter, a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes. The good news is that the headwinds that we've talked about, all things being equal,  so assuming no further rate changes, many of those headwinds bleed back in over time, allowing for us to do what we've committed to, which is returning capital to shareholders over time. In terms of dividends, we always look at that as part of the CCAR submission and part of our broader capital planning, but I'll -- we'll see how the results come out from CCAR, but I would lean in on a point we've had to make a number of times now, which is given where we're trading, it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks. And so we'll likely continue to lean that way as opposed to doing a lot to change the dividend. But stay tuned as the capital planning continues to evolve."

So as you said, good, strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty that's out here, particularly as it relates to supply chains, helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that we're seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well.

I'd also point out that a number of things were important components of that. So if you look at Slide 6, you'll see that the loans, and these are both ICG and consumer loans, largely ICG, largely corporate loans have come down by $600 million. And that's really been a reduction in our risk exposure, right? So borrowers paying down, us limiting the extension of new credit, et cetera. The AFS securities have come down $600 million. And that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales. So we've gotten out of those securities. Yes, there are some mark-to-market losses, but they're not material.

Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because we've actually seen the repayment of those loans come back, and we've been -- we've had to put that cash with the Central Bank just given some of the restrictions that are there. We've been actively working down the reverse repo assets, which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure. And we've been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure. So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to 7.8%. And if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced is kind of a net of $6.8 billion, right? So the second part of your question was, how do we think about reserves and what are those different components. Well, we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have, how we're rating those entities in this environment. And then we actually run that through our models and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating. So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities, the broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what have you. And then there's a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this. So we built the reserves considering those multiple components. The last point I'd make is that, when you look at some of the names, there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country and they provide parental support for some of the exposure that's here as well. So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well."

And so it will continue to evolve. The thing I'd point you to is that as we think about managing our businesses and in particular markets. You would have heard us mention at Investor Day that we're looking -- continually looking for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet, optimize RWA, right?

We do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to OCI, and we'll continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases, which, by the way, we've been actively doing over the past couple of years. If you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved, we've been moving from out of AFS and into held to maturity over the past couple of years, reducing that risk of a negative impact to OCI.

I think part of it is I am more positive around the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer than really any other geographies around the world. And that helps with so much momentum in the labor market. We're seeing still quite a bit of excess liquidity sitting there in the back pocket of our consumers and very healthy balance sheet. I think we have peaked in the payment rates. So we're just starting to see the first signs of that coming down. And I think that's good because it's a return to be -- it should be the return this year to a more healthy behavior. The spend has obviously been quite remarkable. It's up in the mid-20%. Also great to see the experience side and that services side coming back in again. And that's we've been seeing it in travel. We've been seeing it in apparel. People like getting dressed up to go to dinner again in a restaurant.  Those different things, it's nice to see things coming back to normality.

And as you know, as I've said before, that's cross currencies, with about 2/3 of that being to non-U.S. currencies and the other 1/3 obviously being U.S. So that is still our view from an ROE point of view.

You said you underinvested in the past and everything else. But I mean, you have 1,200 basis points between your expense and revenue growth and just seems so high. But you're also guiding for what I think is like 300 basis points of that spread for the full year. So does that mean this is as bad as it gets, and that spread should be narrowed? And just some of those other inflation, volume expenses, expenses generally because it's frustrating for investors. ."

So why don't I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance.

So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that at Investor Day, that's what we talked about. We would love for the number to be different, but we understand and we know that this is what's required to get the franchise to where it needs to be. And so we're taking those hard decisions. We're spending the money where we need to spend it. We're being diligent about that to make sure that we're not being wasteful in that effort. But we don't want to create or go through the things that we've gone through in the past in the way of underinvesting. And so we're going to avoid that. The second thing is, and you acknowledge that kind of in your reference to transformation and business-led investments. On the structural investments spend, I should say, about half of that is from inflation, so not the full 4%. A portion of it is also from nonconsent order risk and control spend that we're making, things like the financial crime unit, things like cyber spend, things like the work we're doing around our wholesale credit operations, important things. And there are some productivity savings that play through that. And then the final piece on the volume related is their transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do on the trading side, their spend that we make in order to drive that activity. And the mix matters. And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter, the mix of the market's activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses that's generated through those transactions. So those are a couple of things. Again, we're consistent with guidance. We believe we're on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits. And we're looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time."

And I'd like to start by reiterating my appreciation to those of you who participated in our Investor Day last month. We greatly value the opportunity to walk you through our refreshed strategy and our plans for the next few years. Given how much time we spent on our strategy that day, today, we'll be focusing on the quarter. Nonetheless, as we committed, we will keep you updated on our progress, and you can see the latest report card on Slide 2.  
Today is also the first time we're reporting quarterly results under our new segmentation, which will help you track our efforts. I've got to say it feels like an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Investor Day. So I'm going to talk about the macro environment first. And then after I talk about the quarter, I'll discuss how we're handling Russia, and Mark is also going to go through it in more detail.  
We've been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged, and we intend to remain so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world, further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure. Back recently from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, it is security, yet energy, food, defense, cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialogue. The macro-outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain. And while my job is to prepare for all outcomes,  our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support near-term growth in the U.S. economy in the face of inflationary pressures. But we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in Europe hit hardest.  
With central banks responding to inflation, we're entering a period of higher rates and a flatter U.S. yield curve. Energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally, but we don't believe we're at the start of a new long super cycle, and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels. So with that as a backdrop, I think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter. Earlier today, we reported net income of $4.3 billion, EPS of $2.02 and an RoTCE of 10.5%. These numbers include impacts related to the divestitures, so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about 150 basis points of RoTCE.  
And let's turn to the performance of our 5 main reporting units. Well, given our emphasis on Services, I'm particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions, fee growth, trade loans and cross-border transactions buoyed by higher rates led to year-over-year revenue growth of 18%. Securities Services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up 6%. In our Markets business, our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well, aided by our mix with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and commodities. This led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of 2021.  
As you might expect, Investment Banking is a different story. While our performance on the advisory side was respectable, I think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward, even if the wallet remains smaller. Our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise. Having said that, we don't expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry until the geopolitical situation and client sentiment improve.  
In U.S. Personal Banking, we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and the spend volume growth. So we like where this business is headed. Geopolitics dampened performance in Global Wealth Management this quarter. While revenues improved in the U.S., our clients in Asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our Markets franchise as well. As you know, we're hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as Citi Alliance, which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisers. As a result of these efforts, we continue to add clients in both the Private Bank and in Citigold.  
Turning to capital. We returned $4 billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter. We now have about 6% fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago. At the same time, a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through OCI and largely caused our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to come in at 11.4% this quarter.  
I want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment, which I spoke about, combined with the impacts of our divestitures, create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year. Now whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year, we have a path to our year-end target of 12%. And Mark is going to walk you through these details. And let me be clear, we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders.  
As you heard at Investor Day, we're focused on our transformation, and we're making the investments in our infrastructure, risk and controls and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make Citi a winning firm. I recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run. But I firmly believe that success here will not only lead to satisfying our regulatory obligations, but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term.  
So far this year, we've announced new agreements to sell a further 7 consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA, the most recent of which were India and Bahrain. We are beginning the sales process in Mexico, and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise. As you've heard me say, this is not an uncomplicated transaction, given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence.  We will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will keep you posted on any development concerning the 3 remaining markets: China, Poland and of course, Russia.  
We started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to Russia in January, and we benefited from being on the front foot here. We've been managing down our financial exposures, both in level and composition and there at a reasonable level, especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter. We've also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond Russia and Ukraine. And our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in Russia remains. We are in continuous communication with the U.S. government, and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime.  
But I've run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm. Our people in Ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country where they can help NGOs deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible. And many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees, and we will continue to help in any way we can.  
So with all that is going on in the world, we remain laser-focused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation. I expect macro environment to remain unpredictable to say the least in the backdrop of a war, which is equally tragic and unnecessary and a persistent pandemic. And I can speak to the last one personally, having just recovered from a brief encounter with COVID, as much as I would like to, I can't blame Paco for it.  
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted to take your questions."
391687,712722558,2538232,"Citigroup Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2022",2022-04-14,"Earnings Calls","Citigroup Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end wi",2401,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end with the results of each segment.  
On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02 with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are Asia consumer divestiture-related impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. In the quarter, total revenues decreased 2% as strength in net interest income driven by Services and PBWM, was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue across businesses. That said, we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on Investor Day, which I will walk you through in detail shortly.  
Total expenses of $13.2 billion increased 15% or 10% excluding the Asia divestiture-related impacts I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $755 million as net credit losses of $872 million were partially offset by a net ACL release. Embedded in the net ACL release is a Russia-related build of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $1 billion related to exposure to Russia and about $900 million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment. This was more than offset by a release related to a COVID-19 uncertainty reserve, primarily in U.S. Personal Banking, given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio, specifically in the U.S. As of today, we have about $17.9 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.35%.  
On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, we incurred some divestiture-related costs this quarter. These costs largely related to a goodwill write-down that we incurred in legacy franchises as part of our resegmentation and divestitures. It is important to note the goodwill impact is capital neutral. Excluding the divestiture-related costs, expenses increased by approximately 10%, 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to the risks, controls, data and finance programs, and approximately 30% of that is related to technology investments. About 2% of the increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers. 
In addition, we are investing in technology across services, wealth and cards. 1% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in Markets and cards. And approximately 4% was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Across all of these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 12% for the quarter.  
On Slide 6, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. As Jane mentioned, as of the end of the quarter, our remaining exposure to Russia stood at about $7.8 billion, down from $9.8 billion at year-end. And importantly, the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way. We have reduced our direct Russia country risk exposure from $5.4 billion to about $3.7 billion, which consists of loans, AFS, derivatives and off-balance sheet exposure. The remaining exposure, which previously totaled $4.4 billion, now totals $4.1 billion and consist of deposits and cash with the Central Bank, reverse repos and cross-border exposure. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $700 million, down from about $1 billion at year-end. And the currency translation adjustment or CTA related to our net investment stands at $1 billion.  
And as I mentioned previously, we took credit reserves of about $1.9 billion, with about $1 billion for direct exposure to Russia and another approximately $900 million for broader impacts given the macro environment. So we feel we have reserved prudently at this point. In the normal course of our planning and risk management, we run a range of stress scenarios, and we've taken the same approach with our exposure to Russia. And as a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down meaningfully from what I described at our Investor Day.  
On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $50 million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count. Excluding day count, net interest income increased by approximately $290 million. Sequentially, net interest margin increased by 7 basis points as lower average deposits in Services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in Markets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million, driven by cards, deposits volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets, and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM.  
On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 23% or $551 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. From a capital perspective, we ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 11.4% under both standardized and advanced approaches, with standardized remaining the binding ratio, down from 12.2% at year-end. 
During the quarter, we adopted SACR and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates. We will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter. However, it is important to note that despite these impacts, we continue to expect to manage to a CET1 ratio of 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2023.  We expect the combination of net income generation, DTA utilization and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in Asia to be sufficient to reach the 12% CET1 ratio by the end of the year.  
As we said at Investor Day, we're committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio, reversing that $4 billion interest rate-driven impact, we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time. And as you know, under the SCB framework and given the uncertain macro environment,  we assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. For the second quarter, we expect only a modest amount of buybacks, and we'll evaluate that level throughout the quarter, taking into account market conditions.  
On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 capital ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. As I just mentioned, our CET1 capital ratio ended the year at 12.2% as we build capital to absorb the impact of SACR on our RWA. Post SACR adoption, our ratio stood at 11.8% as of January 1, 2022. Given the sizable impact of some of the drivers, I wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of about 11.4%. First, we generated net income, which added 35 basis points. Second, over $4 billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about 36 basis points. 
Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 35-basis point reduction. Fourth, the increase in disallowed DTA, largely driven by the reduction in CET1 due to the interest rate impact I just mentioned, drove another 15-basis point reduction. Finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors, including a reduction in RWA. With all of that said, as I just mentioned, we have a path to a 12% CET1 capital ratio by year-end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders.  
On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues decreased 2%, largely driven by Investment Banking partially offset by an increase in Services revenue. And Markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year. Expenses increased 13% driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was nearly $1 billion, largely driven by a $1.5 billion build related to our exposures in Russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment. And outside of Russia, we continue to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients' balance sheets remain healthy. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51%, largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by trade finance. Average deposits grew 2% as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 11.2%.  
On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you each quarter. In Services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients, and we expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 18%, driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients. And we continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 54%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue.  
Securities Services revenues grew 6% as net interest income grew 17%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and fee revenues grew 2% due to higher assets under custody. Overall Markets revenues were down 2% versus a strong quarter last year. In the quarter, activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of Fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 1%. We saw strong client engagement, particularly with our corporate clients in FX and commodities, with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility. Spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity. 
Equity Markets revenues were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year period. In the quarter, we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains or losses on loan hedges, were down 32% as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets. Investment Banking revenues were down 43% and driven by the contraction in capital markets activity, partially offset by growth in M&A. Corporate Lending revenues were down 6%, largely driven by lower average loans.  
Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues declined 1% as net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue. Expenses were up 14%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $376 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. We had a net release of over $1 billion of ACL related to COVID-19 uncertainty reserves. I would note that even after this release, we maintained over $9.8 billion in credit reserves against our U.S. Cards portfolios or approximately 7.6% of total loans. This resulted in a net income decline of 23% and an RoTCE of just over 23%. Adjusting for the ACL release, RoTCE would have been approximately 13%.  
On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Credit cards revenues declined 1% on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continue to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 24%, card spend volumes also up 24% and average loans up 7%. Retail Services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments, driven by improved credit performance. And we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up 14% and average loans up 1%.  
While payment rates remain elevated, we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization. As a result, interest earning balances in Branded Cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis, while Retail Services grew interest-earning balances by 3% sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes. Retail Banking revenues declined 6%, largely driven by lower mortgage originations. Wealth revenues declined 1%, driven by less client activity and investments, partially offset by higher deposits. Investment revenues declined as geopolitical tensions impacted the capital markets, which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity, particularly in Asia. However, underlying drivers remain strong, with average deposits up 14%, average loans up 5%, client assets up 4% and client advisers up 6%.  
On Slide 14, we show results for the legacy franchises. Revenues declined 14%, driven by lower revenue across the exit markets, largely driven by the Korea wind down as well as the muted investment activity in Asia. Expenses were up 31%, largely driven by the goodwill impairment I mentioned earlier, but again, this is neutral to capital. Cost of credit was $160 million in the quarter, driven by net credit losses, and as a result, net income declined significantly.  
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased significantly, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down largely on lower compensation expenses.

We did tweak that a bit in bringing the GDP assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter, and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption. And the other piece is, when we look at the downside scenario, so our analysis for CECL is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario. Under the downside scenario, we did increase the severity of the downside to account for again a bit of the current environment that we're all managing through. So those puts and takes kind of netted out to what you see that we've reported, which is a net release, but largely driven by those 2 drivers."

But let's start with the beginning of your question, just kind of the 12% and how we build back up to the 12%. So we ended the quarter at an estimated 11.4% to get to the 12%, that would be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion of capital that will be required. Jane mentioned, I mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that. You pointed out a few of them. So you all have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter. So you can forecast that what that would be. There's probably another $1.6-or-so billion of a benefit from the DTA. So what I mean by that, there's the $800 million that I've referenced in the past of utilization of the DTA. And the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter. So there are 2 components that carry forwards that impact the DTA. 
And then there's the timing difference, which has equated to about 10% of our capital. So this quarter, we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed DTA, in part because of how the OCI reduction play through. So as that bleeds back in over time, we would expect to have capital buildup, which increases that threshold and therefore, be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the DTA. 
The third component would be the capital from exits. So you didn't mention that one. As you know, there are a number of exits that we're looking to close at the end of the year -- by the end of the year, they'll contribute about $4 billion of capital to that equation. And then there's the bleeding back in of the OCI impact, which will give or take, give us another $1 billion. So those are the pluses. Those are the things that kind of play in on the capital generation side. 
And then on the offsets, you've got preferred dividends, you've got common dividends, whatever growth we play out or put to work from an RWA point of view, and that leaves the balance for share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect in the second quarter, a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes. The good news is that the headwinds that we've talked about, all things being equal, so assuming no further rate changes, many of those headwinds bleed back in over time, allowing for us to do what we've committed to, which is returning capital to shareholders over time. 
In terms of dividends, we always look at that as part of the CCAR submission and part of our broader capital planning, but I'll -- we'll see how the results come out from CCAR, but I would lean in on a point we've had to make a number of times now, which is given where we're trading, it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks. And so we'll likely continue to lean that way as opposed to doing a lot to change the dividend. But stay tuned as the capital planning continues to evolve."

Securities Services had a good quarter. It was up 6% revenue year-over-year and part of that was through fee revenue growth as well. So as you said, good, strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty that's out here, particularly as it relates to supply chains, helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that we're seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well. So I would say a very good quarter -- a very strong quarter for TTS, and we expect that momentum to continue."

So the first thing I'd say is that we're not at $10 billion, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside o",522,"Sure. Why don't I take that? So the first thing I'd say is that we're not at $10 billion, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside of the last 3 months. I'd also point out that a number of things were important components of that. So if you look at Slide 6, you'll see that the loans, and these are both ICG and consumer loans, largely ICG, largely corporate loans have come down by $600 million. And that's really been a reduction in our risk exposure, right? So borrowers paying down, us limiting the extension of new credit, et cetera. The AFS securities have come down $600 million. And that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales. So we've gotten out of those securities. 
Yes, there are some mark-to-market losses, but they're not material. That flows through OCI, not material. You can see that the off-balance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well. Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because we've actually seen the repayment of those loans come back, and we've been -- we've had to put that cash with the Central Bank just given some of the restrictions that are there. We've been actively working down the reverse repo assets, which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure. And we've been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure. So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to $7.8 billion. And if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced is kind of a net of $6.8 billion, right? 
So the second part of your question was, how do we think about reserves and what are those different components. Well, we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have, how we're rating those entities in this environment. And then we actually run that through our models, and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating. So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities, the broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what have you. And then there's a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this. So we built the reserves considering those multiple components. 
The last point I'd make is that, when you look at some of the names, there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country, and they provide parental support for some of the exposure that's here as well. So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well."

And so as I mentioned, there are offsets that play out. And so we felt comfortable kind of maintaining the guidance on the revenue top line. 
In terms of the expenses, as I mentioned at Investor Day, the spend that we have going on in expenses is critically important. And we're still growing them as it relates to transformation. And as it relates to business-led investments. On the business-led investment side, the good news is that we're starting to see some of the top line strength play out, not just driven by rates, but also driven by things like fees, which is what we forecasted. 
On the transformation side, we continue to make progress. And we've talked about how critically important that is to our operations going forward. We expect that, that will peak or arc, if you will, as we talked about at Investor Day, and that will occur in the near term and will be an important offset, if you will, to the structural expense base that we have as the efficiencies from those spending -- from that spending, excuse me, plays through."

In terms of the deposit base we have, as you know, we've got a mix of consumer and corporate client deposits. We skew a bit more heavily towards the corporate client deposit base. That comes with -- generally comes with a higher beta. And so they are likely to be more reactive to, and reactive sooner to the increase in interest rates. And quantitative tightening will certainly have a longer-term impact on the level of deposits that's out there. 
But with that said, our plans both in the near term and as we've played out the Investor Day forecast, don't hinge upon significant growth in deposits. We expect some growth, but growth consistent with kind of pre-pandemic levels, but that's not outsized growth, and we believe our strategy, which is broader than just going after deposits, but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves."

I'm surprised you thought we were lagging because we don't -- we certainly don't see that. I've been really pleased with how the cards franchise has been performing on multiple different drivers on client acquisition, on the spend on some of the new propositions that we've been bringing in. You heard from Anand about the growth on proprietary cards.  The installment lending growth, 75% up, albeit from a small base this quarter. So there are multiple different dimensions. So I think it's -- we're very pleased to see the business actually picking up. 
And as I said, Betsy, in my prepared remarks, I like where the business is headed. I think part of it is I am more positive around the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer than really any other geographies around the world. And that helps with so much momentum in the labor market. We're seeing still quite a bit of excess liquidity sitting there in the back pocket of our consumers and very healthy balance sheet. I think we have peaked in the payment rates. So we're just starting to see the first signs of that coming down. And I think that's good because it's a return to a more -- it should be the return this year to a more healthy behavior.
The spend has obviously been quite remarkable. It's up in the mid-20%. Also great to see the experience side and that services side coming back in again. And that's we've been seeing it in travel. We've been seeing it in apparel. People like getting dressed up to go to dinner again in a restaurant.  Those different things, it's nice to see things coming back to normality. So I'm pretty positive both from cyclically where this is headed, the recovery from COVID, where it's headed. And I'm also pretty happy with the strategy that Anand laid out and the progress we're making against it. So I think some good things ahead here."

You said you underinvested in the past and everything else. But I mean, you have 1,200 basis points between your expense and revenue growth and just seems so high.

So why don't I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance.

So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that at Investor Day, that's what we talked about. We would love for the number to be different, but we understand, and we know that this is what's required to get the franchise to where it needs to be. And so we're taking those hard decisions. We're spending the money where we need to spend it. We're being diligent about that to make sure that we're not being wasteful in that effort. But we don't want to create or go through the things that we've gone through in the past in the way of underinvesting. And so we're going to avoid that. 
The second thing is, and you acknowledge that kind of in your reference to transformation and business-led investments. On the structural investments spend, I should say, about half of that is from inflation, so not the full 4%. A portion of it is also from nonconsent order risk and control spend that we're making, things like the financial crime unit, things like cyber spend, things like the work we're doing around our wholesale credit operations, important things. And there are some productivity savings that play through that. 
And then the final piece on the volume related is their transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do on the trading side, their spend that we make in order to drive that activity. And the mix matters. And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter, the mix of the market's activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses that's generated through those transactions. So those are a couple of things. 
Again, we're consistent with guidance. We believe we're on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits. And we're looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time."

We've been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged, and we intend to remain so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world, further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure. 
[Audio Gap]
Back recently from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, it is security, yet energy, food, defense, cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialogue. The macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain. And while my job is to prepare for all outcomes, our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support near-term growth in the U.S. economy in the face of inflationary pressures. But we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in Europe hit hardest. 
With central banks responding to inflation, we're entering a period of higher rates and a flatter U.S. yield curve. Energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally, but we don't believe we're at the start of a new long super cycle, and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels. So with that as a backdrop, I think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter. Earlier today, we reported net income of $4.3 billion, EPS of $2.02 and an RoTCE of 10.5%. These numbers include impacts related to the divestitures, so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about 150 basis points of RoTCE. 
And let's turn to the performance of our 5 main reporting units. Well, given our emphasis on Services, I'm particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions, fee growth, trade loans and cross-border transactions buoyed by higher rates led to year-over-year revenue growth of 18%. Securities Services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up 6%. In our Markets business, our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well, aided by our mix with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and commodities. This led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of 2021. 
As you might expect, Investment Banking is a different story. While our performance on the advisory side was respectable, I think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward, even if the wallet remains smaller. Our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise. Having said that, we don't expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry until the geopolitical situation and client sentiment improve. 
In U.S. Personal Banking, we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and the spend volume growth. So we like where this business is headed. Geopolitics dampened performance in Global Wealth Management this quarter. While revenues improved in the U.S., our clients in Asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our Markets franchise as well. As you know, we're hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as Citi Alliance, which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisers. As a result of these efforts, we continue to add clients in both the Private Bank and in Citigold. 
Turning to capital. We returned $4 billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter. We now have about 6% fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago. At the same time, a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through OCI and largely caused our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to come in at 11.4% this quarter. 
I want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment, which I spoke about, combined with the impacts of our divestitures, create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year. Now whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year, we have a path to our year-end target of 12%. And Mark is going to walk you through these details. And let me be clear, we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders. 
As you heard at Investor Day, we're focused on our transformation, and we're making the investments in our infrastructure, risk and controls and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make Citi a winning firm. I recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run. But I firmly believe that success here will not only lead to satisfying our regulatory obligations, but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term. 
So far this year, we've announced new agreements to sell a further 7 consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA, the most recent of which were India and Bahrain. We are beginning the sales process in Mexico, and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise. As you've heard me say, this is not an uncomplicated transaction, given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence. We will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will keep you posted on any development concerning the 3 remaining markets: China, Poland and of course, Russia. 
We started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to Russia in January, and we benefited from being on the front foot here. We've been managing down our financial exposures, both in level and composition and they're at a reasonable level, especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter. We've also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond Russia and Ukraine. And our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in Russia remains. We are in continuous communication with the U.S. government, and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime. 
But I've run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm. Our people in Ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country where they can help NGOs deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible. And many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees, and we will continue to help in any way we can. 
So with all that is going on in the world, we remain laser-focused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation. I expect the macro environment to remain unpredictable to say the least in the backdrop of a war, which is equally tragic and unnecessary and a persistent pandemic. And I can speak to the last one personally, having just recovered from a brief encounter with COVID, as much as I would like to, I can't blame Paco for it. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted to take your questions."
391687,712722558,2539886,"Citigroup Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2022",2022-04-14,"Earnings Calls","Citigroup Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end wi",2399,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end with the results of each segment. 
On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02 with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results were Asia consumer divestiture-related impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. In the quarter, total revenues decreased 2% as strength in net interest income driven by Services and PBWM, was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue across businesses. That said, we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on Investor Day, which I will walk you through in detail shortly. 
Total expenses of $13.2 billion increased 15% or 10% excluding the Asia divestiture-related impacts I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $755 million as net credit losses of $872 million were partially offset by a net ACL release. Embedded in the net ACL release is a Russia-related build of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $1 billion related to exposure to Russia and about $900 million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment. This was more than offset by a release related to a COVID-19 uncertainty reserve, primarily in U.S. Personal Banking, given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio, specifically in the U.S. As of today, we have about $17.9 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.35%. 
On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, we incurred some divestiture-related costs this quarter. These costs largely related to a goodwill write-down that we incurred in legacy franchises as part of our resegmentation and divestitures. It is important to note the goodwill impact is capital-neutral. Excluding the divestiture-related costs, expenses increased by approximately 10%, 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 66.6% related to the risks, controls, data and finance programs, and approximately 30% of that is related to technology investments. About 2% of the increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers. 
In addition, we are investing in technology across services, wealth and cards. 1% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in Markets and Cards. And approximately 4% was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Across all of these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 12% for the quarter. 
On Slide 6, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. As Jane mentioned, as of the end of the quarter, our remaining exposure to Russia stood at about $7.8 billion, down from $9.8 billion at year-end. And importantly, the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way. We have reduced our direct Russia country risk exposure from $5.4 billion to about $3.7 billion, which consists of loans, AFS, derivatives and off-balance sheet exposure. The remaining exposure, which previously totaled $4.4 billion, now totals $4.1 billion and consists of deposits and cash with the Central Bank, reverse repos and cross-border exposure. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $700 million, down from about $1 billion at year-end. And the currency translation adjustment or CTA related to our net investment stands at $1 billion. 
And as I mentioned previously, we took credit reserves of about $1.9 billion, with about $1 billion for direct exposure to Russia and another approximately $900 million for broader impacts given the macro environment. So we feel we have reserved prudently at this point. 
In the normal course of our planning and risk management, we run a range of stress scenarios, and we've taken the same approach with our exposure to Russia. And as a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down meaningfully from what I described at our Investor Day. 
On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $50 million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count. Excluding day count, net interest income increased by approximately $290 million. Sequentially, net interest margin increased by 7 basis points as lower average deposits in Services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in Markets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million, driven by cards, deposits' volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets, and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM. 
On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 23% or $551 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. From a capital perspective, we ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 11.4% under both standardized and advanced approaches, with standardized remaining the binding ratio, down from 12.2% at year-end. 
During the quarter, we adopted SACR and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates. We will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter. However, it is important to note that despite these impacts, we continue to expect to manage to a CET1 ratio of 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2023. We expect the combination of net income generation, DTA utilization and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in Asia to be sufficient to reach the 12% CET1 ratio by the end of the year. 
As we said at Investor Day, we're committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio, reversing that $4 billion interest rate-driven impact, we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time. And as you know, under the SCB framework and given the uncertain macro environment, we assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. For the second quarter, we expect only a modest amount of buybacks, and we'll evaluate that level throughout the quarter, taking into account market conditions. 
On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 capital ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. As I just mentioned, our CET1 capital ratio ended the year at 12.2% as we build capital to absorb the impact of SACR on our RWA. Post SACR adoption, our ratio stood at 11.8% as of January 1, 2022. 
Given the sizable impact of some of the drivers, I wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of about 11.4%. First, we generated net income, which added 35 basis points. Second, over $4 billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about 36 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 35-basis point reduction. Fourth, the increase in disallowed DTA, largely driven by the reduction in CET1 due to the interest rate impact I just mentioned, drove another 15-basis point reduction. Finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors, including a reduction in RWA. With all of that said, as I just mentioned, we have a path to a 12% CET1 capital ratio by year-end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. 
On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues decreased 2%, largely driven by Investment Banking partially offset by an increase in Services revenue. And Markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year. Expenses increased 13% driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was nearly $1 billion, largely driven by a $1.5 billion build related to our exposures in Russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment. And outside of Russia, we continue to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients' balance sheets remain healthy. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51%, largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by trade finance. Average deposits grew 2% as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 11.2%. 
On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you each quarter. In Services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients, and we expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 18%, driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients. And we continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 54%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. 
Securities Services revenues grew 6% as net interest income grew 17%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and fee revenues grew 2% due to higher assets under custody. 
Overall Markets revenues were down 2% versus a strong quarter last year. In the quarter, activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of Fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 1%. We saw strong client engagement, particularly with our corporate clients in FX and commodities, with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility. Spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity. 
Equity Markets revenues were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year period. In the quarter, we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains or losses on loan hedges, were down 32% as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets. Investment Banking revenues were down 43% and driven by the contraction in capital markets activity, partially offset by growth in M&A. Corporate Lending revenues were down 6%, largely driven by lower average loans. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues declined 1% as net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue. Expenses were up 14%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $376 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. We had a net release of over $1 billion of ACL related to COVID-19 uncertainty reserves. I would note that even after this release, we maintained over $9.8 billion in credit reserves against our U.S. Cards portfolios or approximately 7.6% of total loans. This resulted in a net income decline of 23% and an RoTCE of just over 23%. Adjusting for the ACL release, RoTCE would have been approximately 13%. 
On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Credit cards revenues declined 1% on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continue to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement. 
We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 24%, card spend volumes also up 24% and average loans up 7%. Retail Services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments, driven by improved credit performance. And we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up 14% and average loans up 1%. 
While payment rates remain elevated, we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization. As a result, interest earning balances in Branded Cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis, while Retail Services grew interest-earning balances by 3% sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes. Retail Banking revenues declined 6%, largely driven by lower mortgage originations. Wealth revenues declined 1%, driven by less client activity and investments, partially offset by higher deposits. Investment revenues declined as geopolitical tensions impacted the capital markets, which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity, particularly in Asia. However, underlying drivers remain strong, with average deposits up 14%, average loans up 5%, client assets up 4% and client advisers up 6%. 
On Slide 14, we show results for the legacy franchises. Revenues declined 14%, driven by lower revenue across the exit markets, largely driven by the Korea wind-down as well as the muted investment activity in Asia. Expenses were up 31%, largely driven by the goodwill impairment I mentioned earlier, but again, this is neutral to capital. Cost of credit was $160 million in the quarter, driven by net credit losses, and as a result, net income declined significantly. 
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased significantly, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down largely on lower compensation expenses. 
And to briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook, at this point, we still expect to see low single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit expense growth, both excluding divestiture-related impacts this year. 
And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

As we thought about these scenarios, as you know, we run a base scenario. We did tweak that a bit in bringing the GDP assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter, and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption. And the other piece is, when we look at the downside scenario, so our analysis for CECL is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario. Under the downside scenario, we did increase the severity of the downside to account for again a bit of the current environment that we're all managing through. So those puts and takes kind of netted out to what you see that we've reported, which is a net release, but largely driven by those 2 drivers."

But let's start with the beginning of your question, just kind of the 12% and how we build back up to the 12%. So we ended the quarter at an estimated 11.4% to get to the 12%, that would be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion of capital that will be required. Jane mentioned, I mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that. You pointed out a few of them. So you all have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter. So you can forecast that what that would be. 
There's probably another $1.6-or-so-billion of a benefit from the DTA. So what I mean by that, there's the $800 million that I've referenced in the past of utilization of the DTA. And the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter. So there are 2 components that carry forwards that impact for DTA. And then there's the timing difference, which has equated to about 10% of our capital. 
So this quarter, we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed DTA, in part because of how the OCI reduction played through. So as that bleeds back in over time, we would expect to have capital buildup, which increases that threshold and therefore, be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the DTA. 
The third component would be the capital from exits. So you didn't mention that one. As you know, there are a number of exits that we're looking to close at the end of the year -- by the end of the year, they'll contribute about $4 billion of capital to that equation. And then there's the bleeding back in of the OCI impact, which will, give or take, give us another $1 billion. So those are the pluses. Those are the things that kind of play in on the capital generation side. 
And then on the offsets, you've got preferred dividends, you've got common dividends, whatever growth we play out or put to work from an RWA point of view, and that leaves the balance for share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect in the second quarter, a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes. The good news is that the headwinds that we've talked about, all things being equal, so assuming no further rate changes, many of those headwinds bleed back in over time, allowing for us to do what we've committed to, which is returning capital to shareholders over time. 
In terms of dividends, we always look at that as part of the CCAR submission and part of our broader capital planning, but I'll -- we'll see how the results come out from CCAR, but I would lean in on a point we've had to make a number of times now, which is given where we're trading, it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks.

And obviously, it was a strong quarter for us in trade because again, with the global network, the ability to provide clients with end-to-end solutions in this interesting world that we're living in is something they really rely upon us. So you saw trade loans up 16%. You saw really many of the drivers that we laid out for you at Investor Day performing particularly strongly. But Mark, why don't I pass to you?"

So net interest income was up 18%. But look at the noninterest revenue, that was up 19%. So to your point, Jane, we're seeing good fee revenue growth play through as well. Securities Services had a good quarter. It was up 16 -- 6% revenue year-over-year and part of that was through fee revenue growth as well. 
So as you said, good, strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty that's out here, particularly as it relates to supply chains, helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that we're seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well. So I would say a very good quarter -- a very strong quarter for TTS, and we expect that momentum to continue."

I guess first question, why don't you take just a bigger kind of stab at reserving for maybe the severe stress scenario? I'm not really an expert on what's going on. But from what I read, it feels kind of pretty severe and it seems like broadly speaking, kind of, other corporations, not necessarily banks, but just corporations are taking kind of more material losses versus a $1 billion on $10 billion? 
And then just a related question, if you could elaborate on what the broader impact is? I guess I'm a little surprised that the reserve for that was as big as the direct Russian reserve or roughly the same."

So the first thing I'd say is that we're not at $10 billion, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside o",520,"Sure. Why don't I take that? So the first thing I'd say is that we're not at $10 billion, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside of the last 3 months. I'd also point out that a number of things were important components of that. So if you look at Slide 6, you'll see that the loans, and these are both ICG and consumer loans, largely ICG, largely corporate loans have come down by $600 million. And that's really been a reduction in our risk exposure, right? So borrowers paying down, us limiting the extension of new credit, et cetera. The AFS securities have come down $600 million. And that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales. So we've gotten out of those securities. 
Yes, there are some mark-to-market losses, but they're not material. That flows through OCI, not material. You can see that the off-balance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well. Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because we've actually seen the repayment of those loans come back, and we've been -- we've had to put that cash with the Central Bank just given some of the restrictions that are there. We've been actively working down the reverse repo assets, which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure. And we've been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure. So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to $7.8 billion. And if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced is kind of a net of $6.8 billion, right? 
So the second part of your question was, how do we think about reserves and what are those different components. Well, we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have, how we're rating those entities in this environment. And then we actually run that through our models, and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating. So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities. 
The broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what-have-you. And then there's a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this. So we built the reserves considering those multiple components. 
The last point I'd make is that, when you look at some of the names, there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country, and they provide parental support for some of the exposure that's here as well. So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well."

As we think about that, that was a pretty sudden move through the quarter of 160 basis points on the 2-year in the quarter. That's now in the expectation. We have built in an assumption around more rate moves that could happen just as a bit of cushion as I think about the outlook and as I think about the walk. We do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to OCI, and we'll continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases, which, by the way, we've been actively doing over the past couple of years. 
If you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved, we've been moving from out of AFS and into held-to-maturity over the past couple of years, reducing that risk of a negative impact to OCI. And if you look at the Ddo1, we've cut that down from as high as $60 million to about $30 million or so.

We expect some growth, but growth consistent with kind of pre-pandemic levels, but that's not outsized growth, and we believe our strategy, which is broader than just going after deposits, but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves."

I'm surprised you thought we were lagging because we don't -- we certainly don't see that.

You heard from Anand about the growth on proprietary cards. The installment lending growth, 75% up, albeit from a small base this quarter. So there are multiple different dimensions. So I think it's -- we're very pleased to see the business actually picking up. 
And as I said, Betsy, in my prepared remarks, I like where the business is headed. I think part of it is I am more positive around the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer than really any other geographies around the world. And that helps with so much momentum in the labor market. We're seeing still quite a bit of excess liquidity sitting there in the back pocket of our consumers and very healthy balance sheet. I think we have peaked in the payment rates. So we're just starting to see the first signs of that coming down. And I think that's good because it's a return to a more -- it should be the return this year to a more healthy behavior.
The spend has obviously been quite remarkable. It's up in the mid-20%. Also great to see the experience side and that services side coming back in again. And that's we've been seeing it in travel. We've been seeing it in apparel. People like getting dressed up to go to dinner again in a restaurant. Those different things, it's nice to see things coming back to normality. So I'm pretty positive both from cyclically where this is headed, the recovery from COVID, where it's headed. And I'm also pretty happy with the strategy that Anand laid out and the progress we're making against it. So I think some good things ahead here."

So why don't I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance.

So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that at Investor Day, that's what we talked about. We would love for the number to be different, but we understand, and we know that this is what's required to get the franchise to where it needs to be. And so we're taking those hard decisions. We're spending the money where we need to spend it. We're being diligent about that to make sure that we're not being wasteful in that effort. But we don't want to create or go through the things that we've gone through in the past in the way of underinvesting. And so we're going to avoid that. 
The second thing is, and you acknowledge that kind of in your reference to transformation and business-led investments. On the structural investments spend, I should say, about half of that is from inflation, so not the full 4%. A portion of it is also from non-consent order risk and control spend that we're making, things like the financial crime unit, things like cyber spend, things like the work we're doing around our wholesale credit operations, important things. And there are some productivity savings that play through that. 
And then the final piece on the volume-related is their transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do on the trading side there, spend that we make in order to drive that activity. And the mix matters. And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter, the mix of the market's activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses that's generated through those transactions. 
So those are a couple of things. Again, we're consistent with guidance. We believe we're on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits. And we're looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time."

And I'd like to start by reiterating my appreciation to those of you who participated in our Investor Day last month. We greatly value the opportunity to walk you through our refreshed strategy and our plans for the next few years. Given how much time we spent on our strategy that day, today, we'll be focusing on the quarter. Nonetheless, as we committed, we will keep you updated on our progress, and you can see the latest report card on Slide 2. 
Today is also the first time we're reporting quarterly results under our new segmentation, which will help you track our efforts. I've got to say it feels like an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Investor Day. So I'm going to talk about the macro environment first. And then after I talk about the quarter, I'll discuss how we're handling Russia, and Mark is also going to go through it in more detail. 
We've been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged, and we intend to remain so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world, further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure. 
[Audio Gap]
Back recently from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, it is security, yet energy, food, defense, cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialogue. The macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain. And while my job is to prepare for all outcomes, our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support near-term growth in the U.S. economy in the face of inflationary pressures. But we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in Europe hit hardest. 
With central banks responding to inflation, we're entering a period of higher rates and a flatter U.S. yield curve. Energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally, but we don't believe we're at the start of a new long super cycle, and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels. So with that as a backdrop, I think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter. Earlier today, we reported net income of $4.3 billion, EPS of $2.02 and an RoTCE of 10.5%. These numbers include impacts related to the divestitures, so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about 150 basis points of RoTCE. 
And let's turn to the performance of our 5 main reporting units. Well, given our emphasis on Services, I'm particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions, fee growth, trade loans and cross-border transactions buoyed by higher rates led to year-over-year revenue growth of 18%. Securities Services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up 6%. In our Markets business, our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well, aided by our mix with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and commodities. This led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of 2021. 
As you might expect, Investment Banking is a different story. While our performance on the advisory side was respectable, I think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward, even if the wallet remains smaller. Our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise. Having said that, we don't expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry until the geopolitical situation and client sentiment improve. 
In U.S. Personal Banking, we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and the spend volume growth. So we like where this business is headed. Geopolitics dampened performance in Global Wealth Management this quarter. While revenues improved in the U.S., our clients in Asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our Markets franchise as well. As you know, we're hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as Citi Alliance, which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisers. As a result of these efforts, we continue to add clients in both the Private Bank and in Citigold. 
Turning to capital. We returned $4 billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter. We now have about 6% fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago. At the same time, a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through OCI and largely caused our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to come in at 11.4% this quarter. 
I want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment, which I spoke about, combined with the impacts of our divestitures, create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year. Now whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year, we have a path to our year-end target of 12%. And Mark is going to walk you through these details. And let me be clear, we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders. 
As you heard at Investor Day, we're focused on our transformation, and we're making the investments in our infrastructure, risk and controls and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make Citi a winning firm. I recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run. But I firmly believe that success here will not only lead to satisfying our regulatory obligations, but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term. 
So far this year, we've announced new agreements to sell a further 7 consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA, the most recent of which were India and Bahrain. We are beginning the sales process in Mexico, and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise. As you've heard me say, this is not an uncomplicated transaction, given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence. We will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will keep you posted on any development concerning the 3 remaining markets: China, Poland and of course, Russia. 
We started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to Russia in January, and we benefited from being on the front foot here. We've been managing down our financial exposures, both in level and composition and they're at a reasonable level, especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter. We've also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond Russia and Ukraine. And our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in Russia remains. We are in continuous communication with the U.S. government, and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime. 
But I've run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm. Our people in Ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country where they can help NGOs deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible. And many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees, and we will continue to help in any way we can. 
So with all that is going on in the world, we remain laser-focused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation. I expect the macro environment to remain unpredictable to say the least in the backdrop of a war, which is equally tragic and unnecessary and a persistent pandemic. And I can speak to the last one personally, having just recovered from a brief encounter with COVID, as much as I would like to, I can't blame Paco for it. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted to take your questions."

I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end with the results of each segment. 
On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02 with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results were Asia consumer divestiture-related impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. In the quarter, total revenues decreased 2% as strength in net interest income driven by Services and PBWM, was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue across businesses. That said, we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on Investor Day, which I will walk you through in detail shortly. 
Total expenses of $13.2 billion increased 15% or 10% excluding the Asia divestiture-related impacts I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $755 million as net credit losses of $872 million were partially offset by a net ACL release. Embedded in the net ACL release is a Russia-related build of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $1 billion related to exposure to Russia and about $900 million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment. This was more than offset by a release related to a COVID-19 uncertainty reserve, primarily in U.S. Personal Banking, given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio, specifically in the U.S. As of today, we have about $17.9 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.35%. 
On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, we incurred some divestiture-related costs this quarter. These costs largely related to a goodwill write-down that we incurred in legacy franchises as part of our resegmentation and divestitures. It is important to note the goodwill impact is capital-neutral. Excluding the divestiture-related costs, expenses increased by approximately 10%, 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 66.6% related to the risks, controls, data and finance programs, and approximately 30% of that is related to technology investments. About 2% of the increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers. 
In addition, we are investing in technology across services, wealth and cards. 1% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in Markets and Cards. And approximately 4% was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Across all of these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 12% for the quarter. 
On Slide 6, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. As Jane mentioned, as of the end of the quarter, our remaining exposure to Russia stood at about $7.8 billion, down from $9.8 billion at year-end. And importantly, the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way. We have reduced our direct Russia country risk exposure from $5.4 billion to about $3.7 billion, which consists of loans, AFS, derivatives and off-balance sheet exposure. The remaining exposure, which previously totaled $4.4 billion, now totals $4.1 billion and consists of deposits and cash with the Central Bank, reverse repos and cross-border exposure. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $700 million, down from about $1 billion at year-end. And the currency translation adjustment or CTA related to our net investment stands at $1 billion. 
And as I mentioned previously, we took credit reserves of about $1.9 billion, with about $1 billion for direct exposure to Russia and another approximately $900 million for broader impacts given the macro environment. So we feel we have reserved prudently at this point. 
In the normal course of our planning and risk management, we run a range of stress scenarios, and we've taken the same approach with our exposure to Russia. And as a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down meaningfully from what I described at our Investor Day. 
On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $50 million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count. Excluding day count, net interest income increased by approximately $290 million. Sequentially, net interest margin increased by 7 basis points as lower average deposits in Services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in Markets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million, driven by cards, deposits' volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets, and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM. 
On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 23% or $551 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. From a capital perspective, we ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 11.4% under both standardized and advanced approaches, with standardized remaining the binding ratio, down from 12.2% at year-end. 
During the quarter, we adopted SACR and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates. We will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter. However, it is important to note that despite these impacts, we continue to expect to manage to a CET1 ratio of 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2023. We expect the combination of net income generation, DTA utilization and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in Asia to be sufficient to reach the 12% CET1 ratio by the end of the year. 
As we said at Investor Day, we're committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio, reversing that $4 billion interest rate-driven impact, we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time. And as you know, under the SCB framework and given the uncertain macro environment, we assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. For the second quarter, we expect only a modest amount of buybacks, and we'll evaluate that level throughout the quarter, taking into account market conditions. 
On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 capital ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. As I just mentioned, our CET1 capital ratio ended the year at 12.2% as we build capital to absorb the impact of SACR on our RWA. Post SACR adoption, our ratio stood at 11.8% as of January 1, 2022. 
Given the sizable impact of some of the drivers, I wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of about 11.4%. First, we generated net income, which added 35 basis points. Second, over $4 billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about 36 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 35-basis point reduction. Fourth, the increase in disallowed DTA, largely driven by the reduction in CET1 due to the interest rate impact I just mentioned, drove another 15-basis point reduction. Finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors, including a reduction in RWA. With all of that said, as I just mentioned, we have a path to a 12% CET1 capital ratio by year-end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. 
On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues decreased 2%, largely driven by Investment Banking partially offset by an increase in Services revenue. And Markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year. Expenses increased 13% driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was nearly $1 billion, largely driven by a $1.5 billion build related to our exposures in Russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment. And outside of Russia, we continue to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients' balance sheets remain healthy. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51%, largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by trade finance. Average deposits grew 2% as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 11.2%. 
On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you each quarter. In Services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients, and we expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 18%, driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients. And we continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 54%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. 
Securities Services revenues grew 6% as net interest income grew 17%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and fee revenues grew 2% due to higher assets under custody. 
Overall Markets revenues were down 2% versus a strong quarter last year. In the quarter, activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of Fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 1%. We saw strong client engagement, particularly with our corporate clients in FX and commodities, with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility. Spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity. 
Equity Markets revenues were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year period. In the quarter, we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains or losses on loan hedges, were down 32% as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets. Investment Banking revenues were down 43% and driven by the contraction in capital markets activity, partially offset by growth in M&A. Corporate Lending revenues were down 6%, largely driven by lower average loans. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues declined 1% as net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue. Expenses were up 14%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $376 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. We had a net release of over $1 billion of ACL related to COVID-19 uncertainty reserves. I would note that even after this release, we maintained over $9.8 billion in credit reserves against our U.S. Cards portfolios or approximately 7.6% of total loans. This resulted in a net income decline of 23% and an RoTCE of just over 23%. Adjusting for the ACL release, RoTCE would have been approximately 13%. 
On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Credit cards revenues declined 1% on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continue to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement. 
We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 24%, card spend volumes also up 24% and average loans up 7%. Retail Services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments, driven by improved credit performance. And we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up 14% and average loans up 1%. 
While payment rates remain elevated, we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization. As a result, interest earning balances in Branded Cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis, while Retail Services grew interest-earning balances by 3% sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes. Retail Banking revenues declined 6%, largely driven by lower mortgage originations. Wealth revenues declined 1%, driven by less client activity and investments, partially offset by higher deposits. Investment revenues declined as geopolitical tensions impacted the capital markets, which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity, particularly in Asia. However, underlying drivers remain strong, with average deposits up 14%, average loans up 5%, client assets up 4% and client advisers up 6%. 
On Slide 14, we show results for the legacy franchises. Revenues declined 14%, driven by lower revenue across the exit markets, largely driven by the Korea wind-down as well as the muted investment activity in Asia. Expenses were up 31%, largely driven by the goodwill impairment I mentioned earlier, but again, this is neutral to capital. Cost of credit was $160 million in the quarter, driven by net credit losses, and as a result, net income declined significantly. 
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased significantly, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down largely on lower compensation expenses. 
And to briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook, at this point, we still expect to see low single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit expense growth, both excluding divestiture-related impacts this year. 
And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

As we thought about these scenarios, as you know, we run a base scenario. We did tweak that a bit in bringing the GDP assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter, and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption. And the other piece is, when we look at the downside scenario, so our analysis for CECL is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario. Under the downside scenario, we did increase the severity of the downside to account for again a bit of the current environment that we're all managing through. So those puts and takes kind of netted out to what you see that we've reported, which is a net release, but largely driven by those 2 drivers."

Obviously, AOCI is a wildcard, unpredictable. But perhaps give us a sense of should we then think about the buyback as just a fallout in terms of that equation, right, is the first question.
Number two, what is the desire to increase the dividend even nominally in this stress test year? And third, how does the DTA impact that was negative in the first quarter turn to a positive impact? And Mark, nice job on the RWA. I think that everybody was scared if that was going to be a big negative number this quarter."

So we ended the",564,"Thank you. You got a lot there, that we've got to unpack. So I'll try to capture it all and you'll point to whatever I may miss. But let's start with the beginning of your question, just kind of the 12% and how we build back up to the 12%. So we ended the quarter at an estimated 11.4% to get to the 12%, that would be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion of capital that will be required. Jane mentioned, I mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that. You pointed out a few of them. So you all have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter. So you can forecast that what that would be. 
There's probably another $1.6-or-so-billion of a benefit from the DTA. So what I mean by that, there's the $800 million that I've referenced in the past of utilization of the DTA. And the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter. So there are 2 components that carry forwards that impact for DTA. And then there's the timing difference, which has equated to about 10% of our capital. 
So this quarter, we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed DTA, in part because of how the OCI reduction played through. So as that bleeds back in over time, we would expect to have capital buildup, which increases that threshold and therefore, be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the DTA. 
The third component would be the capital from exits. So you didn't mention that one. As you know, there are a number of exits that we're looking to close at the end of the year -- by the end of the year, they'll contribute about $4 billion of capital to that equation. And then there's the bleeding back in of the OCI impact, which will, give or take, give us another $1 billion. So those are the pluses. Those are the things that kind of play in on the capital generation side. 
And then on the offsets, you've got preferred dividends, you've got common dividends, whatever growth we play out or put to work from an RWA point of view, and that leaves the balance for share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect in the second quarter, a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes. The good news is that the headwinds that we've talked about, all things being equal, so assuming no further rate changes, many of those headwinds bleed back in over time, allowing for us to do what we've committed to, which is returning capital to shareholders over time. 
In terms of dividends, we always look at that as part of the CCAR submission and part of our broader capital planning, but I'll -- we'll see how the results come out from CCAR, but I would lean in on a point we've had to make a number of times now, which is given where we're trading, it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks. And so we'll likely continue to lean that way as opposed to doing a lot to change the dividend. But stay tuned as the capital planning continues to evolve."

Securities Services had a good quarter. It was up 16 -- 6% revenue year-over-year and part of that was through fee revenue growth as well. 
So as you said, good, strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty that's out here, particularly as it relates to supply chains, helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that we're seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well. So I would say a very good quarter -- a very strong quarter for TTS, and we expect that momentum to continue."

So the first thing I'd say is that we're not at $10 billion, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside o",520,"Sure. Why don't I take that? So the first thing I'd say is that we're not at $10 billion, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside of the last 3 months. I'd also point out that a number of things were important components of that. So if you look at Slide 6, you'll see that the loans, and these are both ICG and consumer loans, largely ICG, largely corporate loans have come down by $600 million. And that's really been a reduction in our risk exposure, right? So borrowers paying down, us limiting the extension of new credit, et cetera. The AFS securities have come down $600 million. And that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales. So we've gotten out of those securities. 
Yes, there are some mark-to-market losses, but they're not material. That flows through OCI, not material. You can see that the off-balance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well. Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because we've actually seen the repayment of those loans come back, and we've been -- we've had to put that cash with the Central Bank just given some of the restrictions that are there. We've been actively working down the reverse repo assets, which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure. And we've been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure. So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to $7.8 billion. And if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced is kind of a net of $6.8 billion, right? 
So the second part of your question was, how do we think about reserves and what are those different components. Well, we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have, how we're rating those entities in this environment. And then we actually run that through our models, and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating. So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities. 
The broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what-have-you. And then there's a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this. So we built the reserves considering those multiple components. 
The last point I'd make is that, when you look at some of the names, there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country, and they provide parental support for some of the exposure that's here as well. So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well."

What I'd say is, obviously, how one manages their exposures and balance sheet and engagement with clients will impact that. But importantly, it's a market dynamic that needs to play out as well. So as more RWA and capital is required for these types of positions, there has to -- it's going to impact returns, and it ultimately will impact pricing as the market starts to incorporate this now-higher requirement. And so it will continue to evolve. 
The thing I'd point you to is that as we think about managing our businesses and in particular Markets. You would have heard us mention at Investor Day that we're looking -- continually looking for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet and optimize RWA, right? And so we talked about targeting a revenue to RWA for our Markets business, and we're actively working at that now. And that's going to be important as we continue to manage not only the balance sheet requirements that we have, but our intent to try and return more capital to shareholders and improve our returns."

As we think about that, that was a pretty sudden move through the quarter of 160 basis points on the 2-year in the quarter. That's now in the expectation. We have built in an assumption around more rate moves that could happen just as a bit of cushion as I think about the outlook and as I think about the walk. We do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to OCI, and we'll continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases, which, by the way, we've been actively doing over the past couple of years. 
If you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved, we've been moving from out of AFS and into held-to-maturity over the past couple of years, reducing that risk of a negative impact to OCI. And if you look at the Ddo1, we've cut that down from as high as $60 million to about $30 million or so. So we've been actively managing with an eye towards how do we reduce that sensitivity, if you will.

And so as I mentioned, there are offsets that play out. And so we felt comfortable kind of maintaining the guidance on the revenue top line.

In terms of the deposit base we have, as you know, we've got a mix of consumer and corporate client deposits. We skew a bit more heavily towards the corporate client deposit base.

And quantitative tightening will certainly have a longer-term impact on the level of deposits that's out there. 
But with that said, our plans both in the near term and as we've played out the Investor Day forecast, don't hinge upon significant growth in deposits. We expect some growth, but growth consistent with kind of pre-pandemic levels, but that's not outsized growth, and we believe our strategy, which is broader than just going after deposits, but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves."

So I think it's -- we're very pleased to see the business actually picking up. 
And as I said, Betsy, in my prepared remarks, I like where the business is headed. I think part of it is I am more positive around the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer than really any other geographies around the world. And that helps with so much momentum in the labor market. We're seeing still quite a bit of excess liquidity sitting there in the back pocket of our consumers and very healthy balance sheet. I think we have peaked in the payment rates. So we're just starting to see the first signs of that coming down. And I think that's good because it's a return to a more -- it should be the return this year to a more healthy behavior.
The spend has obviously been quite remarkable. It's up in the mid-20%. Also great to see the experience side and that services side coming back in again. And that's we've been seeing it in travel. We've been seeing it in apparel. People like getting dressed up to go to dinner again in a restaurant. Those different things, it's nice to see things coming back to normality.

So why don't I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that at Investor Day, that's what we talked about. We",357,"Yes. So why don't I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that at Investor Day, that's what we talked about. We would love for the number to be different, but we understand, and we know that this is what's required to get the franchise to where it needs to be. And so we're taking those hard decisions. We're spending the money where we need to spend it. We're being diligent about that to make sure that we're not being wasteful in that effort. But we don't want to create or go through the things that we've gone through in the past in the way of underinvesting. And so we're going to avoid that. 
The second thing is, and you acknowledge that kind of in your reference to transformation and business-led investments. On the structural investments spend, I should say, about half of that is from inflation, so not the full 4%. A portion of it is also from non-consent order risk and control spend that we're making, things like the financial crime unit, things like cyber spend, things like the work we're doing around our wholesale credit operations, important things. And there are some productivity savings that play through that. 
And then the final piece on the volume-related is their transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do on the trading side there, spend that we make in order to drive that activity. And the mix matters. And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter, the mix of the market's activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses that's generated through those transactions. 
So those are a couple of things. Again, we're consistent with guidance. We believe we're on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits. And we're looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time."

When we last spoke we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain. So in one sense, little has changed. However, the headwinds have certainly crystallized. And it's again",1433,"Thank you, Jen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. When we last spoke we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain. So in one sense, little has changed. However, the headwinds have certainly crystallized. And it's against that backdrop that I'm proud of the results our team delivered this quarter as we execute on our strategy and transformation.
There are mounting costs to the series of supply shocks we've experienced. And now we need to pay attention to an additional S in ESG, and that is security. In addition to energy and cyber security, food security has also come into sharper focus, threatening to spread the humanitarian cost of the wall well beyond Europe.
Resiliency is the new priority for governments and corporates alike. And all of this is adding to inflationary pressures, which are in turn being met with a more hawkish response from the Fed and other central banks, all contributing to sharply lower U.S. consumer confidence.
Higher rates and QT will keep volatility high. That said, wealth sentiment has shifted. Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight.
Similarly, our corporate clients see robust demand and healthy balance sheet with revenue softness attributed to supply chain constraints so far. So while a recession could indeed take place over the next 2 years in the U.S., it's highly unlikely to be a sharper downturn as others in recent memory.
I'm just back from Europe, where it's a different story. We expect a very difficult winter is coming, and that's due to disruptions in the energy supply. There is also increasing concern about second order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent. And the mood is, of course, further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon.
In Asia, a rebound in China also faces some constraints given the potential for future lockdowns, the amount of leverage in the Chinese economy and stress in their property sector. Given this uncertain environment, I'm quite pleased with our overall performance. We reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 and an RoTCE of 11.2%. We grew revenues at 11% year-over-year whilst remaining on track to meet our expense guidance for the year.
Services continued to show excellent momentum with revenues up 28% year-over-year. While some of that growth is a result of the rate environment, we had double-digit fee growth, consistent with the strategy we presented to you in March. TTS in particular fired on all cylinders as clients took advantage of our global network, leading to the best quarter this business has had in a decade.
The market volatility that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second, driving corporate clients in particular to be more active in risk management, contributing to revenue growth of 25% in markets. The volatility we saw in foreign exchange rates, commodities and equity derivatives favored our mix, and we were more efficient in our capital usage.
And while this level of activity is related to where we are in the current cycle rather than a new baseline in markets, I believe we are helping our clients navigate this environment quite well. And it shows how our emphasis on our corporate clients globally given their consistent trading needs is a differentiating one for us in market.
On the flip side, that same environment continues to put a great deal of pressure on the Investment Banking wallet with our revenues down 46%. However, we are seeing an increase of lending as our clients have been less inclined to obtain financing through the debt markets given the recent swings. In U.S. Personal Banking, the positive drivers we saw in our 2 credit card businesses over the last few quarters converted into solid revenue growth this quarter, most notably, 10% growth in Branded Cards.
And you can see how resilient the consumer is in the U.S. through the elevated payment rates and the low level of credit losses. They have, however, shifted their spend far more to travel and entertainment, which are now outpacing 2019 levels.
While volatility can be an opportunity for our trading desks, lower asset prices are a headwind for wealth management. Asia again was hit harder than other regions, leading to flat year-over-year wealth management revenues overall. That said, we continue to execute our wealth strategy across a number of fronts, including building our base of client advisers, expanding our Private Bank physical footprint to reach 20 countries with the additions of Germany and France, and increasing referrals from our branch network in the U.S. So the underlying strategic drivers for the long-term growth of this business continue to advance.
Overall, while we did have a slight build in reserves given the increasing possibility of a recession, we are operating from a position of strength. Our capital, liquidity and credit quality and reserve levels are strong, and our diversified business mix also positions us well for the choppy waters on the horizon.
Well, while the world has changed since we presented our Investor Day to you in March, our strategy has not. We have continued to execute it with discipline and with urgency. The quarterly report card on Slide 3 should help you hold us accountable for our progress. We are laser-focused on the long-term goals we set out in March, and I see this quarter's performance as validating that we are indeed on the right path.
Simplifying the firm is a high priority, and we made good progress executing on our divestitures, such as closing the sale of Australia during the quarter. We're well into the sales process in Mexico, working through the regulatory and legal dynamics that can be expected in a transaction of this nature.
In terms of Russia, we continue to shrink the size of our business and take steps to reduce our financial exposure. Given the complex environment, we are considering the full range of possibilities to exit our Consumer & Commercial Banking businesses, including portfolio sales. As divestitures such as Australia progress, we are beginning to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our model. And this discipline is critical to ensuring we have the resources to invest in the businesses where we want to gain or maintain a competitive advantage and to ensure the success of our transformation.
To that point, we were particularly pleased that our AML consent order was lifted by the OCC in April. We are committed to ensuring our technology, controls and processes are up to the standards our regulators expect of us and we expect of ourselves.
Let me end on capital. We increased our CET1 ratio to 11.9% this quarter whilst returning $1.3 billion in capital, including a rather modest level of buybacks. Our tangible book value per share now exceeds $80. Despite the strength of our balance sheet and reserves, our stress capital buffer is set to increase to 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of this year's stress test scenario. So over the near term, we plan to build to a CET1 ratio of approximately 13%, including our 100 basis point management buffer. Over the medium term, our CET1 target remains at 11.5% to 12%.
We are prioritizing our dividend and are pausing our share repurchases as we build capital. We have a management buffer, which we can use to help ensure a smooth path to our required levels, and Mark will walk you through our approach in a few minutes. We will generate significant capital given our earnings power and the completion of pending divestitures. We know how important buybacks are to shareholder value creation, in particular when we are trading at these levels, and are committed to restarting them as soon as it is prudent to do so.
We will make every effort to optimize our capital, especially in businesses such as Markets. So we balance the needs of our clients, our investors and our regulators. Overall, in a challenging macro and geopolitical environment, our team delivered solid results, and the bank is in a very strong position to weather uncertain times whilst playing to our strengths. I'm confident about the path ahead, and I'm pleased with our early progress.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions."

I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; then spend a little more time on expenses, capital and Russia",2461,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; then spend a little more time on expenses, capital and Russia; and then turn to the results of each segment and end with 2022 guidance.
On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the second quarter, we reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 with an RoTCE of 11.2% or $19.6 billion of revenues. In the quarter, total revenues increased 11% with growth in both net interest income as well as noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 14% driven by higher rates as well as strong volumes across ICG and PBWM. Noninterest revenue grew 5% driven by fixed income and services, which more than offset lower noninterest revenue in Investment Banking and PBWM.
Total expenses of $12.4 billion increased 8%, largely driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses. On a year-to-date basis, expenses were up 12%, but excluding divestiture-related impacts were up 9%, also driven by the factors I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $1.3 billion driven by net credit losses of $850 million and an ACL build of approximately $400 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.3 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44% and are well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%.
On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the second quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to risk, controls, data and the finance programs. And approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. And as of today, we have over 9,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 2% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth. And we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms.
2% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in Markets and Cards. And approximately 1% was driven by compensation as well as other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 14% for the quarter.
Before we move on from expenses, we wanted to provide some tangible examples of what we are working on regarding our transformation and some of the benefits we expect to see over time. The transformation is designed to improve our governance and processes, enhance our policies and leverage technology to strengthen our controls. We've been actively investing in technology to improve automation and hiring people to stand up these efforts.
To this end, we are enhancing our risk management processes and capabilities across a number of areas. For example, in Banking, we've gone live with a new platform and now begun to consolidate our 37 loan processing systems to 1 loan servicing platform. And we have continued to build out our infrastructure to enhance our stress testing capabilities across the firm, particularly useful in this market.
Given the power and importance of data, we are redesigning our data governance and data organization, which will help us improve the timeliness and quality of our data. These foundational data-related changes will allow us to simplify and improve client onboarding and deepening, product development as well as enhance our data analytics for every function.
And we are streamlining our financial planning process to allow for multiple scenarios with greater frequency, including more agile capital planning. And we signed with a major software provider to begin a multiyear process of modernizing and moving our 16 ledger platforms deployed across 121 instances to 1 cloud-based ledger. And while we are in the early stages of these initiatives, we expect the efficiencies from these investments to be key in helping us meet our Investor Day commitments.
On Slide 6, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $1.1 billion on a sequential basis driven by higher rates, day count, growth in loans as well as the impact of the European dividend season on our Markets business. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $1.5 billion driven by higher interest rates as well as volumes across businesses. And we grew average loans by approximately 3% in ICG, mainly in trade finance, and 4% in PBWM.
Legacy franchises loans declined, largely driven by the reclassification of loans to held for sale. And sequentially, the gross yield on our loans increased by 35 basis points, and the cost of our interest-bearing deposits increased by 20 basis points.
On Slide 7, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 22% or $531 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $964 billion. Our end-of-period deposits increased by 1%, largely driven by TTS and wealth. On a sequential basis, deposits decreased by 1%, including the impact of seasonality in wealth.
From an RWA perspective, we saw both advanced and standardized RWA come down both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to optimize RWA. We ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of approximately 11.9%, and standardized remains the binding requirement. And our tangible book value per share was $80.25, up 3%.
On Slide 8, we show a sequential CET1 ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our goals over the next few quarters. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 34 basis points. Second, we returned $1.3 billion in the form of dividends and buybacks, which drove a reduction of about 10 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 12 basis point reduction. Fourth, the decrease in disallowed DTA drove a 5 basis point increase. And finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of our net RWA optimization efforts as well as the 12 basis point benefit from the closing of the Australia sale.
We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, 50 basis points higher than the first quarter and well above the regulatory requirement of 10.5%. We expect our regulatory requirement to increase to 11.5% in October of 2022 to account for the increase in our stress capital buffer from 3% to 4%. In January, our regulatory requirement will increase to 12% as a result of an increase in our G-SIB surcharge.
A combination of our earnings generation, closing of divestitures and continued RWA optimization efforts will be important tools as we manage towards our CET1 requirement. And our management buffer, which was designed to temporarily address volatility, will allow us to build gradually while continuing to support our clients.
Given all that, we do expect to build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which accounts for the increased regulatory requirement and assumes a 100 basis point management buffer. However, consistent with what we said at Investor Day, our medium-term target remains at 11.5% to 12%. And while we are pausing buybacks for now, as I've said before, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time.
On Slide 9, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. In 2Q, we reduced our exposure by $3.1 billion in local currency terms, which was more than offset by the ruble appreciation. As of today, the mix of our exposure has changed and is now reflecting a higher proportion of stronger credit names. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $700 million due to the ruble appreciation.
As a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios our potential capital impact is estimated to be approximately $2 billion, down from the $2.5 billion to $3 billion last quarter.
On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased by 20%, largely driven by TTS, Markets, Securities Services as well as a gain on loan hedges, partially offset by a decrease in Investment Banking revenues. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.
Cost of credit was a benefit of $202 million with a net ACL release of $220 million and net credit losses of only $18 million. The release was largely driven by a reduction in Russia-related risk, partially offset by a build due to increased global macro uncertainty. This resulted in net income of approximately $4 billion, up 16%. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by TTS loans, which were up 17%. Average deposits grew 1% driven by the deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 16.6%.
On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 33% driven by 42% growth in net interest income as well as 17% growth in NIR as we saw a strong growth with both mid- and large corporate clients. And we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 61%.
Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 16% as net interest income grew 41% driven by higher interest rates across currencies. And NIR grew 8%, largely reflecting elevated activity levels in issuer services.
Overall markets revenues were up 25%. The macro environment played to our strengths with the volatility leading to elevated corporate client activity. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 31% driven by FX, rates and commodities due to active engagement with our corporate clients as we help them manage risk associated with volatile markets. Equity markets revenues were up 8% driven by strong equity derivative performance, partially offset by less client activity in cash and a net decrease in prime balances as lower asset valuations more than offset new client balance.
Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 28% driven by Investment Banking as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted client activity, partially offset by higher revenue in corporate lending. So we feel very good about the progress we are making here as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients.
Now turning to Slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue, largely driven by partner payments in Retail Services. Expenses were up 12% driven by transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit of $1.4 billion was up as we added reserves given the increase in overall uncertainty in the macro environment compared to a net ACL release last year. And NCLs were down 19% as we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios.
Average loans grew 4% driven by strong growth in Branded Cards as well as growth across Retail Services and wealth. Average deposits grew 6% driven by growth across retail and wealth. We continue to maintain a strong reserve-to-loan ratio of 7.5% in our U.S. Cards businesses. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 6.8%. While a low return, this was driven by the ACL build and an increase in expenses in the quarter.
On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 10% driven by higher interest on higher loan balances. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts and card spend volumes both up 18% and average loans up 11%. Retail Services revenues were up 7%, also driven by higher interest on higher loan balances, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making have driven growth in interest-earning balances of 3% in Branded Cards and 2% in Retail Services, and we believe we will continue to grow these balances in the second half of the year.
Retail Banking revenues were up 6%, primarily driven by deposit spreads and volumes. Wealth revenues were flat as investment fee headwinds offset NII growth driven by deposits and loan volumes. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. We're starting to see the leading indicators pick up with average deposits up 7% and client advisers up 8%. And we are seeing strong new client acquisitions, having added 800 Private Bank clients and over 50,000 Citigold clients since last year.
On Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchises. Revenues declined 15%, largely driven by the closing of the Australia consumer sale, the Korea wind-down and muted investment activity in Asia. And as we mentioned, this quarter, we closed the sale of the Australia consumer business, which was a benefit of up to $1.5 billion of capital.
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, and expenses were down.
On Slide 16, we briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook. At this point, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range. Relative to Investor Day, the rate curve is certainly giving us a tailwind from an NII perspective, and Markets revenues are up for the first half of the year. However, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing much lower levels of Investment Banking activity, and this will likely continue for the remainder of the year.
In terms of expenses, we still expect to grow expenses by 7% to 8%, excluding the impact of divestitures. While we are seeing some impact from inflation, we believe the efficiencies that we're executing against and the impact of foreign exchange translation should offset these headwinds.
And with that said, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

As you said, we have seen the benefit certainly in the quarter here of the pickup in rates.

As you said, we have seen the benefit certainly in the quarter here of the pickup in rates. And certainly, all indicators are that the rate increases will likely continue through the balance of the year. And as you've heard me say before, I do expect that we will see continued growth in loans, particularly on the card side. And we saw some of that start to play in sooner than expected because I had talked about it being in the back half of the year. We saw some of that even here in the second quarter. So we do continue to think we'll get some lift there.
We also expect to see continued momentum on the services side, both in TTS and life with Securities Services as well. And that growth is more than just rates, but certainly a portion of that does come from rates as well. Where the pressure is going to come is in the noninterest revenue, and we saw that certainly in the quarter here on the Investment Banking side. We saw that obviously in some of the wealth businesses, particularly in Asia. And that's where some of the offset is that we'd expect against that NII momentum.
Now the reality, I think, is that we'll have to see how this plays out as it relates to markets. All the uncertainty that's out there in the environment thus far have played -- has played to our favor given our focus on corporate clients and what have you. But I'd tell you that as I look at the full year, based on what we know now and with the uncertainty that's out there, I continue to feel comfortable with that guidance probably to the higher end of that low single-digit growth that I've talked about."

We got to think there are a couple of drivers that kind of come into play when we think about the sensitivity. So one is obviously the mix. And so in our case, we've got about 2/3 of our deposits are wholesale, about 1/3 are consumer. We've got obviously 70% of ours are in U.S.-denominated and the rest are kind of non-U.S. And that mix is important when you think about betas, when you think about sensitivity and how they play out, particularly in a rising rate environment at the pace that we've seen, and that pace varies for both the U.S. versus the non-U.S. currencies. And so that's all going to be a factor in kind of how we think about it.
You're right. In our disclosure, we forecast our IRE disclosure based on a runoff balance sheet assumption. And what I've been describing the past couple of quarters an approach -- is an approach that's more consistent with peers, which assumes a static balance sheet. And under that analysis, if we were to look at an assumption for 100 basis points parallel shift in rates, cross-currencies, we think that would generate roughly a $2.5 billion increase in NII.
Now for us, that's going to skew towards non-U.S. dollars. About 80% of that would be non-U.S. dollar, about 20% U.S. dollar. And that shift is in part because we've seen already a significant increase in the U.S. We've seen some increase in non-U.S. but nowhere near the magnitude that we've seen in the U.S. So I'll stop there. Hopefully, that addresses your question."

So on the Retail Services side, it has nothing to do with kind of an extension of a contract or anything like that. What I'm describing is that it is a partner business that we have there in Retail Services. And what that means is that there's a sharing of the profits associated with the business that we generate.
And so what happens is in this rising rate environment, we've seen -- and the activity from a volume point of view, we've seen an increase in the net interest income that we've generated. And what that means is that there's more, fortunately, more profits to share with our partners. The sharing of those profits play through the noninterest revenue line. So it comes out of -- comes out as a fee of the contra revenue as we share those with clients. So that's the driver of the swing that you see happening there or the pressure that we have in PBWM as it relates to Retail Services.
In terms of the Cards growth, the Cards growth, we feel very good about it. There certainly is an environmental dynamic that's playing out as it relates to consumers and corporates. But what I would say is that you've also heard us describing more marketing spend, more advertising spend, more acquisitions, 18% growth in acquisitions. We've been targeting growing our customer base there while staying within our risk appetite. The parameters that we've set have been very disciplined about. And that started to pay off. And that is part of what I described in terms of the loan growth that is materializing.
There's nothing that we see of significance as we grow these loans that would suggest, one, that they're outside of the focus that we've had to date because they're not, nor that there's any material risk in terms of outsized losses. If you look at our loss rates, our loss rates are -- for Branded Cards, 1.5%; Retail Services, 2.6%. Those are 50% of what we would normally -- what we used to describe as a normal loss rate, NCL rate, through a cycle. And so we feel very good about the loans that we're growing. There's obviously risk, but we also feel very good about the reserves that we have."

And the net interest income and net interest margin certainly surprised to the upside. So I guess let me reask the question. Appreciate the $2.5 billion for each 100 basis point parallel shift.
But as we think about the U.S. forward curve, how should we think about the trajectory of net interest income from that 10.58 from here. And clearly, as we think about a deposit base that's 2/3 wholesale, how should we think about both deposit flow, deposit growth and deposit beta as we think about the second half of the year? In other words, does the rate of change quarter-over-quarter accelerate, flatten out or decelerate?"

And that -- the speed at which rates increases matters a lot as it relates to the betas. And so -- particularly on the wholesale corporate side. And so we have seen betas increase there. They're probably at about to slightly a little bit better than we would have expected. But we would expect that momentum to continue in the back half of the year given the forecast for continued rate increases.
The other thing that I'd point out, just giving you a point around the ability to forecast from a Citi point of view. If you look at the first half of the year, we did about -- I think it was $1.8 billion or so over the prior year ex Markets. So NII, ex Markets, 1.8 billion year-over-year first half. To give you a bit more guidance on how we're thinking about it in light of the rate curve and in light of our mix, I'd tell you that I expect about another $1.8 billion or so in the back half. So that's probably year-over-year, 8-ish percent or so, 4% on a full year basis based on, again, our mix our assumption around betas and our current assumptions around how the curve would likely play out.

I guess let me kind of answer it in a more fulsome way, if you don't mind, and then I'll certainly make sure that I give you a sense for the contribution of what we expect from divestitures to the capital impact. So again, there are a couple of drivers that are going to be important to us building to ultimately the 13% for as long as that is in place given the SCB. One is obviously the income generation. And we had a very strong quarter as it relates to income generation. I feel good about the back half of the year, as I've just given you some guidance on.
The other is, don't forget, we've had 160 basis points on the 2-year since the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter in terms of rate increases, another 60 in the second quarter. And there's going to be -- there were AOCI impacts from that, 34 in the first quarter, and as we point out here, another 12 in the second, There's a pull to par that we expect to start to play out and continue to play out in the balance of the year. That's going to be an important factor.
The third, as you've heard us mention is we've been working very hard to optimize our RWA, and we'll continue to do that. We paused the buybacks. That's a factor. And then as you mentioned, the divestitures to close to $1.5 billion or so in Australia. I've talked about in the past about $4 billion for the year in terms of capital impact. I'm at about $3.5 billion with Australia is what I'm currently expecting and so a little bit less than what I talked about before, in part because of some of the movement in terms of the timing of some of these closings. Still feel good about it. Just it's a difficult market that we're managing through. So that $3.5 billion total should give you a sense for how that translates into a CET1 impact that we're expecting, at least through the balance of this year. And obviously, there'll be more to come as we continue to close out and -- sign and close out some of the remaining deals."

But I think we're extremely well positioned for what lies ahead in terms of strong capital ratios, total liquidity resources. Portfolio credit quality is extremely high, well reserved.

So I would encourage you to sit at the beach this weekend and have an excellent read of the supplement because we've provided you with a lot of good facts and proof points and information both around the services businesses and the others about the early progress on the strategy.
TTS was able to fire, as I said, on all cylinders this quarter. About 2/3 of the performance was driven by business actions and 1/3 was by rates and as Mark said, very active management of the deposit base, beta discipline across all the regions. And the NIR growth that you saw was driven by cards, by payments, by receivables and by trade.
When you look in the strategic drivers we laid out at Investor Day this quarter, cross-border transaction value, up 17% year-over-year; clearing volume, up 2% in U.S. dollar; commercial comp spend, up 62% as that business recovered; average trade loan balances, up 14%; average deposit balances, up 2%. So that 2/3 that was not rates-related has a very broad and substantive set of drivers behind it that, as Mark said, puts us into a very strong position for continued momentum here.
This level of year-over-year growth is very pleasing, but we would expect to see it revert to the medium-term guidance we gave you at Investor Day over time. But this was across the board, all elements firing. And I will give a shout-out to Samir, the Head of TTS, as well as to our Securities Services team. But he has really instituted a culture of intensity, of tremendous focus, of discipline in how he is running the business as well. And I think that is also a contributing factor to the confidence that you're hearing from us about this. Mark, do you want to explain what TTS and Securities Services is?"

And the medium term, as you know, Betsy, for us is 3 to 5 years. We've got a couple of things that we're working through, not the least of which are the divestitures. They will certainly contribute to that, but so will some of the other things that I've mentioned, including utilization of the DTA, the AOCI pullback and things of that sort. The divestitures certainly will help from an SCB point of view, but I think the stronger performance that we're seeing will aid in that as well.
And importantly, the mix change that we expect to come from executing on our strategy, a mix towards more sustainable, predictable earnings, earnings that are coming from some of the areas of growth that we demonstrated this quarter like TTS and Securities Services, et cetera, et cetera. So there's time there. There's obviously a management buffer component of that, that I think is certainly an important factor in consideration as we evolve our mix.
And then there's the G-SIB score. With not only a reduction in the divestitures that will impact peak-to-trough losses, there's also deposits that will go away with those and balance sheet evolution that will contribute to the reduction in G-SIB score as well."

The pressure from quantitative tightening, I think, will certainly play out over time. But again, our focus is on growing the operating deposits that we have with clients. And we think we've got good traction and ability to continue momentum with those operating deposits. And again, they put us in a position to really broaden the relationship with both those multinational clients as well as with some of our commercial clients where we've been getting good growth in and momentum from.
So yes, likely to be an impact across the industry, but we believe we can get some continued momentum, particularly on the operating deposits that we have with clients. In terms of Markets NII, I mean, you've got the European dividend that plays out in the second quarter. So that obviously is a factor there.
And again, I'd point you to when we talk about Markets, I really like to talk about total revenues because the nature of the security and the trading and the activity that we do there can have an impact on NII and NIR. And what really matters is the total revenues that we're driving and generating out of that franchise. And as you can see, we did 25% growth in Markets revenue year-over-year.

So look, the -- what we've been doing very actively since the beginning of the year, and certainly in the quarter as well, has been working -- we've been working to bring down our exposure in Russia and specifically with the clients that we serve there. And so that direct exposure on -- in a local currency dials, we brought down by some $900 million or so in the quarter. We brought down and reduced the cash and deposits that we have by another $1.7 billion or so and then continued to bring down third-party related exposure by another $400 million. And that's been through working with clients to pay those exposures and loans down, and in some instances, giving them incentives to do so and incentives to move their deposits out as well. So very active engagement from the team as it relates to that.
What's happened with that is the mix of the exposure that we have or that remains has skewed towards the higher-quality names and towards the global subsidiaries that we have in the country. And so with that mix shift to better quality names and the reduction in exposure, that's allowed for us to take down the reserves that we had related to the direct exposure in the quarter. And so that has been, I think, good -- very good progress in terms of that reduction. It gets overshadowed a bit with the ruble impact, but we've made good progress and we're going to continue to actively do that.

We are systematically crunching down the size of our franchise. And as Mark says, the severe stress loss scenario is probably the best indicator of that, which is now around about the $2 billion and materially reduced them. And we completely change the nature of our exposure. Particularly when you think about today, most of our clients are multinationals. Many of the exposures there have parent guarantees against them, which is very helpful.
What are we doing with them? Many of them that -- we're helping them with their exits from the countries. And that obviously, as you can all appreciate, take some time. So for those that are able to exit swiftly, it's -- that's another factor that can help us reduce down our exposure presence, and indeed, our operations.
There are also others though that it is harder. I think we've all seen how difficult it is to disconnect the Russian economy from the West in a couple of key sectors, in particular food and in particular energy. And as you can imagine, given the nature of our bank, we've been in the middle of some of those flows that are essential for the West and the multinationals that are supporting it.
And so you get a -- you have a bit of a blended story here in terms of -- yes, we're helping those that can exit, but we're also still playing the role that we have to and have been asked to in maintaining some of those flows. We anticipate that they will continue to reduce over time as the energy and food security issues get addressed. But it's a complex environment. And bottom line, you can hear us, we're pleased with how this has been managed by our teams."

The labor market is exceedingly tight. We are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a recession next year. But I think what you're hearing from us quite loud and clear is that we think the economy is quite well positioned to withstand it.
Europe, different story. Fragility of their energy supply to any further shocks makes it more vulnerable, and it's kind of at the center of the storm. So we do believe that the continent is heading into a recession under the most likely scenario and could be as early as this fall.
In Asia, concerned, largely focused around China and its COVID -- Zero COVID policy. The economy is bouncing back, but you could have another wave that could be more problematic there. So you put all these different factors. So it's a little bit depends on where in the world that you are.
When I think about Citi, look, we're prepared for a variety of scenarios. We are absolutely ready. We run stress tests all the time given the unique set of risks facing the global economy right now. We have a set of playbooks honed over many years that can get instituted as necessary. And what matters for a bank heading into recession? Capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserves. And we feel very good about all 4 of them. Very strong capital ratios, as you've seen, ending 2Q. Total liquidity resources just shy of $1 trillion. Over 80% of our corporate exposures are investment-grade. Our consumer clients are heavily prime.
And let's just talk a little bit about the ICG NCL this quarter. When you look at the numbers, it was $18 million only. The health of the corporate is entering into the choppy waters is extremely strong. And we have -- we've got a very well reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44. So we have a lot of flexibility here.

You saw -- we talked about services, so I don't need to cover that one again. In Markets, we talked about optimizing RWA, driving the business for stronger capital productivity, also driving more of the Alpha trade solution business. You see that Personal Banking returning to IEB and revenue growth on customer acquisition, purchase sales being important metrics.
Investment Banking, it's progress on key hires and -- that we've been making.

When we last spoke, we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain. So in one sense, little has changed. However, the headwinds have certainly crystallized. And it's agai",1431,"Thank you, Jen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. When we last spoke, we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain. So in one sense, little has changed. However, the headwinds have certainly crystallized. And it's against that backdrop that I'm proud of the results our team delivered this quarter as we execute on our strategy and transformation. 
There are mounting costs to the series of supply shocks we've experienced. And now we need to pay attention to an additional S in ESG, and that is security. In addition to energy and cybersecurity, food security has also come into sharper focus, threatening to spread the humanitarian cost of the war well beyond Europe. Resiliency is the new priority for governments and corporates alike. And all of this is adding to inflationary pressures, which are in turn being met with a more hawkish response from the Fed and other central banks, all contributing to sharply lower U.S. consumer confidence. 
Higher rates and QT will keep volatility high. That said, while sentiment has shifted, little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight. 
Similarly, our corporate clients see robust demand and healthy balance sheet with revenue softness attributed to supply chain constraints so far. So while a recession could indeed take place over the next 2 years in the U.S., it's highly unlikely to be a sharper downturn as others in recent memory. 
I'm just back from Europe, where it's a different story. We expect a very difficult winter is coming, and that's due to disruptions in the energy supply. There is also increasing concern about second order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent. And the mood is, of course, further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon. 
In Asia, a rebound in China also faces some constraints given the potential for future lockdowns, the amount of leverage in the Chinese economy and stress in their property sector. Given this uncertain environment, I'm quite pleased with our overall performance. We reported net income of $4.5 billion, an EPS of $2.19 and an RoTCE of 11.2%. We grew revenues at 11% year-over-year whilst remaining on track to meet our expense guidance for the year. 
Services continued to show excellent momentum with revenues up 28% year-over-year. While some of that growth is a result of the rate environment, we had double-digit fee growth, consistent with the strategy we presented to you in March. TTS in particular fired on all cylinders as clients took advantage of our global network, leading to the best quarter this business has had in a decade. 
The market volatility that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second, driving corporate clients in particular to be more active in risk management, contributing to revenue growth of 25% in markets. The volatility we saw in foreign exchange, rates, commodities and equity derivatives favored our mix, and we were more efficient in our capital usage. And while this level of activity is related to where we are in the current cycle rather than a new baseline in markets, I believe we are helping our clients navigate this environment quite well. And it shows how our emphasis on our corporate clients globally, given their consistent trading needs, is a differentiating one for us in market. 
On the flip side, that same environment continues to put a great deal of pressure on the Investment Banking wallet with our revenues down 46%. However, we are seeing an increase of lending as our clients have been less inclined to obtain financing through the debt markets given the recent swings. In U.S. personal banking, the positive drivers we saw in our 2 credit card businesses over the last few quarters converted into solid revenue growth this quarter, most notably, 10% growth in Branded Cards. 
And you can see how resilient the consumer is in the U.S. through the elevated payment rates and the low level of credit losses. They have, however, shifted their spend far more to travel and entertainment, which are now outpacing 2019 levels. 
While volatility can be an opportunity for our trading desks, lower asset prices are a headwind for wealth management. Asia again was hit harder than other regions, leading to flat year-over-year wealth management revenues overall. That said, we continue to execute our wealth strategy across a number of fronts, including building our base of client advisers, expanding our Private Bank physical footprint to reach 20 countries with the additions of Germany and France, and increasing referrals from our branch network in the U.S. So the underlying strategic drivers for the long-term growth of this business continue to advance. 
Overall, while we did have a slight build in reserves given the increasing possibility of a recession, we are operating from a position of strength. Our capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserve levels are strong, and our diversified business mix also positions us well for the choppy waters on the horizon. 
Well, while the world has changed since we presented our Investor Day to you in March, our strategy has not. We have continued to execute it with discipline and with urgency. The quarterly report card on Slide 3 should help you hold us accountable for our progress. We are laser-focused on the long-term goals we set out in March, and I see this quarter's performance as validating that we are indeed on the right path. 
Simplifying the firm is a high priority, and we made good progress executing on our divestitures, such as closing the sale of Australia during the quarter. We're well into the sales process in Mexico, working through the regulatory and legal dynamics that can be expected in a transaction of this nature. 
In terms of Russia, we continue to shrink the size of our business and take steps to reduce our financial exposure. Given the complex environment, we are considering the full range of possibilities to exit our Consumer & Commercial Banking businesses, including portfolio sales. As divestitures such as Australia progress, we are beginning to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our model. And this discipline is critical to ensuring we have the resources to invest in the businesses where we want to gain or maintain a competitive advantage and to ensure the success of our transformation. 
To that point, we were particularly pleased that our AML consent order was lifted by the OCC in April. We are committed to ensuring our technology, controls and processes are up to the standards our regulators expect of us and we expect of ourselves. 
Let me end on capital. We increased our CET1 ratio to 11.9% this quarter whilst returning $1.3 billion in capital, including a rather modest level of buybacks. Our tangible book value per share now exceeds $80. Despite the strength of our balance sheet and reserves, our stress capital buffer is set to increase to 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of this year's stress test scenario. So over the near term, we plan to build to a CET1 ratio of approximately 13%, including our 100 basis point management buffer. Over the medium term, our CET1 target remains at 11.5% to 12%. 
We are prioritizing our dividend and are pausing our share repurchases as we build capital. We have a management buffer, which we can use to help ensure a smooth path to our required levels, and Mark will walk you through our approach in a few minutes. We will generate significant capital given our earnings power and the completion of pending divestitures. We know how important buybacks are to shareholder value creation, in particular when we are trading at these levels, and are committed to restarting them as soon as it is prudent to do so. 
We will make every effort to optimize our capital, especially in businesses such as Markets. So we balance the needs of our clients, our investors and our regulators. Overall, in a challenging macro and geopolitical environment, our team delivered solid results, and the bank is in a very strong position to weather uncertain times whilst playing to our strengths. I'm confident about the path ahead, and I'm pleased with our early progress. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions."

I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; then spend a little more time on expenses, capital and Russia",2462,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; then spend a little more time on expenses, capital and Russia; and then turn to the results of each segment and end with 2022 guidance. 
On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the second quarter, we reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 with an RoTCE of 11.2% or $19.6 billion of revenues. In the quarter, total revenues increased 11% with growth in both net interest income as well as noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 14% driven by higher rates as well as strong volumes across ICG and PBWM. Noninterest revenue grew 5% driven by fixed income and services, which more than offset lower noninterest revenue in Investment Banking and PBWM. 
Total expenses of $12.4 billion increased 8%, largely driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses. On a year-to-date basis, expenses were up 12%, but excluding divestiture-related impacts were up 9%, also driven by the factors I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $1.3 billion driven by net credit losses of $850 million and an ACL build of approximately $400 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.3 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44% and are well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%. 
On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the second quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to risk, controls, data and the finance programs. And approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. And as of today, we have over 9,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 2% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth. And we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 
2% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in Markets and cards. And approximately 1% was driven by compensation as well as other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 14% for the quarter. 
Before we move on from expenses, we wanted to provide some tangible examples of what we are working on regarding our transformation and some of the benefits we expect to see over time. The transformation is designed to improve our governance and processes, enhance our policies and leverage technology to strengthen our controls. We've been actively investing in technology to improve automation and hiring people to stand up these efforts. 
To this end, we are enhancing our risk management processes and capabilities across a number of areas. For example, in Banking, we've gone live with a new platform and now begun to consolidate our 37 loan processing systems to 1 loan servicing platform. And we have continued to build out our infrastructure to enhance our stress testing capabilities across the firm, particularly useful in this market. 
Given the power and importance of data, we are redesigning our data governance and data organization, which will help us improve the timeliness and quality of our data. These foundational data-related changes will allow us to simplify and improve client onboarding and deepening, product development as well as enhance our data analytics for every function. 
And we are streamlining our financial planning process to allow for multiple scenarios with greater frequency, including more agile capital planning. And we signed with a major software provider to begin a multiyear process of modernizing and moving our 16 ledger platforms deployed across 121 instances to 1 cloud-based ledger. And while we are in the early stages of these initiatives, we expect the efficiencies from these investments to be key in helping us meet our Investor Day commitments. 
On Slide 6, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $1.1 billion on a sequential basis driven by higher rates, day count, growth in loans as well as the impact of the European dividend season on our Markets business. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $1.5 billion driven by higher interest rates as well as volumes across businesses. And we grew average loans by approximately 3% in ICG, mainly in trade finance, and 4% in PBWM. 
Legacy franchises loans declined, largely driven by the reclassification of loans to held for sale. And sequentially, the gross yield on our loans increased by 35 basis points, and the cost of our interest-bearing deposits increased by 20 basis points. 
On Slide 7, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 22% or $531 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $964 billion. Our end-of-period deposits increased by 1%, largely driven by TTS and wealth. On a sequential basis, deposits decreased by 1%, including the impact of seasonality in wealth. 
From an RWA perspective, we saw both advanced and standardized RWA come down both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to optimize RWA. We ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of approximately 11.9%, and standardized remains the binding requirement. And our tangible book value per share was $80.25, up 3%. 
On Slide 8, we show a sequential CET1 ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our goals over the next few quarters. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 34 basis points. Second, we returned $1.3 billion in the form of dividends and buybacks, which drove a reduction of about 10 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 12 basis point reduction. Fourth, the decrease in disallowed DTA drove a 5 basis point increase. And finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of our net RWA optimization efforts as well as the 12 basis point benefit from the closing of the Australia sale. 
We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, 50 basis points higher than the first quarter and well above the regulatory requirement of 10.5%. We expect our regulatory requirement to increase to 11.5% in October of 2022 to account for the increase in our stress capital buffer from 3% to 4%. In January, our regulatory requirement will increase to 12% as a result of an increase in our G-SIB surcharge. 
A combination of our earnings generation, closing of divestitures and continued RWA optimization efforts will be important tools as we manage towards our CET1 requirement. And our management buffer, which was designed to temporarily address volatility, will allow us to build gradually while continuing to support our clients. 
Given all that, we do expect to build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which accounts for the increased regulatory requirement and assumes a 100 basis point management buffer. However, consistent with what we said at Investor Day, our medium-term target remains at 11.5% to 12%. And while we are pausing buybacks for now, as I've said before, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. 
On Slide 9, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. In 2Q, we reduced our exposure by $3.1 billion in local currency terms, which was more than offset by the ruble appreciation. As of today, the mix of our exposure has changed and is now reflecting a higher proportion of stronger credit names. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $700 million due to the ruble appreciation. 
As a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios our potential capital impact is estimated to be approximately $2 billion, down from the $2.5 billion to $3 billion last quarter. 
On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased by 20%, largely driven by TTS, Markets, Securities Services as well as a gain on loan hedges, partially offset by a decrease in Investment Banking revenues. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a benefit of $202 million with a net ACL release of $220 million and net credit losses of only $18 million. The release was largely driven by a reduction in Russia-related risk, partially offset by a build due to increased global macro uncertainty. This resulted in net income of approximately $4 billion, up 16%. 
We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by TTS loans, which were up 17%. Average deposits grew 1% driven by the deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 16.6%. 
On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 33% driven by 42% growth in net interest income as well as 17% growth in NIR as we saw a strong growth with both mid- and large corporate clients. And we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 61%. 
Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 16% as net interest income grew 41% driven by higher interest rates across currencies. And NIR grew 8%, largely reflecting elevated activity levels in issuer services. 
Overall markets revenues were up 25%. The macro environment played to our strengths with the volatility leading to elevated corporate client activity. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 31% driven by FX, rates and commodities due to active engagement with our corporate clients as we help them manage risk associated with volatile markets. Equity markets revenues were up 8% driven by strong equity derivative performance, partially offset by less client activity in cash and a net decrease in prime balances as lower asset valuations more than offset new client balance. 
Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 28% driven by Investment Banking as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted client activity, partially offset by higher revenue in corporate lending. So we feel very good about the progress we are making here as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients. 
Now turning to Slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue, largely driven by partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 12% driven by transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit of $1.4 billion was up as we added reserves given the increase in overall uncertainty in the macro environment compared to a net ACL release last year. And NCLs were down 19% as we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. 
Average loans grew 4% driven by strong growth in Branded Cards as well as growth across Retail Services and wealth. Average deposits grew 6% driven by growth across retail and wealth. We continue to maintain a strong reserve-to-loan ratio of 7.5% in our U.S. Cards businesses. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 6.8%. While a low return, this was driven by the ACL build and an increase in expenses in the quarter. 
On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 10% driven by higher interest on higher loan balances. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts and card spend volumes both up 18% and average loans up 11%. Retail Services revenues were up 7%, also driven by higher interest on higher loan balances, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making have driven growth in interest-earning balances of 3% in Branded Cards and 2% in Retail Services, and we believe we will continue to grow these balances in the second half of the year. 
Retail Banking revenues were up 6%, primarily driven by deposit spreads and volumes. Wealth revenues were flat as investment fee headwinds offset NII growth driven by deposits and loan volumes. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. We're starting to see the leading indicators pick up with average deposits up 7% and client advisers up 8%. And we are seeing strong new client acquisitions, having added 800 Private Bank clients and over 50,000 Citigold clients since last year. 
On Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchises. Revenues declined 15%, largely driven by the closing of the Australia consumer sale, the Korea wind down and muted investment activity in Asia. And as we mentioned, this quarter, we closed the sale of the Australia consumer business, which was a benefit of up to $1.5 billion of capital. 
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, and expenses were down. 
On Slide 16, we briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook. At this point, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range. Relative to Investor Day, the rate curve is certainly giving us a tailwind from an NII perspective, and Markets revenues are up for the first half of the year. However, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing much lower levels of Investment Banking activity, and this will likely continue for the remainder of the year. 
In terms of expenses, we still expect to grow expenses by 7% to 8%, excluding the impact of divestitures. While we are seeing some impact from inflation, we believe the efficiencies that we're executing against and the impact of foreign exchange translation should offset these headwinds. 
And with that said, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

As you said, we have seen the benefit certainly in the quarter here of the pickup in rates. And certainly, all indicators are that the rate increases will likely continue through the balance of the year. And as you've heard me say before, I do expect that we will see continued growth in loans, particularly on the card side. And we saw some of that start to play in sooner than expected because I had talked about it being in the back half of the year. We saw some of that even here in the second quarter. So we do continue to think we'll get some lift there. 
We also expect to see continued momentum on the services side, both in TTS and likely in Securities Services as well. And that growth is more than just rates, but certainly a portion of that does come from rates as well. Where the pressure is going to come is in the noninterest revenue, and we saw that certainly in the quarter here on the Investment Banking side. We saw that obviously in some of the wealth businesses, particularly in Asia. And that's where some of the offset is that we'd expect against that NII momentum. 
Now the reality, I think, is that we'll have to see how this plays out as it relates to markets. All the uncertainty that's out there in the environment thus far have played -- has played to our favor given our focus on corporate clients and what have you. But I'd tell you that as I look at the full year, based on what we know now and with the uncertainty that's out there, I continue to feel comfortable with that guidance probably to the higher end of that low single-digit growth that I've talked about."

We got to think there are a couple of drivers that kind of come into play when we think about the sensitivity. So one is obviously the mix. And so in our case, we've got about 2/3 of our deposits are wholesale, about 1/3 are consumer. We've got obviously 70% of ours are in U.S.-denominated and the rest are kind of non-U.S. And that mix is important when you think about betas, when you think about sensitivity and how they play out, particularly in a rising rate environment at the pace that we've seen, and that pace varies for both the U.S. versus the non-U.S. currencies. And so that's all going to be a factor in kind of how we think about it. 
You're right. In our disclosure, we forecast our IRE disclosure based on a runoff balance sheet assumption. And what I've been describing the past couple of quarters an approach -- is an approach that's more consistent with peers, which assumes a static balance sheet. And under that analysis, if we were to look at an assumption for 100 basis points parallel shift in rates, cross-currencies, we think that would generate roughly a $2.5 billion increase in NII. 
Now for us, that's going to skew towards non-U.S. dollars. About 80% of that would be non-U.S. dollar, about 20% U.S. dollar. And that shift is in part because we've seen already a significant increase in the U.S. We've seen some increase in non-U.S. but nowhere near the magnitude that we've seen in the U.S. So I'll stop there. Hopefully, that addresses your question."

So on the Retail Services side, it has nothing to do with kind of an extension of a contract or anything like that. What I'm describing is that it is a partner business that we have there in Retail Services. And what that means is that there's a sharing of the profits associated with the business that we generate. 
And so what happens is in this rising rate environment, we've seen -- and the activity from a volume point of view, we've seen an increase in the net interest income that we've generated. And what that means is that there's more, fortunately, more profits to share with our partners. The sharing of those profits play through the noninterest revenue line. So it comes out of -- comes out as a fee of the contra revenue as we share those with clients. So that's the driver of the swing that you see happening there or the pressure that we have in PBWM as it relates to Retail Services. 
In terms of the cards growth, the cards growth, we feel very good about it. There certainly is an environmental dynamic that's playing out as it relates to consumers and corporates. But what I would say is that you've also heard us describing more marketing spend, more advertising spend, more acquisitions, 18% growth in acquisitions. We've been targeting growing our customer base there while staying within our risk appetite. The parameters that we've set have been very disciplined about. And that started to pay off. And that is part of what I described in terms of the loan growth that is materializing. 
There's nothing that we see of significance as we grow these loans that would suggest, one, that they're outside of the focus that we've had to date because they're not, nor that there's any material risk in terms of outsized losses. If you look at our loss rates, our loss rates are -- for Branded Cards, 1.5%; Retail Services, 2.6%. Those are 50% of what we would normally -- what we used to describe as a normal loss rate, NCL rate, through a cycle. And so we feel very good about the loans that we're growing. There's obviously risk, but we also feel very good about the reserves that we have."

And the net interest income and net interest margin certainly surprised to the upside. So I guess let me reask the question. Appreciate the $2.5 billion for each 100 basis point parallel shift. But as we think about the U.S. forward curve, how should we think about the trajectory of net interest income from that 10.58 from here? And clearly, as we think about a deposit base that's 2/3 wholesale, how should we think about both deposit flow, deposit growth and deposit beta as we think about the second half of the year? In other words, does the rate of change quarter-over-quarter accelerate, flatten out or decelerate?"

And that the speed at which rates increases matters a lot as it relates to the betas. And so -- particularly on the wholesale corporate side. And so we have seen betas increase there. They're probably at about to slightly a little bit better than we would have expected. But we would expect that momentum to continue in the back half of the year given the forecast for continued rate increases. 
The other thing that I'd point out, just giving you a point around the ability to forecast from a Citi point of view, If you look at the first half of the year, we did about -- I think it was $1.8 billion or so over the prior year ex Markets. So NII, ex Markets, 1.8 billion year-over-year first half. To give you a bit more guidance on how we're thinking about it in light of the rate curve and in light of our mix, I'd tell you that I expect about another $1.8 billion or so in the back half. So that's probably year-over-year, 8-ish percent or so, 4% on a full year basis based on, again, our mix our assumption around betas and our current assumptions around how the curve would likely play out. Let me pause there and see if Jane wants to add anything to that."

I guess let me kind of answer it in a more fulsome way, if you don't mind, and then I'll certainly make sure that I give you a sense for the contribution of what we expect from divestitures to the capital impact. So again, there are a couple of drivers that are going to be important to us building to ultimately the 13% for as long as that is in place given the SCB. One is obviously the income generation. And we had a very strong quarter as it relates to income generation. I feel good about the back half of the year, as I've just given you some guidance on. 
The other is, don't forget, we've had 160 basis points on the 2-year since the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter in terms of rate increases, another 60 in the second quarter. And there's going to be -- there were AOCI impacts from that, 34 in the first quarter. And as we point out here, another 12 in the second. There's a pull to par that we expect to start to play out and continue to play out in the balance of the year. That's going to be an important factor. 
The third, as you've heard us mention is we've been working very hard to optimize our RWA, and we'll continue to do that. We paused the buybacks. That's a factor. And then as you mentioned, the divestitures to close to $1.5 billion or so in Australia, I've talked about in the past about $4 billion for the year in terms of capital impact. I'm at about $3.5 billion with Australia is what I'm currently expecting. And so a little bit less than what I talked about before, in part because of some of the movement in terms of the timing of some of these closings. Still feel good about it. Just it's a difficult market that we're managing through. So that $3.5 billion total should give you a sense for how that translates into a CET1 impact that we're expecting, at least through the balance of this year. And obviously, there'll be more to come as we continue to close out and -- sign and close out some of the remaining deals."

But I think we're extremely well positioned for what lies ahead in terms of strong capital ratios, total liquidity resources. Portfolio credit quality is extremely high, well reserved.

So I would encourage you to sit at the beach this weekend and have an excellent read of the supplement because we've provided you with a lot of good facts and proof points and information both around the services businesses and the others about the early progress on the strategy. 
TTS was able to fire, as I said, on all cylinders this quarter. About 2/3 of the performance was driven by business actions and 1/3 was by rates. And as Mark said, very active management of the deposit base, beta discipline across all the regions. And the NIR growth that you saw was driven by cards, by payments, by receivables and by trade. 
When you look in the strategic drivers we laid out at Investor Day this quarter, cross-border transaction value, up 17% year-over-year; clearing volume, up 2% in U.S. dollar; commercial comp spend, up 62% as that business recovered; average trade loan balances, up 14%; average deposit balances, up 2%. So that 2/3 that was not rates-related has a very broad and substantive set of drivers behind it that, as Mark said, puts us into a very strong position for continued momentum here. 
This level of year-over-year growth is very pleasing, but we would expect to see it revert to the medium-term guidance we gave you at Investor Day over time. But this was across the board, all elements firing. And I will give a shout-out to Shahmir, the Head of TTS, as well as to our Securities Services team. But he has really instituted a culture of intensity, of tremendous focus, of discipline in how he is running the business as well.

So look, I mean, we are obviously going to take it quarter by quarter as it relates to buybacks and from a capital point of view. Again, without going through all of the things that reflect the environment that we're in, you can see the uncertainty that's out there. Obviously, the capital requirements with this SCB for the industry are higher. That's unfortunate. We feel as though the right amount of capital was in the industry already. We've got to manage to that. It's the right requirement. We're going to do that.
But we'll -- SCB gives us the opportunity to take those decisions quarter-by-quarter. We're pausing for now. And next year, there'll be another DFAST process, and there'll be an SCB that comes out of that. And frankly, we should have the strength of higher PPNR that we've been generating to help contribute to what that outcome looks like. So we'll take that quarter-by-quarter.
In terms of risk related to divestitures, again, we did highlight we're being very, very transparent with you all and with the world.

They will certainly contribute to that, but so will some of the other things that I've mentioned, including utilization of the DTA, the AOCI pullback and things of that sort. The divestitures certainly will help from an SCB point of view, but I think the stronger performance that we're seeing will aid in that as well.
And importantly, the mix change that we expect to come from executing on our strategy, a mix towards more sustainable, predictable earnings, earnings that are coming from some of the areas of growth that we demonstrated this quarter like TTS and Securities Services, et cetera, et cetera. So there's time there. There's obviously a management buffer component of that, that I think is certainly an important factor in consideration as we evolve our mix.
And then there's the G-SIB score. With not only a reduction in the divestitures that will impact peak-to-trough losses, there's also deposits that will go away with those and balance sheet evolution that will contribute to the reduction in G-SIB score as well."

The pressure from quantitative tightening, I think, will certainly play out over time. But again, our focus is on growing the operating deposits that we have with clients. And we think we've got good traction and ability to continue momentum with those operating deposits. And again, they put us in a position to really broaden the relationship with both those multinational clients as well as with some of our commercial clients where we've been getting good growth in and momentum from.
So yes, likely to be an impact across the industry, but we believe we can get some continued momentum, particularly on the operating deposits that we have with clients. In terms of Markets NII, I mean, you've got the European dividend that plays out in the second quarter. So that obviously is a factor there.
And again, I'd point you to when we talk about Markets, I really like to talk about total revenues because the nature of the security and the trading and the activity that we do there can have an impact on NII and NIR. And what really matters is the total revenues that we're driving and generating out of that franchise. And as you can see, we did 25% growth in Markets revenue year-over-year.

So look, the -- what we've been doing very actively since the beginning of the year, and certainly in the quarter as well, has been working -- we've been working to bring down our exposure in Russia and specifically with the clients that we serve there. And so that direct exposure on -- in a local currency dials, we brought down by some $900 million or so in the quarter. We brought down and reduced the cash and deposits that we have by another $1.7 billion or so and then continued to bring down third-party related exposure by another $400 million. And that's been through working with clients to pay those exposures and loans down, and in some instances, giving them incentives to do so and incentives to move their deposits out as well. So very active engagement from the team as it relates to that.
What's happened with that is the mix of the exposure that we have or that remains has skewed towards the higher-quality names and towards the global subsidiaries that we have in the country. And so with that mix shift to better quality names and the reduction in exposure, that's allowed for us to take down the reserves that we had related to the direct exposure in the quarter. And so that has been, I think, good -- very good progress in terms of that reduction. It gets overshadowed a bit with the ruble impact, but we've made good progress and we're going to continue to actively do that.

We are systematically crunching down the size of our franchise. And as Mark says, the severe stress loss scenario is probably the best indicator of that, which is now around about the $2 billion and materially reduced them. And we completely change the nature of our exposure. Particularly when you think about today, most of our clients are multinationals. Many of the exposures there have parent guarantees against them, which is very helpful.
What are we doing with them? Many of them that -- we're helping them with their exits from the countries. And that obviously, as you can all appreciate, take some time. So for those that are able to exit swiftly, it's -- that's another factor that can help us reduce down our exposure presence, and indeed, our operations.
There are also others though that it is harder. I think we've all seen how difficult it is to disconnect the Russian economy from the West in a couple of key sectors, in particular food and in particular energy. And as you can imagine, given the nature of our bank, we've been in the middle of some of those flows that are essential for the West and the multinationals that are supporting it.
And so you get a -- you have a bit of a blended story here in terms of -- yes, we're helping those that can exit, but we're also still playing the role that we have to and have been asked to in maintaining some of those flows. We anticipate that they will continue to reduce over time as the energy and food security issues get addressed. But it's a complex environment. And bottom line, you can hear us, we're pleased with how this has been managed by our teams."

The labor market is exceedingly tight. We are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a recession next year. But I think what you're hearing from us quite loud and clear is that we think the economy is quite well positioned to withstand it.
Europe, different story. Fragility of their energy supply to any further shocks makes it more vulnerable, and it's kind of at the center of the storm. So we do believe that the continent is heading into a recession under the most likely scenario and could be as early as this fall.
In Asia, concerned, largely focused around China and its COVID -- Zero COVID policy. The economy is bouncing back, but you could have another wave that could be more problematic there. So you put all these different factors. So it's a little bit depends on where in the world that you are.
When I think about Citi, look, we're prepared for a variety of scenarios. We are absolutely ready. We run stress tests all the time given the unique set of risks facing the global economy right now. We have a set of playbooks honed over many years that can get instituted as necessary. And what matters for a bank heading into recession? Capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserves. And we feel very good about all 4 of them. Very strong capital ratios, as you've seen, ending 2Q. Total liquidity resources just shy of $1 trillion. Over 80% of our corporate exposures are investment-grade. Our consumer clients are heavily prime.
And let's just talk a little bit about the ICG NCL this quarter. When you look at the numbers, it was $18 million only. The health of the corporate is entering into the choppy waters is extremely strong. And we have -- we've got a very well reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44. So we have a lot of flexibility here.

We were -- we went through a very thoughtful process to come up with the different KPIs for the strategy. And those are transparently put into the materials. We're trying to make it as shareholder- and investor-friendly as possible in that respect. And we -- as you can see this quarter, the drivers exceeded expectations in some places. There were headwinds in others. We laid them out very clearly.
You saw -- as we talked about services, so I don't need to cover that one again. In Markets, we talked about optimizing RWA, driving the business for stronger capital productivity, also driving more of the Alpha trade solution business, you see that. Personal Banking returning to IEB and revenue growth on customer acquisition, purchase sales being important metrics.
Investment Banking, it's progress on key hires and -- that we've been making. That's obviously been a tough market to do so, but I mean, pleased with the talent that we've brought in and delighted with the talent that we have. Wealth was more challenged with lockdowns in Asia understandably, slowing some progress on client acquisitions and some of the key strategy drivers there. But synergies, more disciplined, tighter processes reinforced by additional metrics on the scorecard, you'll be hearing us talking more and more about the delivery of those synergies.
So it's not really any difference from exactly what we laid out on Investor Day, right? We've laid out a strategy we have a lot of conviction around. We've laid out the different metrics to hold us accountable to, and it should provide you a sense of progress along the way. And we've also talked about what we're doing to get this cultural change of accountability, of urgency, of intensity and excellence. And we'll give you as many different indicators of where that's working well and where it's not as we go along."

Well, we are certainly still living through interesting times. And overall, I am pleased with how our bank is navigating through them. As you'll hear from me shortly, we continue to focus intense",1333,"Thank you, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, we are certainly still living through interesting times. And overall, I am pleased with how our bank is navigating through them. As you'll hear from me shortly, we continue to focus intensely on executing our strategy and our transformation as we outlined at Investor Day, whilst supporting our clients in this complex environment. 
So before I get into the quarter, let me highlight some observations about what we see going on around the world, given our unique vantage point. The global macro outlook that we shared with you over the last couple of quarters has been borne out. There is accumulating evidence of slowing global growth, and we now expect to experience rolling country level recession starting this quarter. 
The severity and timing of these recessions depend where in the world you are. Although persistently high inflation is driving a global softening of consumer demand for goods. In the Eurozone in the U.K., the supply shocks are most severe. Growth prospects have deteriorated sharply, and headline inflation is running at nearly 10%. All eyes are on this winter's weather forecast and the energy supply. 
The U.S. economy, however, remains relatively resilient. So while we are seeing signs of economic slowing, consumers and corporates remain healthy as our very low net credit losses demonstrate. Supply chain constraints easing, the labor market remains strong. So it is all a question of what it takes to truly take persistently high core inflation. 
Now history would suggest that, that will be quite a lot and for some time. Therefore, we could well see a mild recession in the second half of '23. We believe the U.S. economy is well positioned to expand it all else being equal in the geopolitical arena, that is. Finally, in Asia, we continue to be concerned with China's COVID lockdowns, which took a bigger bite out of economic activity than I anticipated, exacerbated by a lack of intensified macro stimulus. 
It is geopolitical risks and rates that dominate discussions with our corporate clients worldwide. And I'd say we're more focused on market liquidity generally and counter party risk than our credit risk in the near term. Nonetheless, we are planning conservatively, and we are prepared for all environments. Against this backdrop, today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion. EPS $1.63 and an ROTCE of 8.2%. 
We grew revenues by 6%, including a gain on sale of our consumer business in the Philippines. While we had excellent performance in some areas, our results could have been better in a few others. Services delivered another very strong quarter. [indiscernible] saw revenues up 40% year-over-year with growth in each business and in fees. 
Key drivers of our strategy such as wallet share, trade loan originations and cross-border transactions are all trending strongly in the right direction and are ahead of our plan. Security Services was up 15% and despite assets under custody being impacted by the declines in equity markets. We have onboarded over $1 trillion in AUC and AUA since the beginning of the year and we're seeing good momentum in issuer services, in particular. 
Markets, on the other hand, came in lower with revenues down 7%. In fixed income, we matched last year's particularly good showing through our long-standing strength in FX, offsetting a weaker quarter in spread products. In equities, reduced activity in derivatives, which is a core part of our platform, led to lower revenues compared to last year's exceptional performance. And we continued to optimize RWA in market consistent with our strategy. 
Banking, with the business most adversely impacted by the macro environment across the industry with geopolitics and fears of recession significantly reducing deal flows and the appetite for M&A. We continue to invest in building out our teams for long-term growth opportunities, including health care, technology and energy. 
And I'm really pleased with the high caliber bankers who are attracted to both our platform and our culture. The environment for wealth management continued to be less than ideal our revenues were down only slightly and meaningfully up outside of Asia. Our strategy to capture the synergies with our businesses, such as the wealth referral initiatives between commercial banking, retail banking and investment banking is progressing well. 
We also continue to steadily attract new clients and increase the ranks of our client advisers, as you will see in our KPIs. Nonetheless, we are slowing the pace of some of the investments in this business given the environment. U.S. Personal Banking further solidified its growth trajectory, card sales, ANR, interest-earning balances and customer acquisition all saw good growth and we continued to increase digital uptake. 
Retail Services joined branded cards and having double-digit revenue growth this quarter. Retail banking also grew contributing to a 10% overall revenue increase for the business. As you can see in the presentation, our cost of credit reflects the quality of our loan portfolio in both ICG and [ PBWM. ] There were effectively no credit losses in ICG, and U.S. consumer NCLs remain well below the pre-COVID levels. 
Consumer loan growth together with the worsening of our macroeconomic assumptions drove a modest ACL build this quarter. While our expenses are elevated as we continue to invest in our businesses, and in our transformation, we are managing them closely, and we remain on track to meet the full year guidance. 
As you know, the transformation is a multiyear effort, and we're committed to meeting the expectations of our regulators given the paramount importance of safety and soundness. We continue to be in constructive dialogues with them and are updating our execution plans as appropriate. Stepping back, I'm generally pleased with the advances we're making in the key drivers of the strategy we laid out for you in March and these are laid out on Page 3. 
We're seeing good momentum in realizing client synergies and in attracting talent to grow the franchise. In terms of simplification, we continue to make progress on the divestitures of our international consumer businesses and the elimination of their associated stranded costs. We closed the sale of the Philippines during the third quarter and are on track to close Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand during the fourth quarter. 
We also announced the wind down of our consumer franchise in the U.K. to focus fully on the wealth franchise there. I would also note, we're ahead of our plan in our Korean consumer wind down. We continued to shrink our operations in and exposure to Russia. To be clear, our intention is to wind down our presence in that country. 
In August, we announced the wind down of our consumer and local commercial banking businesses. While we have been supporting our multinational clients in Russia, we are now informing them that we will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer by the end of the first quarter of next year. At that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations. 
Turning to capital. We returned $1 billion to our shareholders through common dividends during the quarter. while buybacks continue to be on hold. We will keep evaluating that decision on a quarterly basis as due to increasing regulatory requirements, we build our CET1 ratio to 13% or so by mid next year, and that includes a management buffer of 100 basis points. 
We ended the quarter at a CET1 ratio of 12.2% as we actively managed our RWA usage throughout our lines of business. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $80.34. So the bottom line is that while the environment is a challenging one, and we expect it will remain so we continue to focus relentlessly on executing the strategy we presented to you at our Investor Day and on making steady progress. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark and then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions."

I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses, credit and capital.",2625,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses, credit and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment and end with full year 2022 guidance. 
On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of $3.5 billion and EPS of $1.63, with an ROTCE of 8.2% on $18.5 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $520 million, largely driven by a gain on the sale of the Philippines consumer business. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, EPS and ROTCE would have been $1.50 and 7.5%, respectively. 
In the quarter, total revenues increased 6% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were down 1% as growth in net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 18%, driven by the impact of higher interest rates across the firm and strong loan growth in PBWM. 
Noninterest revenues were down 12% on a reported basis and 28% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely reflecting declines in investment banking, markets, and investment revenues in well. Total expenses of $12.7 billion increased 8% and 7%, excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely driven by transformation inflation and other risk and control initiatives. 
Cost of credit was $1.4 billion, driven by net credit losses of approximately $900 million and an ACL build of approximately $500 million primarily driven by loan growth in PBWM. At the end of the quarter, we had $18.7 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.5%. On Slide 5, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. 
In the third quarter, total net interest income increased by approximately $600 million on a sequential basis and approximately $1.9 billion on a year-over-year basis across the firm, driven by higher interest rates, management of deposit repricing and loan growth in PBWM. Average loans were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower balances in legacy franchises. 
Excluding FX, loans were largely flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by the issuance of institutional CDs as we continue to diversify the funding profile of the bank. Excluding FX, deposits were up roughly 1%. 
And sequentially, our net interest margin increased by 7 basis points. On Slide 6, we show an expense walk for the third quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8% and 7%, excluding the impact of divestitures. 2% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to the risk controls, data and finance programs and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. 
As of today, we have over 10,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth, and we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 1% was due to higher volume-related expenses across both PBWM and ICG and approximately 3% was driven by other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, including systems and hiring people, resulting in our technology-related spend of approximately 16% for the quarter. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Over the last several years, we have been disciplined with our loan growth and consistent with our risk appetite framework. 
This framework includes credit risk limits that consider concentrations, including country, industry, credit rating and in the case of consumer FICO scores. And importantly, these limits apply across the firm in aggregate and we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of stress scenarios. 
As a result, we feel very good about our asset quality and reserve levels. As I mentioned earlier, our reserves to funded loan ratio was approximately 2.5%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. cards is 3.7% and 7.5%, respectively, both right around day 1 CECL levels. In PBWM, the majority of our card portfolios skew towards higher FICO customers. And while we have started to see signs of normalization in both portfolios, NCL rates continue to be less than half of pre-COVID levels. 
In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade and nonaccrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 40 basis points of total loans. So we are well reserved for a variety of scenarios, and we continuously evaluate our scenarios to reflect the evolving macro environment. 
On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet of our $2.4 trillion of assets about 23% or $557 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $967 billion. 
The combination of earnings generation, capital from exits and RWA optimization drove our CET1 ratio up by about 25 basis points to approximately 12.2% on a standardized basis, which remains our binding constraint. And our tangible book value per share was $80.34, up 2% from a year ago. On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our target over the next few quarters. 
First, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 8 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 5 basis point reduction. Fourth, changes in the DTA drove a 3 basis point reduction. And finally, the remaining 14 basis point increase was largely driven by net RWA optimization. 
In light of our increasing regulatory capital requirement, we ended the quarter with a 12.2% CET1 ratio 25 basis points higher than last quarter. Importantly, 12.2% is above our current regulatory requirement of 11.5% as of October 1 and above 12%, which will be our regulatory requirement as of January 1 of next year. As we said last quarter, we continue to gradually build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which includes the current 4% SCB and a 100 basis point management buffer. 
On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group, revenues were down 5% as strong growth in services was more than offset by lower revenues across markets and banking. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity and foreign exchange translation. 
Foster Credit was driven by a reserve build of $86 million. While deterioration in certain macro variables did lead to a build, it was mostly offset by the release of a COVID-19 related uncertainty reserve and a release related to direct exposures in Russia. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 30%. 
Average loans were up 1%, driven by 9% growth in TTS loans, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Average deposits were down 2%, also largely driven by foreign exchange translation. And ICG delivered an ROTCE of 9%. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. 
In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 40% and driven by 61% growth in net interest income as well as 8% growth in NIR across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS and that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 10%; commercial card volumes up roughly 50% and average loans up 9%. 
So while the rate environment drove about 40% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the remaining 60%. This includes continuing to manage deposit repricing and deepening with existing clients and significant new client wins across all client segments. Through the first half of the year, based on the industry data that we see, we estimate that we gained over 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients and client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments, including wins with financial institutions which are up almost 50%. 
These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. In addition, which allows clients to connect their liquidity and funding to their operating flows days a week. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 73%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partly offset by a 6% decrease in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution in Security Services as we onboarded approximately $1 trillion of assets under custody and administration so far this year from significant client wins, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. And we estimate that we have gained about 60 basis points of share in security services through the first half of this year, including in our home market. 
As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and our 2 of our higher returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 7%, largely driven by spread products, equities and RWA actions as we continue to focus on returns. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 1% and as strength in rates and FX was largely offset by continued headwinds in spread products. 
And through the first half of the year, we gained approximately 40 basis points of share. Equity markets revenues were down 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter last year. The actions we took to optimize RWA in markets are in line with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day, and we are making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets so far this year. 
And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 49%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continue to impact client activity. Also embedded in the results is an impact of approximately $110 million related to [ marks ] on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. 
So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress we are making as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients. Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. 
Revenues were up 6% as net interest income grow was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue driven by lower investment fee revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 13%, driven by transformation, other risk and control initiatives business-led investments and volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. 
Cost of credit was $1.1 billion which included a reserve build primarily driven by card volume growth. NCLs were 13% higher year-over-year from near historically low levels, reflecting normalization, particularly in retail services. Overall, we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 5%, driven by strong growth across branded cards, retail services and retail banking. 
Average deposits grew 1%, driven by growth across retail and wealth, partially offset by foreign exchange translation. PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 9.7%. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 10%, driven by higher net interest income. 
We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 10%, card spend volumes up 14% and average loans up 12%. Retail services revenues were up 12%, also driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we've been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 9% in branded cards and 7% in retail services, and we expect to continue to grow these balances in the fourth quarter. 
Retail banking revenues were up 2%, primarily driven by interest rates and deposit growth. Wealth revenues were down 2% as investment fee headwinds and particularly in Asia, more than offset net interest income growth. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. Client advisers were up 5%, and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our wealth business with new clients in ultra-high net worth and wealth work of 7% and 27%, respectively, for the quarter. 
And we're also leveraging our retail network, which has driven almost 50,000 wealth referrals so far this year. While the environment continues to remain challenging, we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. On Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues increased 66%, primarily driven by the Philippines gain on sale in the quarter and the absence of the Australia loss on sale in the prior year period. 
Excluding these items, revenues were down about 12% and largely due to the loss of revenues from the Australia and Philippines closing as well as the impact of the Korea wind down. Expenses increased 6%, driven by divestiture impacts in Asia and Mexico. Loans and deposits decreased as a result of the reclassification of signed exits to other assets and other liabilities, the closing of the Philippine sale and the impact of the Korea wind down. 
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, partially offset by the mark-to-market on certain derivative transactions and expenses were down. On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2022 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range. 
Excluding divestiture-related impacts. And within that, we continue to see a shift with higher net interest income, offset by lower noninterest revenue. So for the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income, excluding markets to be up in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion year-over-year. Clearly, where we land within that range will be a function of a number of factors, including rates, loans and deposit volumes, deposit betas and currency impacts. 
Regarding full year expenses, we continue to expect expenses to grow by 7% to 8%, excluding divestiture-related impacts. In terms of cost of credit, it will be a function of the evolution of the macro environment, normalization that we continue to expect in the cards businesses and loan growth. 
And keep in mind that loan growth tends to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third given typical holiday spending. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few key points. We continue to execute on the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. We are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses. 
And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we are confident we can achieve our medium-term targets in a variety of scenarios. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

So as you know, Glenn, when we think about our business just in aggregate, there's obviously a split between the institutional and the consumer side. Our TTS business, which is on the institutional side, and these corporate clients, they tend to have higher betas in general than obviously, the retail banking side. 
What we've seen is that the betas have been increasing. They are still running lower than what we had expected. But again, they have been increasing. And with continued expected rate increases, I would expect that those betas will continue to rise in the coming quarters. We have been actively managing deposit pricing and repricing with our clients on an ongoing basis. 
You know that this is more than just a deposit-taking business. This is a business where we are looking to manage the operating accounts of our clients and bring the breadth of what we offer in our franchise to them. And so those -- that's the type of conversation we've been having with them, and we'll continue to do that with an eye towards growing the volume of deposits with both the existing as well as with new clients. 
And so we, again, expect to see betas rise but also expect to see continued contribution to the NII. The other aspect of your question is what else has been driving the activity I mentioned a couple of those things. So it's not just deepening with existing clients, but it's also onboarding new clients. 
We've seen cross-border transaction value up about 10%. The commercial card spend is up meaningfully trade originations are up 27%. And so a lot of active engagement with our clients. We've been winning new mandates. We've seen an uptick in client wins of about 20% and we've been gaining share across those client segments. 
And so hopefully, that gives you a little bit of example of examples of where the benefits or momentum is coming from on the NIR side. The NIR growth of 8% is driven really by the cards, the payments and receivables as well as trade."

And that includes a host of different structures.

I guess I'm wondering, your confidence and you said you're confident you could hit medium-term targets even with this creep in capital. Is it really that shift in the rate environment that's helping you get there despite the higher denominator?"

Look, I think there are a couple of things to kind of think back on that still hold true, which is the strategy that we've built, I think, is a resilient strategy and it really spoke to top line momentum that we expected not just through rate increases, but also through share gains and also through the business-led investments that we that we're making and better leveraging the synergies and linkages across the franchise. 
All of those things still hold true to the top line. You're right, the Fed funds assumption has changed. Back in March, I think we all were looking at a Fed funds rate at the end of the year that was closer to 1.5% or so. And so now here we are with the hikes that we've seen and looking at something certainly north of 4%, 4.5%. And so that's changed meaningfully. 
But there are a number of other drivers that contribute to achieving that return, including -- it's the medium term, so call it 3 to 5 years, I think, is how we characterized it and starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation investments that we're making. To your point on capital, we are building to the 13%. 
Remember, that is a byproduct of a 4% SCB for this particular CCAR cycle and the strategy that we described includes a mix in our shift of revenues and earnings over time, a mix towards more stable PPNR and more fee revenues that will contribute to, I think, a balance sheet and a mix that is -- that generates fewer losses -- stress losses than our balance sheet might today. 
So the contribution of those things, we think, will drive that return target that we've set, and we still remain confident about that. Now with that said, there are unknowns that are out there. I just spoke to many of the Nobles. And so what happens with further capital requirements and the current regulatory regime and what have you, it's hard to predict. But we'll manage to that as we learn and know more about it."

Number one, especially if you think you could stabilize your PPNR in the stress test, why 100 basis point management buffer versus one of your peers at 50 that reported today, and secondarily, as we think about impact the timing, as I recall, there's a currency translation adjustment that could be negative upfront at announcement to CET1, but you get that all back during close.

But it started at the beginning, which is I know where we trade in terms of book value. And I'd love to be in a position where we were buying back given that valuation. 
With that said, we're going to take it quarter by quarter, as I think you've heard us say and evaluate what buyback decisions and capital actions make the most sense in light of the environment that we're managing through, we're clearly managing through an uncertain environment. We do -- as I just said and as you kind of mentioned as well, we do see our business mix shifting over time on the heels of our strategy. 
I do think that over time, that will contribute, as I said, to the capital requirements that we have, but that's over the medium term. And we do still see a fair amount of volatility in the stress capital buffer. And part of the reason that we have the management buffer is to deal not only with that uncertainty in the SCB, but also in interest rates. 
And we're seeing volatility in both, frankly. And so we'll continue to evaluate the management buffer as well to see what makes sense as we move towards that medium term. In terms of the Mexico transaction, you're right in terms of we have mentioned before, the CTA component to that. That is a timing difference. We have factored that in to the path to our 13% by middle of next year and factor that into achieving the longer-term targets that we set for ourselves."

I have to tell you, I'm hard pressed to find a negative to the global network. We start off with the vision for the bank that we laid out in March. It is to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross-border needs. Who are those clients? 
It is 5,000 multinationals on the subsidiaries, it's institutional investors and the ultra high net worth clients with a heavy tilt to family offices. And we serve them on FX, on liquidity management on their payroll, on their supply chain as well as strategic advice financing, et cetera. 
That's $4 trillion in daily volume. 80% of that credit portfolio is investment grade. So when we're looking at it, it's the multinational to take a higher risk country. It's the client base we're serving there of the global multinationals much more than the local players. And so this is not a -- this is a relatively simple high returning, very well growing as we're seeing at the moment, capability that is exceedingly hard to replicate. 
So let me pass over to Mark in terms of what are some of the examples of different areas of the drivers of growth? This is, as I said at the beginning, this is a crown jewel. It's not a source of complexity for the bank."

One, what I said was that we continue to gain share, and I referenced specifically about 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients. And we obviously or not obviously, we're also winning mandates and gaining share with other client segments as well. 
You know that the Commercial Banking client segment is one that we are focused on, given the strength of our platform and its applicability to those sized clients as well. I mentioned that our wins are up and specifically, they're up 20%, the mandates that we're winning across all client segments. 
And that specifically with FIs, they're up almost 50%. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of where the revenue growth is coming from. The takeaway there is it's both existing as well as new clients as we kind of continue to build out the platform and build out our capabilities to reach them. So the second part of your question was around expenses and expenses growing and when will we have top line growth that exceeds the expense growth.
And I'd remind you that the work we're doing on the transformation as well as the business-led investments are multiyear almost by definition and important in order to derive savings in our structural cost base over time. And at Investor Day, I think I pointed to by the time we got to that medium-term period, we would see our operating efficiency go down to less than 60%. 
I think we've been very deliberate about trying to give you guidance and update you on guidance for the full year and along the way and we'll be consistent in that discipline. And I can certainly give you more color on '23, as I mentioned earlier to John, the next -- in the next quarter."

So it's a service agreement and that expense will come off over time. And then there's another 25%, which is likely not to come off. Is that fair? Or is there a different message that I'm missing on that?"

So one is when we do these transactions, both Jane and I have deep experience in this. We tend to see about half of the costs go away to the buyer. So when we do the transaction, when we do the sale. 
As you pointed out, about 25% is often in place as part of a transition service agreement. And so there's revenues that we get paid to offset that expense until things have totally transitioned and then that goes away. And then the third bucket is what I call potentially stranded cost and what Jane calls not stranded call, right? 
And that is -- I say potentially because their regional expenses that get allocated to countries, for example, they're global expenses that get allocated to the region and to the countries, for example, and what we have to do and what we're doing is we're attacking what would otherwise be stranded cost. 
And we're attacking that by telling each of the functions in the business. And here's your portion of that 25% and come back and tell me how you're going to rethink your org structure, simplify your processes in order to drive that cost out of the company. Right? And so that's what we've been doing. Remember, the expense base here is probably $7 billion. So you can break down kind of the population that we're talking about. 
We've already stood up a team work with each of the businesses and each of the functions around getting in front of that cost so that we can drive that down over the near-term period of time."

So there is more to come on that, and we'll be looking to do that as I indicated at Investor Day that will be an important part once more of the divestitures are closed, starting in '23, going into '24."

So a couple of things, and you started to allude to it. The first is that when you think about our business, you've got about between ICG and our PBWM business of 65%, 35% split in terms of the deposits",342,"It's a great question. And so why don't I take that? So a couple of things, and you started to allude to it. The first is that when you think about our business, you've got about between ICG and our PBWM business of 65%, 35% split in terms of the deposits. You also have a U.S. dollar-denominated versus non-U.S. dollar-denominated split that is pretty meaningful as well. And then to your point, we've got different currencies and different rate hikes by different central banks around the world. And that then is juxtaposed against different beta behavior from customers. And so on the whole -- on the ICG side, we tend to see higher betas. And obviously, with rates increasing at a more rapid pace -- we expect those to get closer to our expectations in the near term. 
We're starting to see many more hikes around the globe outside of the U.S. And so again, we expect to see betas which move at a -- or operate at a much lower pace level outside of the U.S. but start to tick up. And so over time, I think we will see continued tailwinds from an NII as the differences between U.S. and non-U.S. activity play out. 
And so that should play to our -- has played to our benefit, I think, and should continue to play to our benefit. If you think about what I've talked about before in terms of our IRE, our interest rate exposure and the cash flow approach that we are moving towards taking, in some ways, it captures exactly that point. And so this is -- if you see a 100 basis point move in the curve cross currencies, we're looking at as much as a $2.2 billion increase. 
And when you look at that increase, it skews more heavily towards the non-U.S. dollar than the U.S. dollar. And that is in part because of the different moves in rate curves by currency as well as the different betas by client type in U.S. versus non-U.S."

What are we seeing going on? I think a lot of the focus is in Europe. Right now, which is sort of at the center of the storm. We're seeing some areas where there could be energy supply constraints are impacting some clients. So we're watching industrial production moved to the U.S., for example, which are the places where the cost of production is lower, a potential buffer for some of the slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and the like because the demand for goods softened, for example. 
We're seeing areas where clients on the collateral on where there's a situation of intense volatility that hits a surprise drop as we saw in [ Gilt ] is having an impact on liquidity and therefore, margining, which is what happens that has been happening with the U.K. pension funds with the derivatives. 
So a lot of the areas we look at is what's the collateral behind different institutions as we have done with the commodity players earlier on in the year, we've been looking at some of the LDIs at the moment. And as we see different stresses, we're jumping on it. 
I think the central banks are also ready to jump in as needed and certainly attuned to the importance of agility in these situations as well. As our large global institutions like ourselves as to how do we help support the market the benefit for our bank is because we're in a strong position on all of our capital on liquidity, on balance sheet and the credit portfolio, as you can see, is extraordinary at the moment, 0 losses in ICG this quarter, again, we're in a position to be able to jump in and play an important role.

Well, we are certainly still living through interesting times. And overall, I am pleased with how our bank is navigating through them. As you'll hear from me shortly, we continue to focus intense",1330,"Thank you, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, we are certainly still living through interesting times. And overall, I am pleased with how our bank is navigating through them. As you'll hear from me shortly, we continue to focus intensely on executing our strategy and our transformation as we outlined at Investor Day, whilst supporting our clients in this complex environment. 
So before I get into the quarter, let me highlight some observations about what we see going on around the world, given our unique vantage point. The global macro outlook that we shared with you over the last couple of quarters has been borne out. There is accumulating evidence of slowing global growth, and we now expect to experience rolling country level recession starting this quarter. 
The severity and timing of these recessions depend where in the world you are. Although persistently high inflation is driving a global softening of consumer demand for goods. In the Eurozone in the U.K., the supply shocks are most severe. Growth prospects have deteriorated sharply, and headline inflation is running at nearly 10%. All eyes are on this winter's weather forecast and the energy supply. 
The U.S. economy, however, remains relatively resilient. So while we are seeing signs of economic slowing, consumers and corporates remain healthy as our very low net credit losses demonstrate, supply chain constraints are easing, the labor market remains strong. So it is all a question of what it takes to truly tame persistently high core inflation. Now history would suggest that, that will be quite a lot and for some time. Therefore, we could well see a mild recession in the second half of '23. We believe the U.S. economy is well positioned to expand it all else being equal in the geopolitical arena, that is. 
Finally, in Asia, we continue to be concerned with China's COVID lockdowns, which took a bigger bite out of economic activity than anticipated, exacerbated by a lack of intensified macro stimulus. It is geopolitical risks and rates that dominate discussions with our corporate clients worldwide. And I'd say we're more focused on market liquidity generally and counterparty risk than our credit risk in the near term. Nonetheless, we are planning conservatively, and we are prepared for all environments. 
Against this backdrop, today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 8.2%. We grew revenues by 6%, including a gain on sale of our consumer business in the Philippines. While we had excellent performance in some areas, our results could have been better in a few others. Services delivered another very strong quarter. TTS saw revenues up 40% year-over-year with growth in each business and in fees. Key drivers of our strategy such as wallet share, trade loan originations and cross-border transactions are all trending strongly in the right direction and are ahead of our plan. 
Security Services was up 15% despite assets under custody being impacted by the declines in equity markets. We have onboarded over $1 trillion in AUC and AUA since the beginning of the year and we're seeing good momentum in issuer services, in particular. Markets, on the other hand, came in lower with revenues down 7%. In fixed income, we matched last year's particularly good showing through our long-standing strength in FX, offsetting a weaker quarter in spread products. In equities, reduced activity in derivatives, which is a core part of our platform, led to lower revenues compared to last year's exceptional performance. And we continued to optimize RWA in market consistent with our strategy. 
Banking was the business most adversely impacted by the macro environment across the industry with geopolitics and fears of recession significantly reducing deal flows and the appetite for M&A. We continue to invest in building out our teams for long-term growth opportunities, including health care, technology and energy. And I'm really pleased with the high caliber bankers who are attracted to both our platform and our culture. 
The environment for wealth management continued to be less than ideal. Our revenues were down only slightly and meaningfully up outside of Asia. Our strategy to capture the synergies with our businesses, such as the wealth referral initiatives between commercial banking, retail banking and investment banking is progressing well. We also continue to steadily attract new clients and increase the ranks of our client advisers, as you will see in our KPIs. Nonetheless, we are slowing the pace of some of the investments in this business given the environment. U.S. Personal Banking further solidified its growth trajectory. Card sales, ANR, interest-earning balances and customer acquisition all saw good growth and we continued to increase digital uptake. 
Retail Services joined Branded cards in having double-digit revenue growth this quarter. Retail Banking also grew contributing to a 10% overall revenue increase for the business. As you can see in the presentation, our cost of credit reflects the quality of our loan portfolio in both ICG and PBWM. There were effectively no credit losses in ICG, and U.S. consumer NCLs remain well below the pre-COVID levels. 
Consumer loan growth together with the worsening of our macroeconomic assumptions drove a modest ACL build this quarter. While our expenses are elevated as we continue to invest in our businesses, and in our transformation, we are managing them closely, and we remain on track to meet the full year guidance. 
As you know, the transformation is a multiyear effort, and we're committed to meeting the expectations of our regulators given the paramount importance of safety and soundness. We continue to be in constructive dialogues with them and are updating our execution plans as appropriate. Stepping back, I'm generally pleased with the advances we're making in the key drivers of the strategy we laid out for you in March, and these are laid out on Page 3. 
We're seeing good momentum in realizing client synergies and in attracting talent to grow the franchise. In terms of simplification, we continue to make progress on the divestitures of our international consumer businesses and the elimination of their associated stranded costs. We closed the sale of the Philippines during the third quarter and are on track to close Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand during the fourth quarter. 
We also announced the wind down of our consumer franchise in the U.K. to focus fully on the wealth franchise there. I would also note, we're ahead of our plan in our Korean consumer wind down. We continued to shrink our operations in and exposure to Russia. To be clear, our intention is to wind down our presence in that country. 
In August, we announced the wind down of our consumer and local commercial banking businesses. While we have been supporting our multinational clients in Russia, we are now informing them that we will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer by the end of the first quarter of next year. At that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations. 
Turning to capital. We returned $1 billion to our shareholders through common dividends during the quarter, while buybacks continue to be on hold. We will keep evaluating that decision on a quarterly basis as due to increasing regulatory requirements, we build our CET1 ratio to 13% or so by mid next year, and that includes a management buffer of 100 basis points. 
We ended the quarter at a CET1 ratio of 12.2% as we actively managed our RWA usage throughout our lines of business. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $80.34. So the bottom line is that while the environment is a challenging one, and we expect it will remain so, we continue to focus relentlessly on executing the strategy we presented to you at our Investor Day and on making steady progress. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. And then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions."

I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses, credit and capital.",2647,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses, credit and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment and end with full year 2022 guidance. 
On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of $3.5 billion and EPS of $1.63, with an RoTCE of 8.2% on $18.5 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $520 million, largely driven by a gain on the sale of the Philippines consumer business. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, EPS and RoTCE would have been $1.50 and 7.5%, respectively. 
In the quarter, total revenues increased 6% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were down 1% as growth in net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 18%, driven by the impact of higher interest rates across the firm and strong loan growth in PBWM. 
Noninterest revenues were down 12% on a reported basis and 28% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely reflecting declines in investment banking, markets, and investment revenues in wealth. Total expenses of $12.7 billion increased 8% and 7%, excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely driven by transformation, inflation and other risk and control initiatives. 
Cost of credit was $1.4 billion, driven by net credit losses of approximately $900 million and an ACL build of approximately $500 million primarily driven by loan growth in PBWM. At the end of the quarter, we had $18.7 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.5%. 
On Slide 5, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the third quarter, total net interest income increased by approximately $600 million on a sequential basis and approximately $1.9 billion on a year-over-year basis across the firm, driven by higher interest rates, management of deposit repricing and loan growth in PBWM. Average loans were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower balances in legacy franchises. 
Excluding FX, loans were largely flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by the issuance of institutional CDs as we continue to diversify the funding profile of the bank. Excluding FX, deposits were up roughly 1%. And sequentially, our net interest margin increased by 7 basis points. 
On Slide 6, we show an expense walk for the third quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8% and 7%, excluding the impact of divestitures. 2% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to the risk, controls, data and finance programs and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. 
As of today, we have over 10,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth, and we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 1% was due to higher volume-related expenses across both PBWM and ICG, and approximately 3% was driven by other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, including systems and hiring people, resulting in our technology-related spend of approximately 16% for the quarter. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Over the last several years, we have been disciplined with our loan growth and consistent with our risk appetite framework. 
This framework includes credit risk limits that consider concentrations, including country, industry, credit rating and in the case of consumer, FICO scores. And importantly, these limits apply across the firm in aggregate and we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of stress scenarios. As a result, we feel very good about our asset quality and reserve levels. 
As I mentioned earlier, our reserves to funded loan ratio was approximately 2.5%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. Cards is 3.7% and 7.5%, respectively, both right around day 1 CECL levels. In PBWM, the majority of our card portfolios skew towards higher FICO customers. And while we have started to see signs of normalization in both portfolios, NCL rates continue to be less than half of pre-COVID levels. 
In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade and nonaccrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 40 basis points of total loans. So we are well reserved for a variety of scenarios, and we continuously evaluate our scenarios to reflect the evolving macro environment. 
On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets about 23% or $557 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $967 billion. The combination of earnings generation, capital from exits and RWA optimization drove our CET1 ratio up by about 25 basis points to approximately 12.2% on a standardized basis, which remains our binding constraint. And our tangible book value per share was $80.34, up 2% from a year ago. 
On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our target over the next few quarters. First, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 8 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 5 basis point reduction. Fourth, changes in the DTA drove a 3 basis point reduction. And finally, the remaining 14 basis point increase was largely driven by net RWA optimization. 
In light of our increasing regulatory capital requirement, we ended the quarter with a 12.2% CET1 ratio, 25 basis points higher than last quarter. Importantly, 12.2% is above our current regulatory requirement of 11.5% as of October 1 and above 12%, which will be our regulatory requirement as of January 1 of next year. As we said last quarter, we continue to gradually build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which includes the current 4% SCB and a 100 basis point management buffer. 
On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group, revenues were down 5% as strong growth in services was more than offset by lower revenues across markets and banking. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity and foreign exchange translation. Cost of credit was driven by a reserve build of $86 million. 
While deterioration in certain macro variables did lead to a build, it was mostly offset by the release of a COVID-19 related uncertainty reserve and a release related to direct exposures in Russia. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 30%. Average loans were up 1%, driven by 9% growth in TTS loans, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Average deposits were down 2%, also largely driven by foreign exchange translation. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 9%. 
On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. 
In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 40%, driven by 61% growth in net interest income as well as 8% growth in NIR across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 10%, commercial card volumes up roughly 50% and average loans up 9%. 
So while the rate environment drove about 40% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the remaining 60%. This includes continuing to manage deposit repricing and deepening with existing clients and significant new client wins across all client segments. Through the first half of the year, based on the industry data that we see, we estimate that we gained over 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients. And client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments, including wins with financial institutions which are up almost 50%. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. 
In addition, so far this year, we have onboarded approximately 5,800 suppliers, and we recently launched our innovative suite product in the in the U.S. and Asia which allows clients to connect their liquidity and funding to their operating flows 7 days a week. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 73%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partly offset by a 6% decrease in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we onboarded approximately $1 trillion of assets under custody and administration so far this year from significant client wins, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. And we estimate that we have gained about 60 basis points of share in Securities Services through the first half of this year, including in our home market. 
As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 7%, largely driven by spread products, equities and RWA actions as we continue to focus on returns. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 1% as strength in rates and FX was largely offset by continued headwinds in spread products. 
And through the first half of the year, we gained approximately 40 basis points of share. Equity markets revenues were down 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter last year. The actions we took to optimize RWA in markets are in line with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day, and we are making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets so far this year. 
And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 49%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continue to impact client activity. Also embedded in the results is an impact of approximately $110 million related to marks on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress we are making as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income grow was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue driven by lower investment fee revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 13%, driven by transformation, other risk and control initiatives business-led investments and volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. 
Cost of credit was $1.1 billion which included a reserve build primarily driven by card volume growth. NCLs were 13% higher year-over-year from near historically low levels, reflecting normalization, particularly in retail services. Overall, we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 5%, driven by strong growth across branded cards, retail services and retail banking. 
Average deposits grew 1%, driven by growth across retail and wealth, partially offset by foreign exchange translation. PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 9.7%. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 10%, driven by higher net interest income. 
We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 10%, card spend volumes up 14% and average loans up 12%. Retail services revenues were up 12%, also driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we've been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 9% in branded cards and 7% in retail services, and we expect to continue to grow these balances in the fourth quarter. 
Retail banking revenues were up 2%, primarily driven by interest rates and deposit growth. Wealth revenues were down 2% as investment fee headwinds, particularly in Asia, more than offset net interest income growth. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. Client advisers were up 5%, and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our wealth business with new clients in ultra-high net worth and Wealth at Work of 7% and 27%, respectively, for the quarter. 
And we're also leveraging our retail network, which has driven almost 50,000 wealth referrals so far this year. While the environment continues to remain challenging, we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. 
On Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues increased 66%, primarily driven by the Philippines gain on sale in the quarter and the absence of the Australia loss on sale in the prior year period. Excluding these items, revenues were down about 12% and largely due to the loss of revenues from the Australia and Philippines closing as well as the impact of the Korea wind down. Expenses increased 6%, driven by divestiture impacts in Asia and Mexico. Loans and deposits decreased as a result of the reclassification of signed exits to other assets and other liabilities, the closing of the Philippine sale and the impact of the Korea wind down. 
On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, partially offset by the mark-to-market on certain derivative transactions and expenses were down. 
On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2022 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range, excluding divestiture-related impacts. And within that, we continue to see a shift with higher net interest income, offset by lower noninterest revenue. So for the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income, excluding markets to be up in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion year-over-year. Clearly, where we land within that range will be a function of a number of factors, including rates, loans and deposit volumes, deposit betas and currency impacts. 
Regarding full year expenses, we continue to expect expenses to grow by 7% to 8%, excluding divestiture-related impacts. In terms of cost of credit, it will be a function of the evolution of the macro environment, normalization that we continue to expect in the cards businesses and loan growth. And keep in mind that loan growth tends to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third given typical holiday spending. 
Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few key points. We continue to execute on the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. We are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we are confident we can achieve our medium-term targets in a variety of scenarios.

So as you know, Glenn, when we think about our business just in aggregate, there's obviously a split between the institutional and the consumer side. Our TTS business, which is on the institutional side, and these corporate clients, they tend to have higher betas in general than obviously, the retail banking side. What we've seen is that the betas have been increasing. They are still running lower than what we had expected. But again, they have been increasing. And with continued expected rate increases, I would expect that those betas will continue to rise in the coming quarters. We have been actively managing deposit pricing and repricing with our clients on an ongoing basis. 
You know that this is more than just a deposit-taking business. This is a business where we are looking to manage the operating accounts of our clients and bring the breadth of what we offer in our franchise to them. And so those -- that's the type of conversation we've been having with them, and we'll continue to do that with an eye towards growing the volume of deposits with both the existing as well as with new clients. 
And so we, again, expect to see betas rise but also expect to see continued contribution to the NII. The other aspect of your question is what else has been driving the activity. I mentioned a couple of those things. So it's not just deepening with existing clients, but it's also onboarding new clients. We've seen cross-border transaction value up about 10%. The commercial card spend is up meaningfully. Trade originations are up 27%. And so a lot of active engagement with our clients. We've been winning new mandates. We've seen an uptick in client wins, up about 20%, and we've been gaining share across those client segments. 
And so hopefully, that gives you a little bit of examples of where the benefits or momentum is coming from on the NIR side. The NIR growth of 8% is driven really by the cards, the payments and receivables as well as trade."

So I guess I'm wondering, your confidence and you said you're confident you could hit medium-term targets even with this creep in capital. Is it really that shift in the rate environment that's helping you get there despite the higher denominator?"

Look, I think there are a couple of things to kind of think back on that still hold true, which is the strategy that we've built, I think, is a resilient strategy and it really spoke to top line momentum that we expected not",358,"So thank you for the question. Look, I think there are a couple of things to kind of think back on that still hold true, which is the strategy that we've built, I think, is a resilient strategy and it really spoke to top line momentum that we expected not just through rate increases, but also through share gains and also through the business-led investments that we're making and better leveraging the synergies and linkages across the franchise. 
All of those things still hold true to the top line. You're right, the Fed funds assumption has changed. Back in March, I think we all were looking at a Fed funds rate at the end of the year that was closer to 1.5% or so. And so now here we are with the hikes that we've seen and looking at something certainly north of 4%, 4.5%. And so that's changed meaningfully. But there are a number of other drivers that contribute to achieving that return, including -- it's the medium term, so call it 3 to 5 years, I think, is how we characterized it and starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation investments that we're making. 
To your point on capital, we are building to the 13%. Remember, that is a by-product of a 4% SCB for this particular CCAR cycle and the strategy that we described includes a mix in our shift of revenues and earnings over time, a mix towards more stable PPNR and more fee revenues that will contribute to, I think, a balance sheet and a mix that is -- that generates fewer losses -- stress losses than our balance sheet might today. 
So the contribution of those things, we think, will drive that return target that we've set, and we still remain confident about that. Now with that said, there are unknowns that are out there. I just spoke to many of the [ nobles ]. And so what happens with further capital requirements and the current regulatory regime and what have you, it's hard to predict. But we'll manage to that as we learn and know more about it."

And my follow-up question is given Citi's valuation on book, I think your current and prospective shareholders are waiting for buybacks to potentially return. I guess a two-part question here. Number one, especially if you think you could stabilize your PPNR in the stress test, why 100 basis point management buffer versus one of your peers at 50 that reported today? 
And secondarily, as we think about the return of buybacks, I imagine that once you hit that 13%, the buybacks could return. But how does the mandated sale potentially impact the timing, as I recall, there's a currency translation adjustment that could be negative upfront at announcement to CET1, but you get that all back during close. So I guess the real big question here is how should we think about -- what are the mile markers for the return of buyback activity at Citi?"

But I'll start at the beginning, which is I know where we trade in terms of book value. And I'd love to be in a position where we were buying back given that valuation. 
With that said, we're going to take it quarter by quarter, as I think you've heard us say and evaluate what buyback decisions and capital actions make the most sense in light of the environment that we're managing through, we're clearly managing through an uncertain environment. We do -- as I just said and as you kind of mentioned as well, we do see our business mix shifting over time on the heels of our strategy. 
I do think that over time, that will contribute, as I said, to the capital requirements that we have, but that's over the medium term. And we do still see a fair amount of volatility in the stress capital buffer. And part of the reason that we have the management buffer is to deal not only with that uncertainty in the SCB, but also in interest rates. 
And we're seeing volatility in both, frankly. And so we'll continue to evaluate the management buffer as well to see what makes sense as we move towards that medium term. In terms of the Mexico transaction, you're right in terms of we have mentioned before, the CTA component to that. That is a timing difference. We have factored that in to the path to our 13% by middle of next year and factor that into achieving the longer-term targets that we set for ourselves."

I mean you talked about trade, you talked about other activities connecting multinational corporations in the spirit of volatility, so if you could a little more meat on the bone as far when you talk about market share and those -- there's tailwinds on the revenues while you have the headwinds on the expenses from the global network."

I have to tell you, I'm hard pressed to find a negative to the global network. We start off with the vision for the bank that we laid out in March. It is to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross-border needs. Who are those clients? It is 5,000 multinationals and their subsidiaries, it's institutional investors and the ultra-high net worth clients with a heavy tilt to family offices. And we serve them on FX, on liquidity management, on their payroll, on their supply chain as well as strategic advice, financing, et cetera. 
That's $4 trillion in daily volume, 80% of that credit portfolio is investment grade. So when we're looking at it, it's the multinational to take a higher risk country. It's the client base we're serving there are the global multinationals much more than the local players. And so this is not a -- this is a relatively simple, high returning, very well growing as we're seeing at the moment, capability that is exceedingly hard to replicate.

One, what I said was that we continue to gain share, and I referenced specifically about 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients. And we obviously -- or not obviously, we're also winning mandates and gaining share with other client segments as well. 
You know that the Commercial Banking client segment is one that we are focused on, given the strength of our platform and its applicability to those sized clients as well. I mentioned that our wins are up and specifically, they're up 20%, the mandates that we're winning across all client segments. And that specifically with FIs, they're up almost 50%. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of where the revenue growth is coming from. The takeaway there is it's both existing as well as new clients as we kind of continue to build out the platform and build out our capabilities to reach them. 
So the second part of your question was around expenses and expenses growing and when will we have top line growth that exceeds the expense growth. And I'd remind you that the work we're doing on the transformation as well as the business-led investments are multiyear almost by definition and important in order to derive savings in our structural cost base over time. And at Investor Day, I think I pointed to by the time we got to that medium-term period, we would see our operating efficiency go down to less than 60%. 
I think we've been very deliberate about trying to give you guidance and update you on guidance for the full year and along the way and we'll be consistent in that discipline. And I can certainly give you more color on '23, as I mentioned earlier to John, the next -- in the next quarter."

So one is when we do these transactions, both Jane and I have deep experience in this. We tend to see about half of the costs go away to the buyer, so when we do the transaction, when we do the sale. 
As you pointed out, about 25% is often in place as part of a transition service agreement. And so there's revenues that we get paid to offset that expense until things have totally transitioned and then that goes away. And then the third bucket is what I call potentially stranded cost and what Jane calls not stranded call, right? 
And that is -- I say potentially because their regional expenses that get allocated to countries, for example, they're global expenses that get allocated to the region and to the countries, for example, and what we have to do and what we're doing is we're attacking what would otherwise be stranded cost. 
And we're attacking that by telling each of the functions in the business, and here's your portion of that 25% and come back and tell me how you're going to rethink your org structure, simplify your processes in order to drive that cost out of the company, right? And so that's what we've been doing. Remember, the expense base here is probably $7 billion. So you can break down kind of the population that we're talking about. 
We've already stood up a team to work with each of the businesses and each of the functions around getting in front of that cost, so that we can drive that down over the near-term period of time."

So a couple of things, and you started to allude to it. The first is that when you think about our business, you've got about between ICG and our PBWM business of 65%, 35% split in terms of the deposits. You also have a U.S. dollar-denominated versus non-U.S. dollar-denominated split that is pretty meaningful as well. And then to your point, we've got different currencies and different rate hikes by different central banks around the world. And that then is juxtaposed against different beta behavior from customers. And so on the whole -- on the ICG side, we tend to see higher betas. And obviously, with rates increasing at a more rapid pace, we expect those to get closer to our expectations in the near term. 
We're starting to see many more hikes around the globe or outside of the U.S. And so again, we expect to see betas which move at a -- or operate at a much lower pace level outside of the U.S. but start to tick up. And so over time, I think we will see continued tailwinds from an NII as the differences between U.S. and non-U.S. activity play out. And so that should play to our -- has played to our benefit, I think, and should continue to play to our benefit. 
If you think about what I've talked about before in terms of our IRE, our interest rate exposure and the cash flow approach that we are moving towards taking, in some ways, it captures exactly that point. And so this is -- if you see a 100 basis point move in the curve cross currencies, we're looking at as much as a $2.2 billion increase. And when you look at that increase, it skews more heavily towards the non-U.S. dollar than the U.S. dollar. And that is in part because of the different moves in rate curves by currency as well as the different betas by client type in U.S. versus non-U.S."

And as I said at the -- just in the opening remarks, we're more focused on the liquidity in the market at the moment and the impact on some counterparties much more than we are on our credit risk -- that could change over time, depending particularly what happens from a tail risk on the geopolitics here. 
What are we seeing going on? I think a lot of the focus is in Europe. Right now, which is sort of at the center of the storm. We're seeing some areas where there could be energy supply constraints are impacting some clients. So we're watching industrial production moved to the U.S., for example, which are the places where the cost of production is lower, a potential buffer for some of the slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and the like because the demand for goods softened, for example. 
We're seeing areas where clients on the collateral front, where there's a situation of intense volatility that hits or a surprise drop as we saw in gilts is having an impact on liquidity and therefore, margining, which is what happens and has been happening with the U.K. pension funds with the derivatives. So a lot of the areas we look at is what's the collateral behind different institutions as we have done with the commodity players earlier on in the year, we've been looking at some of the LDIs at the moment. And as we see different stresses, we're jumping on it. 
I think the central banks are also ready to jump in as needed and certainly attuned to the importance of agility in these situations as well. As our large global institutions like ourselves as to how do we help support the market, the benefit for our bank is because we're in a strong position on all of our capital on liquidity, on balance sheet and the credit portfolio, as you can see, is extraordinary at the moment, 0 losses in ICG this quarter. Again, we're in a position to be able to jump in and play an important role. But it's a bit of whack-a-mole, I would say."
