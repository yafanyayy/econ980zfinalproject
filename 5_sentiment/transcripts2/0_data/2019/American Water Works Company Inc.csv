Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan will cover in detail the fourth quarter and full year financial results. And our COO Walter Lynch will give key updates on our operations. 2018 was a very eventful year for American Water, beginning with historic tax reform, the conclusion of several key rate cases and active acquisition here in both regulated and Market-Based Businesses, the sale and discontinuation of a few Market-Based Business line and a sharp focus on deploying smart technology and business fundamentals. Through it all, we further strengthened our lower risk and predictable growth story. We experienced continued growth in our Regulated Businesses from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Our Market-Based Businesses achieved very strong year-over-year growth, less Keystone impairment, and provided increased cash to our overall business. 
Our $3.30 adjusted EPS is an 8.9% increase over adjusted 2017 EPS. We are affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share, and we continue our focus on achieving the top half of over 7% to 10% EPS growth guidance through 2023. Our fundamental story at American Water remains the same, and our performance is consistent as we report another strong year of results for 2018. The capital investment we make in regulated operations continues to be the foundation for our growth. $1.5 billion of the total of $2 billion that we invested in 2018 was for regulated infrastructure improvement, with almost $400 million for acquisitions, including our acquisition of Pivotal. Let me mention a few of our 2018 highlights. First and most importantly, we continue to be a safer company in which our employees work. We finished 2018 with fewer employee injuries than in any other year recorded in our company's history, but we won't be satisfied until we have 0 injuries throughout our business. We continued our commitment to the highest levels of water quality, the environment and our customer safety by leveraging new and groundbreaking technologies. We have installed additional surface water monitoring panel at all of our major surface water intakes, and we are working on a comprehensive data analytics strategy that will enhance our ability to detect issues and respond accordingly. This will enhance the protections we provide to our customers. Phases 2 and 3 of these systems schedule for this year, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning. We are also implementing technology tools for our frontline employee that will enhance communication and mobility to empower our people to significantly improve our customer experience. And as we invest, we work to lower O&M costs and deploy capital as efficiently as possible, while also leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to drive cost-savings. Walter will talk a bit further about these in just a moment. We also experienced strong customer growth. We added 25,000 new customers in the business through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We have an additional 61,000 customer connections under agreement for acquisitions pending regulatory approval. Our portfolio of Market-Based Businesses also provided strong growth, while leveraging our core competencies, using nil to no capital and generating healthy cash flows. We completed the $365 million acquisition of Pivotal, welcoming 650,000 new customers. In our legacy Homeowner Services organization, we launched partnerships with Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Indiana, and received intent to award notices for new partnerships within Francisco, Toledo, Ohio and Florida. We also added our 14th military base with the addition of 4 Edward Army base in Missouri. And we took steps to optimize our Market-Based Businesses, selling the majority of our contract services and narrowing Keystone clear waters operation to its most predictable and profitable water business. With that, I'll turn it over to Walter."

As Susan mentioned, our regulated business had a strong year overall with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency that benefits our customers. Turning to Slide 8., with a significant amount of progress in the regulatory front throughout 2018 and continuing into 2019. 
Let me start with the New Jersey rate case. In October, New Jersey American Water received an order, finalizing it rate case, which was driven by more than $868 million in capital investments since our last rate case in 2015. The new rates represent a $40 million annual increase in water and wastewater revenue, with an authorized return on equity of 9.6% and an equity ratio of 54%, up from 50% in last case. Board of Public Utilities also approved the of $35 million distribution system improvement charge. New Jersey American Water is providing single issue not covered by the settlement, namely the rate recovery of the acquisition adjustments for the and acquisitions. We expect the decision by the end of the second quarter. Pennsylvania American Water received an order for it rate case with an authorized return on equity of 10%, then equity ratio of 53.75%. These new rates will effect in January 1, 2018 and represent approximate $1.3 billion in investments to protect public health in more than 400 communities served by Pennsylvania American Water. In Mame, Missouri American Water received an order finalizing their rate case, resulting in approximately $38 million in additional annualized revenue with an authorized return on equity of 10% and an equity ratio of 52.8%. The new rates were driven by approximately $255 million in investment since our last rate case. In mid-December, California American Water received an order, finalizing its rate case for the period 2018 to 2020. The order approved approximately $171 million of capital investment during this 3-year period. As a reminder, the return on equity of 9.2% and equity ratio of 55% were approved in a separate cost of capital proceeding. These rates are retroactive to the beginning 2018. We also received approval of our request for pilot program, which the customer service fee for payments made by credit card. Rate consolidation of several systems in northern and central California and a continuation of a low income ratepayer systems program. In a separate proceeding, we received approval for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which is a critical water supply solution for more than 40,000 customer connections. Moving to 2019, in West Virginia, we received approval of settlement agreement earlier this month with an authorized return on equity of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 48.4%. This case was driven by the company's ongoing infrastructure investments of more than $200 million since its last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the company's distribution system improvement charge for DSIC will be reset to provide for additional investment. This DSIC surcharge will be offset by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In Maryland, we received approval of the settlement agreement for new water rates earlier this month with an estimate the return on equity of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 48.66%. The case was driven by $80 million of investment made since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new $90 million gallon reservoir and This new reservoir is now in service, provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity for that region. On Slide 9, you can see that there continues to be substantial progress in the legislative side as well. In Indiana, Act 362, the Indiana Water Commitment act was approved in 2018. The focus is on environmental permitting and state revolving loan funds with periodic reviews for utilities, ensuring adequate investment, rate and environmental compliance. In Pennsylvania, there were development on 3 separate acts. Act 120 became effective in December of 2018 and allows the water utility to include the replacement cost for customer owned service line in rate base. Act 58 clarifies the public utility commissions authority to approve rates and rate mechanisms, such as the coupling mechanisms, performance-based rates, formula rates and multi-year plans. Act 12 pertaining to fair market value was constructively clarified and for communities to monetize our assets and redirect the proceeds for other projects like streets, parks and equipment for first responders. Illinois fair market value legislation was expanded and expanded from 5 years to 10 years, continuing to allow utilities to acquire systems and streamline the regulatory approval process. Maryland and Iowa have also enacted similar fair value market legislation. We now have 8 states within our regulatory footprint with this enabling legislation. In California, 3 bills were signed that benefit communities and water and wastewater customers by removing barriers for communities to seek solutions. On the federal side, the water infrastructure act was signed into law in 2018. The results of this law includes policies that set course for enhanced water compliance and improve management for water systems across the country. All of these efforts help our company provide solutions to water and wastewater challenges across our footprint. Turning to Slide 10. 2018 was also a great year for growth. We welcome more than 14,000 customer connections through closed acquisitions, most recently in Roxbury, New Jersey; and Sheridan, Indiana. We also welcome the 11,000 customer connections through organic growth, while welcoming another 61,000 customer connections through 23 signed agreements in 10 different states. This again highlights our ability to grow across our footprint as we continue to provide solutions for communities. Turning to Slide 11. Our smart investments must be balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. In 2018, we invested $1.5 billion in our Regulated Operations. Investment remains critical to ensure reliable service; but for us, it's also about affordable service. We continue to make progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency target of 31.5% by 2023. You can see the progress we've made in our O&M efficiency ratio, going from 46.1% in 2010 to 35.6% in 2018. To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are only slightly higher today than they were in 2012 with a compound annual growth rate of just 0.6%. During that time, we invested more than $7 billion in our infrastructure and added about 150,000 customer connections. We're extremely of how we're managing our O&M expenses. For example, our corporate supply chain group partnered with our technology and innovation team in 2018 to deliver $1.4 million in telecom savings through improved contract terms. We expect these savings to continue through 2019. One Slide 12, we're pleased to announce a few of our notable accomplishments during the final quarter of 2018. Our water supply project received 2 distinguished awards. It was chosen as the environmental project of the year by the local chapter of American Public Works Association, and also won an award for the Association of Environmental Each year, this organization projects that best align with California's environmental focus. Also, our reservoir in Maryland is for and engineering excellence award. And finally, Missouri American Water recently received funding from the EPS WIFIA program for progress in Joplin and St. Louis. The project in Joplin is a much-needed 12 billion-gallon reservoir, that ensure reliable water supply for the 240,000 people in that service area. In St. Louis, we'll be replacing 100 miles of main and service lines. WIFIA programs accelerates investment in our nation's water infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost supplemental loans for regionally and nationally significant projects. With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

In the four",1153,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results on Slide 14. For the quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 in the same period last year. In the fourth quarter of both years, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. You may recall that due to the complexity of the act, the SEC provided companies of one-year window to finalize their estimates. We have now completed that process and recorded a $12 million or $0.07 charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the final remeasurement. Excluding this item in both years, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.69 per share, flat to the prior year as we expected, mainly from a $0.05 favorable depreciation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2017. And I will discuss the quarter in more detail in a moment. Our full year GAAP earnings were $3.15 per share in 2018, which include several adjustments. The remeasurement of deferred taxes I just discussed, the gain from sale of the majority of contract operation, the impairment at Keystone and the final favorable insurance settlement related to the freedom industry sale. Excluding these items and similar items in 2017, our adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share, up 8.9% over adjusted earnings in 2017. Turning to Slide 15. Let me discuss the fourth quarter adjusted results in more detail. Our Regulated Businesses were up $0.05 in total. Revenue was up $0.18 from rate authorizations to support capital investments, acquisitions and organic growth. This revenue was reduced by the $0.16 impact from the lower federal tax rate expected to benefit regulated customers. O&M expense increased $0.05 in total with about $0.02 supporting regulated acquisitions and growth and the remainder related to timing of certain maintenance and repairs, including expenses in New Jersey. Depreciation expense increased $0.09, $0.04 from investment growth and $0.05 from the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the full year new depreciation rates approved in Illinois as I mentioned earlier. And income tax expense was favorable $0.16 from the lower federal tax rate. Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. They were down $0.01 in total with the impact from Keystone final closeout of the Construction business, more than offsetting growth in our Homeowner Services Group. The parent company was down $0.04 from 2 items, half from the lower tax yield on interest expense from the lower federal tax rate and about half from a tax return up in the fourth quarter of 2018. Turning to Slide 16. Our full year 2018 adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share and 8.9% increase over 2017 adjusted earnings. We had strong growth across the company in 2018 with our regulated operations of $0.23 per share from investment in acquisition growth; our Market-Based Businesses up $0.09, primarily from growth in Homeowner Services, including the Pivotal acquisition and the positive impact from tax reform. And the parent was down $0.05, mainly from the lower tax yield on interest expense. Overall, a strong year with consistent execution across all businesses and that can only happen with dedicated commitment of our employees across the company. Turning to Slide 17. Walter reviewed our rate case activity for 2018 and 2019 and that activity resulted in a total of $201 million in new annualized revenues effective since January 1, 2018. This includes $171 million of new annualized revenue in 2018 and $30 million from new annualized revenue so far in 2019. We are also awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge for a total outstanding revenue request of $45 million. Slide 18 highlights of our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. We invented capital of $2 billion in 2018, including $1.5 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $33 million in closed regulated acquisition that added 14,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at year-end 2018 to $12.6 billion, an 8.7% increase from the prior year. We also completed the $365 million acquisition of Pivotal and the remaining $100 million was primarily for of our new headquarters building. And as a reminder, our headquarters building is eligible for up to $164 million in New Jersey tax credit that will be paid out over the next 10 years. And importantly, we estimate this move to be revenue neutral for of our regulated customers. Our cash from operations held steady even with the impact of tax reform. This was due to our strong adjusted net income growth and the increase in cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses, mainly from the Pivotal acquisition. Also, we continue to expect to begin to pay cash taxes late this year and be a full year cash taxpayer in 2020. So what does that mean from a cash flow perspective? It means that given the continuation of accelerated depreciation, repairs and other deductions, we expect cash taxes to be roughly half of our book taxes beginning in 2020 under our long-term plan. Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.9% to 10.1%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint is approximately 9.8% with a weighted equity ratio of about 51.5%. And I'd like to note that the equity ratio represents an increase of more than 4 percentage point from year-end 2017. Our actual adjusted ROE of 10.1% reflects the continued value of our Market-Based Businesses and our Regulated Businesses efforts to narrow the gap between authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on both O&M and capital efficiency. We've been a top leader in dividend growth. We've grown our dividend at or about 10% for 6 consecutive years, and we expect to grow our dividend over the next 5 years at the top of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range subject to Board approval. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Turning to Slide 19. We are today affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. At the guidance midpoint, that represents an 8.8% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've shown you before with plus or minus $0.06 of normal weather variability significant. Events or variations outset of these could cause our results to differ. In our 2019 through 2023 financial plan, we are affirming EPS growth in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth rate, while investing capital in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion, mainly for our regulated customers. And with our strong balance sheet, we do not see a need to issue additional equity under normal operating conditions. With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

American Water has created a foundation based on continued execution of our strategy, and this navigates us through market ups and downs and drives our long-term success. At a recent business dinner, a nonutility colleague asked me directly. So with your valuation, why should I invest in American Water. I laid out our investment thesis as summarized on this slide, which many of you are familiar with, but which we never discussed. There are too many of these to address on this call, but as always, we will be happy to engage with you at a later time on any or all of these factors. And all of this is due to the 71,000 people who are American Water. Once again, with temperatures in early January of this year, our were out there working 24 hours a day, so that our customers had the precious resource of water at as well as critical fire protection and sanitation services. We had main challenges throughout the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. But none more dramatic than in Iowa and upstate Michigan, where temperatures dipped to minus 25 degrees with minus 50 degree windshield. While we only work emergencies during this brutal cold, we doubled and tripled cruise size as to enable very short work cycle, and we provided the best protective equipment possible to ensure employee safety and they heroically work these temperature induced breaks. These folks are amazing and they are at the heart and soul of what makes us successful. It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. More and more, employees, customers and investors seek to align themselves with companies who have responsible policies, make a positive impact in their communities, lead and protecting the planet, invest in their employees and operate in an open and transparent manner. We believe that when you do these things responsibly, long-term financial sustainability follows. It was just announced last week that for the second year in a row, American Water was named to Barron's 100 most sustainable companies. This year, we rank highest of all utilities of any type, coming in at #23 up from 36 last year. It was also announced last month that we were selected for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, one of only 230 companies globally. And as shown on this chart, these recognitions join others, such as our inclusion in last year's NAACP and index line. We've been in business for 133 years and we want to be in business for at least that many more. We has succeeded through market swings, company ownership changes, macro technology disruptions and the full continuum of political and regulatory policy. We are provided our shareholders with 140% TSR over the past 5 years. We have provided clear and transparent insight into our future with decades of investment. We have a strong history of executing on our strategy through efficiencies in both O&M costs and capital deployment. Our regulated capital investment is low risk, consisting of over 100 different water projects per year, reducing the overall risk of any single project to our plan. And our commitment to our shareholders continue through dividend growth guidance at the high-end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth guide. History matters, experience matters and predictability matter. And that's why we're confident in our business and growth for the future. Thank you, and we're happy to take your questions."

And before I turn over to Linda to talk about the financials, just quickly and Keystone. So as we mentioned on the third quarter call, so we have shut down the trucking of water business and the Construction business and we're focusing on water transfer only. And as we pointed out, it was the most predictable and profitable. One thing to date, even this year, we are seeing that hypothesis prove out with a very strong year in water transfer thus far in '19.

And so we're just going to continue telling our story and we think there's a lot of interest given the story that we've got and the proven execution on the strategies and the fundamentals that we try to exhibit every year, every quarter, every day."

But I wanted to bring it back to the fourth quarter what was reported in kind of just give us a little bit of an explanation for. So on a consolidated basis, the company beat our top line estimate. But when I break it down and I look at the regulated revenue, American reported $717 million, that's exactly what we have. And the $30 million outperformance came on the nonregulated side. And my thinking is, well, maybe I did capture -- maybe there were sales in there from the Keystone trucking and construction sale that maybe I should have ticked up or it could have come from added strength from Pivotal that it just came in better-than-expected. So I'm wondering if you could just share and give a little bit more detail how much of that nonregulated sales for the quarter? How much of that was from the Keystone construction and trucking, do we just pick it up for October and then how much of which was really from that Pivotal strength? Because going forward modeling, I don't want to underestimate Pivotal, obviously I don't want to add in trucking and construction when it's no longer going to be there."

Keystone was up to $6 million year-over-year from quarter perspective. I'm sorry, this is a full year. $6 million, Keystone was up, and that's primarily from increase in the water transfer business. And then we had lower revenue results from Military services. This is from lower capital upgrades as well as our Contract Services Group from the sale of that group this year. So that is included in the breakdown for revenue on Page 30, and I think that will help you. For clarification, Rich, we did not feel Keystone's Construction business or trucking, we shut it down because there was not of any of that was related to that. And in our non-GAAP earnings, we did not include the benefits from the sale of CSG. We simply did not include that, nor did we include a positive outcome from an interim sale. So what Linda said, as you look at that chart, this is truly from ongoing operations, this does not include any revenues from onetime sales."

And then the second question is for the regulated acquisition front. I'm just wondering if there are any states where the company is more heavily focused the next 5 years?

And so that's going to be very supportive of privatization. And then when you think about -- so you think about that New Jersey, you think about -- you think about the water accountability act, you think that American Water is headquartered in New Jersey. You would think logically, well, this is very supportive on the regulated acquisition front for American to really dive deeper into New Jersey. At the same time, the company also wants to remain diversified. So just wondering if you could give us some sort of color on that regulated acquisition front.

Because for example, on chemicals and that's the generic name for whether you're talking about waste or or name any of these type of chemicals. And why that's interesting is that, while there was a lot of discussion around the EPA position to not immediately form a maximum contaminant level, but most people might not understand EPA does currently have a unenforceable health advisory, a 70 parts per trillion. Well, at American Water, we don't wait for maximum contaminant level. When the EPA has health advisories, we actually ensure that our systems are consistent with that. So we're already meeting the existing EPA health advisory. We test for it, we check for it before it even becomes an Now I don't know what that number is for municipalities. I don't know what that number is for the companies. But I think your broader point, which is, as we see this in New Jersey and you see this, as we think that, that will become an issue everywhere in all of our states, we're starting to see a lot of concern about these contaminates. And as Walter said, when we talk about being a solutions provider, it's not just buying assets and providing hopefully better service when we go in because this is all we do, water and wastewater, but it's also providing critical health solutions for things like emerging contaminants. And also as Walter said in his comments, in states -- some of our states, we're actually seeing the ability for us to go in and replace customer lead service lines, even if the lead not in our pipes, but as we can do it more cheaply as we're replacing our pipes. So that's the broader story around us being a solutions provider. And I think you're -- what you mentioned is going to be an increasing theme across this country as there's more and more concerns in all the states about these contaminates."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan will cover in detail the fourth quarter and full year financial results. And our COO, Walter Lynch will give key updates on our operations. 
2018 was a very eventful year for American Water, beginning with historic tax reform, the conclusion of several key rate cases and active acquisition here in both Regulated and Market-Based Businesses, the sale and discontinuation of a few Market-Based Business lines and a sharp focus on deploying smart technology and excelling in business fundamentals. Through it all, we further strengthened our low-risk and predictable growth story. 
We experienced continued growth in our Regulated Businesses from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Our Market-Based Businesses achieved very strong year-over-year growth, less the Keystone impairment and provided increased cash to our overall business. 
Our $3.30 adjusted EPS is an 8.9% increase over adjusted 2017 EPS. We are affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share, and we continue our focus on achieving the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS growth CAGR guidance through 2023. 
Our fundamental story at American Water remains the same, and our performance is consistent as we report another strong year of results for 2018. The capital investment we make in regulated operations continues to be the foundation for our growth. $1.5 billion of the total of $2 billion that we invested in 2018 was for regulated infrastructure improvement, with almost $400 million for acquisitions, including our acquisition of Pivotal. 
Let me mention a few of our 2018 highlights. First and most importantly, we continue to be a safer company in which our employees work. We finished 2018 with fewer employee injuries than in any other year recorded in our company's history, but we won't be satisfied until we have 0 injuries throughout our business. We continued our commitment to the highest levels of water quality, the environment and our customer safety by leveraging new and groundbreaking technologies. 
We have installed additional surface water monitoring panel at all of our major surface water intakes, and we are working on a comprehensive data analytics strategy that will enhance our ability to detect issues and respond accordingly. This will enhance the protections we provide to our customers. Phases 2 and 3 of these systems scheduled for this year, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
We are also implementing technology tools for our frontline employees that will enhance communication and mobility to empower our people to significantly improve our customer experience. And as we invest, we work to lower O&M costs and deploy capital as efficiently as possible, while also leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to drive cost savings. Walter will talk a bit further about these in just a moment. 
We also experienced strong customer growth. We added 25,000 new customers in the reg business through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We have an additional 61,000 customer connections under agreement for acquisitions pending regulatory approval. Our portfolio of Market-Based Businesses also provided strong growth, while leveraging our core competencies, using little to no capital and generating healthy cash flows. 
We completed the $365 million acquisition of Pivotal, welcoming 650,000 new customers. In our legacy Homeowner Services organization, we launched partnerships with Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Indiana and received intent to award notices for new partnerships with San Francisco, Toledo, Ohio and Pinellas County, Florida. 
We also added our 14th military base with the addition of Fort Leonard Wood army base in Missouri. And we took steps to optimize our Market-Based Businesses, selling the majority of our contract services and narrowing Keystone Clearwater's operation to its most predictable and profitable water transfer business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Walter."

As Susan mentioned, our Regulated businesses had a strong year all round with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency that benefits our customers. 
Turning to Slide 8, with a significant amount of progress on the regulatory front throughout 2018 and continuing into 2019. 
Let me start with the New Jersey rate case. In October, New Jersey American Water received an order finalizing its rate case, which was driven by more than $868 million in capital investment since our last rate case in 2015. The new rates represent a $40 million annual increase in water and wastewater revenue, with an authorized return on equity of 9.6% and an equity ratio of 54%, up from 53% in the last case. Board of Public Utilities also approved the ruling of a $35 million distribution system improvement charge. New Jersey American Water is providing briefs on single issue not covered by the settlement, namely the rate recovery of the acquisition adjustments for the Haddonfield and Shorelands acquisitions. We expect the decision by the end of the second quarter. 
Pennsylvania American Water received an order for it rate case with an authorized return on equity of 10% and an equity ratio of 53.75%. These new rates were effected in January 1, 2018 and represent approximately $1.3 billion in investment to protect public health in more than 400 communities served by Pennsylvania American Water. 
In May, Missouri American Water received an order finalizing their rate case, resulting in approximately $38 million in additional annualized revenue with an authorized return on equity of 10% and an equity ratio of 52.8%. The new rates were driven by approximately $255 million in investment since our last rate case. 
In mid-December, California American Water received an order finalizing its rate case for the period 2018 to 2020. The order approved approximately $171 million of capital investment during this 3-year period. As a reminder, the return on equity of 9.2% and equity ratio of 55% were approved in a separate cost of capital proceeding. These rates are retroactive to the beginning of 2018. 
We also received approval of our request for a pilot program, which waives the customer service fee for payments made by credit card. Rate consolidation of several systems in northern and central California and a continuation of our low-income ratepayer systems program. 
In a separate proceeding, we received approval for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which is a critical water supply solution for more than 40,000 customer connections. 
Moving to 2019, in West Virginia, we received approval of a settlement agreement earlier this month with an authorized return on equity of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 48.4%. This case was driven by the company's ongoing infrastructure investments of more than $200 million since its last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the company's distribution system improvement charge, or DSIC, will be reset to provide for additional investment. This DSIC surcharge will be offset by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In Maryland, we received approval of the settlement agreement for new water rates earlier this month with an estimated return on equity of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 48.66%. The case was driven by $18 million of investment made since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new 90 million gallon reservoir and intake. This new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity for that region. 
On Slide 9, you can see that there continues to be substantial progress on the legislative side as well. In Indiana, Act 362, the Indiana Water Commitment act was approved in 2018. The focus is on environmental permitting and state revolving loan funds with periodic reviews for utilities, ensuring adequate investment, rate and environmental compliance. 
In Pennsylvania, there were developments on 3 separate acts. Act 120 became effective in December of 2018 and allows the water utility to include the replacement cost for customer-owned lead service lines in rate base. Act 58 clarifies the Public Utility Commission's authority to approve alternative rates and rate mechanisms, such as decoupling mechanisms, performance-based rates, formula rates and multiyear plans. Act 12 pertaining to fair market value was constructively clarified and allows for communities to monetize their assets and redirect the proceeds for other projects like streets, parks and equipment for first responders. 
Illinois fair market value legislation was expanded and extended from 5 years to 10 years, continuing to allow utilities to acquire systems and streamline the regulatory approval process. 
Maryland and Iowa have also enacted similar fair value market legislation. We now have 8 states within our regulatory footprint with this enabling legislation. 
In California, 3 bills were signed that benefit communities and water and wastewater customers by removing barriers for communities to seek solutions. 
On the federal side, the Water Infrastructure Act was signed into law in 2018. The results of this law include policies that set a course for enhanced water compliance and improve management for water systems across the country. All of these efforts help our company provide solutions to water and wastewater challenges across our footprint. 
Turning to Slide 10. 2018 was also a great year for growth. We welcomed more than 14,000 customer connections through closed acquisitions, most recently in Roxbury, New Jersey; and Sheridan, Indiana. We also welcomed the 11,000 customer connections through organic growth and we welcomed another 61,000 customer connections through 23 signed agreements in 10 different states. This again highlights our ability to grow across our footprint as we continue to provide solutions for communities. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our smart investments must be balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. In 2018, we invested $1.5 billion in our regulated operations. Investment remains critical to ensure reliable service, but for us, it's also about affordable service. We continue to make progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency target of 31.5% by 2023. 
You can see the progress we've made in our O&M efficiency ratio, going from 46.1% in 2010 to 35.6% in 2018. To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are only slightly higher today than they were in 2012 with a compound annual growth rate of just 0.6%. During that time, we've invested more than $7 billion in our infrastructure and added about 150,000 customer connections. We're extremely proud of how we're managing our O&M expenses. 
For example, our corporate supply chain group partnered with our technology and innovation team in 2018 to deliver $1.4 million in telecom savings through improved contract terms. We expect these savings to continue through 2019. 
On Slide 12, we're pleased to announce a few of our notable accomplishments during the final quarter of 2018. Our water supply project at Monterey received 2 distinguished awards. It was chosen as the environmental project of the year by the local chapter of American Public Works Association and it also won an award from the Association of Environmental Professions. Each year, this organization awards projects that best align with California's environmental focus. Also, our reservoir in Maryland is now a finalist for the Maryland Engineering Excellence Award. 
And finally, Missouri American Water recently received funding from the EPA's WIFIA program for projects in Joplin and St. Louis. The project in Joplin is a much-needed 12 billion-gallon reservoir, that will ensure reliable water supply for the 240,000 people in that service area. In St. Louis, we'll be replacing 100 miles of mains and lead service lines.

Let me start with our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results on Slide 14. For the quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 in the same period last year. In the fo",1161,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. 
Let me start with our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results on Slide 14. For the quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 in the same period last year. In the fourth quarter of both years, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. You may recall that due to the complexity of the act, the SEC provided companies of one-year window to finalize their estimates. We have now completed that process and recorded a $12 million or $0.07 charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the final remeasurement. 
Excluding this item in both years, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.69 per share, flat to the prior year as we expected, mainly from a $0.05 favorable depreciation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2017. And I will discuss the quarter in more detail in a moment. 
Our full year GAAP earnings were $3.15 per share in 2018, which include several adjustments. The remeasurement of deferred taxes I just discussed, the gain from sale of the majority of contract operation, the impairment at Keystone and the final favorable insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical sale. Excluding these items and similar items in 2017, our adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share, up 8.9% over adjusted earnings in 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. Let me discuss the fourth quarter adjusted results in more detail. Our Regulated Businesses were up $0.05 in total. Revenue was up $0.18 from rate authorizations to support capital investments, acquisitions and organic growth. This revenue was reduced by the $0.16 impact from the lower federal tax rate expected to benefit regulated customers. O&M expense increased $0.05 in total, with about $0.02 supporting regulated acquisitions and growth and the remainder related to timing of certain maintenance and repairs, including tank painting expenses in New Jersey. 
Depreciation expense increased $0.09, $0.04 from investment growth and $0.05 from the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the full year new depreciation rates approved in Illinois, as I mentioned earlier. And income tax expense was favorable $0.16 from the lower federal tax rate. 
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. They were down $0.01 in total with the impact from Keystone final closeout of the construction business more than offsetting growth in our Homeowner Services Group. The parent company was down $0.04 from 2 items, half from the lower tax yield on interest expense from the lower federal tax rate and about half from a tax return true-up in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 16. Our full year 2018 adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share, an 8.9% increase over 2017 adjusted earnings. We had strong growth across the company in 2018 with our regulated operations up $0.23 per share from investment and acquisition growth; our Market-Based Businesses up $0.09, primarily from growth in Homeowner Services, including the Pivotal acquisition and the positive impact from tax reform. And the parent was down $0.05, mainly from the lower tax yield on interest expense. Overall, a strong year with consistent execution across all businesses and that can only happen with the dedicated commitment of our employees across the company. 
Turning to Slide 17. Walter reviewed our rate case activity for 2018 and 2019 and that activity resulted in a total of $201 million in new annualized revenues effective since January 1, 2018. This includes $171 million of new annualized revenue in 2018 and $30 million from new annualized revenue so far in 2019. We are also awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 1 infrastructure charge for a total outstanding revenue request of $45 million. 
Slide 18 highlights our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. We invested capital of $2 billion in 2018, including $1.5 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $33 million in closed regulated acquisitions that added 14,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at year-end 2018 to $12.6 billion, an 8.7% increase from the prior year. 
We also completed the $365 million acquisition of Pivotal and the remaining $100 million was primarily for our new headquarters building. And as a reminder, our headquarters building is eligible for up to $164 million in New Jersey tax credit that will be paid out over the next 10 years. And importantly, we estimate this move to be revenue neutral for our regulated customers. 
Our cash flow from operations held steady even with the impact of tax reform. This was due to our strong adjusted net income growth and the increase in cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses, mainly from the Pivotal acquisition. Also, we continue to expect to begin to pay cash taxes late this year and be a full year cash taxpayer in 2020. 
So what does that mean from a cash flow perspective? It means that given the continuation of accelerated depreciation, repairs and other deductions, we expect cash taxes to be roughly half of our book taxes beginning in 2020 under our long-term plan. 
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.9% to 10.1%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint is approximately 9.8% with a weighted equity ratio of about 51.5%. And I'd like to note that the equity ratio represents an increase of more than a full percentage point from year-end 2017. 
Our actual adjusted ROE of 10.1% reflects the continued value of our Market-Based Businesses and our Regulated Businesses efforts to narrow the gap between authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on both O&M and capital efficiency. 
We've been a top leader in dividend growth. We've grown our dividend at or above 10% for 6 consecutive years, and we expect to grow our dividend over the next 5 years at the top of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range, subject to board approval. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
Turning to Slide 19. We are today affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. At the guidance midpoint, that represents an 8.8% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've shown you before with plus or minus $0.06 of normal weather variability being the most significant. Events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ. 
In our 2019 through 2023 financial plan, we are affirming EPS growth in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth rate, while investing capital in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion, mainly for our regulated customers. And with our strong balance sheet, we do not see a need to issue additional equity under normal operating conditions. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

American Water has created a foundation based on continued execution of our strategy, and this navigates us through market ups and downs and drives our long-term success. At a recent business dinner, a nonutility colleague asked me directly, ""So with your valuation, why should I invest in American Water?"" I've laid out our investment thesis as summarized on this slide, which many of you are familiar with but which we never tire discussing. There are too many of these to address on this call, but as always, we will be happy to engage with you at a later time on any or all of these factors. And all this is due to the 7,100 people who are American Water. 
Once again, with sub-zero temperatures hit in early January of this year, our folks were out there working 24 hours a day, so that our customers had the precious resource of water at their faucet as well as critical fire protection and sanitation services. We had main break challenges throughout the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, but none more dramatic than in Iowa and upstate Michigan, where temperatures dipped to minus 25 degrees with minus 50-degree windshield. While we only worked emergencies during this brutal cold, we doubled and tripled cruise sizes to enable very short work cycle, and we provided the best protective equipment possible to ensure employee safety as they heroically work these temperature-induced breaks. These folks are amazing and they're the heart and soul of what makes us successful. 
It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. More and more employees, customers and investors seek to align themselves with companies who have responsible policies, make a positive impact in their communities, lead in protecting the planet, invest in their employees and operate in an open and transparent manner. We believe that when you do these things responsibly, long-term financial sustainability follows. 
It was just announced last week that for the second year in a row, American Water was named to Barron's 100 most sustainable companies. This year, we ranked highest of all utilities of any type, coming in at #23, up from 36 last year. It was also announced last month that we were selected for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, one of only 230 companies globally. And as shown on this chart, these recognitions join others, such as our inclusion in last year's NAACP inaugural index line. 
We've been in business for 133 years and we want to be in business for at least that many more. We have succeeded through World Wars, market swings, company ownership changes, macro technology disruptions and the full continuum of political and regulatory policy. We've provided our shareholders with 140% TSR over the past 5 years. We have provided clear and transparent insight into our future with decades of needed investment. We have a strong history of executing on our strategy through efficiencies in both O&M costs and capital deployment. 
Our regulated capital investment is low risk, consisting of over 100 different water projects per year, reducing the overall risk of any single project to our plan. And our commitment to our shareholders continue through dividend growth guidance at the high end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth guidance. History matters, experience matters and predictability matter. And that's why we're confident in our business and growth for the future. 
Thank you, and we're happy to take your questions."

As you saw from the numbers that Linda presented, a very, very good year for the entire Homeowner Services organization and Pivotal was part of that as well as the legacy Homeowner Services, which actually won 5 key partnerships, which has a tremendous impact on the future profitability and cash, that we get from that business. And before I turn it over to Linda to talk about the financials, just quickly on Keystone, so as we mentioned on the third quarter call, so we had shut down the trucking of water business and the construction business and we're focusing on water transfer only. And as we pointed out, it was the most predictable and profitable. One thing to date, even this year, we are seeing that hypothesis prove out with a very strong year in water transfer thus far in '19. And as Linda said, you saw a little bit at the end of '14 impact financially as we're taking -- finally closing out the entire construction business."

So I'm wondering if you could just share and give a little bit more detail, how much of that nonregulated sales for the quarter -- how much of that was from the Keystone construction and trucking?

Keystone was up $6 million year-over-year -- or from a quarter perspective -- I'm sorry, this is the full year, $6 million. Keystone was up, and that's primarily from the increase in the water transfer business. And then we had lower revenue results from Military services.

And then the second question is for the regulated acquisition front. I'm just wondering if there are any states where the company is more heavily focused the next 5 years. And the reason why I ask that is because I noticed just the other day that the New Jersey Assembly and the Senate approved a bill where local governments allow -- are going to be allowed to tax homeowners and companies that have very large paint surfaces because the pollutants from those surfaces are seeping into the water systems, and so the tax -- the extra tax revenue is going to be used for upgrading water systems and what have you. But thinking about it, I mean, no one wants extra taxes, right, higher taxes. And so that's going to be very supportive of privatization. And then when you think about -- so you think about that New Jersey, you think about WIPA, you think about the Water Accountability Act, you think that American Water is headquartered in New Jersey. You would think logically, well, this is very supportive on the regulated acquisition front for American to really dive deeper into New Jersey, but at the same time, the company also wants to remain diversified.

We think that with the Water Quality Accountability Act, with the things that are happening, you're correct, this does position us not just in New Jersey, but in all of our states. Because for example, on the perfluoro chemicals, and that's the generic name for whether you're talking about PFOAs or PFNAs or name any of these type of chemicals, and why that's interesting is that while there was a lot of discussion around the EPA's position to not immediately form a maximum contaminant level, what most people may not understand is EPA does currently have a nonenforceable health advisory, a 70 parts per trillion. Well, at American Water, we don't wait for maximum contaminant level. When the EPA has health advisories, we actually ensure that our systems are consistent with that. So we're already meeting the existing EPA health advisory. We test for it, we check for it before it even becomes an MCL. Now I don't know what that number is for municipalities. I don't know what that number is for the companies. But I think your broader point, which is, as we see this in New Jersey and you see this -- we think that, that will become an issue everywhere. In all of our states, we're starting to see a lot of concern about these contaminants. And as Walter said, when we talk about being a solutions provider, it's not just buying assets and providing hopefully better service when we go in because this is all we do, water and wastewater, but it's also providing critical health solutions for things like emerging contaminants. And also as Walter said in his comments, in states -- some of our states, we're actually seeing the ability for us to go in and replace customer lead service lines even if the lead's not in our pipes because we can do it more cheaply as we're replacing our pipes. So that's the broader story around us being a solutions provider. And I think you're -- what you mentioned is going to be an increasing theme across this country as there's more and more concerns in all the states about these contaminants."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan will cover in detail the fourth quarter and full year financial results. And our COO, Walter Lynch will give key updates on our operations. 
2018 was a very eventful year for American Water, beginning with historic tax reform, the conclusion of several key rate cases and active acquisition here in both Regulated and Market-Based Businesses, the sale and discontinuation of a few Market-Based Business lines and a sharp focus on deploying smart technology and excelling in business fundamentals. Through it all, we further strengthened our low-risk and predictable growth story. 
We experienced continued growth in our Regulated Businesses from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Our Market-Based Businesses achieved very strong year-over-year growth, less the Keystone impairment and provided increased cash to our overall business. 
Our $3.30 adjusted EPS is an 8.9% increase over adjusted 2017 EPS. We are affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share, and we continue our focus on achieving the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS growth CAGR guidance through 2023. 
Our fundamental story at American Water remains the same, and our performance is consistent as we report another strong year of results for 2018. The capital investment we make in regulated operations continues to be the foundation for our growth. $1.5 billion of the total of $2 billion that we invested in 2018 was for regulated infrastructure improvement, with almost $400 million for acquisitions, including our acquisition of Pivotal. 
Let me mention a few of our 2018 highlights. First and most importantly, we continue to be a safer company in which our employees work. We finished 2018 with fewer employee injuries than in any other year recorded in our company's history, but we won't be satisfied until we have 0 injuries throughout our business. We continued our commitment to the highest levels of water quality, the environment and our customer safety by leveraging new and groundbreaking technologies. 
We have installed additional surface water monitoring panel at all of our major surface water intakes, and we are working on a comprehensive data analytics strategy that will enhance our ability to detect issues and respond accordingly. This will enhance the protections we provide to our customers. Phases 2 and 3 of these systems scheduled for this year, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
We are also implementing technology tools for our frontline employees that will enhance communication and mobility to empower our people to significantly improve our customer experience. And as we invest, we work to lower O&M costs and deploy capital as efficiently as possible, while also leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to drive cost savings. Walter will talk a bit further about these in just a moment. 
We also experienced strong customer growth. We added 25,000 new customers in the reg business through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We have an additional 61,000 customer connections under agreement for acquisitions pending regulatory approval. Our portfolio of Market-Based Businesses also provided strong growth, while leveraging our core competencies, using little to no capital and generating healthy cash flows. 
We completed the $365 million acquisition of Pivotal, welcoming 650,000 new customers. In our legacy Homeowner Services organization, we launched partnerships with Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Indiana and received intent to award notices for new partnerships with San Francisco, Toledo, Ohio and Pinellas County, Florida. 
We also added our 14th military base with the addition of Fort Leonard Wood army base in Missouri. And we took steps to optimize our Market-Based Businesses, selling the majority of our contract services and narrowing Keystone Clearwater's operation to its most predictable and profitable water transfer business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Walter."

As Susan mentioned, our Regulated businesses had a strong year all round with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency that benefits our customers. 
Turning to Slide 8, with a significant amount of progress on the regulatory front throughout 2018 and continuing into 2019. 
Let me start with the New Jersey rate case. In October, New Jersey American Water received an order finalizing its rate case, which was driven by more than $868 million in capital investment since our last rate case in 2015. The new rates represent a $40 million annual increase in water and wastewater revenue, with an authorized return on equity of 9.6% and an equity ratio of 54%, up from 53% in the last case. Board of Public Utilities also approved the ruling of a $35 million distribution system improvement charge. New Jersey American Water is providing briefs on single issue not covered by the settlement, namely the rate recovery of the acquisition adjustments for the Haddonfield and Shorelands acquisitions. We expect the decision by the end of the second quarter. 
Pennsylvania American Water received an order for it rate case with an authorized return on equity of 10% and an equity ratio of 53.75%. These new rates were effected in January 1, 2018 and represent approximately $1.3 billion in investment to protect public health in more than 400 communities served by Pennsylvania American Water. 
In May, Missouri American Water received an order finalizing their rate case, resulting in approximately $38 million in additional annualized revenue with an authorized return on equity of 10% and an equity ratio of 52.8%. The new rates were driven by approximately $255 million in investment since our last rate case. 
In mid-December, California American Water received an order finalizing its rate case for the period 2018 to 2020. The order approved approximately $171 million of capital investment during this 3-year period. As a reminder, the return on equity of 9.2% and equity ratio of 55% were approved in a separate cost of capital proceeding. These rates are retroactive to the beginning of 2018. 
We also received approval of our request for a pilot program, which waives the customer service fee for payments made by credit card. Rate consolidation of several systems in northern and central California and a continuation of our low-income ratepayer systems program. 
In a separate proceeding, we received approval for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which is a critical water supply solution for more than 40,000 customer connections. 
Moving to 2019, in West Virginia, we received approval of a settlement agreement earlier this month with an authorized return on equity of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 48.4%. This case was driven by the company's ongoing infrastructure investments of more than $200 million since its last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the company's distribution system improvement charge, or DSIC, will be reset to provide for additional investment. This DSIC surcharge will be offset by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In Maryland, we received approval of the settlement agreement for new water rates earlier this month with an estimated return on equity of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 48.66%. The case was driven by $18 million of investment made since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new 90 million gallon reservoir and intake. This new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity for that region. 
On Slide 9, you can see that there continues to be substantial progress on the legislative side as well. In Indiana, Act 362, the Indiana Water Commitment act was approved in 2018. The focus is on environmental permitting and state revolving loan funds with periodic reviews for utilities, ensuring adequate investment, rate and environmental compliance. 
In Pennsylvania, there were developments on 3 separate acts. Act 120 became effective in December of 2018 and allows the water utility to include the replacement cost for customer-owned lead service lines in rate base. Act 58 clarifies the Public Utility Commission's authority to approve alternative rates and rate mechanisms, such as decoupling mechanisms, performance-based rates, formula rates and multiyear plans. Act 12 pertaining to fair market value was constructively clarified and allows for communities to monetize their assets and redirect the proceeds for other projects like streets, parks and equipment for first responders. 
Illinois fair market value legislation was expanded and extended from 5 years to 10 years, continuing to allow utilities to acquire systems and streamline the regulatory approval process. 
Maryland and Iowa have also enacted similar fair value market legislation. We now have 8 states within our regulatory footprint with this enabling legislation. 
In California, 3 bills were signed that benefit communities and water and wastewater customers by removing barriers for communities to seek solutions. 
On the federal side, the Water Infrastructure Act was signed into law in 2018. The results of this law include policies that set a course for enhanced water compliance and improve management for water systems across the country. All of these efforts help our company provide solutions to water and wastewater challenges across our footprint. 
Turning to Slide 10. 2018 was also a great year for growth. We welcomed more than 14,000 customer connections through closed acquisitions, most recently in Roxbury, New Jersey; and Sheridan, Indiana. We also welcomed the 11,000 customer connections through organic growth and we welcomed another 61,000 customer connections through 23 signed agreements in 10 different states. This again highlights our ability to grow across our footprint as we continue to provide solutions for communities. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our smart investments must be balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. In 2018, we invested $1.5 billion in our regulated operations. Investment remains critical to ensure reliable service, but for us, it's also about affordable service. We continue to make progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency target of 31.5% by 2023. 
You can see the progress we've made in our O&M efficiency ratio, going from 46.1% in 2010 to 35.6% in 2018. To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are only slightly higher today than they were in 2012 with a compound annual growth rate of just 0.6%. During that time, we've invested more than $7 billion in our infrastructure and added about 150,000 customer connections. We're extremely proud of how we're managing our O&M expenses. 
For example, our corporate supply chain group partnered with our technology and innovation team in 2018 to deliver $1.4 million in telecom savings through improved contract terms. We expect these savings to continue through 2019. 
On Slide 12, we're pleased to announce a few of our notable accomplishments during the final quarter of 2018. Our water supply project at Monterey received 2 distinguished awards. It was chosen as the environmental project of the year by the local chapter of American Public Works Association and it also won an award from the Association of Environmental Professions. Each year, this organization awards projects that best align with California's environmental focus. Also, our reservoir in Maryland is now a finalist for the Maryland Engineering Excellence Award. 
And finally, Missouri American Water recently received funding from the EPA's WIFIA program for projects in Joplin and St. Louis. The project in Joplin is a much-needed 12 billion-gallon reservoir, that will ensure reliable water supply for the 240,000 people in that service area. In St. Louis, we'll be replacing 100 miles of mains and lead service lines. The WIFIA program accelerates investment in our nation's water infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost supplemental loans for regionally and nationally significant projects. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start with our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results on Slide 14. For the quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 in the same period last year. In the fo",1161,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. 
Let me start with our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results on Slide 14. For the quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 in the same period last year. In the fourth quarter of both years, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. You may recall that due to the complexity of the act, the SEC provided companies of one-year window to finalize their estimates. We have now completed that process and recorded a $12 million or $0.07 charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the final remeasurement. 
Excluding this item in both years, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.69 per share, flat to the prior year as we expected, mainly from a $0.05 favorable depreciation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2017. And I will discuss the quarter in more detail in a moment. 
Our full year GAAP earnings were $3.15 per share in 2018, which include several adjustments. The remeasurement of deferred taxes I just discussed, the gain from sale of the majority of contract operation, the impairment at Keystone and the final favorable insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical sale. Excluding these items and similar items in 2017, our adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share, up 8.9% over adjusted earnings in 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. Let me discuss the fourth quarter adjusted results in more detail. Our Regulated Businesses were up $0.05 in total. Revenue was up $0.18 from rate authorizations to support capital investments, acquisitions and organic growth. This revenue was reduced by the $0.16 impact from the lower federal tax rate expected to benefit regulated customers. O&M expense increased $0.05 in total, with about $0.02 supporting regulated acquisitions and growth and the remainder related to timing of certain maintenance and repairs, including tank painting expenses in New Jersey. 
Depreciation expense increased $0.09, $0.04 from investment growth and $0.05 from the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the full year new depreciation rates approved in Illinois, as I mentioned earlier. And income tax expense was favorable $0.16 from the lower federal tax rate. 
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. They were down $0.01 in total with the impact from Keystone final closeout of the construction business more than offsetting growth in our Homeowner Services Group. The parent company was down $0.04 from 2 items, half from the lower tax yield on interest expense from the lower federal tax rate and about half from a tax return true-up in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 16. Our full year 2018 adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share, an 8.9% increase over 2017 adjusted earnings. We had strong growth across the company in 2018 with our regulated operations up $0.23 per share from investment and acquisition growth; our Market-Based Businesses up $0.09, primarily from growth in Homeowner Services, including the Pivotal acquisition and the positive impact from tax reform. And the parent was down $0.05, mainly from the lower tax yield on interest expense. Overall, a strong year with consistent execution across all businesses and that can only happen with the dedicated commitment of our employees across the company. 
Turning to Slide 17. Walter reviewed our rate case activity for 2018 and 2019 and that activity resulted in a total of $201 million in new annualized revenues effective since January 1, 2018. This includes $171 million of new annualized revenue in 2018 and $30 million from new annualized revenue so far in 2019. We are also awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 1 infrastructure charge for a total outstanding revenue request of $45 million. 
Slide 18 highlights our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. We invested capital of $2 billion in 2018, including $1.5 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $33 million in closed regulated acquisitions that added 14,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at year-end 2018 to $12.6 billion, an 8.7% increase from the prior year. 
We also completed the $365 million acquisition of Pivotal and the remaining $100 million was primarily for our new headquarters building. And as a reminder, our headquarters building is eligible for up to $164 million in New Jersey tax credit that will be paid out over the next 10 years. And importantly, we estimate this move to be revenue neutral for our regulated customers. 
Our cash flow from operations held steady even with the impact of tax reform. This was due to our strong adjusted net income growth and the increase in cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses, mainly from the Pivotal acquisition. Also, we continue to expect to begin to pay cash taxes late this year and be a full year cash taxpayer in 2020. 
So what does that mean from a cash flow perspective? It means that given the continuation of accelerated depreciation, repairs and other deductions, we expect cash taxes to be roughly half of our book taxes beginning in 2020 under our long-term plan. 
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.9% to 10.1%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint is approximately 9.8% with a weighted equity ratio of about 51.5%. And I'd like to note that the equity ratio represents an increase of more than a full percentage point from year-end 2017. 
Our actual adjusted ROE of 10.1% reflects the continued value of our Market-Based Businesses and our Regulated Businesses efforts to narrow the gap between authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on both O&M and capital efficiency. 
We've been a top leader in dividend growth. We've grown our dividend at or above 10% for 6 consecutive years, and we expect to grow our dividend over the next 5 years at the top of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range, subject to board approval. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
Turning to Slide 19. We are today affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. At the guidance midpoint, that represents an 8.8% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've shown you before with plus or minus $0.06 of normal weather variability being the most significant. Events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ. 
In our 2019 through 2023 financial plan, we are affirming EPS growth in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth rate, while investing capital in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion, mainly for our regulated customers. And with our strong balance sheet, we do not see a need to issue additional equity under normal operating conditions. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

American Water has created a foundation based on continued execution of our strategy, and this navigates us through market ups and downs and drives our long-term success. At a recent business dinner, a nonutility colleague asked me directly, ""So with your valuation, why should I invest in American Water?"" I've laid out our investment thesis as summarized on this slide, which many of you are familiar with but which we never tire discussing. There are too many of these to address on this call, but as always, we will be happy to engage with you at a later time on any or all of these factors. And all this is due to the 7,100 people who are American Water. 
Once again, with sub-zero temperatures hit in early January of this year, our folks were out there working 24 hours a day, so that our customers had the precious resource of water at their faucet as well as critical fire protection and sanitation services. We had main break challenges throughout the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, but none more dramatic than in Iowa and upstate Michigan, where temperatures dipped to minus 25 degrees with minus 50-degree windshield. While we only worked emergencies during this brutal cold, we doubled and tripled cruise sizes to enable very short work cycle, and we provided the best protective equipment possible to ensure employee safety as they heroically work these temperature-induced breaks. These folks are amazing and they're the heart and soul of what makes us successful. 
It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. More and more employees, customers and investors seek to align themselves with companies who have responsible policies, make a positive impact in their communities, lead in protecting the planet, invest in their employees and operate in an open and transparent manner. We believe that when you do these things responsibly, long-term financial sustainability follows. 
It was just announced last week that for the second year in a row, American Water was named to Barron's 100 most sustainable companies. This year, we ranked highest of all utilities of any type, coming in at #23, up from 36 last year. It was also announced last month that we were selected for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, one of only 230 companies globally. And as shown on this chart, these recognitions join others, such as our inclusion in last year's NAACP inaugural index line. 
We've been in business for 133 years and we want to be in business for at least that many more. We have succeeded through World Wars, market swings, company ownership changes, macro technology disruptions and the full continuum of political and regulatory policy. We've provided our shareholders with 140% TSR over the past 5 years. We have provided clear and transparent insight into our future with decades of needed investment. We have a strong history of executing on our strategy through efficiencies in both O&M costs and capital deployment. 
Our regulated capital investment is low risk, consisting of over 100 different water projects per year, reducing the overall risk of any single project to our plan. And our commitment to our shareholders continue through dividend growth guidance at the high end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth guidance. History matters, experience matters and predictability matter. And that's why we're confident in our business and growth for the future. 
Thank you, and we're happy to take your questions."

And before I turn it over to Linda to talk about the financials, just quickly on Keystone, so as we mentioned on the third quarter call, so we had shut down the trucking of water business and the construction business and we're focusing on water transfer only. And as we pointed out, it was the most predictable and profitable.

But I want to bring it back to the fourth quarter what was reported in kind of just give us a little bit of an explanation for. So on a consolidated basis, the company beat our top line estimate. But when I break it down and I look at the regulated revenue, American reported $717 million, that's exactly what we have, and the $30 million outperformance came on the nonregulated side. And my thinking is, well, maybe I didn't capture -- maybe there were sales in there from the Keystone trucking and construction sale that maybe I should have ticked up or it could have come from added strength from Pivotal that it just came in better than expected. So I'm wondering if you could just share and give a little bit more detail, how much of that nonregulated sales for the quarter -- how much of that was from the Keystone construction and trucking? Did we just pick it up for October, and then how much of it was really from that Pivotal strength?

Keystone was up $6 million year-over-year -- or from a quarter perspective -- I'm sorry, this is the full year, $6 million. Keystone was up, and that's primarily from the increase in the water transfer business. And then we had lower revenue results from Military services. This is from lower capital upgrades as well as our Contract Services Group from the sale of that group this year. So that is included in the breakdown for revenue on Page 30, and I think that will help you."

And then the second question is for the regulated acquisition front. I'm just wondering if there are any states where the company is more heavily focused the next 5 years. And the reason why I ask that is because I noticed just the other day that the New Jersey Assembly and the Senate approved a bill where local governments allow -- are going to be allowed to tax homeowners and companies that have very large paint surfaces because the pollutants from those surfaces are seeping into the water systems, and so the tax -- the extra tax revenue is going to be used for upgrading water systems and what have you. But thinking about it, I mean, no one wants extra taxes, right, higher taxes. And so that's going to be very supportive of privatization. And then when you think about -- so you think about that New Jersey, you think about WIPA, you think about the Water Accountability Act, you think that American Water is headquartered in New Jersey. You would think logically, well, this is very supportive on the regulated acquisition front for American to really dive deeper into New Jersey, but at the same time, the company also wants to remain diversified. So just wondering if you could give us just some sort of color on that regulated acquisition front. It's may be you are leaning more towards New Jersey or if there are any other states maybe you're more heavily focused on in the next 5 years?"

We think that with the Water Quality Accountability Act, with the things that are happening, you're correct, this does position us not just in New Jersey, but in all of our states. Because for example, on the perfluoro chemicals, and that's the generic name for whether you're talking about PFOAs or PFNAs or name any of these type of chemicals, and why that's interesting is that while there was a lot of discussion around the EPA's position to not immediately form a maximum contaminant level, what most people may not understand is EPA does currently have a nonenforceable health advisory, a 70 parts per trillion. Well, at American Water, we don't wait for maximum contaminant level. When the EPA has health advisories, we actually ensure that our systems are consistent with that. So we're already meeting the existing EPA health advisory. We test for it, we check for it before it even becomes an MCL. Now I don't know what that number is for municipalities. I don't know what that number is for the companies. But I think your broader point, which is, as we see this in New Jersey and you see this -- we think that, that will become an issue everywhere. In all of our states, we're starting to see a lot of concern about these contaminants. And as Walter said, when we talk about being a solutions provider, it's not just buying assets and providing hopefully better service when we go in because this is all we do, water and wastewater, but it's also providing critical health solutions for things like emerging contaminants. And also as Walter said in his comments, in states -- some of our states, we're actually seeing the ability for us to go in and replace customer lead service lines even if the lead's not in our pipes because we can do it more cheaply as we're replacing our pipes. So that's the broader story around us being a solutions provider. And I think you're -- what you mentioned is going to be an increasing theme across this country as there's more and more concerns in all the states about these contaminants."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan will cover in detail the fourth quarter and full year financial results. And our COO, Walter Lynch will give key updates on our operations. 
2018 was a very eventful year for American Water, beginning with historic tax reform, the conclusion of several key rate cases and active acquisition here in both Regulated and Market-Based Businesses, the sale and discontinuation of a few Market-Based Business lines and a sharp focus on deploying smart technology and excelling in business fundamentals. Through it all, we further strengthened our low-risk and predictable growth story. 
We experienced continued growth in our Regulated Businesses from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Our Market-Based Businesses achieved very strong year-over-year growth, less the Keystone impairment and provided increased cash to our overall business. 
Our $3.30 adjusted EPS is an 8.9% increase over adjusted 2017 EPS. We are affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share, and we continue our focus on achieving the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS growth CAGR guidance through 2023. 
Our fundamental story at American Water remains the same, and our performance is consistent as we report another strong year of results for 2018. The capital investment we make in regulated operations continues to be the foundation for our growth. $1.5 billion of the total of $2 billion that we invested in 2018 was for regulated infrastructure improvement, with almost $400 million for acquisitions, including our acquisition of Pivotal. 
Let me mention a few of our 2018 highlights. First and most importantly, we continue to be a safer company in which our employees work. We finished 2018 with fewer employee injuries than in any other year recorded in our company's history, but we won't be satisfied until we have 0 injuries throughout our business. We continued our commitment to the highest levels of water quality, the environment and our customer safety by leveraging new and groundbreaking technologies. 
We have installed additional surface water monitoring panel at all of our major surface water intakes, and we are working on a comprehensive data analytics strategy that will enhance our ability to detect issues and respond accordingly. This will enhance the protections we provide to our customers. Phases 2 and 3 of these systems scheduled for this year, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
We are also implementing technology tools for our frontline employees that will enhance communication and mobility to empower our people to significantly improve our customer experience. And as we invest, we work to lower O&M costs and deploy capital as efficiently as possible, while also leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to drive cost savings. Walter will talk a bit further about these in just a moment. 
We also experienced strong customer growth. We added 25,000 new customers in the reg business through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We have an additional 61,000 customer connections under agreement for acquisitions pending regulatory approval. Our portfolio of Market-Based Businesses also provided strong growth, while leveraging our core competencies, using little to no capital and generating healthy cash flows. 
We completed the $365 million acquisition of Pivotal, welcoming 650,000 new customers. In our legacy Homeowner Services organization, we launched partnerships with Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Indiana and received intent to award notices for new partnerships with San Francisco, Toledo, Ohio and Pinellas County, Florida. 
We also added our 14th military base with the addition of Fort Leonard Wood army base in Missouri. And we took steps to optimize our Market-Based Businesses, selling the majority of our contract services and narrowing Keystone Clearwater's operation to its most predictable and profitable water transfer business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Walter."

Turning to Slide 8, with a significant amount of progress on the regulatory front throughout 2018 and continuing into 2019. 
Let me start with the New Jersey rate case. In October, New Jersey American Water received an order finalizing its rate case, which was driven by more than $868 million in capital investment since our last rate case in 2015. The new rates represent a $40 million annual increase in water and wastewater revenue, with an authorized return on equity of 9.6% and an equity ratio of 54%, up from 53% in the last case. Board of Public Utilities also approved the ruling of a $35 million distribution system improvement charge. New Jersey American Water is providing briefs on single issue not covered by the settlement, namely the rate recovery of the acquisition adjustments for the Haddonfield and Shorelands acquisitions. We expect the decision by the end of the second quarter. 
Pennsylvania American Water received an order for it rate case with an authorized return on equity of 10% and an equity ratio of 53.75%. These new rates were effected in January 1, 2018, and represent approximately $1.3 billion in investment to protect public health in more than 400 communities served by Pennsylvania American Water. 
In May, Missouri American Water received an order finalizing their rate case, resulting in approximately $38 million in additional annualized revenue with an authorized return on equity of 10% and an equity ratio of 52.8%. The new rates were driven by approximately $255 million in investment since our last rate case. 
In mid-December, California American Water received an order finalizing its rate case for the period 2018 to 2020. The order approved approximately $171 million of capital investment during this 3-year period. As a reminder, the return on equity of 9.2% and equity ratio of 55% were approved in a separate cost of capital proceeding. These rates are retroactive to the beginning of 2018. 
We also received approval of our request for a pilot program, which waives the customer service fee for payments made by credit card. Rate consolidation of several systems in northern and central California and a continuation of our low-income ratepayer systems program. 
In a separate proceeding, we received approval for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which is a critical water supply solution for more than 40,000 customer connections. 
Moving to 2019, in West Virginia, we received approval of a settlement agreement earlier this month with an authorized return on equity of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 48.4%. This case was driven by the company's ongoing infrastructure investments of more than $200 million since its last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the company's distribution system improvement charge, or DSIC, will be reset to provide for additional investment. This DSIC surcharge will be offset by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In Maryland, we received approval of the settlement agreement for new water rates earlier this month with an estimated return on equity of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 48.66%. The case was driven by $18 million of investment made since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new 90 million gallon reservoir and intake. This new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity for that region. 
On Slide 9, you can see that there continues to be substantial progress on the legislative side as well. In Indiana, Act 362, the Indiana Water Commitment act was approved in 2018. The focus is on environmental permitting and state revolving loan funds with periodic reviews for utilities, ensuring adequate investment, rate and environmental compliance. 
In Pennsylvania, there were developments on 3 separate acts. Act 120 became effective in December of 2018 and allows the water utility to include the replacement cost for customer-owned lead service lines in rate base. Act 58 clarifies the Public Utility Commission's authority to approve alternative rates and rate mechanisms, such as decoupling mechanisms, performance-based rates, formula rates and multiyear plans. Act 12 pertaining to fair market value was constructively clarified and allows for communities to monetize their assets and redirect the proceeds for other projects like streets, parks and equipment for first responders. 
Illinois fair market value legislation was expanded and extended from 5 years to 10 years, continuing to allow utilities to acquire systems and streamline the regulatory approval process. 
Maryland and Iowa have also enacted similar fair value market legislation. We now have 8 states within our regulatory footprint with this enabling legislation. 
In California, 3 bills were signed that benefit communities and water and wastewater customers by removing barriers for communities to seek solutions. 
On the federal side, the Water Infrastructure Act was signed into law in 2018. The results of this law include policies that set a course for enhanced water compliance and improve management for water systems across the country. All of these efforts help our company provide solutions to water and wastewater challenges across our footprint. 
Turning to Slide 10. 2018 was also a great year for growth. We welcomed more than 14,000 customer connections through closed acquisitions, most recently in Roxbury, New Jersey; and Sheridan, Indiana. We also welcomed the 11,000 customer connections through organic growth and we welcomed another 61,000 customer connections through 23 signed agreements in 10 different states. This again highlights our ability to grow across our footprint as we continue to provide solutions for communities. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our smart investments must be balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. In 2018, we invested $1.5 billion in our regulated operations. Investment remains critical to ensure reliable service, but for us, it's also about affordable service. We continue to make progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency target of 31.5% by 2023. 
You can see the progress we've made in our O&M efficiency ratio, going from 46.1% in 2010 to 35.6% in 2018. To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are only slightly higher today than they were in 2012 with a compound annual growth rate of just 0.6%. During that time, we've invested more than $7 billion in our infrastructure and added about 150,000 customer connections. We're extremely proud of how we're managing our O&M expenses. 
For example, our corporate supply chain group partnered with our technology and innovation team in 2018 to deliver $1.4 million in telecom savings through improved contract terms. We expect these savings to continue through 2019. 
On Slide 12, we're pleased to announce a few of our notable accomplishments during the final quarter of 2018. Our water supply project at Monterey received 2 distinguished awards. It was chosen as the environmental project of the year by the local chapter of American Public Works Association and it also won an award from the Association of Environmental Professions. Each year, this organization awards projects that best align with California's environmental focus. Also, our reservoir in Maryland is now a finalist for the Maryland Engineering Excellence Award. 
And finally, Missouri American Water recently received funding from the EPA's WIFIA program for projects in Joplin and St. Louis. The project in Joplin is a much-needed 12 billion-gallon reservoir, that will ensure reliable water supply for the 240,000 people in that service area. In St. Louis, we'll be replacing 100 miles of mains and lead service lines. The WIFIA program accelerates investment in our nation's water infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost supplemental loans for regionally and nationally significant projects. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start with our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results on Slide 14. For the quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 in the same period last year. In the fo",1161,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. 
Let me start with our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results on Slide 14. For the quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 in the same period last year. In the fourth quarter of both years, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. You may recall that due to the complexity of the act, the SEC provided companies of 1-year window to finalize their estimates. We have now completed that process and recorded a $12 million or $0.07 charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the final remeasurement. 
Excluding this item in both years, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.69 per share, flat to the prior year as we expected, mainly from a $0.05 favorable depreciation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2017. And I will discuss the quarter in more detail in a moment. 
Our full year GAAP earnings were $3.15 per share in 2018, which include several adjustments. The remeasurement of deferred taxes I just discussed, the gain from sale of the majority of contract operation, the impairment at Keystone and the final favorable insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical sale. Excluding these items and similar items in 2017, our adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share, up 8.9% over adjusted earnings in 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. Let me discuss the fourth quarter adjusted results in more detail. Our Regulated Businesses were up $0.05 in total. Revenue was up $0.18 from rate authorizations to support capital investments, acquisitions and organic growth. This revenue was reduced by the $0.16 impact from the lower federal tax rate expected to benefit regulated customers. O&M expense increased $0.05 in total, with about $0.02 supporting regulated acquisitions and growth and the remainder related to timing of certain maintenance and repairs, including tank painting expenses in New Jersey. 
Depreciation expense increased $0.09, $0.04 from investment growth and $0.05 from the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the full year new depreciation rates approved in Illinois, as I mentioned earlier. And income tax expense was favorable $0.16 from the lower federal tax rate. 
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. They were down $0.01 in total with the impact from Keystone final closeout of the construction business more than offsetting growth in our Homeowner Services Group. The parent company was down $0.04 from 2 items, half from the lower tax yield on interest expense from the lower federal tax rate and about half from a tax return true-up in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 16. Our full year 2018 adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share, an 8.9% increase over 2017 adjusted earnings. We had strong growth across the company in 2018 with our regulated operations up $0.23 per share from investment and acquisition growth; our Market-Based Businesses up $0.09, primarily from growth in Homeowner Services, including the Pivotal acquisition and the positive impact from tax reform. And the parent was down $0.05, mainly from the lower tax yield on interest expense. Overall, a strong year with consistent execution across all businesses and that can only happen with the dedicated commitment of our employees across the company. 
Turning to Slide 17. Walter reviewed our rate case activity for 2018 and 2019 and that activity resulted in a total of $201 million in new annualized revenues effective since January 1, 2018. This includes $171 million of new annualized revenue in 2018 and $30 million from new annualized revenue so far in 2019. We are also awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 1 infrastructure charge for a total outstanding revenue request of $45 million. 
Slide 18 highlights our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. We invested capital of $2 billion in 2018, including $1.5 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $33 million in closed regulated acquisitions that added 14,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at year-end 2018 to $12.6 billion, an 8.7% increase from the prior year. 
We also completed the $365 million acquisition of Pivotal and the remaining $100 million was primarily for our new headquarters building. And as a reminder, our headquarters building is eligible for up to $164 million in New Jersey tax credit that will be paid out over the next 10 years. And importantly, we estimate this move to be revenue neutral for our regulated customers. 
Our cash flow from operations held steady even with the impact of tax reform. This was due to our strong adjusted net income growth and the increase in cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses, mainly from the Pivotal acquisition. Also, we continue to expect to begin to pay cash taxes late this year and be a full year cash taxpayer in 2020. 
So what does that mean from a cash flow perspective? It means that given the continuation of accelerated depreciation, repairs and other deductions, we expect cash taxes to be roughly half of our book taxes beginning in 2020 under our long-term plan. 
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.9% to 10.1%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint is approximately 9.8% with a weighted equity ratio of about 51.5%. And I'd like to note that the equity ratio represents an increase of more than a full percentage point from year-end 2017. 
Our actual adjusted ROE of 10.1% reflects the continued value of our Market-Based Businesses and our Regulated Businesses efforts to narrow the gap between authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on both O&M and capital efficiency. 
We've been a top leader in dividend growth. We've grown our dividend at or above 10% for 6 consecutive years, and we expect to grow our dividend over the next 5 years at the top of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range, subject to board approval. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
Turning to Slide 19. We are today affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. At the guidance midpoint, that represents an 8.8% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've shown you before with plus or minus $0.06 of normal weather variability being the most significant. Events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ. 
In our 2019 through 2023 financial plan, we are affirming EPS growth in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth rate, while investing capital in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion, mainly for our regulated customers. And with our strong balance sheet, we do not see a need to issue additional equity under normal operating conditions. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

American Water has created a foundation based on continued execution of our strategy, and this navigates us through market ups and downs and drives our long-term success. At a recent business dinner, a nonutility colleague asked me directly, ""So with your valuation, why should I invest in American Water?"" I've laid out our investment thesis as summarized on this slide, which many of you are familiar with but which we never tire discussing. There are too many of these to address on this call, but as always, we will be happy to engage with you at a later time on any or all of these factors. And all this is due to the 7,100 people who are American Water. 
Once again, with sub-zero temperatures hit in early January of this year, our folks were out there working 24 hours a day, so that our customers had the precious resource of water at their faucet as well as critical fire protection and sanitation services. We had main break challenges throughout the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, but none more dramatic than in Iowa and upstate Michigan, where temperatures dipped to minus 25 degrees with minus 50-degree windshield. While we only worked emergencies during this brutal cold, we doubled and tripled cruise sizes to enable very short work cycle, and we provided the best protective equipment possible to ensure employee safety as they heroically work these temperature-induced breaks. These folks are amazing and they're the heart and soul of what makes us successful. 
It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. More and more employees, customers and investors seek to align themselves with companies who have responsible policies, make a positive impact in their communities, lead in protecting the planet, invest in their employees and operate in an open and transparent manner. We believe that when you do these things responsibly, long-term financial sustainability follows. 
It was just announced last week that for the second year in a row, American Water was named to Barron's 100 most sustainable companies. This year, we ranked highest of all utilities of any type, coming in at #23, up from 36 last year. It was also announced last month that we were selected for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, one of only 230 companies globally. And as shown on this chart, these recognitions join others, such as our inclusion in last year's NAACP inaugural index line. 
We've been in business for 133 years and we want to be in business for at least that many more. We have succeeded through World Wars, market swings, company ownership changes, macro technology disruptions and the full continuum of political and regulatory policy. We've provided our shareholders with 140% TSR over the past 5 years. We have provided clear and transparent insight into our future with decades of needed investment. We have a strong history of executing on our strategy through efficiencies in both O&M costs and capital deployment. 
Our regulated capital investment is low risk, consisting of over 100 different water projects per year, reducing the overall risk of any single project to our plan. And our commitment to our shareholders continue through dividend growth guidance at the high end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth guidance. History matters, experience matters and predictability matter. And that's why we're confident in our business and growth for the future. 
Thank you, and we're happy to take your questions."

And before I turn it over to Linda to talk about the financials, just quickly on Keystone, so as we mentioned on the third quarter call, so we had shut down the trucking of water business and the construction business and we're focusing on water transfer only. And as we pointed out, it was the most predictable and profitable. One thing to date, even this year, we are seeing that hypothesis prove out with a very strong year in water transfer thus far in '19. And as Linda said, you saw a little bit at the end of '14 impact financially as we're taking -- finally closing out the entire construction business."

So I'm wondering if you could just share and give a little bit more detail, how much of that nonregulated sales for the quarter -- how much of that was from the Keystone construction and trucking?

Keystone was up $6 million year-over-year -- or from a quarter perspective -- I'm sorry, this is the full year, $6 million. Keystone was up, and that's primarily from the increase in the water transfer business. And then we had lower revenue results from Military services.

And then the second question is for the regulated acquisition front. I'm just wondering if there are any states where the company is more heavily focused the next 5 years. And the reason why I ask that is because I noticed just the other day that the New Jersey Assembly and the Senate approved a bill where local governments allow -- are going to be allowed to tax homeowners and companies that have very large paint surfaces because the pollutants from those surfaces are seeping into the water systems, and so the tax -- the extra tax revenue is going to be used for upgrading water systems and what have you. But thinking about it, I mean, no one wants extra taxes, right, higher taxes. And so that's going to be very supportive of privatization. And then when you think about -- so you think about that New Jersey, you think about WIPA, you think about the Water Accountability Act, you think that American Water is headquartered in New Jersey. You would think logically, well, this is very supportive on the regulated acquisition front for American to really dive deeper into New Jersey, but at the same time, the company also wants to remain diversified. So just wondering if you could give us just some sort of color on that regulated acquisition front. It's may be you are leaning more towards New Jersey or if there are any other states maybe you're more heavily focused on in the next 5 years?"

Our state teams are leading this charge and they're focused on again providing solutions for communities in need, and that's really what we're focused on. Yes, there are some great states, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois, that really have advanced, I think, the notion of private water companies providing solutions. And you look at all the fair market value legislation out there. That's encouraging us to do these kind of acquisitions. So we're really excited about the growth opportunities. As we said before, we've over 500,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline, and that's because we're providing solutions. And our communities recognize that and it's just something we're all very, very proud of."

We think that with the Water Quality Accountability Act, with the things that are happening, you're correct, this does position us not just in New Jersey, but in all of our states. Because for example, on the perfluoro chemicals, and that's the generic name for whether you're talking about PFOAs or PFNAs or name any of these type of chemicals, and why that's interesting is that while there was a lot of discussion around the EPA's position to not immediately form a maximum contaminant level, what most people may not understand is EPA does currently have a nonenforceable health advisory, a 70 parts per trillion. Well, at American Water, we don't wait for maximum contaminant level. When the EPA has health advisories, we actually ensure that our systems are consistent with that. So we're already meeting the existing EPA health advisory. We test for it, we check for it before it even becomes an MCL. Now I don't know what that number is for municipalities. I don't know what that number is for the companies. But I think your broader point, which is, as we see this in New Jersey and you see this -- we think that, that will become an issue everywhere. In all of our states, we're starting to see a lot of concern about these contaminants. And as Walter said, when we talk about being a solutions provider, it's not just buying assets and providing hopefully better service when we go in because this is all we do, water and wastewater, but it's also providing critical health solutions for things like emerging contaminants. And also as Walter said in his comments, in states -- some of our states, we're actually seeing the ability for us to go in and replace customer lead service lines even if the lead's not in our pipes because we can do it more cheaply as we're replacing our pipes. So that's the broader story around us being a solutions provider. And I think you're -- what you mentioned is going to be an increasing theme across this country as there's more and more concerns in all the states about these contaminants."

Before I discuss our first quarter earnings results, I would like to talk about Linda Sullivan's retirement. While we made the announcement yesterday, she will remain CFO until July 1, and will stay with us until August 1st, to ensure a smooth transition. This is especially bitter sweet from the -- as Linda and I have been a team. she began her 10-year CFO in early May 2014, when I moved from CFO position to CEO. But our family is growing and in addition to her 2 beautiful grandsons, she met in a presentation in our Investor Day last December, her son and daughter-in-law in California are expecting her first granddaughter in June. We're happy for Linda and in a few minutes she will tell you more about her plans. Her accomplishments in too don't to list that will highlight that from 2014 through 2018, our EPS has grown at an 8% CAGR, an annual dividend have increased at 10.1% CAGR, and our stock price has risen from $46.22 on May 1, 2014, to $107.10 at yesterday's closing. I'm reminded of an executive team meeting in 2014 when we ask each person for his or her top aspiration goals for American Water. Literally Linda said, ""For our stock to go over $100 per share. ""Linda we did it. Linda also oversaw the raising of $4.4 billion of financing capital over the past 5 years. She rebuilt our tax and risk management functions with industry-leading talent, and she has led significant improvement in our supply chain processes. She also designed and developed the financial strategy and planning organization, and she has recently set up digital finance within her organization, one of the first in the utility industry. She has also been very involved in our corporate-wide growth, customer and people initiatives. And she helped us recruit her successor, Susan Hardwick, whom she has known for several years. Many of you also know Susan who served 6 years as CFO of Veteran. She has 35 years of deep finance and regulated utility experience. She most recently led the execution of $8.5 billion veteran sale to Centerpoint energy. Susan is strongly committed to customers, constructive regulatory relationships and building better communities. She prioritizes employee development and building of collaborative and successful teams. She has a strong record of living and reading their values we have at American Water and is a tremendous fit for our company. She will join our company on June 3, as Executive Vice President of Finance until she takes the CFO rank from Linda on July 1st. She is actually here in the room with us today. Linda, would you like to say a few words?"

I have learned more from you in the last 5 years that in my entire career, and I thank you immensely.

And being part of the American Water team, turned out to be the best career decision of my life, and I would not create this experience for anything in the world. And to our analysts and investors, I want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the American Water story and listen to your insight and view. You were truly the grand teacher and thought leaders of our industry. It has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you. So now after 30 years in the utility industry, this decision to retire is the hardest career decision I have made, and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family. It's hard because I love everything about American Water, the leadership team, my colleagues, my team, the board and our collective ability to do what we say we are going to do. I believe American Water is the best run utility in the nation and with our announcement today bringing Susan Hardwick on board, I am confident it will continue to be just that. Personally, this is an easy decision for me. My coast-to-coast family is rapidly expanding with two grandsons and a granddaughter due in June. And I'm fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull up my heart. And it's really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel, but there is a song lyric and it's by Andy Grammar that's sums it up pretty well. It says ""I think I finally found my [indiscernible]. So I also love the work I do on several boards and am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion, plasma marketplace is approaching the size of a novel and my husband, Tom and I, learn to those just to get our like to thank leadership team and board for being so understanding and gracious about my decision and working with me through a strong succession plan.

Unfortunately, our COO, Walter Lynch is in Arkansas due to the passing of his father in law, and Alex. Many of you know that Walter is a West Point graduate Army and Main Street also serve our country in the Army. At 80 years old, he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years. We applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold ther e American Water. Integrity, service and unwavering commitment to his community and country. So now moving onto our first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low-risk and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2018. As a reminder, we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13.5% EPS increase from the previous year primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the Pennsylvania and the Missouri General rate cases in 2018, which Linda will discuss in more detail. While American Water does not give quarterly guidance, our first quarter results were $0.01 ahead of plan for the quarter. Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate through 2023. Also consistent with our previous dividend guidance on April 17, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payments from $0.455 to $0.50 per share, a 9.9% increase. The company has increased its dividend every year fits our IPO in April of 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10% per year since 2013. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investments we make in our Regulated Operations, so that we can provide clean, safe and reliable service. We invested $337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvement in our Regulated Businesses. We minimized the customer bill impact for these investments through our continued focus on controlling O&M cost. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement, constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from both our employees and our customers. I'll talk more on the next slide about or concerning process on regulated acquisitions and the contributions of our long-term growth story. Earnings were up year-over-year in our Market-Based Businesses. This was due primarily to grow the customer contracts from Homeowner Services. Of note, we have a very successful new partnerships with Philadelphia, where we have added more than 100,000 contracts since we launched the partnership in October 2018. That type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined Homeowner Services has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. Our Military Services Group added the right Paterson Airport Base contract in 2018, and we begin full operations at [indiscernible] Army base yesterday May 1. We still expect to see decisions by the Department of Defense on up to 3 military base awards for which we are competing this year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Let's talk more about growth across our regulated footprints. We have closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states so far in 2019. 3 of these wwere water systems in Kentucky, Indiana and Missouri. And two will wastewater acquisitions in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. These closed acquisitions resulted in 4,700 new customer connections and they joined more than 3,000 customer connections we added a through organic growth in the first quarter. We also look forward to adding another 61,500 customer connections through signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2019. This includes our most recent agreement to acquire East Pasadena water company in California, adding 2,900 new connections. Just as a reminder, typically a customer connection or meter represents on average 2.5 to 3 people based on the specific state. At American Water, we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices, regardless of where they live or socioeconomic status. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. Moving to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As we make these critical investment to maintain a reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We do this by putting a laser focus on both O&M efficiency as well as capital investment efficiency. This is why our 31.5% O&M efficiency goal by 2023 is so important. As a reminder, this ratio represents how many sense of O&M we spend for every dollar revenue. Meaning, we want more dollars to go to investments so we can make our system safer, stronger and more reliable. Our employees live in the communities we serve, and they are committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality water and water services at affordable prices. 
Let me give you just one example of how we're driving further efficiencies. We are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personnel, the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging. So we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points, so there are states operations are more cost effective. When we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get by leveraging our large size and purchasing power, we will save approximately $33 million a year, just on the purchases of meters, hydrants, valves and pipes. Slide 10 summarizes many points I just cover. Again, we're affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth through 2023. We are off to a good start this year, and we look forward to continue to deliver stable and predictable results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda for her comments."

I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter, last year. Included in GAAP ea",1638,"Thank you, Susan. I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter, last year. Included in GAAP earnings was favorable adjustment of $4 million or $0.01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. This reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims costs. In total, our share of the original $126 million Freedom Industries-related settlement has been reduced to $19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims. Excluding this benefit, first quarter earnings were up 3.4%, which came in $0.01 above our plan. On strong market-based earnings offset partially by timing items in the regulated business in parent. Other highlights include achieving consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10% for the 12-month period ended first quarter 2019, executing on our capital investment strategy by investing $337 million during the quarter and adding $36 million in annualized new authorized revenue since the beginning of this year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results. I'll start on the left outside of this page. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter of 2018, up 13.5% over first quarter 2017. On settlement of both the Pennsylvania and Missouri General rate cases last year. First quarter 2019 increased 3.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which reflects some timing impacts that I'll discuss in more detail as I cover each business. Let me start with our Regulated Businesses, which were up $0.01 per share. Revenue was up 8% in total and included increases from authorized rate cases, infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower demand and a $0.02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our Missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customer rate for the lower federal income tax rate until May 28, 2018. Lastly, I should note, we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019. Next, we had higher O&M expense of $0.01 per share from something we are very proud of. To finalization of our union-negotiated national benefits agreement last year, we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plan. This puts our 7,100 employees on the same annual performance plan, where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement. 
So from our CEO to the front line, our goals are aligned. We believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our O&M efficiency goals, allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact of our critically-needed infrastructure investments. Depreciation and interest expense were each up $0.03 per share to support investment growth. Our Market-Based Businesses had a strong quarter up $0.04 or 57% with Homeowner Services up $0.03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer addition. Military services was up a $0.01 from the addition of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and an increase in capital work at Vandenberg. Lastly, the parent decreased $0.03 from 3 separate items, each $0.01 per share. First, we had higher interest expense to support growth, next we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018, and we also had $0.01 of expense timing. 
Turning to Slide 14. I will provide an update on our regulatory proceedings. We settled 2 rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in West Virginia and Maryland and implemented our 3rd-year rate increase under our 4-year plan in New York effective April 1. In West Virginia, we received approval of our -- of an annualized revenue increase of $19 million and ROE of 9.75 and an increase equity ratio to a 48.4%. 
The case was driven by $200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment. This surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In Maryland, we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over $1 million and estimated ROE of 9.9%, and an equity ratio of 48.7%. The case was driven by $18 million of investments since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new 90 million-gallon reservoir and intake near Bel Air Maryland. This new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region. We also have 3 pending rate cases in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our California General rate case. In Indiana, we reached an agreement on -- with the major parties on our rate case. If approved, the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of 7.5 -- $17.5 million over 2 steps, an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.4%. 
The settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 Future Test Year, Indiana American Water will have invested over $500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015. Regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Indiana American Water already reduced customer lead by 4.4% on August 1, 2018, and the agreement includes credit for the period before August 1, to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in May 2020.  A final order rates expected by mid-2019. 
Moving to Virginia. We implemented in term water and wastewater rates on May 1, the general rate case requested in overall increase of $5 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. The final rate order could take several months. In Kentucky, our general rate case requested nearly $20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than $100 million in capital investment since the last rate case in 2016. And yesterday, California American Water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first year of revenue increase of $23.9 million followed by annual step increases that would support of $200 million of infrastructure projects. California is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019. 
Turning to Slide 15. Today, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. This excludes the $0.01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our Freedom Industries-related settlement, which is included in our 2019 GAAP earnings guidance range. Included in our annual guidance range are several variables, with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather. And as a reminder, we consider plus or minus $0.06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range. With the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months or third quarter of each year. On a long-term basis, we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long-term EPS guidance in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth range anchored of 2017 adjusted earnings. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me discuss our balance sheet. As we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform, originally, we expected lower cash flow of about $500 million from 2018 to 2022. This has improved by $120 million following the pivotal acquisition. You can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020, when we expect to become a cash taxpayer, but then declines quickly as rate base growth and becomes positive by 2022. 
Also as we continue to refine our estimates, we are now forecasting becoming a cash taxpayer in the second half of 2020 versus our prior estimate of a full year in 2020. Now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform. Also, I'm pleased to report that our 2018 debt-to-capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59% in 2018, further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management. Incorporating the better 2018 results into our 5-year plan, we have lowered our expected long-term debt-to-cap levels by a full percentage point to a range of 61% to 62% by 2023. And I should note that debt-to-cap ratio include both long-term and short-term debt. In terms of credit rating, earlier this year Moody's downgraded American Water from A3 to BAA1 with a stable outlook. Although, disappointing we expect the expect to be minimum. And as you know, in the second quarter of 2018, S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating with a stable outlook. 
In summary, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we do not see a need to issue new equity with our current 5-year plan under normal operating conditions. 
Turning to Slide 17. We are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value. With our announced increase in dividends of 9.9%, our 5-year compound annual growth rate in dividends is 10.1%, and we have now have consistent annual dividend increases since 2013. Looking forward, we expect to grow our dividend at the top of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range subject to board approval, and we continue to our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steadier 10% for the 12 months period ended March 31, our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9.8%, and we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing UTY index and S&P 500 over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods. Through this disciplined financial management, customers and shareholders maybe be confident that American Water will continue to deliver value. With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

We never forget at American Water that at the end of every waterpipe there is a family depending on the safety of water they give their children. That at every fire hydrant life depend on the water being there at the right pressure. That every wastewater plant, we are a shield between our customers and disease. We're very proud to announce our most recent award from the Water Research Foundation to continue research on Legionella, while Legionella is primarily an issue in customer-owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter. We think it's critical that we further educate and protect our customers for contaminants that could impact of water quality. As a reminder, we've had an R&D group at American Water since 1981, and our newest research grant is 1 of over 100 we on topics ranging from emerging contaminants, to water recycling and reuse, to ground breaking water technologies. We know that employees, customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society, our planet and our community. We believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose of given values culture. I was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent S&P Global ESG evaluation launch. The key topics at the launch of our ESG risk quantification, developing more standardized ESG measures and improving timeliness of reporting. S&P as well as Moody's, have indicated that ESG measures will be an important input into evaluation of risks to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit rating. we're committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you ESG information that you want. But the wide-ranging and nonstandardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparison. Timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we have seen recently are based on data from as far back as 2016 and don't  reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years. We've engaged the leading ESG consulting firms, and they have recently completed a materiality assessment for us. This effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors, credit rating analysts, regulators, customers, elected officials, environmental and ESG activists and our own board members and employees. We will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve. And we look forward to your continuing feedback. In closing, I mentioned earlier about the professional accomplishments of Linda Sullivan over the past 5 years. But I would be if I would didn't end on something even more important for personal influencing impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company. Linda has the highest integrity. She's smart, quick and strategic, and she's always asking how can we get better. She cares deeply about our employees, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. She's been a CFO that I depend on everyday to the fundamentals to the very best. And to look beyond the horizon to what's next week. She treats every single person with respect and dignity. I can honestly say that I've learned something from her every day. She is my colleague, my hero and my friend, and I will miss her tremendously. For those of you who know her well, you understand that this last slide. Linda loves 3 things very much: her family; American Water; and Corvettes. So many of you will see Linda Susan and me [indiscernible] over the next 2 months on investor visits. And while Linda's not returning until August 1, this will be her last earnings call. And in and out of things to come, I will share with you another first for American Water. We are 1 of only 3 S&P 500 companies with a female CEO and CFO team. And on July 1, we'll have the distinction of the only company for both women even have the same first name. Just another way we're going to make things easy for you. So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So I was just kind of hoping maybe you can discuss a little bit about how that could impact our company on a regulated side in terms of the acquisition front? And then on in terms of what it could mean to cost to the companies, since it is going to stricter standards as well. And then on top of that, how could also impact the company in terms of the military business because driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher firm form used on this military bases everyday when they are running. Groups and so I would think that would be something with this P fast contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue O&M contracts with the likes of American Water.

There isn't a regulation. It is not actually a regulated chemical. What it is as they are recommending, not to have over certain limits, but they have the force of regulation behind it. The EPA came out yesterday I read, and basically said they are going to do it. They are looking at the levels that they were using for maximum contamination levels that weren't regulated of 70 parts per trillion. New Jersey, as you mentioned, has come in with a much lower, I believe, 13 parts per trillion. To your point about the company, I mentioned it's interesting you asked this question because I mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our R&D group. We've been doing research on this perfluorinated chemicals for decades. And in fact, and I'll talk about military first and then come back to the regulated business.

We believe from the military installation standpoint is actually a competitive advantage for us. We have treated two levels that are at or below what the New Jersey requirements are, we know how to do that. So this is a serious situation, and if you want to get a nice 4, 5 page premier for those are there who want to know the National Institute of Environmental Health Services has a wonderful 3 or 4 page Premier because some people use, PFOS, PFOAs, they're all part of group of PFCs, called perfluorinated chemicals, and they are all man-made materials and the issue comes in is that they are, as you said, firefighting foam, Teflon. It comes from the even stain masters things that repelled grease and water, and it's been used for decades. And so what is happened as it gets into the water source of the environment, that it just stays -- and is consumed by humans, it just doesn't get released from the body for years and years. And that's where the concern is coming. So this is a very serious issue. We applaud all of the different states as well as the EPA for making this a priority. We actually see this is a very good thing. We are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the PACs and are different states and we really want to be apart and being a solutions provider for those and treat as a strength given all the research and actual deployment we have done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies."

Her accomplishments in too long  to list but I would highlight that from 2014 through 2018, our EPS has grown at an 8% CAGR, our annual dividend have increased at 10.1% CAGR and our stock price has risen from $46.22 on May 1 2014, to $107.10 at yesterday's closing. I'm reminded of an executive team meeting in 2014 when we ask each person for his or her top aspirational goals for American Water. Literally Linda said, ""For our stock to go over $100 per share."" Linda, we did it. 
Linda also oversaw the raising of $4.4 billion of financing capital over the past 5 years. She rebuilt our tax and risk management functions with industry-leading talent. And she has led significant improvements in our supply chain processes. She also designed and developed the financial strategy and planning organization. And she has recently set a digital finance within her organization, one of the first in the utility industry. She has also been very involved in our corporate-wide growth, customer and people initiatives. And she helped us recruit her successor, Susan Hardwick, whom she has known for several years. Many of you also know Susan who served 6 years as CFO of Vectren. She has 35 years of deep finance and regulated utility experience. She most recently led the execution of $8.5 billion Vectren sale to CenterPoint Energy. Susan is strongly committed to customers, constructive regulatory relationships and building better communities. She prioritizes employee development and the building of collaborative and successful teams. She has a strong record of living and leading the values we have at American Water and is a tremendous fit for our company. She will join our company on June 3, as Executive Vice President of Finance until she takes the CFO rank from Linda on July 1. She's actually here in the room with us today. Linda, would you like to say a few words?"

I have learned more from you in the last 5 years than in my entire career, and I thank you immensely. My husband and I took the road bus travel when we moved from California to New Jersey 5 years ago. And being part of the American Water team, turned out to be the best career decision of my life, and I would not trade this experience for anything in the world. And to our analysts and investors, I want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the American Water story and listen to your insights and views. You were truly the grand teachers and thought leaders of our industry. It has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you. So now after 30 years in the utility industry, this decision to retire is the hardest career decision I have made and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family. It's hard because I love everything about American Water, the leadership team, my colleagues, my team, the Board and our collective ability to do what we say we're going to do. I believe American Water is the best-run utility in the nation and with our announcement today, bringing Susan Hardwick on board, I am confident it will continue to be just that. 
Personally, this is an easy decision for me. My coast-to-coast family is rapidly expanding with 2 grandsons and a granddaughter due in June. And I'm fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull of my heart. And it's really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel, but there is a song lyric and it's by Andy Grammar that's sums it up pretty well. It says, ""I think I finally found my hallelujah"". So I also love the work I do on several boards and am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion, plus my bucket size is approaching the size of a novel and my husband, Tom, and I look forward to living those dreams. I would like to thank the leadership team and Board for being so understanding and gracious about my decisions and working with me through a strong succession plan. I'm thrilled to have Susan Hardwick join the team. She will bring tremendous value to American Water."

Unfortunately, our COO, Walter Lynch is in Arkansas due to the passing of his father-in-law, Alex Street. Many of you know that Walter is a West Point Graduate and an Army veteran and Mr. Street also served our country in the Army. At 80 years old, he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years. We applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold dear at American Water: integrity; service; and unwavering commitment to his community and country. 
So now moving onto our first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low-risk and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2018. As a reminder, we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13.5% EPS increase from the previous year primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the Pennsylvania and the Missouri General rate cases in 2018, which Linda will discuss in more detail. While American Water does not give quarterly guidance, our first quarter results were $0.01 ahead of plan for the quarter. Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate through 2023. 
Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance on April 17, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.455 to $0.50 per share, a 9.9% increase. The company has increased its dividend every year since our IPO in April of 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10% per year since 2013. 
The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations, so that we can provide clean, safe and reliable service. We invested $337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvements in our Regulated Businesses. We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement, constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from both our employees and our customers. I'll talk more on the next slide about our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. Earnings were up year-over-year in our Market-Based Businesses. This was due primarily to growth customer contracts from Homeowner Services. Of note, we have a very successful new partnerships with Philadelphia, where we have added more than 100,000 contracts since we launched the partnership in October of 2018. That type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined Homeowner Services has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. 
Our Military Services Group added the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base contract in 2018, and we begin full operations at Fort Leonard Wood Army base yesterday, May 1. We still expect to see decisions by the Department of Defense on up to 3 military base awards for which we are competing this year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Let's talk more about growth across our regulated footprints. We have closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states so far in 2019. 3 of these were water systems in Kentucky, Indiana and Missouri. And 2 were wastewater acquisitions in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. These closed acquisitions resulted in 4,700 new customer connections and they join more than 3,000 customer connections we added through organic growth in the first quarter. We also look forward to adding another 61,500 customer connections through signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2019. This includes our most recent agreement to acquire East Pasadena water company in California, adding 2,900 new connections. 
Just as a reminder, typically a customer connection or meter represents, on average, 2.5 to 3 people based on the specific state. At American Water, we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. 
Moving to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We do this by putting a laser focus on both O&M efficiency as well as capital-investment efficiency. This is why our 31.5% O&M efficiency goal by 2023 is so important. As a reminder, this ratio represents how many cents of O&M we spend for every dollar of revenue. Meaning, we want more dollars to go to investment so we can make our system safer, stronger and more reliable. Our employees live in the communities we serve, and they're committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality of water and water services at affordable prices. 
Let me give you just 1 example of how we're driving further efficiencies. We are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personnel, the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging. So we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points, so their states operations are more cost effective. When we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get, by leveraging our large size and purchasing power, we will save approximately $33 million a year, just on the purchases of meters, hydrants, valves and pipes. 
Slide 10 summarizes many points I just covered. Again, we're affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth through 2023. We are off to a good start this year and we look forward to continuing to deliver stable and predictable results. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda for her comments."
250885,608652476,1717186,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan. I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter last year. Included in GAAP e",1646,"Thank you, Susan. 
I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter last year. Included in GAAP earnings was a favorable adjustment of $4 million or $0.01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. This reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims costs. In total, our share of the original $126 million Freedom Industries-related settlement has been reduced to $19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims. Excluding this  ] benefit, first quarter earnings were up 3.4%, which came in $0.01 above our plan. Our strong market-based earnings offset partially by timing items in the Regulated Business in parent. 
Other highlights include achieving a consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10% for the 12-month period ended first quarter 2019, executing on our capital investment strategy by investing $337 million during the quarter and adding $36 million in annualized new, authorized revenue since the beginning of this year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results. I'll start on the left hand side of this page. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter of 2018, up 13.5% over first quarter 2017. On settlement of both the Pennsylvania and Missouri General rate cases last year. First quarter 2019 increased 3.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which reflects some timing impacts that I will discuss in more detail as I cover each business. 
Let me start with our Regulated Businesses, which were up $0.01 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 in total and included increases from authorized rate cases, infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower demand and a $0.02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our Missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customer rates for the lower federal income tax rate until May 28 2018. 
Lastly, I should note, we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019. Next, we had higher O&M expense of $0.01 per share from something we are very proud of. For finalization of our union-negotiated national benefits agreement last year, we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plans. This puts our 7,100 employees on the same annual performance plan, where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement. 
So from our CEO to the front line, our goals are aligned. We believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our O&M efficiency goals, allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact at our critically-needed infrastructure investments. 
Depreciation and interest expense were each up $0.03 per share to support investment growth. Our Market-Based Businesses had a strong quarter, up $0.04 or 57% with Homeowner Services up $0.03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer additions. 
Military services was up a $0.01 from the addition of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and an increase in capital work at Vandenberg. 
Lastly, the parent decreased $0.03 from 3 separate items, each $0.01 per share. First, we had higher interest expense to support growth, next we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018 and we also had $0.01 of expense timing. 
Turning to Slide 14. I will provide an update on our regulatory proceedings. We settled 2 rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in West Virginia and Maryland and implemented our 3-year rate increase under our 4-year plan in New York effective April 1. In West Virginia, we received approval of our -- of an annualized revenue increase of $19 million, an ROE of 9.75 and an increased equity ratio to a 48.4%. 
The case was driven by $200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment. This surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In Maryland, we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over $1 million, an estimated ROE of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 48.7%. The case was driven by $18 million of investments since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new 90 million-gallon reservoir and intake near Bel Air, Maryland. This new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region. 
We also have 3 pending rate cases in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our California General rate case. In Indiana, we reached an agreement on the -- with the major parties on our rate case. If approved, the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of $7.5 million -- $17.5 million over 2 steps, an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.4%. 
The settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 Future Test Year, Indiana American Water will have invested over $500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015. 
Regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Indiana American Water already reduced its customer rates by 4.4% on August 1 2018. And the agreement includes credit for the period before August 1, to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in May 2020.  A final order is expected by mid-2019. 
Moving to Virginia. We implemented interim water and wastewater rates on May 1, the general rate case requested an overall increase of $5 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April of 2017. The final rate order could take several months. 
In Kentucky, our general rate case requested nearly $20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than $100 million in capital investment since the last rate case in 2016. 
And yesterday, California American Water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first-year  revenue increase of $23.9 million followed by annual step increases that would support $200 million of infrastructure projects. California is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019. 
Turning to Slide 15. Today, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. This excludes the $0.01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our Freedom Industries-related settlement, which is included in our 2019 GAAP earnings guidance range. Included in our annual guidance range are several variables, with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather. And as a reminder, we consider plus or minus $0.06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range. With the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months or third quarter of each year. On a long-term basis, we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long-term EPS guidance in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth range, anchored off 2017 adjusted earnings. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me discuss our balance sheet. As we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform, originally, we expected lower cash flow of about $500 million from 2018 through 2022. This has improved by $120 million following the pivotal acquisition. You can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020 when we expect to become a cash taxpayer, but then declines quickly as rate base grows and becomes positive by 2022. 
Also, as we continue to refine our estimates, we are now forecasting becoming a cash taxpayer in the second half of 2020 versus our prior estimate at a full year in 2020. Now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform. 
Also, I am pleased to report that our 2018 debt-to-capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59% in 2018, further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management. Incorporating the better 2018 results into our 5-year plan, we have lowered our expected long-term, debt-to-cap levels by a full percentage point, to a range of 61% to 62% by 2023. And I should note that debt-to-cap ratio includes both long-term and short-term debt. In terms of credit ratings, earlier this year Moody's downgraded American Water from AAA to BAA1 with a stable outlook. Although, disappointing we expect the expect to be minimum. And as you know, in the second quarter of 2018, S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating with a stable outlook. 
In summary, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we do not see the need to issue new equity with our current 5-year plan under normal operating conditions. 
Turning to Slide 17. We are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value. With our announced increase in dividends of 9.9%, our 5-year compound annual growth rate in dividends is 10.1%. And we have now have had consistent annual dividend increases since 2013. Looking forward, we expect to grow our dividend at the top end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range, subject to board approval. And we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steady at 10% for the 12-months period ended March 31. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9.8%. And we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing the UTY index and S&P 500 over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods. Through this disciplined financial management, customers and shareholders may be confident that American Water will continue to deliver value. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

We never forget at American Water that at the end of every waterpipe there is a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children. That at every fire hydrant, life depends on the water being there at the right pressure. That at every wastewater plant, we are a shield between our customers and disease. We're very proud to announce our most recent award from the Water Research Foundation to continue research on Legionella, while Legionella is primarily an issue in customer-owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter, we think it's critical that we further educate and protect our customers for contaminants that could impact their water quality. As a reminder, we've had an R&D group at American Water since 1981, and our newest research grant is one of over 100 we've received on topics ranging from emerging contaminants, to water recycling and reuse, to ground-breaking water technologies. We know that employees, customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society, our planet and our communities. We believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose-driven values culture. 
I was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent S&P Global ESG evaluation launch. The key topics at the launch were ESG risk quantification, developing more standardized ESG measures and improving timeliness of reporting. S&P as well as Moody's, have indicated that ESG measures will be an important input into evaluation of risk to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit ratings. We're committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you the ESG information that you want. But the wide ranging and nonstandardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparisons. Timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we've seen recently are based on data from as far back as 2016 and don't  reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years. We've engaged a leading ESG consulting firm and they've recently completed a materiality assessment for us. This effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors, credit-rating analysts, regulators, customers, elected officials, environmental and ESG activists and our own Board members and employees. We will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve. And we look forward to your continuing feedback. 
In closing, I mentioned earlier about the professional accomplishments of Linda Sullivan over the past 5 years. But I would be remorse if would didn't end on something even more important for personal influence and impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company. Linda has the highest integrity. She's smart, quick and strategic. And she's always asking how can we get better. She cares deeply about our employees, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. She's been a CFO that I depend on everyday to do  the fundamentals very best. And to look beyond the horizon to what's next week. She treats every single person with respect and dignity. I can honestly say that I have learned something from her every day. She is my colleague, my hero and my friend, and I will miss her tremendously. For those of you who know her well, you understand that this last slide. Linda loves 3 things very much: her family; American Water; and Corvettes. So many of you will see Linda, Susan and me with Ed and Ralph over the next 2 months on investor visits. And while Linda's not returning until August 1, this will be her last earnings call. And in and out of things to come, I will share with you another first for American Water, we are 1 of only 3 S&P 500 companies with a female CEO and CFO team. And on July 1, we will have the distinction as the only company for both women even have the same first name. Just another way we're trying to make things easy for you. 
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

Last month, we sold a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection announced that it has plan to set standards for the PFOS contamination. And they're much more strict than the EPA's guidelines. And it appears other states are going to implement similar standard as well. So I was just, kind of, hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the company on a regulated side in terms of the acquisition front? And then on -- in terms of what it could mean to cost to the companies, since it'll -- it's going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well. And then on top of that, how it could also impact the company in terms of the military business because driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher firm -- foam used on this military bases everyday when they are running their drills. And so I would think that, that would be something with this -- PFOS contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue O&M contracts with the likes of American Water. So I just wondered if you could give us some high-level color on how this PFOS contamination could impact the company?"

This is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country. Those from states that are doing their own limits P5 as well as -- EPA actually, yesterday came out from -- what most people don't understand, while the EPA has a recommended maximum contaminant level, there really isn't a regulation. It is not actually a regulated chemical. What it is, is they're recommending not to have over certain limits, but they don't have the force of regulation behind it. The EPA came out yesterday I read, and basically said they are going to do it. They are looking at the levels that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren't regulated of 70 parts per trillion. New Jersey, as you mentioned, has come in with a much lower, I believe, 13 parts per trillion. To your point about the company, I mentioned it's interesting you asked this question because I mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our R&D group. We've been doing research on these perfluorinated chemicals for decades. And in fact, and I'll talk about military first, then I'll come back to the regulated business. We have actually already been working on a couple or 3 of our  military basis to actually treat P5. We have mobile units, where we can actually do on-site decontamination and, for example, at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, we've done tremendous work already with a couple of wells there that we serve. It -- we believe from the military installation standpoint, it's actually a competitive advantage for us. We have treated 2 levels that are at or below what the New Jersey requirements are, we know how to do that. So this is a serious situation, and if you want to get a nice 4, 5 page premier for those are there who want to know, the National Institute of Environmental Health Services has a wonderful 3 or 4 page premier because some people use, PFOS, PFOAs, they're all part of group of PFCs, called perfluorinated chemicals. And they are all man-made materials and the issue comes in is that they are, as you said, firefighting foam, Teflon. It comes from even Stainmaster, things that repel grease and water and it's been used for decades. And so what is happened is, as it gets into the water source of the environment, that it just stays -- and it's consumed by humans, it just doesn't get released from the body for years and years. And that's where the concern is coming. So this is a very serious issue. We applaud all of the different states as well as the EPA for making this a priority. We actually see this is a very good thing. We are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the PFCs and our different states and we really want to be part of being a solutions provider for those and see it as a strength, given all the research and actual deployment we've done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies."

Before I discuss our first quarter earnings results, I'd like to talk about Linda Sullivan's retirement. While we made the announcement yesterday, she will remain CFO until July 1, and will stay with us until August 1, to ensure a smooth transition. This is especially bitter sweet for me, as Linda and I have been a team since she began her tenure as CFO in early May 2014, when I moved from the CFO position to CEO. But her family is growing and in addition to her 2 beautiful grandsons you met in a presentation at our Investor Day last December, her son and daughter-in-law in California are expecting her first granddaughter in June. We're happy for Linda and in a few minutes she will tell you more about her plans. 
Her accomplishments in too long  to list but I would highlight that from 2014 through 2018, our EPS has grown at an 8% CAGR, our annual dividend have increased at 10.1% CAGR and our stock price has risen from $46.22 on May 1 2014, to $107.10 at yesterday's closing. I'm reminded of an executive team meeting in 2014 when we ask each person for his or her top aspirational goals for American Water. Literally Linda said, ""For our stock to go over $100 per share."" Linda, we did it. 
Linda also oversaw the raising of $4.4 billion of financing capital over the past 5 years. She rebuilt our tax and risk management functions with industry-leading talent. And she has led significant improvements in our supply chain processes. She also designed and developed the financial strategy and planning organization. And she has recently set a digital finance within her organization, one of the first in the utility industry. She has also been very involved in our corporate-wide growth, customer and people initiatives. And she helped us recruit her successor, Susan Hardwick, whom she has known for several years. Many of you also know Susan who served 6 years as CFO of Vectren. She has 35 years of deep finance and regulated utility experience. She most recently led the execution of $8.5 billion Vectren sale to CenterPoint Energy. Susan is strongly committed to customers, constructive regulatory relationships and building better communities. She prioritizes employee development and the building of collaborative and successful teams. She has a strong record of living and leading the values we have at American Water and is a tremendous fit for our company. She will join our company on June 3, as Executive Vice President of Finance until she takes the CFO rank from Linda on July 1. She's actually here in the room with us today. Linda, would you like to say a few words?"

I have learned more from you in the last 5 years than in my entire career, and I thank you immensely. My husband and I took the road bus travel when we moved from California to New Jersey 5 years ago. And being part of the American Water team, turned out to be the best career decision of my life, and I would not trade this experience for anything in the world. And to our analysts and investors, I want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the American Water story and listen to your insights and views. You were truly the grand teachers and thought leaders of our industry. It has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you. So now after 30 years in the utility industry, this decision to retire is the hardest career decision I have made and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family. It's hard because I love everything about American Water, the leadership team, my colleagues, my team, the Board and our collective ability to do what we say we're going to do. I believe American Water is the best-run utility in the nation and with our announcement today, bringing Susan Hardwick on board, I am confident it will continue to be just that. 
Personally, this is an easy decision for me. My coast-to-coast family is rapidly expanding with 2 grandsons and a granddaughter due in June. And I'm fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull of my heart. And it's really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel, but there is a song lyric and it's by Andy Grammar that's sums it up pretty well. It says, ""I think I finally found my hallelujah"". So I also love the work I do on several boards and am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion, plus my bucket size is approaching the size of a novel and my husband, Tom, and I look forward to living those dreams. I would like to thank the leadership team and Board for being so understanding and gracious about my decisions and working with me through a strong succession plan. I'm thrilled to have Susan Hardwick join the team. She will bring tremendous value to American Water."

Unfortunately, our COO, Walter Lynch is in Arkansas due to the passing of his father-in-law, Alex Street. Many of you know that Walter is a West Point Graduate and an Army veteran and Mr. Street also served our country in the Army. At 80 years old, he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years. We applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold dear at American Water: integrity; service; and unwavering commitment to his community and country. 
So now moving onto our first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low-risk and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2018. As a reminder, we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13.5% EPS increase from the previous year primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the Pennsylvania and the Missouri General rate cases in 2018, which Linda will discuss in more detail. While American Water does not give quarterly guidance, our first quarter results were $0.01 ahead of plan for the quarter. Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate through 2023. 
Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance on April 17, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.455 to $0.50 per share, a 9.9% increase. The company has increased its dividend every year since our IPO in April of 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10% per year since 2013. 
The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations, so that we can provide clean, safe and reliable service. We invested $337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvements in our Regulated Businesses. We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement, constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from both our employees and our customers. I'll talk more on the next slide about our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. Earnings were up year-over-year in our Market-Based Businesses. This was due primarily to growth customer contracts from Homeowner Services. Of note, we have a very successful new partnerships with Philadelphia, where we have added more than 100,000 contracts since we launched the partnership in October of 2018. That type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined Homeowner Services has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. 
Our Military Services Group added the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base contract in 2018, and we begin full operations at Fort Leonard Wood Army base yesterday, May 1. We still expect to see decisions by the Department of Defense on up to 3 military base awards for which we are competing this year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Let's talk more about growth across our regulated footprints. We have closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states so far in 2019. 3 of these were water systems in Kentucky, Indiana and Missouri. And 2 were wastewater acquisitions in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. These closed acquisitions resulted in 4,700 new customer connections and they join more than 3,000 customer connections we added through organic growth in the first quarter. We also look forward to adding another 61,500 customer connections through signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2019. This includes our most recent agreement to acquire East Pasadena water company in California, adding 2,900 new connections. 
Just as a reminder, typically a customer connection or meter represents, on average, 2.5 to 3 people based on the specific state. At American Water, we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. 
Moving to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We do this by putting a laser focus on both O&M efficiency as well as capital-investment efficiency. This is why our 31.5% O&M efficiency goal by 2023 is so important. As a reminder, this ratio represents how many cents of O&M we spend for every dollar of revenue. Meaning, we want more dollars to go to investment so we can make our system safer, stronger and more reliable. Our employees live in the communities we serve, and they're committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality of water and water services at affordable prices. 
Let me give you just 1 example of how we're driving further efficiencies. We are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personnel, the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging. So we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points, so their states operations are more cost effective. When we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get, by leveraging our large size and purchasing power, we will save approximately $33 million a year, just on the purchases of meters, hydrants, valves and pipes. 
Slide 10 summarizes many points I just covered. Again, we're affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth through 2023. We are off to a good start this year and we look forward to continuing to deliver stable and predictable results. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda for her comments."
250885,608652476,1717825,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan. I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter last year. Included in GAAP e",1646,"Thank you, Susan. 
I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter last year. Included in GAAP earnings was a favorable adjustment of $4 million or $0.01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. This reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims costs. In total, our share of the original $126 million Freedom Industries-related settlement has been reduced to $19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims. Excluding this  ] benefit, first quarter earnings were up 3.4%, which came in $0.01 above our plan. Our strong market-based earnings offset partially by timing items in the Regulated Business in parent. 
Other highlights include achieving a consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10% for the 12-month period ended first quarter 2019, executing on our capital investment strategy by investing $337 million during the quarter and adding $36 million in annualized new, authorized revenue since the beginning of this year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results. I'll start on the left hand side of this page. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter of 2018, up 13.5% over first quarter 2017. On settlement of both the Pennsylvania and Missouri General rate cases last year. First quarter 2019 increased 3.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which reflects some timing impacts that I will discuss in more detail as I cover each business. 
Let me start with our Regulated Businesses, which were up $0.01 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 in total and included increases from authorized rate cases, infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower demand and a $0.02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our Missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customer rates for the lower federal income tax rate until May 28 2018. 
Lastly, I should note, we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019. Next, we had higher O&M expense of $0.01 per share from something we are very proud of. For finalization of our union-negotiated national benefits agreement last year, we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plans. This puts our 7,100 employees on the same annual performance plan, where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement. 
So from our CEO to the front line, our goals are aligned. We believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our O&M efficiency goals, allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact at our critically-needed infrastructure investments. 
Depreciation and interest expense were each up $0.03 per share to support investment growth. Our Market-Based Businesses had a strong quarter, up $0.04 or 57% with Homeowner Services up $0.03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer additions. 
Military services was up a $0.01 from the addition of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and an increase in capital work at Vandenberg. 
Lastly, the parent decreased $0.03 from 3 separate items, each $0.01 per share. First, we had higher interest expense to support growth, next we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018 and we also had $0.01 of expense timing. 
Turning to Slide 14. I will provide an update on our regulatory proceedings. We settled 2 rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in West Virginia and Maryland and implemented our 3-year rate increase under our 4-year plan in New York effective April 1. In West Virginia, we received approval of our -- of an annualized revenue increase of $19 million, an ROE of 9.75 and an increased equity ratio to a 48.4%. 
The case was driven by $200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment. This surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In Maryland, we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over $1 million, an estimated ROE of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 48.7%. The case was driven by $18 million of investments since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new 90 million-gallon reservoir and intake near Bel Air, Maryland. This new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region. 
We also have 3 pending rate cases in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our California General rate case. In Indiana, we reached an agreement on the -- with the major parties on our rate case. If approved, the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of $7.5 million -- $17.5 million over 2 steps, an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.4%. 
The settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 Future Test Year, Indiana American Water will have invested over $500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015. 
Regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Indiana American Water already reduced its customer rates by 4.4% on August 1 2018. And the agreement includes credit for the period before August 1, to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in May 2020.  A final order is expected by mid-2019. 
Moving to Virginia. We implemented interim water and wastewater rates on May 1, the general rate case requested an overall increase of $5 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April of 2017. The final rate order could take several months. 
In Kentucky, our general rate case requested nearly $20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than $100 million in capital investment since the last rate case in 2016. 
And yesterday, California American Water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first-year  revenue increase of $23.9 million followed by annual step increases that would support $200 million of infrastructure projects. California is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019. 
Turning to Slide 15. Today, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. This excludes the $0.01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our Freedom Industries-related settlement, which is included in our 2019 GAAP earnings guidance range. Included in our annual guidance range are several variables, with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather. And as a reminder, we consider plus or minus $0.06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range. With the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months or third quarter of each year. On a long-term basis, we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long-term EPS guidance in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth range, anchored off 2017 adjusted earnings. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me discuss our balance sheet. As we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform, originally, we expected lower cash flow of about $500 million from 2018 through 2022. This has improved by $120 million following the pivotal acquisition. You can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020 when we expect to become a cash taxpayer, but then declines quickly as rate base grows and becomes positive by 2022. 
Also, as we continue to refine our estimates, we are now forecasting becoming a cash taxpayer in the second half of 2020 versus our prior estimate at a full year in 2020. Now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform. 
Also, I am pleased to report that our 2018 debt-to-capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59% in 2018, further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management. Incorporating the better 2018 results into our 5-year plan, we have lowered our expected long-term, debt-to-cap levels by a full percentage point, to a range of 61% to 62% by 2023. And I should note that debt-to-cap ratio includes both long-term and short-term debt. In terms of credit ratings, earlier this year Moody's downgraded American Water from AAA to BAA1 with a stable outlook. Although, disappointing we expect the expect to be minimum. And as you know, in the second quarter of 2018, S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating with a stable outlook. 
In summary, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we do not see the need to issue new equity with our current 5-year plan under normal operating conditions. 
Turning to Slide 17. We are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value. With our announced increase in dividends of 9.9%, our 5-year compound annual growth rate in dividends is 10.1%. And we have now have had consistent annual dividend increases since 2013. Looking forward, we expect to grow our dividend at the top end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range, subject to board approval. And we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steady at 10% for the 12-months period ended March 31. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9.8%. And we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing the UTY index and S&P 500 over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods. Through this disciplined financial management, customers and shareholders may be confident that American Water will continue to deliver value. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

We never forget at American Water that at the end of every waterpipe there is a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children. That at every fire hydrant, life depends on the water being there at the right pressure. That at every wastewater plant, we are a shield between our customers and disease. We're very proud to announce our most recent award from the Water Research Foundation to continue research on Legionella, while Legionella is primarily an issue in customer-owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter, we think it's critical that we further educate and protect our customers for contaminants that could impact their water quality. As a reminder, we've had an R&D group at American Water since 1981, and our newest research grant is one of over 100 we've received on topics ranging from emerging contaminants, to water recycling and reuse, to ground-breaking water technologies. We know that employees, customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society, our planet and our communities. We believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose-driven values culture. 
I was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent S&P Global ESG evaluation launch. The key topics at the launch were ESG risk quantification, developing more standardized ESG measures and improving timeliness of reporting. S&P as well as Moody's, have indicated that ESG measures will be an important input into evaluation of risk to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit ratings. We're committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you the ESG information that you want. But the wide ranging and nonstandardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparisons. Timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we've seen recently are based on data from as far back as 2016 and don't  reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years. We've engaged a leading ESG consulting firm and they've recently completed a materiality assessment for us. This effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors, credit-rating analysts, regulators, customers, elected officials, environmental and ESG activists and our own Board members and employees. We will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve. And we look forward to your continuing feedback. 
In closing, I mentioned earlier about the professional accomplishments of Linda Sullivan over the past 5 years. But I would be remorse if would didn't end on something even more important for personal influence and impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company. Linda has the highest integrity. She's smart, quick and strategic. And she's always asking how can we get better. She cares deeply about our employees, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. She's been a CFO that I depend on everyday to do  the fundamentals very best. And to look beyond the horizon to what's next week. She treats every single person with respect and dignity. I can honestly say that I have learned something from her every day. She is my colleague, my hero and my friend, and I will miss her tremendously. For those of you who know her well, you understand that this last slide. Linda loves 3 things very much: her family; American Water; and Corvettes. So many of you will see Linda, Susan and me with Ed and Ralph over the next 2 months on investor visits. And while Linda's not returning until August 1, this will be her last earnings call. And in and out of things to come, I will share with you another first for American Water, we are 1 of only 3 S&P 500 companies with a female CEO and CFO team. And on July 1, we will have the distinction as the only company for both women even have the same first name. Just another way we're trying to make things easy for you. 
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

For us, it was more business as usual. So we are just now starting to see some of the certifications coming in. It's our understanding that there may be 1 or 2, I think, a university that may be looking at consolidating those type of certifications and looking where different systems stand in the state.

Last month, we sold a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection announced that it has plan to set standards for the PFOS contamination. And they're much more strict than the EPA's guidelines. And it appears other states are going to implement similar standard as well. So I was just, kind of, hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the company on a regulated side in terms of the acquisition front? And then on -- in terms of what it could mean to cost to the companies, since it'll -- it's going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well. And then on top of that, how it could also impact the company in terms of the military business because driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher firm -- foam used on this military bases everyday when they are running their drills. And so I would think that, that would be something with this -- PFOS contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue O&M contracts with the likes of American Water. So I just wondered if you could give us some high-level color on how this PFOS contamination could impact the company?"

This is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country. Those from states that are doing their own limits P5 as well as -- EPA actually, yesterday came out from -- what most people don't understand, while the EPA has a recommended maximum contaminant level, there really isn't a regulation. It is not actually a regulated chemical. What it is, is they're recommending not to have over certain limits, but they don't have the force of regulation behind it. The EPA came out yesterday I read, and basically said they are going to do it. They are looking at the levels that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren't regulated of 70 parts per trillion. New Jersey, as you mentioned, has come in with a much lower, I believe, 13 parts per trillion. To your point about the company, I mentioned it's interesting you asked this question because I mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our R&D group. We've been doing research on these perfluorinated chemicals for decades. And in fact, and I'll talk about military first, then I'll come back to the regulated business. We have actually already been working on a couple or 3 of our  military basis to actually treat P5. We have mobile units, where we can actually do on-site decontamination and, for example, at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, we've done tremendous work already with a couple of wells there that we serve. It -- we believe from the military installation standpoint, it's actually a competitive advantage for us. We have treated 2 levels that are at or below what the New Jersey requirements are, we know how to do that. So this is a serious situation, and if you want to get a nice 4, 5 page premier for those are there who want to know, the National Institute of Environmental Health Services has a wonderful 3 or 4 page premier because some people use, PFOS, PFOAs, they're all part of group of PFCs, called perfluorinated chemicals. And they are all man-made materials and the issue comes in is that they are, as you said, firefighting foam, Teflon. It comes from even Stainmaster, things that repel grease and water and it's been used for decades. And so what is happened is, as it gets into the water source of the environment, that it just stays -- and it's consumed by humans, it just doesn't get released from the body for years and years. And that's where the concern is coming. So this is a very serious issue. We applaud all of the different states as well as the EPA for making this a priority. We actually see this is a very good thing. We are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the PFCs and our different states and we really want to be part of being a solutions provider for those and see it as a strength, given all the research and actual deployment we've done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies."

And we have been in West Virginia since the 1880s. And the last 2 rate cases outcomes we've had, including a settlement, I mean, this was a settlement [ reach ] with all parties. We're very constructive because in West Virginia there is a realization, maybe as much as any other state about the importance of clean water and safe water. And it's not just an issue for American Water, the public providers of water there and wastewater services see this same thing. So we have some wonderful employees in West Virginia. We have some outstanding customers in West Virginia, and we're are very excited that there is a growing realization from all of the parties, the stakeholders as well as the regulatory commission about the importance of investment for the future to ensure that, that state can continue to grow economically and have a safe water, wastewater and fire protection system for its citizens."

Before I discuss our first quarter earnings results, I'd like to talk about Linda Sullivan's retirement. While we made the announcement yesterday, she will remain CFO until July 1, and will stay with us until August 1, to ensure a smooth transition. This is especially bitter sweet for me, as Linda and I have been a team since she began her tenure as CFO in early May 2014, when I moved from the CFO position to CEO. But her family is growing and in addition to her 2 beautiful grandsons you met in a presentation at our Investor Day last December, her son and daughter-in-law in California are expecting her first granddaughter in June. We're happy for Linda and in a few minutes she will tell you more about her plans. 
Her accomplishments in too long  to list but I would highlight that from 2014 through 2018, our EPS has grown at an 8% CAGR, our annual dividend have increased at 10.1% CAGR and our stock price has risen from $46.22 on May 1 2014, to $107.10 at yesterday's closing. I'm reminded of an executive team meeting in 2014 when we ask each person for his or her top aspirational goals for American Water. Literally Linda said, ""For our stock to go over $100 per share."" Linda, we did it. 
Linda also oversaw the raising of $4.4 billion of financing capital over the past 5 years. She rebuilt our tax and risk management functions with industry-leading talent. And she has led significant improvements in our supply chain processes. She also designed and developed the financial strategy and planning organization. And she has recently set a digital finance within her organization, one of the first in the utility industry. She has also been very involved in our corporate-wide growth, customer and people initiatives. And she helped us recruit her successor, Susan Hardwick, whom she has known for several years. Many of you also know Susan who served 6 years as CFO of Vectren. She has 35 years of deep finance and regulated utility experience. She most recently led the execution of $8.5 billion Vectren sale to CenterPoint Energy. Susan is strongly committed to customers, constructive regulatory relationships and building better communities. She prioritizes employee development and the building of collaborative and successful teams. She has a strong record of living and leading the values we have at American Water and is a tremendous fit for our company. She will join our company on June 3, as Executive Vice President of Finance until she takes the CFO rank from Linda on July 1. She's actually here in the room with us today. Linda, would you like to say a few words?"

I have learned more from you in the last 5 years than in my entire career, and I thank you immensely. My husband and I took the road bus travel when we moved from California to New Jersey 5 years ago. And being part of the American Water team, turned out to be the best career decision of my life, and I would not trade this experience for anything in the world. And to our analysts and investors, I want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the American Water story and listen to your insights and views. You were truly the grand teachers and thought leaders of our industry. It has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you. So now after 30 years in the utility industry, this decision to retire is the hardest career decision I have made and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family. It's hard because I love everything about American Water, the leadership team, my colleagues, my team, the Board and our collective ability to do what we say we're going to do. I believe American Water is the best-run utility in the nation and with our announcement today, bringing Susan Hardwick on board, I am confident it will continue to be just that. 
Personally, this is an easy decision for me. My coast-to-coast family is rapidly expanding with 2 grandsons and a granddaughter due in June. And I'm fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull of my heart. And it's really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel, but there is a song lyric and it's by Andy Grammar that's sums it up pretty well. It says, ""I think I finally found my hallelujah"". So I also love the work I do on several boards and am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion, plus my bucket size is approaching the size of a novel and my husband, Tom, and I look forward to living those dreams. I would like to thank the leadership team and Board for being so understanding and gracious about my decisions and working with me through a strong succession plan. I'm thrilled to have Susan Hardwick join the team. She will bring tremendous value to American Water."

Unfortunately, our COO, Walter Lynch is in Arkansas due to the passing of his father-in-law, Alex Street. Many of you know that Walter is a West Point Graduate and an Army veteran and Mr. Street also served our country in the Army. At 80 years old, he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years. We applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold dear at American Water: integrity; service; and unwavering commitment to his community and country. 
So now moving onto our first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low-risk and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2018. As a reminder, we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13.5% EPS increase from the previous year primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the Pennsylvania and the Missouri General rate cases in 2018, which Linda will discuss in more detail. While American Water does not give quarterly guidance, our first quarter results were $0.01 ahead of plan for the quarter. Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate through 2023. 
Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance on April 17, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.455 to $0.50 per share, a 9.9% increase. The company has increased its dividend every year since our IPO in April of 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10% per year since 2013. 
The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations, so that we can provide clean, safe and reliable service. We invested $337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvements in our Regulated Businesses. We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement, constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from both our employees and our customers. I'll talk more on the next slide about our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. Earnings were up year-over-year in our Market-Based Businesses. This was due primarily to growth customer contracts from Homeowner Services. Of note, we have a very successful new partnerships with Philadelphia, where we have added more than 100,000 contracts since we launched the partnership in October of 2018. That type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined Homeowner Services has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. 
Our Military Services Group added the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base contract in 2018, and we begin full operations at Fort Leonard Wood Army base yesterday, May 1. We still expect to see decisions by the Department of Defense on up to 3 military base awards for which we are competing this year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Let's talk more about growth across our regulated footprints. We have closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states so far in 2019. 3 of these were water systems in Kentucky, Indiana and Missouri. And 2 were wastewater acquisitions in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. These closed acquisitions resulted in 4,700 new customer connections and they join more than 3,000 customer connections we added through organic growth in the first quarter. We also look forward to adding another 61,500 customer connections through signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2019. This includes our most recent agreement to acquire East Pasadena water company in California, adding 2,900 new connections. 
Just as a reminder, typically a customer connection or meter represents, on average, 2.5 to 3 people based on the specific state. At American Water, we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. 
Moving to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We do this by putting a laser focus on both O&M efficiency as well as capital-investment efficiency. This is why our 31.5% O&M efficiency goal by 2023 is so important. As a reminder, this ratio represents how many cents of O&M we spend for every dollar of revenue. Meaning, we want more dollars to go to investment so we can make our system safer, stronger and more reliable. Our employees live in the communities we serve, and they're committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality of water and water services at affordable prices. 
Let me give you just 1 example of how we're driving further efficiencies. We are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personnel, the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging. So we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points, so their states operations are more cost effective. When we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get, by leveraging our large size and purchasing power, we will save approximately $33 million a year, just on the purchases of meters, hydrants, valves and pipes. 
Slide 10 summarizes many points I just covered. Again, we're affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth through 2023. We are off to a good start this year and we look forward to continuing to deliver stable and predictable results. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda for her comments."

I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018.

I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter last year. Included in GAAP earnings was a favorable adjustment of $4 million or $0.01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. This reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims costs. In total, our share of the original $126 million Freedom Industries-related settlement has been reduced to $19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims. Excluding this  ] benefit, first quarter earnings were up 3.4%, which came in $0.01 above our plan. Our strong market-based earnings offset partially by timing items in the Regulated Business in parent. 
Other highlights include achieving a consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10% for the 12-month period ended first quarter 2019, executing on our capital investment strategy by investing $337 million during the quarter and adding $36 million in annualized new, authorized revenue since the beginning of this year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results. I'll start on the left hand side of this page. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter of 2018, up 13.5% over first quarter 2017. On settlement of both the Pennsylvania and Missouri General rate cases last year. First quarter 2019 increased 3.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which reflects some timing impacts that I will discuss in more detail as I cover each business. 
Let me start with our Regulated Businesses, which were up $0.01 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 in total and included increases from authorized rate cases, infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower demand and a $0.02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our Missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customer rates for the lower federal income tax rate until May 28 2018. 
Lastly, I should note, we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019. Next, we had higher O&M expense of $0.01 per share from something we are very proud of. For finalization of our union-negotiated national benefits agreement last year, we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plans. This puts our 7,100 employees on the same annual performance plan, where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement. 
So from our CEO to the front line, our goals are aligned. We believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our O&M efficiency goals, allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact at our critically-needed infrastructure investments. 
Depreciation and interest expense were each up $0.03 per share to support investment growth. Our Market-Based Businesses had a strong quarter, up $0.04 or 57% with Homeowner Services up $0.03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer additions. 
Military services was up a $0.01 from the addition of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and an increase in capital work at Vandenberg. 
Lastly, the parent decreased $0.03 from 3 separate items, each $0.01 per share. First, we had higher interest expense to support growth, next we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018 and we also had $0.01 of expense timing. 
Turning to Slide 14. I will provide an update on our regulatory proceedings. We settled 2 rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in West Virginia and Maryland and implemented our 3-year rate increase under our 4-year plan in New York effective April 1. In West Virginia, we received approval of our -- of an annualized revenue increase of $19 million, an ROE of 9.75 and an increased equity ratio to a 48.4%. 
The case was driven by $200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment. This surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In Maryland, we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over $1 million, an estimated ROE of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 48.7%. The case was driven by $18 million of investments since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new 90 million-gallon reservoir and intake near Bel Air, Maryland. This new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region. 
We also have 3 pending rate cases in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our California General rate case. In Indiana, we reached an agreement on the -- with the major parties on our rate case. If approved, the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of $7.5 million -- $17.5 million over 2 steps, an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.4%. 
The settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 Future Test Year, Indiana American Water will have invested over $500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015. 
Regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Indiana American Water already reduced its customer rates by 4.4% on August 1 2018. And the agreement includes credit for the period before August 1, to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in May 2020.  A final order is expected by mid-2019. 
Moving to Virginia. We implemented interim water and wastewater rates on May 1, the general rate case requested an overall increase of $5 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April of 2017. The final rate order could take several months. 
In Kentucky, our general rate case requested nearly $20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than $100 million in capital investment since the last rate case in 2016. 
And yesterday, California American Water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first-year  revenue increase of $23.9 million followed by annual step increases that would support $200 million of infrastructure projects. California is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019. 
Turning to Slide 15. Today, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. This excludes the $0.01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our Freedom Industries-related settlement, which is included in our 2019 GAAP earnings guidance range. Included in our annual guidance range are several variables, with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather. And as a reminder, we consider plus or minus $0.06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range. With the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months or third quarter of each year. On a long-term basis, we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long-term EPS guidance in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth range, anchored off 2017 adjusted earnings. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me discuss our balance sheet. As we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform, originally, we expected lower cash flow of about $500 million from 2018 through 2022. This has improved by $120 million following the pivotal acquisition. You can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020 when we expect to become a cash taxpayer, but then declines quickly as rate base grows and becomes positive by 2022. 
Also, as we continue to refine our estimates, we are now forecasting becoming a cash taxpayer in the second half of 2020 versus our prior estimate at a full year in 2020. Now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform. 
Also, I am pleased to report that our 2018 debt-to-capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59% in 2018, further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management. Incorporating the better 2018 results into our 5-year plan, we have lowered our expected long-term, debt-to-cap levels by a full percentage point, to a range of 61% to 62% by 2023. And I should note that debt-to-cap ratio includes both long-term and short-term debt. In terms of credit ratings, earlier this year Moody's downgraded American Water from AAA to BAA1 with a stable outlook. Although, disappointing we expect the expect to be minimum. And as you know, in the second quarter of 2018, S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating with a stable outlook. 
In summary, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we do not see the need to issue new equity with our current 5-year plan under normal operating conditions. 
Turning to Slide 17. We are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value. With our announced increase in dividends of 9.9%, our 5-year compound annual growth rate in dividends is 10.1%. And we have now have had consistent annual dividend increases since 2013. Looking forward, we expect to grow our dividend at the top end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range, subject to board approval. And we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steady at 10% for the 12-months period ended March 31. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9.8%. And we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing the UTY index and S&P 500 over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods. Through this disciplined financial management, customers and shareholders may be confident that American Water will continue to deliver value. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

We never forget at American Water that at the end of every waterpipe there is a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children. That at every fire hydrant, life depends on the water being there at the right pressure. That at every wastewater plant, we are a shield between our customers and disease. We're very proud to announce our most recent award from the Water Research Foundation to continue research on Legionella, while Legionella is primarily an issue in customer-owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter, we think it's critical that we further educate and protect our customers for contaminants that could impact their water quality. As a reminder, we've had an R&D group at American Water since 1981, and our newest research grant is one of over 100 we've received on topics ranging from emerging contaminants, to water recycling and reuse, to ground-breaking water technologies. We know that employees, customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society, our planet and our communities. We believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose-driven values culture. 
I was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent S&P Global ESG evaluation launch. The key topics at the launch were ESG risk quantification, developing more standardized ESG measures and improving timeliness of reporting. S&P as well as Moody's, have indicated that ESG measures will be an important input into evaluation of risk to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit ratings. We're committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you the ESG information that you want. But the wide ranging and nonstandardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparisons. Timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we've seen recently are based on data from as far back as 2016 and don't  reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years. We've engaged a leading ESG consulting firm and they've recently completed a materiality assessment for us. This effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors, credit-rating analysts, regulators, customers, elected officials, environmental and ESG activists and our own Board members and employees. We will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve. And we look forward to your continuing feedback. 
In closing, I mentioned earlier about the professional accomplishments of Linda Sullivan over the past 5 years. But I would be remorse if would didn't end on something even more important for personal influence and impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company. Linda has the highest integrity. She's smart, quick and strategic. And she's always asking how can we get better. She cares deeply about our employees, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. She's been a CFO that I depend on everyday to do  the fundamentals very best. And to look beyond the horizon to what's next week. She treats every single person with respect and dignity. I can honestly say that I have learned something from her every day. She is my colleague, my hero and my friend, and I will miss her tremendously. For those of you who know her well, you understand that this last slide. Linda loves 3 things very much: her family; American Water; and Corvettes. So many of you will see Linda, Susan and me with Ed and Ralph over the next 2 months on investor visits. And while Linda's not returning until August 1, this will be her last earnings call. And in and out of things to come, I will share with you another first for American Water, we are 1 of only 3 S&P 500 companies with a female CEO and CFO team. And on July 1, we will have the distinction as the only company for both women even have the same first name. Just another way we're trying to make things easy for you. 
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So many of you know that the first step in implementation was that water providers in the state of New Jersey were going to have to certify to certain parts of those regulations. That is happening though as the regulations are currently still being developed by the DEP in New Jersey to be rolled out further. So we were the first to certify. For us, it was more business as usual. So we are just now starting to see some of the certifications coming in. It's our understanding that there may be 1 or 2, I think, a university that may be looking at consolidating those type of certifications and looking where different systems stand in the state. So it's in the early stages. The regulations are still being promulgated, and we look forward to -- in continued roll out over the next probably 6 to 12 months."

Last month, we sold a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection announced that it has plan to set standards for the PFOS contamination. And they're much more strict than the EPA's guidelines. And it appears other states are going to implement similar standard as well. So I was just, kind of, hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the company on a regulated side in terms of the acquisition front? And then on -- in terms of what it could mean to cost to the companies, since it'll -- it's going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well. And then on top of that, how it could also impact the company in terms of the military business because driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher firm -- foam used on this military bases everyday when they are running their drills. And so I would think that, that would be something with this -- PFOS contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue O&M contracts with the likes of American Water. So I just wondered if you could give us some high-level color on how this PFOS contamination could impact the company?"

This is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country. Those from states that are doing their own limits P5 as well as -- EPA actually, yesterday came out from -- what most people don't understand, while the EPA has a recommended maximum contaminant level, there really isn't a regulation. It is not actually a regulated chemical. What it is, is they're recommending not to have over certain limits, but they don't have the force of regulation behind it. The EPA came out yesterday I read, and basically said they are going to do it. They are looking at the levels that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren't regulated of 70 parts per trillion. New Jersey, as you mentioned, has come in with a much lower, I believe, 13 parts per trillion. To your point about the company, I mentioned it's interesting you asked this question because I mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our R&D group. We've been doing research on these perfluorinated chemicals for decades. And in fact, and I'll talk about military first, then I'll come back to the regulated business. We have actually already been working on a couple or 3 of our  military basis to actually treat P5. We have mobile units, where we can actually do on-site decontamination and, for example, at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, we've done tremendous work already with a couple of wells there that we serve. It -- we believe from the military installation standpoint, it's actually a competitive advantage for us. We have treated 2 levels that are at or below what the New Jersey requirements are, we know how to do that. So this is a serious situation, and if you want to get a nice 4, 5 page premier for those are there who want to know, the National Institute of Environmental Health Services has a wonderful 3 or 4 page premier because some people use, PFOS, PFOAs, they're all part of group of PFCs, called perfluorinated chemicals. And they are all man-made materials and the issue comes in is that they are, as you said, firefighting foam, Teflon. It comes from even Stainmaster, things that repel grease and water and it's been used for decades. And so what is happened is, as it gets into the water source of the environment, that it just stays -- and it's consumed by humans, it just doesn't get released from the body for years and years. And that's where the concern is coming. So this is a very serious issue. We applaud all of the different states as well as the EPA for making this a priority. We actually see this is a very good thing. We are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the PFCs and our different states and we really want to be part of being a solutions provider for those and see it as a strength, given all the research and actual deployment we've done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies."

Before I discuss our first quarter earnings results, I'd like to talk about Linda Sullivan's retirement. While we made the announcement yesterday, she will remain CFO until July 1, and will stay with us until August 1, to ensure a smooth transition. This is especially bittersweet for me, as Linda and I have been a team since she began her tenure as CFO in early May 2014, when I moved from the CFO position to CEO. But her family is growing and in addition to her 2 beautiful grandsons you met in a presentation at our Investor Day last December, her son and daughter-in-law in California are expecting her first granddaughter in June. We're happy for Linda and in a few minutes she will tell you more about her plans. 
Her accomplishments in too long to list but I would highlight that from 2014 through 2018, our EPS has grown at an 8% CAGR, our annual dividend have increased at 10.1% CAGR and our stock price has risen from $46.22 on May 1 2014, to $107.10 at yesterday's closing. I'm reminded of an executive team meeting in 2014 when we ask each person for his or her top aspirational goals for American Water. Literally Linda said, ""For our stock to go over $100 per share."" Linda, we did it. 
Linda also oversaw the raising of $4.4 billion of financing capital over the past 5 years. She rebuilt our tax and risk management functions with industry-leading talent. And she has led significant improvements in our supply chain processes. She also designed and developed the financial strategy and planning organization. And she has recently set a digital finance within her organization, one of the first in the utility industry. She has also been very involved in our corporate-wide growth, customer and people initiatives. And she helped us recruit her successor, Susan Hardwick, whom she has known for several years. Many of you also know Susan who served 6 years as CFO of Vectren. She has 35 years of deep finance and regulated utility experience. She most recently led the execution of $8.5 billion Vectren sale to CenterPoint Energy. Susan is strongly committed to customers, constructive regulatory relationships and building better communities. She prioritizes employee development and the building of collaborative and successful teams. She has a strong record of living and leading the values we have at American Water and is a tremendous fit for our company. She will join our company on June 3, as Executive Vice President of Finance until she takes the CFO rank from Linda on July 1. She's actually here in the room with us today. Linda, would you like to say a few words?"

I have learned more from you in the last 5 years than in my entire career, and I thank you immensely. My husband and I took the road bus travel when we moved from California to New Jersey 5 years ago. And being part of the American Water team, turned out to be the best career decision of my life, and I would not trade this experience for anything in the world. And to our analysts and investors, I want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the American Water story and listen to your insights and views. You were truly the grand teachers and thought leaders of our industry. It has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you. So now after 30 years in the utility industry, this decision to retire is the hardest career decision I have made and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family. It's hard because I love everything about American Water, the leadership team, my colleagues, my team, the Board and our collective ability to do what we say we're going to do. I believe American Water is the best-run utility in the nation and with our announcement today, bringing Susan Hardwick on board, I am confident it will continue to be just that. 
Personally, this is an easy decision for me. My coast-to-coast family is rapidly expanding with 2 grandsons and a granddaughter due in June. And I'm fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull of my heart. And it's really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel, but there is a song lyric and it's by Andy Grammar that's sums it up pretty well. It says, ""I think I finally found my hallelujah"". So I also love the work I do on several boards and am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion, plus my bucket size is approaching the size of a novel and my husband, Tom, and I look forward to living those dreams. I would like to thank the leadership team and Board for being so understanding and gracious about my decisions and working with me through a strong succession plan. I'm thrilled to have Susan Hardwick join the team. She will bring tremendous value to American Water."

Unfortunately, our COO, Walter Lynch is in Arkansas due to the passing of his father-in-law, Alex Street. Many of you know that Walter is a West Point Graduate and an Army veteran and Mr. Street also served our country in the Army. At 80 years old, he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years. We applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold dear at American Water: integrity; service; and unwavering commitment to his community and country. 
So now moving onto our first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low-risk and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2018. As a reminder, we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13.5% EPS increase from the previous year primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the Pennsylvania and the Missouri General rate cases in 2018, which Linda will discuss in more detail. While American Water does not give quarterly guidance, our first quarter results were $0.01 ahead of plan for the quarter. Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate through 2023. 
Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance on April 17, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.455 to $0.50 per share, a 9.9% increase. The company has increased its dividend every year since our IPO in April of 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10% per year since 2013. 
The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations, so that we can provide clean, safe and reliable service. We invested $337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvements in our Regulated Businesses. We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement, constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from both our employees and our customers. I'll talk more on the next slide about our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. Earnings were up year-over-year in our Market-Based Businesses. This was due primarily to growth customer contracts from Homeowner Services. Of note, we have a very successful new partnerships with Philadelphia, where we have added more than 100,000 contracts since we launched the partnership in October of 2018. That type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined Homeowner Services has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. 
Our Military Services Group added the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base contract in 2018, and we begin full operations at Fort Leonard Wood Army base yesterday, May 1. We still expect to see decisions by the Department of Defense on up to 3 military base awards for which we are competing this year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Let's talk more about growth across our regulated footprints. We have closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states so far in 2019. 3 of these were water systems in Kentucky, Indiana and Missouri. And 2 were wastewater acquisitions in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. These closed acquisitions resulted in 4,700 new customer connections and they join more than 3,000 customer connections we added through organic growth in the first quarter. We also look forward to adding another 61,500 customer connections through signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2019. This includes our most recent agreement to acquire East Pasadena water company in California, adding 2,900 new connections. 
Just as a reminder, typically a customer connection or meter represents, on average, 2.5 to 3 people based on the specific state. At American Water, we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. 
Moving to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We do this by putting a laser focus on both O&M efficiency as well as capital investment efficiency. This is why our 31.5% O&M efficiency goal by 2023 is so important. As a reminder, this ratio represents how many cents of O&M we spend for every dollar of revenue. Meaning, we want more dollars to go to investment so we can make our system safer, stronger and more reliable. Our employees live in the communities we serve, and they're committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality of water and water services at affordable prices. 
Let me give you just 1 example of how we're driving further efficiencies. We are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personnel, the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging. So we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points, so their states operations are more cost-effective. When we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get, by leveraging our large size and purchasing power, we will save approximately $33 million a year, just on the purchases of meters, hydrants, valves and pipes. 
Slide 10 summarizes many points I just covered. Again, we're affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth through 2023. We are off to a good start this year and we look forward to continuing to deliver stable and predictable results. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda for her comments."

I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018.

I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter last year. Included in GAAP earnings was a favorable adjustment of $4 million or $0.01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. This reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims costs. In total, our share of the original $126 million Freedom Industries-related settlement has been reduced to $19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims. Excluding this ] benefit, first quarter earnings were up 3.4%, which came in $0.01 above our plan. Our strong market-based earnings offset partially by timing items in the Regulated Business in parent. 
Other highlights include achieving a consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10% for the 12-month period ended first quarter 2019, executing on our capital investment strategy by investing $337 million during the quarter and adding $36 million in annualized new, authorized revenue since the beginning of this year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results. I'll start on the left hand side of this page. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter of 2018, up 13.5% over first quarter 2017. On settlement of both the Pennsylvania and Missouri General rate cases last year. First quarter 2019 increased 3.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which reflects some timing impacts that I will discuss in more detail as I cover each business. 
Let me start with our Regulated Businesses, which were up $0.01 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 in total and included increases from authorized rate cases, infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower demand and a $0.02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our Missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customer rates for the lower federal income tax rate until May 28 2018. 
Lastly, I should note, we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019. Next, we had higher O&M expense of $0.01 per share from something we are very proud of. For finalization of our union-negotiated national benefits agreement last year, we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plans. This puts our 7,100 employees on the same annual performance plan, where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement. 
So from our CEO to the front line, our goals are aligned. We believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our O&M efficiency goals, allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact at our critically-needed infrastructure investments. 
Depreciation and interest expense were each up $0.03 per share to support investment growth. Our Market-Based Businesses had a strong quarter, up $0.04 or 57% with Homeowner Services up $0.03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer additions. 
Military services was up a $0.01 from the addition of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and an increase in capital work at Vandenberg. 
Lastly, the parent decreased $0.03 from 3 separate items, each $0.01 per share. First, we had higher interest expense to support growth, next we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018 and we also had $0.01 of expense timing. 
Turning to Slide 14. I will provide an update on our regulatory proceedings. We settled 2 rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in West Virginia and Maryland and implemented our 3-year rate increase under our 4-year plan in New York effective April 1. In West Virginia, we received approval of our -- of an annualized revenue increase of $19 million, an ROE of 9.75 and an increased equity ratio to a 48.4%. 
The case was driven by $200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment. This surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In Maryland, we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over $1 million, an estimated ROE of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 48.7%. The case was driven by $18 million of investments since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new 90 million-gallon reservoir and intake near Bel Air, Maryland. This new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region. 
We also have 3 pending rate cases in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our California General rate case. In Indiana, we reached an agreement on the -- with the major parties on our rate case. If approved, the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of $7.5 million -- $17.5 million over 2 steps, an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.4%. 
The settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 Future Test Year, Indiana American Water will have invested over $500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015. 
Regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Indiana American Water already reduced its customer rates by 4.4% on August 1 2018. And the agreement includes credit for the period before August 1, to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in May 2020. A final order is expected by mid-2019. 
Moving to Virginia. We implemented interim water and wastewater rates on May 1, the general rate case requested an overall increase of $5 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April of 2017. The final rate order could take several months. 
In Kentucky, our general rate case requested nearly $20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than $100 million in capital investment since the last rate case in 2016. 
And yesterday, California American Water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first-year revenue increase of $23.9 million followed by annual step increases that would support $200 million of infrastructure projects. California is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019. 
Turning to Slide 15. Today, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. This excludes the $0.01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our Freedom Industries-related settlement, which is included in our 2019 GAAP earnings guidance range. Included in our annual guidance range are several variables, with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather. And as a reminder, we consider plus or minus $0.06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range. With the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months or third quarter of each year. On a long-term basis, we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long-term EPS guidance in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth range, anchored off 2017 adjusted earnings. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me discuss our balance sheet. As we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform, originally, we expected lower cash flow of about $500 million from 2018 through 2022. This has improved by $120 million following the pivotal acquisition. You can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020 when we expect to become a cash taxpayer, but then declines quickly as rate base grows and becomes positive by 2022. 
Also, as we continue to refine our estimates, we are now forecasting becoming a cash taxpayer in the second half of 2020 versus our prior estimate at a full year in 2020. Now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform. 
Also, I am pleased to report that our 2018 debt-to-capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59% in 2018, further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management. Incorporating the better 2018 results into our 5-year plan, we have lowered our expected long-term, debt-to-cap levels by a full percentage point, to a range of 61% to 62% by 2023. And I should note that debt-to-cap ratio includes both long-term and short-term debt. In terms of credit ratings, earlier this year Moody's downgraded American Water from AAA to BAA1 with a stable outlook. Although, disappointing we expect the expect to be minimum. And as you know, in the second quarter of 2018, S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating with a stable outlook. 
In summary, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we do not see the need to issue new equity with our current 5-year plan under normal operating conditions. 
Turning to Slide 17. We are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value. With our announced increase in dividends of 9.9%, our 5-year compound annual growth rate in dividends is 10.1%. And we have now have had consistent annual dividend increases since 2013. Looking forward, we expect to grow our dividend at the top end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range, subject to board approval. And we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steady at 10% for the 12-months period ended March 31. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9.8%. And we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing the UTY index and S&P 500 over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods. Through this disciplined financial management, customers and shareholders may be confident that American Water will continue to deliver value. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

We never forget at American Water that at the end of every waterpipe there is a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children. That at every fire hydrant, life depends on the water being there at the right pressure. That at every wastewater plant, we are a shield between our customers and disease. We're very proud to announce our most recent award from the Water Research Foundation to continue research on Legionella, while Legionella is primarily an issue in customer-owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter, we think it's critical that we further educate and protect our customers for contaminants that could impact their water quality. As a reminder, we've had an R&D group at American Water since 1981, and our newest research grant is one of over 100 we've received on topics ranging from emerging contaminants, to water recycling and reuse, to ground-breaking water technologies. We know that employees, customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society, our planet and our communities. We believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose-driven values culture. 
I was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent S&P Global ESG evaluation launch. The key topics at the launch were ESG risk quantification, developing more standardized ESG measures and improving timeliness of reporting. S&P as well as Moody's, have indicated that ESG measures will be an important input into evaluation of risk to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit ratings. We're committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you the ESG information that you want. But the wide-ranging and nonstandardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparisons. Timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we've seen recently are based on data from as far back as 2016 and don't reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years. We've engaged a leading ESG consulting firm and they've recently completed a materiality assessment for us. This effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors, credit-rating analysts, regulators, customers, elected officials, environmental and ESG activists and our own Board members and employees. We will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve. And we look forward to your continuing feedback. 
In closing, I mentioned earlier about the professional accomplishments of Linda Sullivan over the past 5 years. But I would be remorse if would didn't end on something even more important for personal influence and impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company. Linda has the highest integrity. She's smart, quick and strategic. And she's always asking how can we get better. She cares deeply about our employees, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. She's been a CFO that I depend on everyday to do the fundamentals very best. And to look beyond the horizon to what's next week. She treats every single person with respect and dignity. I can honestly say that I have learned something from her every day. She is my colleague, my hero and my friend, and I will miss her tremendously. For those of you who know her well, you understand that this last slide. Linda loves 3 things very much: her family; American Water; and Corvettes. So many of you will see Linda, Susan and me with Ed and Ralph over the next 2 months on investor visits. And while Linda's not returning until August 1, this will be her last earnings call. And in and out of things to come, I will share with you another first for American Water, we are 1 of only 3 S&P 500 companies with a female CEO and CFO team. And on July 1, we will have the distinction as the only company for both women even have the same first name. Just another way we're trying to make things easy for you. 
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

That is happening though as the regulations are currently still being developed by the DEP in New Jersey to be rolled out further. So we were the first to certify. For us, it was more business as usual. So we are just now starting to see some of the certifications coming in. It's our understanding that there may be 1 or 2, I think, a university that may be looking at consolidating those type of certifications and looking where different systems stand in the state. So it's in the early stages. The regulations are still being promulgated, and we look forward to -- in continued roll out over the next probably 6 to 12 months."

Last month, we sold a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection announced that it has plan to set standards for the PFOS contamination. And they're much more strict than the EPA's guidelines. And it appears other states are going to implement similar standard as well. So I was just, kind of, hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the company on a regulated side in terms of the acquisition front? And then on -- in terms of what it could mean to cost to the companies, since it'll -- it's going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well. And then on top of that, how it could also impact the company in terms of the military business because driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher firm -- foam used on this military bases everyday when they are running their drills. And so I would think that, that would be something with this -- PFOS contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue O&M contracts with the likes of American Water. So I just wondered if you could give us some high-level color on how this PFOS contamination could impact the company?"

This is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country. Those from states that are doing their own limits P5 as well as -- EPA actually, yesterday came out from -- what most people don't understand, while the EPA has a recommended maximum contaminant level, there really isn't a regulation. It is not actually a regulated chemical. What it is, is they're recommending not to have over certain limits, but they don't have the force of regulation behind it. The EPA came out yesterday I read, and basically said they are going to do it. They are looking at the levels that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren't regulated of 70 parts per trillion. New Jersey, as you mentioned, has come in with a much lower, I believe, 13 parts per trillion. To your point about the company, I mentioned it's interesting you asked this question because I mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our R&D group. We've been doing research on these perfluorinated chemicals for decades. And in fact, and I'll talk about military first, then I'll come back to the regulated business. We have actually already been working on a couple or 3 of our military basis to actually treat P5. We have mobile units, where we can actually do on-site decontamination and, for example, at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, we've done tremendous work already with a couple of wells there that we serve. It -- we believe from the military installation standpoint, it's actually a competitive advantage for us. We have treated 2 levels that are at or below what the New Jersey requirements are, we know how to do that. So this is a serious situation, and if you want to get a nice 4, 5 page premier for those are there who want to know, the National Institute of Environmental Health Services has a wonderful 3 or 4 page premier because some people use, PFOS, PFOAs, they're all part of group of PFCs, called perfluorinated chemicals. And they are all man-made materials and the issue comes in is that they are, as you said, firefighting foam, Teflon. It comes from even Stainmaster, things that repel grease and water and it's been used for decades. And so what is happened is, as it gets into the water source of the environment, that it just stays -- and it's consumed by humans, it just doesn't get released from the body for years and years. And that's where the concern is coming. So this is a very serious issue. We applaud all of the different states as well as the EPA for making this a priority. We actually see this is a very good thing. We are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the PFCs and our different states and we really want to be part of being a solutions provider for those and see it as a strength, given all the research and actual deployment we've done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies."

Before I discuss our first quarter earnings results, I'd like to talk about Linda Sullivan's retirement. While we made the announcement yesterday, she will remain CFO until July 1, and will stay with us until August 1, to ensure a smooth transition. This is especially bitter sweet for me, as Linda and I have been a team since she began her tenure as CFO in early May 2014, when I moved from the CFO position to CEO. But her family is growing and in addition to her 2 beautiful grandsons you met in a presentation at our Investor Day last December, her son and daughter-in-law in California are expecting her first granddaughter in June. We're happy for Linda and in a few minutes she will tell you more about her plans. 
Her accomplishments in too long to list but I would highlight that from 2014 through 2018, our EPS has grown at an 8% CAGR, our annual dividend have increased at 10.1% CAGR and our stock price has risen from $46.22 on May 1, 2014, to $107.10 at yesterday's closing. I'm reminded of an executive team meeting in 2014 when we ask each person for his or her top aspirational goals for American Water. Literally, Linda said, ""For our stock to go over $100 per share."" Linda, we did it. 
Linda also oversaw the raising of $4.4 billion of financing capital over the past 5 years. She rebuilt our tax and risk management functions with industry-leading talent. And she has led significant improvements in our supply chain processes. She also designed and developed the financial strategy and planning organization. And she has recently set a digital finance within her organization, one of the first in the utility industry. She has also been very involved in our corporate-wide growth, customer and people initiatives. And she helped us recruit her successor, Susan Hardwick, whom she has known for several years. Many of you also know Susan who served 6 years as CFO of Vectren. She has 35 years of deep finance and regulated utility experience. She most recently led the execution of $8.5 billion Vectren sale to CenterPoint Energy. Susan is strongly committed to customers, constructive regulatory relationships and building better communities. She prioritizes employee development and the building of collaborative and successful teams. She has a strong record of living and leading the values we have at American Water and is a tremendous fit for our company. She will join our company on June 3, as Executive Vice President of Finance until she takes the CFO rank from Linda on July 1. She's actually here in the room with us today. Linda, would you like to say a few words?"

I have learned more from you in the last 5 years than in my entire career, and I thank you immensely. My husband and I took the road bus travel when we moved from California to New Jersey 5 years ago. And being part of the American Water team, turned out to be the best career decision of my life, and I would not trade this experience for anything in the world. And to our analysts and investors, I want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the American Water story and listen to your insights and views. You were truly the grand teachers and thought leaders of our industry. It has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you. So now after 30 years in the utility industry, this decision to retire is the hardest career decision I have made and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family. It's hard because I love everything about American Water, the leadership team, my colleagues, my team, the Board and our collective ability to do what we say we're going to do. I believe American Water is the best-run utility in the nation and with our announcement today, bringing Susan Hardwick on board, I am confident it will continue to be just that. 
Personally, this is an easy decision for me. My coast-to-coast family is rapidly expanding with 2 grandsons and a granddaughter due in June. And I'm fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull of my heart. And it's really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel, but there is a song lyric and it's by Andy Grammar that's sums it up pretty well. It says, ""I think I finally found my hallelujah"". So I also love the work I do on several boards and am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion, plus my bucket size is approaching the size of a novel and my husband, Tom, and I look forward to living those dreams. I would like to thank the leadership team and Board for being so understanding and gracious about my decisions and working with me through a strong succession plan. I'm thrilled to have Susan Hardwick join the team. She will bring tremendous value to American Water."

Unfortunately, our COO, Walter Lynch is in Arkansas due to the passing of his father-in-law, Alex Street. Many of you know that Walter is a West Point Graduate and an Army veteran and Mr. Street also served our country in the Army. At 80 years old, he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years. We applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold dear at American Water: integrity; service; and unwavering commitment to his community and country. 
So now moving onto our first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low-risk and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2018. As a reminder, we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13.5% EPS increase from the previous year primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the Pennsylvania and the Missouri General rate cases in 2018, which Linda will discuss in more detail. While American Water does not give quarterly guidance, our first quarter results were $0.01 ahead of plan for the quarter. Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate through 2023. 
Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance on April 17, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.455 to $0.50 per share, a 9.9% increase. The company has increased its dividend every year since our IPO in April of 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10% per year since 2013. 
The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations, so that we can provide clean, safe and reliable service. We invested $337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvements in our Regulated Businesses. We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement, constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from both our employees and our customers. I'll talk more on the next slide about our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. Earnings were up year-over-year in our Market-Based Businesses. This was due primarily to growth customer contracts from Homeowner Services. Of note, we have a very successful new partnerships with Philadelphia, where we have added more than 100,000 contracts since we launched the partnership in October of 2018. That type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined Homeowner Services has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. 
Our Military Services Group added the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base contract in 2018, and we begin full operations at Fort Leonard Wood Army base yesterday, May 1. We still expect to see decisions by the Department of Defense on up to 3 military base awards for which we are competing this year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Let's talk more about growth across our regulated footprints. We have closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states so far in 2019. 3 of these were water systems in Kentucky, Indiana and Missouri. And 2 were wastewater acquisitions in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. These closed acquisitions resulted in 4,700 new customer connections and they join more than 3,000 customer connections we added through organic growth in the first quarter. We also look forward to adding another 61,500 customer connections through signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2019. This includes our most recent agreement to acquire East Pasadena water company in California, adding 2,900 new connections. 
Just as a reminder, typically a customer connection or meter represents, on average, 2.5 to 3 people based on the specific state. At American Water, we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. 
Moving to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We do this by putting a laser focus on both O&M efficiency as well as capital-investment efficiency. This is why our 31.5% O&M efficiency goal by 2023 is so important. As a reminder, this ratio represents how many cents of O&M we spend for every dollar of revenue. Meaning, we want more dollars to go to investment so we can make our system safer, stronger and more reliable. Our employees live in the communities we serve, and they're committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality of water and water services at affordable prices. 
Let me give you just one example of how we're driving further efficiencies. We are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personnel, the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging. So we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points, so their states operations are more cost effective. When we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get, by leveraging our large size and purchasing power, we will save approximately $33 million a year, just on the purchases of meters, hydrants, valves and pipes. 
Slide 10 summarizes many points I just covered. Again, we're affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth through 2023. We are off to a good start this year and we look forward to continuing to deliver stable and predictable results. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda for her comments."
250885,608652476,1721609,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan. I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter last year. Included in GAAP e",1646,"Thank you, Susan. 
I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019, especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, an increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter last year. Included in GAAP earnings was a favorable adjustment of $4 million or $0.01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. This reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims costs. In total, our share of the original $126 million Freedom Industries-related settlement has been reduced to $19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims. Excluding this benefit, first quarter earnings were up 3.4%, which came in $0.01 above our plan. Our strong market-based earnings offset partially by timing items in the Regulated Business in parent. 
Other highlights include achieving a consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10% for the 12-month period ended first quarter 2019, executing on our capital investment strategy by investing $337 million during the quarter and adding $36 million in annualized new, authorized revenue since the beginning of this year. 
Turning to Slide 13. Let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results. I'll start on the left hand side of this page. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter of 2018, up 13.5% over first quarter 2017. On settlement of both the Pennsylvania and Missouri general rate cases last year, first quarter 2019 increased 3.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which reflects some timing impacts that I will discuss in more detail as I cover each business. 
Let me start with our Regulated Businesses, which were up $0.01 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 in total and included increases from authorized rate cases, infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower demand and a $0.02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our Missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customer rates for the lower federal income tax rate until May 28 2018. 
Lastly, I should note, we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019. Next, we had higher O&M expense of $0.01 per share from something we are very proud of. For finalization of our union-negotiated national benefits agreement last year, we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plans. This puts our 7,100 employees on the same annual performance plan, where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement. 
So from our CEO to the front line, our goals are aligned. We believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our O&M efficiency goals, allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact at our critically needed infrastructure investments. 
Depreciation and interest expense were each up $0.03 per share to support investment growth. Our Market-Based Businesses had a strong quarter, up $0.04 or 57% with Homeowner Services up $0.03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer additions. 
Military services was up a $0.01 from the addition of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and an increase in capital work at Vandenberg. 
Lastly, the parent decreased $0.03 from 3 separate items, each $0.01 per share. First, we had higher interest expense to support growth, next we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018 and we also had $0.01 of expense timing. 
Turning to Slide 14. I will provide an update on our regulatory proceedings. We settled 2 rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in West Virginia and Maryland and implemented our 3-year rate increase under our 4-year plan in New York effective April 1. In West Virginia, we received approval of our -- of an annualized revenue increase of $19 million, an ROE of 9.75 and an increased equity ratio to a 48.4%. 
The case was driven by $200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016. Additionally, the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment. This surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In Maryland, we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over $1 million, an estimated ROE of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 48.7%. The case was driven by $18 million of investments since 2015. During that time, the company constructed a new 90 million-gallon reservoir and intake near Bel Air, Maryland. This new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region. 
We also have 3 pending rate cases in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our California General rate case. In Indiana, we reached an agreement on the -- with the major parties on our rate case. If approved, the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of $7.5 million -- $17.5 million over 2 steps, an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.4%. 
The settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 Future Test Year, Indiana American Water will have invested over $500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015. 
Regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Indiana American Water already reduced its customer rates by 4.4% on August 1, 2018. And the agreement includes credit for the period before August 1, to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in May 2020. A final order is expected by mid-2019. 
Moving to Virginia. We implemented interim water and wastewater rates on May 1, the general rate case requested an overall increase of $5 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April of 2017. The final rate order could take several months. 
In Kentucky, our general rate case requested nearly $20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than $100 million in capital investment since the last rate case in 2016. 
And yesterday, California American Water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first-year revenue increase of $23.9 million followed by annual step increases that would support $200 million of infrastructure projects. California is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019. 
Turning to Slide 15. Today, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. This excludes the $0.01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our Freedom Industries-related settlement, which is included in our 2019 GAAP earnings guidance range. Included in our annual guidance range are several variables, with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather. And as a reminder, we consider plus or minus $0.06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range. With the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months or third quarter of each year. On a long-term basis, we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long-term EPS guidance in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth range, anchored off 2017 adjusted earnings. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me discuss our balance sheet. As we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform, originally, we expected lower cash flow of about $500 million from 2018 through 2022. This has improved by $120 million following the pivotal acquisition. You can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020 when we expect to become a cash taxpayer, but then declines quickly as rate base grows and becomes positive by 2022. 
Also, as we continue to refine our estimates, we are now forecasting becoming a cash taxpayer in the second half of 2020 versus our prior estimate at a full year in 2020. Now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform. 
Also, I am pleased to report that our 2018 debt-to-capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59% in 2018, further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management. Incorporating the better 2018 results into our 5-year plan, we have lowered our expected long-term debt-to-cap levels by a full percentage point, to a range of 61% to 62% by 2023. And I should note that debt-to-cap ratio includes both long-term and short-term debt. In terms of credit ratings, earlier this year Moody's downgraded American Water from AAA to BAA1 with a stable outlook. Although disappointing, we expect the impact to be minimum. And as you know, in the second quarter of 2018, S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating with a stable outlook. 
In summary, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we do not see the need to issue new equity with our current 5-year plan under normal operating conditions. 
Turning to Slide 17. We are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value. With our announced increase in dividends of 9.9%, our 5-year compound annual growth rate in dividends is 10.1%. And we have now have had consistent annual dividend increases since 2013. Looking forward, we expect to grow our dividend at the top end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range, subject to board approval. And we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steady at 10% for the 12-months period ended March 31. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9.8%. And we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing the UTY index and S&P 500 over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods. Through this disciplined financial management, customers and shareholders may be confident that American Water will continue to deliver value. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

We never forget at American Water that at the end of every water pipe there is a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children. That at every fire hydrant, life depends on the water being there at the right pressure.",702,"Thanks, Linda. We never forget at American Water that at the end of every water pipe there is a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children. That at every fire hydrant, life depends on the water being there at the right pressure. That at every wastewater plant, we are a shield between our customers and disease. We're very proud to announce our most recent award from the Water Research Foundation to continue research on Legionella, while Legionella is primarily an issue in customer-owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter, we think it's critical that we further educate and protect our customers for contaminants that could impact their water quality. As a reminder, we've had an R&D group at American Water since 1981, and our newest research grant is one of over 100 we've received on topics ranging from emerging contaminants, to water recycling and reuse, to groundbreaking water technologies. We know that employees, customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society, our planet and our communities. We believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose-driven values culture. 
I was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent S&P Global ESG evaluation launch. The key topics at the launch were ESG risk quantification, developing more standardized ESG measures and improving timeliness of reporting. S&P as well as Moody's, have indicated that ESG measures will be an important input into evaluation of risk to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit ratings. We're committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you the ESG information that you want. But the wide ranging and nonstandardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparisons. Timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we've seen recently are based on data from as far back as 2016 and don't reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years. We've engaged a leading ESG consulting firm and they've recently completed a materiality assessment for us. This effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors, credit-rating analysts, regulators, customers, elected officials, environmental and ESG activists and our own Board members and employees. We will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve. And we look forward to your continuing feedback. 
In closing, I mentioned earlier about the professional accomplishments of Linda Sullivan over the past 5 years. But I would be remorse if would didn't end on something even more important for personal influence and impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company. Linda has the highest integrity. She's smart, quick and strategic. And she's always asking how can we get better. She cares deeply about our employees, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. She's been a CFO that I depend on every day to do the fundamentals very best. And to look beyond the horizon to what's next week. She treats every single person with respect and dignity. I can honestly say that I have learned something from her every day. She is my colleague, my hero and my friend, and I will miss her tremendously. For those of you who know her well, you understand that this last slide. Linda loves 3 things very much: her family; American Water; and Corvettes. So many of you will see Linda, Susan and me with Ed and Ralph over the next 2 months on investor visits. And while Linda's not returning until August 1, this will be her last earnings call. And in and out of things to come, I will share with you another first for American Water, we are 1 of only 3 S&P 500 companies with a female CEO and CFO team. And on July 1, we will have the distinction as the only company for both women even have the same first name. Just another way we're trying to make things easy for you. 
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

For us, it was more business as usual. So we are just now starting to see some of the certifications coming in. It's our understanding that there may be 1 or 2, I think, a university that may be looking at consolidating those type of certifications and looking where different systems stand in the state.

Last month, we sold a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection announced that it has plan to set standards for the PFOS contamination. And they're much more strict than the EPA's guidelines. And it appears other states are going to implement similar standard as well. So I was just, kind of, hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the company on a regulated side in terms of the acquisition front? And then on -- in terms of what it could mean to cost to the companies, since it'll -- it's going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well. And then on top of that, how it could also impact the company in terms of the military business because driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher firm -- foam used on this military bases every day when they are running their drills. And so I would think that, that would be something with this -- PFOS contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue O&M contracts with the likes of American Water. So I just wondered if you could give us some high-level color on how this PFOS contamination could impact the company?"

This is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country. Those from states that are doing their own limits P5 as well as -- EPA actually, yesterday came out from -- what most people don't understand, while the EPA has a recommended maximum contaminant level, there really isn't a regulation. It is not actually a regulated chemical. What it is, is they're recommending not to have over certain limits, but they don't have the force of regulation behind it. The EPA came out yesterday I read, and basically said they are going to do it. They are looking at the levels that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren't regulated of 70 parts per trillion. New Jersey, as you mentioned, has come in with a much lower, I believe, 13 parts per trillion. To your point about the company, I mentioned it's interesting you asked this question because I mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our R&D group. We've been doing research on these perfluorinated chemicals for decades. And in fact, and I'll talk about military first, then I'll come back to the regulated business. We have actually already been working on a couple or 3 of our military basis to actually treat P5. We have mobile units, where we can actually do on-site decontamination and, for example, at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, we've done tremendous work already with a couple of wells there that we serve. It -- we believe from the military installation standpoint, it's actually a competitive advantage for us. We have treated 2 levels that are at or below what the New Jersey requirements are, we know how to do that. So this is a serious situation, and if you want to get a nice 4, 5 page premier for those are there who want to know, the National Institute of Environmental Health Services has a wonderful 3 or 4 page premier because some people use, PFOS, PFOAs, they're all part of group of PFCs, called perfluorinated chemicals. And they are all man made materials and the issue comes in is that they are, as you said, firefighting foam, Teflon. It comes from even Stainmaster, things that repel grease and water and it's been used for decades. And so what is happened is, as it gets into the water source of the environment, that it just stays -- and it's consumed by humans, it just doesn't get released from the body for years and years. And that's where the concern is coming. So this is a very serious issue. We applaud all of the different states as well as the EPA for making this a priority. We actually see this is a very good thing. We are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the PFCs and our different states and we really want to be part of being a solutions provider for those and see it as a strength, given all the research and actual deployment we've done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies."

We have some outstanding customers in West Virginia, and we're are very excited that there is a growing realization from all of the parties, the stakeholders as well as the regulatory commission about the importance of investment for the future to ensure that, that state can continue to grow economically and have a safe water, wastewater and fire protection system for its citizens."

Today, our CFO, Susan Hardwick will cover our second quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. 
American Water employees delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the significant impact of unusually wet weather throughout our service area. I'll highlight just a few of their accomplishments this quarter. 
First, we continue to deliver strong consistent growth and financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 13.3% compared to last year despite the wet weather I just mentioned. As a reminder, weather impacts typically occur in the third quarter but the historical rains and flooding this second quarter resulted in a $0.05 quarter-over-quarter difference. We saw growth in our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses during this quarter. We added more than 37,000 customer connections year-to-date through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. This includes welcoming over 23,000 wastewater customers in Alton, Illinois where we have been privileged to provide water for our company's entire 133-year history. Alton is also home to one of our Regulated Businesses customer care centers and the Homeowner Services customer center. We finalized general rate cases in Kentucky and Indiana where we have invested more than $600 million combined since our last cases to ensure clean, safe and reliable water for our customers. Walter will give more details on our regulatory activities in just a minute.
All 3 Market-Based Businesses grew with especially strong growth from Homeowner Services. We were proud to join Philadelphia officials in May to announce that our water and sewer line action partnership is already having a significant positive impact to customers in the field for community. 
Also in the quarter, we successfully completed a $1.1 billion debt offering and S&P affirmed our A corporate credit rating with a stable outlook. We're pleased with S&P's decision. Having access to capital at lower debt cost enhances our ability to make needed investments while minimizing the cost impact on the customers we serve. 
Slide 6 shows our year-to-date performance. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. We invested almost $800 million during the first half of the year with virtually all dedicated to our Regulated Businesses. We expect to invest $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the year, reflecting both the strong acquisition closings this year, along with continued and growing need for infrastructure investment in our regulated states. And as I mentioned, results for our Market-Based Businesses continues to be strong. 
Moving to Slide 7, with this continued strong performance and our commitment to the execution of our strategy, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. American Water will invest $8 billion to $8.6 billion from 2019 through 2023 as we continue to invest in our infrastructure. We have a line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023, which is a key element of our commitment to ensure affordability for our customers. And under our 2019 to 2023 plan, we do not see the need to issue equity. 
In summary, we remain on track to meet our long-term earnings growth target in the top half of the 7% to 10% range. Now Walter will give a more detailed update on our Regulated business."

As Susan said, our Regulated Businesses had a solid first half of the year in spite of a very wet weather in the second quarter. We continue on a steady path making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while we continue to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. We also continue to grow through acquisitions, closing on 12 transactions through the end of July. Let me start on Slide 9 with the weather impact for the quarter. As a reminder, we had a $0.01 positive benefit from weather, warmer weather in the second quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2019, we experienced significant precipitation in the Midwest and the Northeast. In fact, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the past 12 months in the United States have been the wettest on record and that 2019 had the most rains since records began 124 years ago. 
As a result of these extreme conditions, we had a total quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of $0.05. By the way, this little meteorologist is the grandson of our Vice President of Regulatory Services. 
Turning to Slide 10, we continue to have a very busy regulatory calendar focused on needed investment with a keen eye toward reducing customer bill impacts. I'll cover a few highlights. 
In Kentucky, we received approval from the Kentucky Service Commission for new water rates effective June 28, with an authorized return on equity of 9.7% and an equity ratio of 48.9%. The case was driven by more than $100 million in investment since following our last rate case in January 2016. The Kentucky Public Service Commission also approved the implementation of a Qualified Infrastructure Program charge that will allow the company to replace aging pipes as well as other assets while reducing regulatory lag. This is now our 9th state with infrastructure surcharge mechanism in place. 
Moving to Indiana. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the settlement agreement reached with other parties in June with an authorized return on equity of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.41%. The primary driver of the case was the company's investment of $542 million since our last case in 2014. 
California American Water put into effect this 2018 rate case decision on May 11, 2019, resulting in a $4 million annualized increase in authorized revenue. The decision also approved $103 million in infrastructure improvements. Rates were consolidated for several service areas in Northern California to ensure reliable water service at an affordable price. 
We also have 2 pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In Virginia, we filed a general rate case in November 2018 requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. 
California American Water filed for new rates covering 2021 through 2023, requesting an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request includes $197 million for infrastructure improvements throughout the state. We expect the decision on the case in late 2020 with new rates taking effect on January 1, 2021. 
Moving on to slide 11. We continue to grow the size of our footprint with 12 water and wastewater acquisitions occurring in 7 states. These closed acquisitions added 30,700 customer connections, including 23,000 new wastewater customer connections from the Alton, Illinois acquisition. Alton Mayor Brant Walker stated that the sale of the wastewater system to Illinois American Water is ""in the city's best interest and provide significant net proceeds to help fund other city needs and priorities."" This is another example of how we're growing wastewater in areas where we serve water customers, leveraging our tremendous expertise and our commitment to the communities we serve.
We also welcomed 6,500 customer connections through organic growth and we'll welcome another 38,200 customer connections through 29 signed agreements in 8 states. This agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country.
Moving to Slide 12, customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. We invested $792 million in our regulated operations in the first half of this year, with $712 million dedicated to infrastructure improvements and $80 million funding acquisitions for our regulated business. We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through our continued focus on controlling O&M costs. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from our employees and our customers. As you can see, we continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 31.5% by 2023.
For example, we've developed and started to deploy a web-based work management software for our field service representatives. This software will put the control of daily planning in the hands of local operations, allowing our field service representatives to manage and optimize around work, quickly reroute to emergency orders and balance employees' work to ensure we're meeting the needs of our customers. 
Moving to Slide 13. I want to highlight the importance of the investments that we've made to improve the resiliency of our assets. What you're looking at is a photo of the recent flood in Davenport, Iowa, when the Mississippi River crested at a record 22.7 feet. The picture was taken from the vantage point of our water treatment plant and is proof that our focus on the resiliency of our systems benefits our communities. 
This particular plant is secured and protected by a 2,200-foot long floodwall that was completed in 2013. The $11.8 million project was a successful partnership between Iowa American Water and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, safeguarding the drinking water supply for over 130,000 residents in the Iowa quad cities. This is only one example of how we continue to make necessary investments to ensure that our customers receive reliable, high-quality water service. 
Finally, I want to recognize our Illinois American Water President, Bruce Hawk, who was awarded the 2019 Inclusion and Diversity Award by the National Black Chamber of Commerce during its annual conference last week. This award is presented annually to an individual who champions inclusion and diversity within their company. American Water see inclusion and diversity as vital elements in creating an environment in which our differences are celebrated and contribute to our success. It's also critical to us that our employees reflect the communities that we're privileged to serve. So congratulations, Bruce, for living our values. 
So it was good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees driving efficiencies and quality results all to benefit our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Susan for more detail on our financial performance."

I'll start on Slide 15 with a summary of the results.

I'll start on Slide 15 with a summary of the results. Second quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.94 per share compared to $0.91 per share in 2018. 2018 results included an $0.08 per share after-tax benefit from the Freedom Industries insurance settlement. Excluding the 2018 benefit, adjusted earnings per share were up 13.3% driven primarily by growth in the Regulated Businesses but also strong growth in the Market-Based Businesses and some earnings from the parent. 
The Regulated business segment was up $0.01 per share compared to adjusted 2018 earnings increasing 1.2%. Susan and Walter already discussed the unusually wet weather conditions in the second quarter. And without that unfavorable impact, the Regulated business segment results would have increased by 7%, which is well in line with our rate base and EPS growth objectives. Both the Market-Based Businesses and the parent company were each up $0.05 per share.
Our 2019 adjusted earnings through June 30 were $1.55 per share or a 9.2% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.02 per share. Without the unfavorable weather impact, the regulated business segment results would have increased by about 5% year-to-date compared to last year. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.09 per share, primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results improved by $0.02 per share year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 16, let me walk through the adjusted quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.01 per share in total, as I mentioned. We had a $0.10 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. You'll also see on this slide the $0.05 per share quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of weather. 
Next, O&M expense increased slightly and depreciation and interest increased $0.03 per share, mainly to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. 
Turning to the Market-Based Businesses, the $0.05 per share increase was mainly from our Homeowner Services Group due to growth in partnerships and the full year impact from the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions in 2018. The Military Services Group and Keystone combined for $0.01 per share increase and another $0.01 from the final wrap-up of the exit of operations in Canada. Finally, the parent recognized earnings of $0.03 per share due to the sale of the legacy investment. The timing of expenses and other items added $0.04 per share in the quarter, which you'll note is largely gone on a year-to-date basis. As expected, interest expense was $0.02 per share drag in the quarter.
Moving on to Slide 17, 6 months adjusted EPS increased 9.2% year-over-year even with the weather impact. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously also explain the year-over-year results. 
Moving to Slide 18, as Walter detailed, it has been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $84 million in annualized new revenues this year, and this includes $45 million from rate cases and $39 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 2 rate cases and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $39 million. Our weighted average authorized ROE stands at 9.8%.
The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 19, because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be in the top half of the 7% to 10% range.
Moving to Slide 20, as noted in the release, on July 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share payable on September 4. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 17, 2019. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth.
We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue that growth consistent with our EPS growth expectation at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. We continue to deliver results as expected. For the 12 months ended June 2019, our total company consolidated return on equity was 10.2%. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations, continue to provide excellent value for our investors. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Susan."

Today, our CFO, Susan Hardwick will cover our second quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. 
American Water employees delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the significant impact of unusually wet weather throughout our service area. I'll highlight just a few of their accomplishments this quarter. 
First, we continue to deliver strong consistent growth and financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 13.3% compared to last year despite the wet weather I just mentioned. As a reminder, weather impacts typically occur in the third quarter but the historical rains and flooding this second quarter resulted in a $0.05 quarter-over-quarter difference. We saw growth in our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses during this quarter. We added more than 37,000 customer connections year-to-date through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. This includes welcoming over 23,000 wastewater customers in Alton, Illinois where we have been privileged to provide water for our company's entire 133-year history. Alton is also home to one of our Regulated Businesses customer care centers and the Homeowner Services customer center. We finalized general rate cases in Kentucky and Indiana where we have invested more than $600 million combined since our last cases to ensure clean, safe and reliable water for our customers. Walter will give more details on our regulatory activities in just a minute.
All 3 Market-Based Businesses grew with a especially strong growth from Homeowner Services. We were proud to join Philadelphia officials in May to announce that our water and sewer line action partnership is already having a significant positive impact to customers in the Philadelphia community. 
Also in the quarter, we successfully completed a $1.1 billion debt offering and S&P affirmed our A corporate credit rating with a stable outlook. We're pleased with S&P's decision. Having access to capital at lower debt cost enhances our ability to make needed investments while minimizing the cost impact on the customers we serve. 
Slide 6 shows our year-to-date performance. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations. We invested almost $800 million during the first half of the year with virtually all dedicated to our Regulated Businesses. We expect to invest $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the year, reflecting both the strong acquisition closings this year, along with continued and growing need for infrastructure investment in our regulated state. And as I mentioned, results for our Market-Based Businesses continues to be strong. 
Moving to Slide 7, with this continued strong performance and our commitment to the execution of our strategy, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. American Water will invest $8 billion to $8.6 billion from 2019 through 2023 as we continue to invest in our infrastructure. We have a line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023, which is a key element of our commitment to ensure affordability for our customers. And under our 2019 to 2023 plan, we do not see the need to issue equity. 
In summary, we remain on track to meet our long-term earnings growth target in the top half of the 7% to 10% range. Now Walter will give a more detailed update on our Regulated business."

As Susan said, our Regulated Businesses had a solid first half of the year in spite of a very wet weather in the second quarter. We continue on a steady path making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while we continue to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. We also continue to grow through acquisitions, closing on 12 transactions through the end of July. Let me start on Slide 9 with the weather impact for the quarter. As a reminder, we had a $0.01 positive benefit from weather, warmer weather in the second quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2019, we experienced significant precipitation in the Midwest and the Northeast. In fact, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the past 12 months in the United States have been the wettest on record and that 2019 had the most rains since records began 124 years ago. 
As a result of these extreme conditions, we had a total quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of $0.05. By the way, this little meteorologist is the grandson of our Vice President of Regulatory Services. 
Turning to Slide 10, we continue to have a very busy regulatory calendar focused on needed investment with a keen eye toward reducing customer bill impacts. I'll cover a few highlights. 
In Kentucky, we received approval from the Kentucky Service Commission for new water rates effective June 28, with an authorized return on equity of 9.7% and an equity ratio of 48.9%. The case was driven by more than $100 million in investment since following our last rate case in January 2016. The Kentucky Public Service Commission also approved the implementation of a qualified infrastructure program charge that will allow the company to replace aging pipes as well as other assets while reducing regulatory lag. This is now our 9th state with infrastructure surcharge mechanism in place. 
Moving to Indiana. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the settlement agreement reached with other parties in June with an authorized return on equity of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.41%. The primary driver of the case was the company's investment of $542 million since our last case in 2014. 
California American Water put into effect this 2018 rate case decision on May 11, 2019, resulting in a $4 million annualized increase in authorized revenue. The decision also approved $103 million in infrastructure improvements. Rates were consolidated for several service areas in Northern California to ensure reliable water service at an affordable price. 
We also have 2 pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In Virginia, we filed a general rate case in November 2018 requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. 
California American Water filed for new rates covering 2021 through 2023, requesting an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request includes $197 million for infrastructure improvements throughout the state. We expect the decision on the case in late 2020 with new rates taking effect on January 1, 2021. 
Moving on to slide 11. We continue to grow the size of our footprint with 12 water and wastewater acquisitions occurring in 7 states. These closed acquisitions added 30,700 customer connections, including 23,000 new wastewater customer connections from the Alton, Illinois acquisition. Alton Mayor Brant Walker stated that the sale of the wastewater system to Illinois American Water is ""in the city's best interest and provide significant net proceeds to help fund other city needs and priorities."" This is another example of how we're growing wastewater in areas where we serve water customers, leveraging our tremendous expertise and our commitment to the communities we serve.
We also welcomed 6,500 customer connections through organic growth and we'll welcome another 38,200 customer connections through 29 signed agreements in 8 states. This agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country.
Moving to Slide 12, customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. We invested $792 million in our regulated operations in the first half of this year, with $712 million dedicated to infrastructure improvements and $80 million funding acquisitions for our regulated business. We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through our continued focus on controlling O&M costs. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from our employees and our customers. As you can see, we continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 31.5% by 2023.
For example, we've developed and started to deploy a web-based work management software for our field service representatives. This software will put the control of daily planning in the hands of local operations, allowing our field service representatives to manage and optimize around work, quickly reroute to emergency orders and balance employees' work to ensure we're meeting the needs of our customers. 
Moving to Slide 13. I want to highlight the importance of the investments that we've made to improve the resiliency of our assets. What you're looking at is a photo of the recent flood in Davenport, Iowa, when the Mississippi River crested at a record 22.7 feet. The picture was taken from the vantage point of our water treatment plant and is proof that our focus on the resiliency of our systems benefits our communities. 
This particular plant is secured and protected by a 2,200-foot long floodwall that was completed in 2013. The $11.8 million project was a successful partnership between Iowa American Water and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, safeguarding the drinking water supply for over 130,000 residents in the Iowa quad cities. This is only one example of how we continue to make necessary investments to ensure that our customers receive reliable, high-quality water service. 
Finally, I want to recognize our Illinois American Water President, Bruce Hauk, who was awarded the 2019 Inclusion and Diversity Award by the National Black Chamber of Commerce during its annual conference last week. This award is presented annually to an individual who champions inclusion and diversity within their company. American Water sees inclusion and diversity as vital elements in creating an environment in which our differences are celebrated and contribute to our success. It's also critical to us that our employees reflect the communities that we're privileged to serve. So congratulations, Bruce, for living our values. 
So it was good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees driving efficiencies and quality results all to benefit our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan for more detail on our financial performance."

I'll start on Slide 15 with a summary of results. Second quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.94 per share compared to $0.91 per share in 2018. 2018 results included an $0.08 per share after-tax be",776,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 15 with a summary of results. Second quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.94 per share compared to $0.91 per share in 2018. 2018 results included an $0.08 per share after-tax benefit from the Freedom Industries insurance settlement. Excluding the 2018 benefit, adjusted earnings per share were up 13.3% driven primarily by growth in the Regulated Businesses but also strong growth in the Market-Based Businesses and some earnings from the parent. 
The Regulated business segment was up $0.01 per share compared to adjusted 2018 earnings increasing 1.2%. Susan and Walter already discussed the unusually wet weather conditions in the second quarter. And without that unfavorable impact, the Regulated business segment results would have increased by 7%, which is well in line with our rate base and EPS growth objectives. Both the Market-Based Businesses and the parent company were each up $0.05 per share.
Our 2019 adjusted earnings through June 30 were $1.55 per share or a 9.2% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.02 per share. Without the unfavorable weather impact, the regulated business segment results would have increased by about 5% year-to-date compared to last year. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.09 per share, primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results improved by $0.02 per share year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 16, let me walk through the adjusted quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.01 per share in total, as I mentioned. We had a $0.10 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. You'll also see on this slide the $0.05 per share quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of weather. 
Next, O&M expense increased slightly and depreciation and interest increased $0.03 per share, mainly to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. 
Turning to the Market-Based Businesses, the $0.05 per share increase was mainly from our Homeowner Services Group due to growth in partnerships and the full year impact from the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions in 2018. The Military Services Group and Keystone combined for $0.01 per share increase and another $0.01 from the final wrap-up of the exit of operations in Canada. Finally, the parent recognized earnings of $0.03 per share due to the sale of the legacy investment. The timing of expenses and other items added $0.04 per share in the quarter, which you'll note is largely gone on a year-to-date basis. And as expected, interest expense was $0.02 per share drag in the quarter.
Moving on to Slide 17, 6-month adjusted EPS increased 9.2% year-over-year even with the weather impact. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously also explain the year-over-year results. 
Moving to Slide 18, as Walter detailed, it has been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $84 million in annualized new revenues this year, and this includes $45 million from rate cases and $39 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 2 rate cases and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $39 million. Our weighted average authorized ROE stands at 9.8%.
The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 19, because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be in the top half of the 7% to 10% range.
Moving to Slide 20, as noted in the release, on July 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share payable on September 4. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 17, 2019. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth.
We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue that growth consistent with our EPS growth expectation at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. We continue to deliver results as expected. For the 12 months ended June 2019, our total company consolidated return on equity was 10.2%. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations, continue to provide excellent value for our investors. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Susan."

They will make our already outstanding Board even better. This matters to those who invest in American Water. When deciding the value of an investment, we know that the profiles of our traditional investors are evolving and expanding. We've described some of those profiles on this page. We know that our traditional utility investors need us to keep our conservative, predictable, low risk and dividend growth priorities. We also know that the growing power of ESG investors is very consistent and complementary to our environmental leadership commitment, our leading governance structure and our focus on our employees, customers and communities. Research shows some pretty interesting facts on who some of these investors are, which we show on the slide. Likewise, the uniqueness of the different sectors we touch provide a choice for both domestic and international investors looking for infrastructure, environment, growth, water and other specific personal interest areas. Even with somewhat varying priorities, we know that all of our investors expect predictable financial performance, successful execution of our strategies, transparency, integrity, strong governance and a deep commitment to our customers and communities.

American Water employees delivered strong",555,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Susan Hardwick will cover our second quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. 
American Water employees delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the significant impact of unusually wet weather throughout our service area. I'll highlight just a few of their accomplishments this quarter. 
First, we continue to deliver strong consistent growth and financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 13.3% compared to last year despite the wet weather I just mentioned. As a reminder, weather impacts typically occur in the third quarter but the historical rains and flooding this second quarter resulted in a $0.05 quarter-over-quarter difference. We saw growth in our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses during this quarter. We added more than 37,000 customer connections year-to-date through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. This includes welcoming over 23,000 wastewater customers in Alton, Illinois where we have been privileged to provide water for our company's entire 133-year history. Alton is also home to one of our Regulated Businesses customer care centers and the Homeowner Services customer center. We finalized general rate cases in Kentucky and Indiana where we have invested more than $600 million combined since our last cases to ensure clean, safe and reliable water for our customers. Walter will give more details on our regulatory activities in just a minute.
All 3 Market-Based Businesses grew with an especially strong growth from Homeowner Services. We were proud to join Philadelphia officials in May to announce that our water and sewer line action partnership is already having a significant positive impact to customers in the Philadelphia community. 
Also in the quarter, we successfully completed a $1.1 billion debt offering and S&P affirmed our A corporate credit rating with a stable outlook. We're pleased with S&P's decision. Having access to capital at lower debt cost enhances our ability to make needed investments while minimizing the cost impact on the customers we serve. 
Slide 6 shows our year-to-date performance. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations. We invested almost $800 million during the first half of the year with virtually all dedicated to our Regulated Businesses. We expect to invest $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the year, reflecting both the strong acquisition closings this year, along with continued and growing need for infrastructure investment in our regulated state. And as I mentioned, results for our Market-Based Businesses continues to be strong. 
Moving to Slide 7, with this continued strong performance and our commitment to the execution of our strategy, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. American Water will invest $8 billion to $8.6 billion from 2019 through 2023 as we continue to invest in our infrastructure. We have a line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023, which is a key element of our commitment to ensure affordability for our customers. And under our 2019 to 2023 plan, we do not see the need to issue equity. 
In summary, we remain on track to meet our long-term earnings growth target in the top half of the 7% to 10% range. Now Walter will give a more detailed update on our Regulated business."

As Susan said, our Regulated Businesses had a solid first half of the year in spite of a very wet weather in the second quarter. We continue on a steady path making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while we continue to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. We also continue to grow through acquisitions, closing on 12 transactions through the end of July. Let me start on Slide 9 with the weather impact for the quarter. As a reminder, we had a $0.01 positive benefit from weather, warmer weather in the second quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2019, we experienced significant precipitation in the Midwest and the Northeast. In fact, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the past 12 months in the United States have been the wettest on record and that 2019 had the most rains since records began 124 years ago. 
As a result of these extreme conditions, we had a total quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of $0.05. By the way, this little meteorologist is the grandson of our Vice President of Regulatory Services. 
Turning to Slide 10, we continue to have a very busy regulatory calendar focused on needed investment with a keen eye toward reducing customer bill impacts. I'll cover a few highlights. 
In Kentucky, we received approval from the Kentucky Service Commission for new water rates effective June 28, with an authorized return on equity of 9.7% and an equity ratio of 48.9%. The case was driven by more than $100 million in investment since following our last rate case in January 2016. The Kentucky Public Service Commission also approved the implementation of a qualified infrastructure program charge that will allow the company to replace aging pipes as well as other assets while reducing regulatory lag. This is now our 9th state with infrastructure surcharge mechanism in place. 
Moving to Indiana. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the settlement agreement reached with other parties in June with an authorized return on equity of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.41%. The primary driver of the case was the company's investment of $542 million since our last case in 2014. 
California American Water put into effect this 2018 rate case decision on May 11, 2019, resulting in a $4 million annualized increase in authorized revenue. The decision also approved $103 million in infrastructure improvements. Rates were consolidated for several service areas in Northern California to ensure reliable water service at an affordable price. 
We also have 2 pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In Virginia, we filed a general rate case in November 2018 requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. 
California American Water filed for new rates covering 2021 through 2023, requesting an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request includes $197 million for infrastructure improvements throughout the state. We expect the decision on the case in late 2020 with new rates taking effect on January 1, 2021. 
Moving on to slide 11. We continue to grow the size of our footprint with 12 water and wastewater acquisitions occurring in 7 states. These closed acquisitions added 30,700 customer connections, including 23,000 new wastewater customer connections from the Alton, Illinois acquisition. Alton Mayor Brant Walker stated that the sale of the wastewater system to Illinois American Water is ""in the city's best interest and provide significant net proceeds to help fund other city needs and priorities."" This is another example of how we're growing wastewater in areas where we serve water customers, leveraging our tremendous expertise and our commitment to the communities we serve.
We also welcomed 6,500 customer connections through organic growth and we'll welcome another 38,200 customer connections through 29 signed agreements in 8 states. These agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country.
Moving to Slide 12, customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. We invested $792 million in our regulated operations in the first half of this year, with $712 million dedicated to infrastructure improvements and $80 million funding acquisitions for our regulated business. We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through our continued focus on controlling O&M costs. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from our employees and our customers. As you can see, we continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 31.5% by 2023.
For example, we've developed and started to deploy a web-based work management software for our field service representatives. This software will put the control of daily planning in the hands of local operations, allowing our field service representatives to manage and optimize around work, quickly reroute to emergency orders and balance employees' work to ensure we're meeting the needs of our customers. 
Moving to Slide 13. I want to highlight the importance of the investments that we've made to improve the resiliency of our assets. What you're looking at is a photo of the recent flood in Davenport, Iowa, when the Mississippi River crested at a record 22.7 feet. The picture was taken from the vantage point of our water treatment plant and is proof that our focus on the resiliency of our systems benefits our communities. 
This particular plant is secured and protected by a 2,200-foot long floodwall that was completed in 2013. The $11.8 million project was a successful partnership between Iowa American Water and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, safeguarding the drinking water supply for over 130,000 residents in the Iowa quad cities. This is only one example of how we continue to make necessary investments to ensure that our customers receive reliable, high-quality water service. 
Finally, I want to recognize our Illinois American Water President, Bruce Hauk, who was awarded the 2019 Inclusion and Diversity Award by the National Black Chamber of Commerce during its annual conference last week. This award is presented annually to an individual who champions inclusion and diversity within their company. American Water sees inclusion and diversity as vital elements in creating an environment in which our differences are celebrated and contribute to our success. It's also critical to us that our employees reflect the communities that we're privileged to serve. So congratulations, Bruce, for living our values. 
So it was good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees driving efficiencies and quality results all to benefit our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan for more detail on our financial performance."

I'll start on Slide 15 with a summary of results. Second quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.94 per share compared to $0.91 per share in 2018. 2018 results included an $0.08 per share after-tax benefit from the Freedom Industries insurance settlement. Excluding the 2018 benefit, adjusted earnings per share were up 13.3%, driven primarily by growth in the Regulated Businesses but also strong growth in the Market-Based Businesses and some earnings from the parent. 
The Regulated business segment was up $0.01 per share compared to adjusted 2018 earnings increasing 1.2%. Susan and Walter already discussed the unusually wet weather conditions in the second quarter. And without that unfavorable impact, the Regulated business segment results would have increased by 7%, which is well in line with our rate base and EPS growth objectives. Both the Market-Based Businesses and the parent company were each up $0.05 per share.
Our 2019 adjusted earnings through June 30 were $1.55 per share or a 9.2% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.02 per share. Without the unfavorable weather impact, the regulated business segment results would have increased by about 5% year-to-date compared to last year. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.09 per share, primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results improved by $0.02 per share year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 16, let me walk through the adjusted quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.01 per share in total, as I mentioned. We had a $0.10 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. You'll also see on this slide the $0.05 per share quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of weather. 
Next, O&M expense increased slightly and depreciation and interest increased $0.03 per share, mainly to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. 
Turning to the Market-Based Businesses, the $0.05 per share increase was mainly from our Homeowner Services Group due to growth in partnerships and the full year impact from the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions in 2018. The Military Services Group and Keystone combined for $0.01 per share increase and another $0.01 from the final wrap-up of the exit of operations in Canada. Finally, the parent recognized earnings of $0.03 per share due to the sale of the legacy investment. The timing of expenses and other items added $0.04 per share in the quarter, which you'll note is largely gone on a year-to-date basis. And as expected, interest expense was $0.02 per share drag in the quarter.
Moving on to Slide 17, 6-month adjusted EPS increased 9.2% year-over-year even with the weather impact. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously also explain the year-over-year results. 
Moving to Slide 18, as Walter detailed, it has been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $84 million in annualized new revenues this year, and this includes $45 million from rate cases and $39 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 2 rate cases and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $39 million. Our weighted average authorized ROE stands at 9.8%.
The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 19, because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be in the top half of the 7% to 10% range.
Moving to Slide 20, as noted in the release, on July 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share payable on September 4. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 17, 2019. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth.
We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue that growth consistent with our EPS growth expectation at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. We continue to deliver results as expected. For the 12 months ended June 2019, our total company consolidated return on equity was 10.2%. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations, continue to provide excellent value for our investors. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Susan."

Last week, we were very pleased to add 3 new independent directors to our American Water Board: Kimberly Harris, Patricia and Lloyd Yates are highly seasoned utility executives who bring combined strength and expertise in regulatory, operations, business continuity, technology, people leadership and a deep commitment to customers and community. They will make our already outstanding Board even better. This matters to those who invest in American Water. When deciding the value of an investment, we know that the profiles of our traditional investors are evolving and expanding. We've described some of those profiles on this page. We know that our traditional utility investors need us to keep our conservative, predictable, low risk and dividend growth priorities. We also know that the growing power of ESG investors is very consistent and complementary to our environmental leadership commitment, our leading governance structure and our focus on our employees, customers and communities. Research shows some pretty interesting facts on who some of these investors are, which we show on the slide. Likewise, the uniqueness of the different sectors we touch provide a choice for both domestic and international investors looking for infrastructure, environment, growth, water and other specific personal interest areas. Even with somewhat varying priorities, we know that all of our investors expect predictable financial performance, successful execution of our strategies, transparency, integrity, strong governance and a deep commitment to our customers and communities. That's the American Water story and it's one that we're proud to tell. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Susan Hardwick will cover our second quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. American Water employees delivered strong",555,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Susan Hardwick will cover our second quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. 
American Water employees delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the significant impact of unusually wet weather throughout our service area. I'll highlight just a few of their accomplishments this quarter. 
First, we continue to deliver strong consistent growth and financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 13.3% compared to last year despite the wet weather I just mentioned. As a reminder, weather impacts typically occur in the third quarter but the historical rains and flooding this second quarter resulted in a $0.05 quarter-over-quarter difference. 
We saw growth in our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses during this quarter. We added more than 37,000 customer connections year-to-date through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. This includes welcoming over 23,000 wastewater customers in Alton, Illinois where we have been privileged to provide water for our company's entire 133-year history. Alton is also home to one of our Regulated Businesses customer care centers and the Homeowner Services customer center. We finalized general rate cases in Kentucky and Indiana where we have invested more than $600 million combined since our last cases to ensure clean, safe and reliable water for our customers. Walter will give more details on our regulatory activities in just a minute.
All 3 Market-Based Businesses grew with an especially strong growth from Homeowner Services. We were proud to join Philadelphia officials in May to announce that our water and sewer line action partnership is already having a significant positive impact to customers in the Philadelphia community. 
Also in the quarter, we successfully completed a $1.1 billion debt offering and S&P affirmed our A corporate credit rating with a stable outlook. We're pleased with S&P's decision. Having access to capital at lower debt cost enhances our ability to make needed investments while minimizing the cost impact on the customers we serve. 
Slide 6 shows our year-to-date performance. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations. We invested almost $800 million during the first half of the year with virtually all dedicated to our Regulated Businesses. We expect to invest $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the year, reflecting both the strong acquisition closings this year, along with continued and growing need for infrastructure investment in our regulated state. And as I mentioned, results for our Market-Based Businesses continues to be strong. 
Moving to Slide 7, with this continued strong performance and our commitment to the execution of our strategy, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. American Water will invest $8 billion to $8.6 billion from 2019 through 2023 as we continue to invest in our infrastructure. We have a line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023, which is a key element of our commitment to ensure affordability for our customers. And under our 2019 to 2023 plan, we do not see the need to issue equity. 
In summary, we remain on track to meet our long-term earnings growth target in the top half of the 7% to 10% range. Now Walter will give a more detailed update on our Regulated business."

As Susan said, our Regulated Businesses had a solid first half of the year in spite of a very wet weather in the second quarter. We continue on a steady path making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while we continue to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. We also continue to grow through acquisitions, closing on 12 transactions through the end of July. Let me start on Slide 9 with the weather impact for the quarter. As a reminder, we had a $0.01 positive benefit from weather, warmer weather in the second quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2019, we experienced significant precipitation in the Midwest and the Northeast. In fact, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the past 12 months in the United States have been the wettest on record and that 2019 had the most rains since records began 124 years ago. 
As a result of these extreme conditions, we had a total quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of $0.05. By the way, this little meteorologist is the grandson of our Vice President of Regulatory Services. 
Turning to Slide 10, we continue to have a very busy regulatory calendar focused on needed investment with a keen eye toward reducing customer bill impacts. I'll cover a few highlights. 
In Kentucky, we received approval from the Kentucky Service Commission for new water rates effective June 28, with an authorized return on equity of 9.7% and an equity ratio of 48.9%. The case was driven by more than $100 million in investment since following our last rate case in January 2016. The Kentucky Public Service Commission also approved the implementation of a qualified infrastructure program charge that will allow the company to replace aging pipes as well as other assets while reducing regulatory lag. This is now our 9th state with infrastructure surcharge mechanism in place. 
Moving to Indiana. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the settlement agreement reached with other parties in June with an authorized return on equity of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.41%. The primary driver of the case was the company's investment of $542 million since our last case in 2014. 
California American Water put into effect this 2018 rate case decision on May 11, 2019, resulting in a $4 million annualized increase in authorized revenue. The decision also approved $103 million in infrastructure improvements. Rates were consolidated for several service areas in Northern California to ensure reliable water service at an affordable price. 
We also have 2 pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In Virginia, we filed a general rate case in November 2018 requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. 
California American Water filed for new rates covering 2021 through 2023, requesting an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request includes $197 million for infrastructure improvements throughout the state. We expect the decision on the case in late 2020 with new rates taking effect on January 1, 2021. 
Moving on to slide 11. We continue to grow the size of our footprint with 12 water and wastewater acquisitions occurring in 7 states. These closed acquisitions added 30,700 customer connections, including 23,000 new wastewater customer connections from the Alton, Illinois acquisition. Alton Mayor Brant Walker stated that the sale of the wastewater system to Illinois American Water is ""in the city's best interest and provide significant net proceeds to help fund other city needs and priorities."" This is another example of how we're growing wastewater in areas where we serve water customers, leveraging our tremendous expertise and our commitment to the communities we serve.
We also welcomed 6,500 customer connections through organic growth and we'll welcome another 38,200 customer connections through 29 signed agreements in 8 states. These agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country.
Moving to Slide 12, customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. We invested $792 million in our regulated operations in the first half of this year, with $712 million dedicated to infrastructure improvements and $80 million funding acquisitions for our regulated business. 
We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through our continued focus on controlling O&M costs. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from our employees and our customers. As you can see, we continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 31.5% by 2023.
For example, we've developed and started to deploy a web-based work management software for our field service representatives. This software will put the control of daily planning in the hands of local operations, allowing our field service representatives to manage and optimize around work, quickly reroute to emergency orders and balance employees' work to ensure we're meeting the needs of our customers. 
Moving to Slide 13. I want to highlight the importance of the investments that we've made to improve the resiliency of our assets. What you're looking at is a photo of the recent flood in Davenport, Iowa, when the Mississippi River crested at a record 22.7 feet. The picture was taken from the vantage point of our water treatment plant and is proof that our focus on the resiliency of our systems benefits our communities. 
This particular plant is secured and protected by a 2,200-foot long floodwall that was completed in 2013. The $11.8 million project was a successful partnership between Iowa American Water and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, safeguarding the drinking water supply for over 130,000 residents in the Iowa quad cities. This is only one example of how we continue to make necessary investments to ensure that our customers receive reliable, high-quality water service. 
Finally, I want to recognize our Illinois American Water President, Bruce Hauk, who was awarded the 2019 Inclusion and Diversity Award by the National Black Chamber of Commerce during its annual conference last week. This award is presented annually to an individual who champions inclusion and diversity within their company. American Water sees inclusion and diversity as vital elements in creating an environment in which our differences are celebrated and contribute to our success. It's also critical to us that our employees reflect the communities that we're privileged to serve. So congratulations, Bruce, for living our values. 
So it was good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees driving efficiencies and quality results all to benefit our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan for more detail on our financial performance."

I'll start on Slide 15 with a summary of results.

I'll start on Slide 15 with a summary of results. Second quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.94 per share compared to $0.91 per share in 2018. 2018 results included an $0.08 per share after-tax benefit from the Freedom Industries insurance settlement. Excluding the 2018 benefit, adjusted earnings per share were up 13.3% driven primarily by growth in the Regulated Businesses but also strong growth in the Market-Based Businesses and some earnings from the parent. 
The Regulated business segment was up $0.01 per share compared to adjusted 2018 earnings increasing 1.2%. Susan and Walter already discussed the unusually wet weather conditions in the second quarter. And without that unfavorable impact, the Regulated business segment results would have increased by 7%, which is well in line with our rate base and EPS growth objectives. Both the Market-Based Businesses and the parent company were each up $0.05 per share.
Our 2019 adjusted earnings through June 30 were $1.55 per share or a 9.2% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.02 per share. Without the unfavorable weather impact, the regulated business segment results would have increased by about 5% year-to-date compared to last year. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.09 per share, primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results improved by $0.02 per share year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 16, let me walk through the adjusted quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.01 per share in total, as I mentioned. We had a $0.10 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. You'll also see on this slide the $0.05 per share quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of weather. 
Next, O&M expense increased slightly and depreciation and interest increased $0.03 per share, mainly to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. 
Turning to the Market-Based Businesses, the $0.05 per share increase was mainly from our Homeowner Services Group due to growth in partnerships and the full year impact from the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions in 2018. The Military Services Group and Keystone combined for $0.01 per share increase and another $0.01 from the final wrap-up of the exit of operations in Canada. Finally, the parent recognized earnings of $0.03 per share due to the sale of the legacy investment. The timing of expenses and other items added $0.04 per share in the quarter, which you'll note is largely gone on a year-to-date basis. And as expected, interest expense was $0.02 per share drag in the quarter.
Moving on to Slide 17, 6-month adjusted EPS increased 9.2% year-over-year even with the weather impact. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously also explain the year-over-year results. 
Moving to Slide 18, as Walter detailed, it has been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $84 million in annualized new revenues this year, and this includes $45 million from rate cases and $39 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 2 rate cases and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $39 million. Our weighted average authorized ROE stands at 9.8%.
The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 19. Because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be in the top half of the 7% to 10% range.
Moving to Slide 20, as noted in the release, on July 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share payable on September 4. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 17, 2019. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth.
We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue that growth consistent with our EPS growth expectation at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. We continue to deliver results as expected. For the 12 months ended June 2019, our total company consolidated return on equity was 10.2%. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations, continue to provide excellent value for our investors. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Susan."

They will make our already outstanding Board even better. This matters to those who invest in American Water. 
When deciding the value of an investment, we know that the profiles of our traditional investors are evolving and expanding. We've described some of those profiles on this page. We know that our traditional utility investors need us to keep our conservative, predictable, low risk and dividend growth priorities. We also know that the growing power of ESG investors is very consistent and complementary to our environmental leadership commitment, our leading governance structure and our focus on our employees, customers and communities. Research shows some pretty interesting facts on who some of these investors are, which we show on the slide. 
Likewise, the uniqueness of the different sectors we touch provide a choice for both domestic and international investors looking for infrastructure, environment, growth, water and other specific personal interest areas. Even with somewhat varying priorities, we know that all of our investors expect predictable financial performance, successful execution of our strategies, transparency, integrity, strong governance and a deep commitment to our customers and communities. That's the American Water story and it's one that we're proud to tell.

Today, our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover our third quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations.
American Water employees continue to deliver strong results. Let me highlight just a few of our third quarter accomplishments. We continue to have strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 10.8% compared to last year's third quarter, and we saw growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses.
In our Regulated business, we've added more than 57,000 customer connections year-to-date. This includes of 46,900 customers through closed acquisitions and 10,400 through organic growth in our existing service areas.
We most recently closed on the water asset of Stilton of Boro Pennsylvania and Lake Station, Indiana as well as the wastewater asset of Exeter Township in Pennsylvania. We're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees.
Additionally, in the coming months, we will welcome an additional 26,400 customer connections through agreements that are signed and pending.
Moving to our Market-Based businesses. We're extremely honored to be awarded Department of Defense contracts for the water and wastewater systems at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.
Joint Base San Antonio includes Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis and Lackland Air Force Base. These installations support over 187,000 jobs across the state of Texas. The United States Military Academy at West Point is the oldest continually operated army post in the United States. The campus is home to 4,400 cadets and was once home to our own COO, Walter Lynch, a West Point alumnus and army veteran.
The opportunity to expand our military footprint to 16 bases across the country is a testament to American Water's industry-leading water research, development and operational excellence. It's a privilege to ensure the delivery of safe, clean and reliable water and wastewater services for our country's military members and their families.
With these continued strong performance and our disciplined approach to our business, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 to $3.64 per share from $3.54 to $3.64.
Moving to Slide 6. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. Through September 30, we invested around $1.3 billion, with about $1.2 billion into our existing regulated infrastructure and around $85 million in regulated acquisition closings. We expect to invest approximately $1.9 billion total for the full year, with projections of more than $260 million for regulated acquisition closing and around $1.7 billion to address the continued and growing need for infrastructure investment across our footprint.
Results for our Market-Based businesses are also strong, contributing to both net income growth and cash flow generation, given the capital light nature of these businesses. 
So in summary, we will continue to invest in our infrastructure, and we have line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023, which is key to ensuring affordability for our customers as we make these much needed investments.
And finally, we remain on track to meet our 7% to 10% long-term earnings growth target. Now Walter will give a more detailed update on our Regulated Businesses."

On Slide 8, let me touch briefly on the weather. As you recall, we had an unusually wet weather in the second quarter of 2019, which led to auto quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of $0.05. This quarter has been more typical. And once again, you can see how our geographic diversity helps mitigate weather variability. For example, this quarter, New Jersey American Water experienced at or below average precipitation, which offset Missouri's slightly above average precipitation. As a result, weather had no material impact on our revenues for the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 9. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights, starting with our 2 pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect the decision in the first quarter of 2020.
California American Water filed for new rates this past July. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements for the 2021 to 2022 capital test years. We expect the decision on this case in late 2020, with new rates to take effect by January 1, 2021.
In other activities. Several bills were recently signed into law in Indiana by Governor Hook. First, House Bill 1406, known as the Water Infrastructure Funding Act, establishes the first state appropriation of $20 million per year for water infrastructure investment. Paired with another bill, Senate Bill 4, this combined legislation supports regional water planning and the reduction of water loss caused by poor or aging infrastructure. The goal is to promote a consistent approach to providing clean and safe water across all water systems in Indiana.
The third bill, Senate Bill 472, enhances Indiana's version of fair market value legislation, by now including qualified none municipal systems. Previously, the legislation only covered distressed municipal systems. In Pennsylvania, on October 3, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our proposal to replace customer owned light service lines in accordance with the Act 120. This act authorizes the cost associated with the replacement of the customer owned portion of service lines to be included in the regulated utilities rate base.
Turning to Slide 10. We continue to grow the size of our footprint with 19 acquisitions occurring in 8 states, totaling 46,900 new customer connections. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania American Water completed the acquisition of both the Stilton Water and Exeter Wastewater Systems. The Stilton Water System added approximately 2,400 new water connections. The sale of the water system will allow the borrower to eliminate its existing water debt and invest in capital project.
In Exeter Pennsylvania where we've been providing water service for more than 17 years, we welcomed approximately 9,000 wastewater connections. According to township manager John Granger, ""The sale of the wastewater treatment plant and collection system in the Pennsylvania American Water is a great benefit to current and future residents of Exeter. The plant and system were becoming an increasing burden on the Township as federal and state regulations were becoming too difficult for the Township to manage."" This is a great example of how communities are better, simply because we're there. This marks Pennsylvania American Water's fifth acquisition in the state in 2019.
Indiana American Water also closed on the Lake Station Water System earlier this month, adding about 3,300 water connections to the existing Indiana customer base.
We also welcomed 10,400 new customer connections from organic growth to date, and we'll welcome another 26,400 customer connections through 24 signed agreements in 10 states. As we've shared with you before, with the consistent pipeline of opportunities we see in the water and wastewater industry, we're confident in our disciplined growth strategy and our ability to provide solutions across the nation.
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to balance making critical investments to ensure reliable service while limiting the impact our customers' bills. In the first 9 months, we've invested approximately $1.2 billion in our existing regulated infrastructure. At the same time, we're making progress towards long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.5% by 2023. To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. However, over the last 9 years, we welcomed approximately 338,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers.
Moving to Slide 12. We're pleased that our new customer service site, My Water, is now live for all American Water customers nationwide. Customers are now able to access their accounts through this mobile friendly site. My Water allows customers to easily make payments, view their water usage history and receive alert notifications from any location, 24 hours a days, 7 days a week.
We launched this new platform by listening to our customers who told us they wanted to more easily manage their accounts online. Since the launch, we received very positive customer feedback, especially on ease of use. This is just another great example of how our customers are at the center of everything we do.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan for more details on the financial performance."

Let me start on Slide 15 with a summary of results. 
Third quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $1.33 per share compared to $1.04 in 2018. 2018 results included a $0.06 gain from the sale of the majority of the contracts in our Contract Services Group in a $0.22 charge from the Keystone impairment. Excluding these 2 adjustments in 2018, adjusted earnings per share were up 10.8% primarily driven by growth in the regulated business.
The Regulated business segment results were up $0.12 per share or an increase of 10.3% compared to 2018. The Market-Based Business results were about flat in the [ parent ] results improved $0.01 per share compared to 2018.
Our 2019 adjusted earnings through September 30 were $2.88 per share or a 10.3% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.15 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.09 per share. And finally, the parent results improved by $0.03 per share year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Let me walk through the details of the quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.12 in total. We had an $0.11 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Also, O&M expenses decreased $0.02 per share for the quarter as a result of the continued focus on cost management and higher cost in the third quarter of 2018 related primarily to the New York American Water settlement.
Depreciation and interest increased $0.01 per share primarily to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. The Market-Based Business results for the quarter were similar to last year on continued strong performance.
Finally, earnings at the parent were $0.01 per share, reflective of the impact of a lower consolidated and effective tax rate, offset somewhat by increased interest expense.
Moving to Slide 16. 9 months ended September 30, 2019 adjusted EPS increased 10.3% year-over-year, even with the weather negatively impacting the second quarter of 2019. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously for the regulated business also explain the year-over-year results. 
For Market-Based Businesses, the year-to-date improved results reflect, among other things, the addition of customers under new partnerships at Homeowner Services and growth from the 2018 additions of 2 bases in the Military Services Group.
Moving on to Slide 17. It's been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $93 million in annualized new revenues this year. This includes $45 million from rate cases and $48 million from infrastructure surcharges. As Walter noted, we have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 2 rate cases and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $41 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 18. Because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, as Susan mentioned, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 at to $3.64 per share. Our previous guidance was to $3.54 to $3.64 per share.
We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be on the top half of that 7% to 10% range.
Now moving on to Slide 17 -- Slide 19, excuse me. As we noted in the release, on October 29, 2019, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock payable on December 4, 2019. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 17 of 2019.
We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue to grow at the high end of that 7% to 10% range. We continue to deliver a very strong consolidated results. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2019, our total company consolidated return on equity is 10.4%. Our weighted average authorized regulated ROE stands at 9.8%. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our Market-Based businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment.
We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations, continue to provide excellent value for our investors.
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Susan."

At the top of that list is the commitment to be the best at the fundamentals of the business. One of the most basic things we have to do as a water utility is the quality of the over 1 billion gallons of water we provide every day throughout United States. And whether you call it our purpose, our mission or just part of ESG, we note that if we don't deliver water that is safe and reliable, then nothing else we do matters.
You'll see on the slide just a few of the headlines we're already about threats to the safety of drinking water including lead, [indiscernible] toxins. These are real threats at that require expert and knowledgeable people in organizations who have the breadth, depth and experience to ensure the safety of the critical unique human need of water.
And at American Water, we never forget at that end of every water pipe, there's a family that depending on us to provide this critical need and that every fire hydrant life could depend on the right pressures and volumes and that every wastewater plant serves as a shield against potential disease and every community should be stronger because we're there.
And at the end of the day, we also know that what we do in our customers' and communities' best long-term interest will also be in our investors' best long-term interest. And that's what we believe it means to be a truly sustainable company. 
I want to close our prepared remarks by saying how much our hearts go out to the millions of people who are affected by the horrific fires in California and how much we are in all of the amazing work being done around the clock by the incredibly brave and talented firefighters. Our California American Water employees have also been working 24/7 to keep water service to our customers there when the power is out. We're using backup mobile and permanent generators. We're also using remote monitoring for our facilities when they're under mandatory evacuation so we can minimize the hardship our customers may be facing during these difficult times.
We were able to maintain and service the entire time during the [indiscernible] fire and power outages, which affected 2 of our smaller operations in [ Geiserville ] with approximately 300,000 customer connections and [indiscernible] with approximately 2,100 connections. Our infrastructure assets have not been damaged. I just want to publicly thank our hard-working employees who have truly kept the water flowing to our customers under these difficult conditions.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So I mean, our response to that is that we take water quality and safety very seriously. The EPA establishes drinking water standards to protect the public health. We treat and deliver water that is -- meets or surpasses every one of those. And in fact, the EPA has a special program that's called the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, which looks at another 40 contaminants that really aren't regulated, but we voluntarily have adopted those so that they can look and see what the impacts of those are. We made or surpassed all of our states. At the end of the day, there are a lot of groups out there who may decide that they're going to set their own goals and their own policies, but we really can't follow what every individual group does along those lines.

And West Point is a nice size military installation. Also, we do know that just like across the U.S. where there are infrastructure needs, we're finding at the military bases that a lot of their infrastructure is from -- right after World War II, when most of the military bases were built. So if you remember, we make money 3 ways through the military bases. There's the 50-year-old contract. Then, when we take over, there's typically upgrades we need to make. And then any future projects that our capital or working capital on these bases, we then can add that as part of the O&M and we get paid to do those plus a fee. So what we're finding is the military bases also need infrastructure upgrades and investment just like the rest of the country does. So we're looking at these in terms of all 3 of those areas. So we're very pleased. In Texas, we have Fort Hood which also, I believe, 1 of the top 2 or 3 large bases we have. So it's very exciting to us to be able to grow in that respect. And then we look in the Air Force and the army continue to be quite active. There's a lot of opportunity in Navy, we believe. They have really not done much privatization. So we're stepping back, looking at the bases and facilities across the country.

But I do actually revert back to a question I would periodically ask in the past for an update due to some of the events that transpired during the quarter and to avoid being granular, I'm going to ask this on a very high level. So when we think about the company's portfolio, obviously it has a nice portfolio given the quarter report, quarter report is going back for many quarters. But that doesn't mean that there's not opportunity in states outside the portfolio. On the other hand, the states where the company has a footprint are very compelling for a need to upgrade infrastructure perspective and also on the regulatory front. So moving forward in the near to intermediate term, is the strategy maybe more to work within the states in which the company operates and try to extend within the states?

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover our third quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations.
American Water employees continued to deliver strong results. Let me highlight just a few of our third quarter accomplishments. We continued to have strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 10.8% compared to last year's third quarter, and we saw growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses.
In our Regulated business, we've added more than 57,000 customer connections year-to-date. This includes of 46,900 customers through closed acquisitions and 10,400 through organic growth in our existing service areas.
We most recently closed on the water asset of Steelton Borough, Pennsylvania and Lake Station, Indiana as well as the wastewater asset of Exeter Township in Pennsylvania. We're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees.
Additionally, in the coming months, we will welcome an additional 26,400 customer connections through agreements that are signed and pending.
Moving to our Market-Based businesses. We're extremely honored to be awarded Department of Defense contracts for the water and wastewater systems at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Joint Base San Antonio includes Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis and Lackland Air Force Base. These installations support over 187,000 jobs across the state of Texas. 
The United States Military Academy at West Point is the oldest continually operated army post in the United States. The campus is home to 4,400 cadets and was once home to our own COO, Walter Lynch, a West Point alumnus and army veteran.
The opportunity to expand our military footprint to 16 bases across the country is a testament to American Water's industry-leading water research, development and operational excellence. It's a privilege to ensure the delivery of safe, clean and reliable water and wastewater services for our country's military members and their families.
With these continued strong performance and our disciplined approach to our business, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 to $3.64 per share from $3.54 to $3.64.
Moving to Slide 6. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. Through September 30, we invested around $1.3 billion, with about $1.2 billion into our existing regulated infrastructure and around $85 million in regulated acquisition closings. We expect to invest approximately $1.9 billion total for the full year with projections of more than $260 million for regulated acquisition closing and around $1.7 billion to address the continued and growing need for infrastructure investment across our footprint.
Results for our Market-Based businesses are also strong, contributing to both net income growth and cash flow generation given the capital-light nature of these businesses. 
So in summary, we will continue to invest in our infrastructure and we have line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023, which is key to ensuring affordability for our customers as we make these much needed investments.
And finally, we remain on track to meet our 7% to 10% long-term earnings growth target. 
Now Walter will give a more detailed update on our Regulated Businesses."

Our Regulated Businesses had a strong third quarter in making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water services.  We also continued to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers and grow our business through acquisitions.
On Slide 8, let me touch briefly on the weather. As you recall, we had an unusually wet weather in the second quarter of 2019, which led to auto quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of $0.05. This quarter has been more typical. But once again, you can see how our geographic diversity helps mitigate weather variability. For example, this quarter, New Jersey American Water experienced at or below average precipitation, which offset Missouri's slightly above average precipitation. As a result, weather had no material impact on our revenues for the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 9. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights, starting with our 2 pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect the decision in the first quarter of 2020.
California American Water filed for new rates this past July. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements for the 2021 to 2022 capital test years. We expect the decision on this case in late 2020 with new rates to take effect by January 1, 2021.
In other activities, several bills were recently signed into law in Indiana by Governor Holcomb. First, House Bill 1406, known as the Water Infrastructure Funding Act, establishes the first state appropriation of $20 million per year for water infrastructure investment. Paired with another bill, Senate Bill 4, this combined legislation supports regional water planning and the reduction of water loss caused by poor or aging infrastructure. The goal is to promote a consistent approach to providing clean and safe water across all water systems in Indiana.
A third bill, Senate Bill 472, enhances Indiana's version of fair market value legislation by now including qualified nonmunicipal systems. Previously, the legislation only covered distressed municipal systems. An in Pennsylvania, on October 3, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our proposal to replace customer-owned lead service lines in accordance with Act 120. This act authorizes the costs associated with the replacement of the customer-owned portion of lead service lines to be included in a regulated utilities rate base.
Turning to Slide 10. We continued to grow the size of our footprint with 19 acquisitions occurring in 8 states, totaling 46,900 new customer connections. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania American Water completed the acquisition of both the Steelton water and Exeter wastewater systems. The Steelton Water System added approximately 2,400 new water connections. The sale of the water system will allow the borough to eliminate its existing water debt and invest in capital projects.
In Exeter, Pennsylvania where we've been providing water service for more than 17 years, we welcomed approximately 9,000 wastewater customer connections. According to Township Manager, John Granger, ""The sale of the wastewater treatment plant and collection system to Pennsylvania American Water is a great benefit to current and future residents of Exeter. The plant and system were becoming an increasing burden on the Township as federal and state regulations were becoming too difficult for the Township to manage."" This is a great example of how communities are better simply because we're there. This marks Pennsylvania American Water's fifth acquisition in the state in 2019.
Indiana American Water also closed on the Lake Station water system earlier this month, adding about 3,300 water connections to the existing Indiana customer base.
We also welcomed 10,400 new customer connections from organic growth to date, and we'll welcome another 26,400 customer connections through 24 signed agreements in 10 states. 
As we've shared with you before, with the consistent pipeline of opportunities we see in the water and wastewater industry, we're confident in our disciplined growth strategy and our ability to provide solutions across the nation.
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to balance making critical investments to ensure reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers' bills. In the first 9 months, we have invested approximately $1.2 billion in our existing regulated infrastructure. At the same time, we're making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.5% by 2023. 
To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. However, over the last 9 years, we welcomed approximately 338,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers.
Moving to Slide 12. We're pleased that our new customer service site, myWater, is now live for all American Water customers nationwide. Customers are now able to access their accounts through this mobile-friendly site. myWater allows customers to easily make payments, view their water usage history and receive alert notifications from any location 24 hours a days, 7 days a week.
We launched this new platform by listening to our customers who told us they wanted to more easily manage their accounts online. Since the launch, we've received very positive customer feedback, especially on ease of use. This is just another great example of how our customers are at the center of everything we do.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan for more detail on our financial performance."
250885,638327613,1846974,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2019",2019-10-31,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 15 with a summary of results.

Let me start on Slide 15 with a summary of results. 
Third quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $1.33 per share compared to $1.04 in 2018. 2018 results included a $0.06 gain from the sale of the majority of the contracts in our Contract Services Group in a $0.22 charge from the Keystone impairment. Excluding these 2 adjustments in 2018, adjusted earnings per share were up 10.8% primarily driven by growth in the Regulated Business.
The Regulated Business segment results were up $0.12 per share or an increase of 10.2% compared to 2018. The Market-Based Business results were about flat and the parent results improved $0.01 per share compared to 2018.
Our 2019 adjusted earnings through September 30 were $2.88 per share or a 10.3% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.15 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.09 per share. And finally, the parent results improved by $0.03 per share year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Let me walk through the details of the quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.12 in total. We had an $0.11 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Also, O&M expenses decreased $0.02 per share for the quarter as a result of the continued focus on cost management and higher costs in the third quarter of 2018 related primarily to the New York American Water settlement. Depreciation and interest increased $0.01 per share primarily to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. 
The Market-Based Business results for the quarter were similar to last year on continued strong performance.
Finally, earnings at the parent were $0.01 per share, reflective of the impact of a lower consolidated effective tax rate offset somewhat by increased interest expense.
Moving to Slide 16. 9 months ended September 30, 2019, adjusted EPS increased 10.3% year-over-year even with the weather negatively impacting the second quarter of 2019. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously for the Regulated Business also explain the year-over-year results. 
For Market-Based Businesses, the year-to-date improved results reflect, among other things, the addition of customers under new partnerships at Homeowner Services and growth from the 2018 additions of 2 bases in the Military Services Group.
Moving on to Slide 17. It's been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $93 million in annualized new revenue this year. This includes $45 million from rate cases and $48 million from infrastructure surcharges. As Walter noted, we have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 2 rate cases and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $41 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 18. Because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, as Susan mentioned, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 to $3.64 per share. Our previous guidance was to $3.54 to $3.64 per share.
We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be on the top half of that 7% to 10% range.
Now moving on to Slide 17 -- Slide 19, excuse me. As we noted in the release, on October 29, 2019, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock payable on December 4, 2019. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 17, 2019.
We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue the growth at the high end of that 7% to 10% range. 
We continue to deliver a very strong consolidated results. For the 12 months ended September 2019, our total company consolidated return on equity is 10.4%. Our weighted average authorized regulated ROE stands at 9.8%. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our Market-Based businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment.

At the top of that list is the commitment to be the best at the fundamentals of the business. One of the most basic things we have to do as a water utility is the quality of the over 1 billion gallons of water we provide every day throughout United States. And whether you call it our purpose or mission or just part of ESG, we know that if we don't deliver water that is safe and reliable, nothing else we do matters.
You see on the slide just a few of the headlines we're all reading about threats to the safety of drinking water including lead, Legionella, PFAS and cyanotoxins. These are real threats that require expert and knowledgeable people in organizations who have the breadth, depth and experience to ensure the safety of the critical unique human need of water.
And at American Water, we never forget that at that end of every water pipe, there's a family that's depending on us to provide this critical need and that every fire hydrant life could depend on the right pressures and volumes and that every wastewater plant serves as a shield against potential disease and every community should be stronger because we're there.
And at the end of the day, we also know that what we do in our customers' and communities' best long-term interest will also be in our investors' best long-term interest. And that's what we believe it means to be a truly sustainable company. 
I want to close our prepared remarks by saying how much our hearts go out to the millions of people who are affected by the horrific fires in California and how much we are in awe of the amazing work being done around the clock by the incredibly brave and talented firefighters. Our California American Water employees have also been working 24/7 to keep water service to our customers there when the power is out. We're using backup mobile and permanent generators. We're also using remote monitoring for our facilities when they're under mandatory evacuation so we can minimize the hardship our customers may be facing during these difficult times.
We were able to maintain service the entire time during the Kincade fire and power outages, which affected 2 of our smaller operations in Geyserville with approximately 300,000 customer connections and Larkfield with approximately 2,100 connections. Our infrastructure assets have not been damaged. I just want to publicly thank our hard-working employees who have truly kept the water flowing to our customers under these difficult conditions.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So I mean our response to that is that we take water quality and safety very seriously. The EPA establishes drinking water standards to protect the public health. We treat and deliver water that is -- meets or surpasses every one of those. And in fact, the EPA has a special program that's called the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, which looks at another 40 contaminants that really aren't regulated, but we voluntarily have adopted those so that they can look and see what the impacts of those are. We made or surpassed all of our states. At the end of the day, there are a lot of groups out there who may decide that they're going to set their own goals and their own policies, but we really can't follow what every individual group does along those lines. So -- but we are meeting all the EPA. We are voluntarily adopting 40 that aren't even regulated but we're continuing to monitor and we're acting as if they're regulated and meeting all state requirements."

And West Point is nice sized military installation also. We do know that just like across the U.S. where there are infrastructure needs, we're finding at the military bases that a lot of their infrastructure is from -- right after World War II when most of the military bases were built. So if you remember, we make money 3 ways through with the military bases. There's the 50-year O&M contract. Then when we take over, there's typically upgrades we need to make. And then any future projects that are capital or working capital on these bases, we then can add that as part of the O&M and we get paid to do those plus a fee. So what we're finding is the military bases also need infrastructure upgrades and investment just like the rest of the country does. So we're looking at these in terms of all 3 of those areas. So we're very pleased. In Texas, we have Fort Hood which also, I believe, one of the top 2 or 3 large bases we have. So it's very exciting to us to be able to grow in that respect. 
And then we look, and the Air Force and the army continue to be quite active. There's a lot of opportunity in Navy, we believe. They have really not done much privatization.

But that doesn't mean that there's not opportunity in states outside the portfolio. On the other hand, the states where the company has a footprint are very compelling from a need-to-upgrade infrastructure perspective and also on the regulatory front.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover our third quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations.
American Water employees continued to deliver strong results. Let me highlight just a few of our third quarter accomplishments. We continued to have strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 10.8% compared to last year's third quarter, and we saw growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses.
In our Regulated business, we've added more than 57,000 customer connections year-to-date. This includes of 46,900 customers through closed acquisitions and 10,400 through organic growth in our existing service areas.
We most recently closed on the water asset of Steelton Borough, Pennsylvania and Lake Station, Indiana as well as the wastewater asset of Exeter Township in Pennsylvania. We're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees.
Additionally, in the coming months, we will welcome an additional 26,400 customer connections through agreements that are signed and pending.
Moving to our Market-Based businesses. We're extremely honored to be awarded Department of Defense contracts for the water and wastewater systems at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Joint Base San Antonio includes Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis and Lackland Air Force Base. These installations support over 187,000 jobs across the state of Texas. 
The United States Military Academy at West Point is the oldest continually operated army post in the United States. The campus is home to 4,400 cadets and was once home to our own COO, Walter Lynch, a West Point alumnus and Army veteran.
The opportunity to expand our military footprint to 16 bases across the country is a testament to American Water's industry-leading water research, development and operational excellence. It's a privilege to ensure the delivery of safe, clean and reliable water and wastewater services for our country's military members and their families.
With these continued strong performance and our disciplined approach to our business, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 to $3.64 per share from $3.54 to $3.64.
Moving to Slide 6. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. Through September 30, we invested around $1.3 billion, with about $1.2 billion into our existing regulated infrastructure and around $85 million in regulated acquisition closings. We expect to invest approximately $1.9 billion total for the full year with projections of more than $260 million for regulated acquisition closing and around $1.7 billion to address the continued and growing need for infrastructure investment across our footprint.
Results for our Market-Based businesses are also strong, contributing to both net income growth and cash flow generation given the capital-light nature of these businesses. 
So in summary, we will continue to invest in our infrastructure and we have line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023, which is key to ensuring affordability for our customers as we make these much needed investments.
And finally, we remain on track to meet our 7% to 10% long-term earnings growth target. 
Now Walter will give a more detailed update on our Regulated Businesses."

Our Regulated Businesses had a strong third quarter in making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water services.  We also continued to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers and grow our business through acquisitions.
On Slide 8, let me touch briefly on the weather. As you recall, we had an unusually wet weather in the second quarter of 2019, which led to auto quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of $0.05. This quarter has been more typical. But once again, you can see how our geographic diversity helps mitigate weather variability. For example, this quarter, New Jersey American Water experienced at or below average precipitation, which offset Missouri's slightly above average precipitation. As a result, weather had no material impact on our revenues for the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 9. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights, starting with our 2 pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect the decision in the first quarter of 2020.
California American Water filed for new rates this past July. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements for the 2021 to 2022 capital test years. We expect the decision on this case in late 2020 with new rates to take effect by January 1, 2021.
In other activities, several bills were recently signed into law in Indiana by Governor Holcomb. First, House Bill 1406, known as the Water Infrastructure Funding Act, establishes the first state appropriation of $20 million per year for water infrastructure investment. Paired with another bill, Senate Bill 4, this combined legislation supports regional water planning and the reduction of water loss caused by poor or aging infrastructure. The goal is to promote a consistent approach to providing clean and safe water across all water systems in Indiana.
A third bill, Senate Bill 472, enhances Indiana's version of fair market value legislation by now including qualified nonmunicipal systems. Previously, the legislation only covered distressed municipal systems. An in Pennsylvania, on October 3, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our proposal to replace customer-owned lead service lines in accordance with Act 120. This act authorizes the costs associated with the replacement of the customer-owned portion of lead service lines to be included in a regulated utilities rate base.
Turning to Slide 10. We continued to grow the size of our footprint with 19 acquisitions occurring in 8 states, totaling 46,900 new customer connections. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania American Water completed the acquisition of both the Steelton water and Exeter wastewater systems. The Steelton Water System added approximately 2,400 new water connections. The sale of the water system will allow the borough to eliminate its existing water debt and invest in capital projects.
In Exeter, Pennsylvania where we've been providing water service for more than 17 years, we welcomed approximately 9,000 wastewater customer connections. According to Township Manager, John Granger, ""The sale of the wastewater treatment plant and collection system to Pennsylvania American Water is a great benefit to current and future residents of Exeter. The plant and system were becoming an increasing burden on the Township as federal and state regulations were becoming too difficult for the Township to manage."" This is a great example of how communities are better simply because we're there. This marks Pennsylvania American Water's fifth acquisition in the state in 2019.
Indiana American Water also closed on the Lake Station water system earlier this month, adding about 3,300 water connections to the existing Indiana customer base.
We also welcomed 10,400 new customer connections from organic growth to date, and we'll welcome another 26,400 customer connections through 24 signed agreements in 10 states. 
As we've shared with you before, with the consistent pipeline of opportunities we see in the water and wastewater industry, we're confident in our disciplined growth strategy and our ability to provide solutions across the nation.
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to balance making critical investments to ensure reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers' bills. In the first 9 months, we have invested approximately $1.2 billion in our existing regulated infrastructure. At the same time, we're making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.5% by 2023. 
To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. However, over the last 9 years, we welcomed approximately 338,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers.
Moving to Slide 12. We're pleased that our new customer service site, myWater, is now live for all American Water customers nationwide. Customers are now able to access their accounts through this mobile-friendly site. myWater allows customers to easily make payments, view their water usage history and receive alert notifications from any location 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
We launched this new platform by listening to our customers who told us they wanted to more easily manage their accounts online. Since the launch, we've received very positive customer feedback, especially on ease of use. This is just another great example of how our customers are at the center of everything we do.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start on Slide 15 with a summary of results.

Let me start on Slide 15 with a summary of results. 
Third quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $1.33 per share compared to $1.04 in 2018. 2018 results included a $0.06 gain from the sale of the majority of the contracts in our Contract Services Group in a $0.22 charge from the Keystone impairment. Excluding these 2 adjustments in 2018, adjusted earnings per share were up 10.8% primarily driven by growth in the Regulated Business.
The Regulated Business segment results were up $0.12 per share or an increase of 10.2% compared to 2018. The Market-Based Business results were about flat and the parent results improved $0.01 per share compared to 2018.
Our 2019 adjusted earnings through September 30 were $2.88 per share or a 10.3% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.15 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.09 per share. And finally, the parent results improved by $0.03 per share year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Let me walk through the details of the quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.12 in total. We had an $0.11 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Also, O&M expenses decreased $0.02 per share for the quarter as a result of the continued focus on cost management and higher costs in the third quarter of 2018 related primarily to the New York American Water settlement. Depreciation and interest increased $0.01 per share primarily to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. 
The Market-Based Business results for the quarter were similar to last year on continued strong performance.
Finally, earnings at the parent were $0.01 per share, reflective of the impact of a lower consolidated effective tax rate offset somewhat by increased interest expense.
Moving to Slide 16. 9 months ended September 30, 2019, adjusted EPS increased 10.3% year-over-year even with the weather negatively impacting the second quarter of 2019. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously for the Regulated Business also explain the year-over-year results. 
For Market-Based Businesses, the year-to-date improved results reflect, among other things, the addition of customers under new partnerships at Homeowner Services and growth from the 2018 additions of 2 bases in the Military Services Group.
Moving on to Slide 17. It's been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $93 million in annualized new revenue this year. This includes $45 million from rate cases and $48 million from infrastructure surcharges. As Walter noted, we have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 2 rate cases and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $41 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 18. Because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, as Susan mentioned, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 to $3.64 per share. Our previous guidance was to $3.54 to $3.64 per share.
We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be on the top half of that 7% to 10% range.
Now moving on to Slide 17 -- Slide 19, excuse me. As we noted in the release, on October 29, 2019, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock payable on December 4, 2019. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 17, 2019.
We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue the growth at the high end of that 7% to 10% range. 
We continue to deliver a very strong consolidated results. For the 12 months ended September 2019, our total company consolidated return on equity is 10.4%. Our weighted average authorized regulated ROE stands at 9.8%. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our Market-Based businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment.
We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations, continues to provide excellent value for our investors.
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Susan."

At the top of that list is the commitment to be the best at the fundamentals of the business. One of the most basic things we have to do as a water utility is the quality of the over 1 billion gallons of water we provide every day throughout United States. And whether you call it our purpose or mission or just part of ESG, we know that if we don't deliver water that is safe and reliable, nothing else we do matters.
You see on the slide just a few of the headlines we're all reading about threats to the safety of drinking water including lead, Legionella, PFAS and cyanotoxins. These are real threats that require expert and knowledgeable people in organizations who have the breadth, depth and experience to ensure the safety of the critical unique human need of water.
And at American Water, we never forget that at that end of every water pipe, there's a family that's depending on us to provide this critical need and that every fire hydrant life could depend on the right pressures and volumes and that every wastewater plant serves as a shield against potential disease and every community should be stronger because we're there.
And at the end of the day, we also know that what we do in our customers' and communities' best long-term interest will also be in our investors' best long-term interest. And that's what we believe it means to be a truly sustainable company. 
I want to close our prepared remarks by saying how much our hearts go out to the millions of people who are affected by the horrific fires in California and how much we are in awe of the amazing work being done around the clock by the incredibly brave and talented firefighters. Our California American Water employees have also been working 24/7 to keep water service to our customers there when the power is out. We're using backup mobile and permanent generators. We're also using remote monitoring for our facilities when they're under mandatory evacuation so we can minimize the hardship our customers may be facing during these difficult times.
We were able to maintain service the entire time during the Kincade fire and power outages, which affected 2 of our smaller operations in Geyserville with approximately 300,000 customer connections and Larkfield with approximately 2,100 connections. Our infrastructure assets have not been damaged. I just want to publicly thank our hard-working employees who have truly kept the water flowing to our customers under these difficult conditions.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So I mean our response to that is that we take water quality and safety very seriously. The EPA establishes drinking water standards to protect the public health. We treat and deliver water that is -- meets or surpasses every one of those. And in fact, the EPA has a special program that's called the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, which looks at another 40 contaminants that really aren't regulated, but we voluntarily have adopted those so that they can look and see what the impacts of those are. We made or surpassed all of our states. At the end of the day, there are a lot of groups out there who may decide that they're going to set their own goals and their own policies, but we really can't follow what every individual group does along those lines. So -- but we are meeting all the EPA. We are voluntarily adopting 40 that aren't even regulated but we're continuing to monitor and we're acting as if they're regulated and meeting all state requirements."

And West Point is nice sized military installation also. We do know that just like across the U.S. where there are infrastructure needs, we're finding at the military bases that a lot of their infrastructure is from -- right after World War II when most of the military bases were built. So if you remember, we make money 3 ways through with the military bases. There's the 50-year O&M contract. Then when we take over, there's typically upgrades we need to make. And then any future projects that are capital or working capital on these bases, we then can add that as part of the O&M and we get paid to do those plus a fee. So what we're finding is the military bases also need infrastructure upgrades and investment just like the rest of the country does. So we're looking at these in terms of all 3 of those areas. So we're very pleased. In Texas, we have Fort Hood which also, I believe, one of the top 2 or 3 large bases we have. So it's very exciting to us to be able to grow in that respect. 
And then we look, and the Air Force and the army continue to be quite active. There's a lot of opportunity in Navy, we believe. They have really not done much privatization. So we're stepping back, looking at the bases and facilities across the country. Again, we have 5 outstanding RFPs that we're already in the middle of the process and we're looking to any new ones that may come up in the next year."

But I do want to actually revert back to a question I would periodically ask in the past for an update due to some of the events that transpired during the quarter.

So when we think about the company's portfolio, obviously it has a nice portfolio of states given the quarter report -- given quarter reports going back for many quarters. But that doesn't mean that there's not opportunity in states outside the portfolio. On the other hand, the states where the company has a footprint are very compelling from a need-to-upgrade infrastructure perspective and also on the regulatory front. 
So moving forward in the near to intermediate term, is the strategy maybe more to work within the states in which the company operates and try to expand within the states? Or could we maybe expect the company to more and more announce that it's trying to enter other states?"

So we want to be able to expand in the state. 
So we're looking at that and we actively look at that. But we do both. And as far as growth goes inside, our growth, we're investing as we said $1.7 billion this year and we're going to be spending over $250 million to acquire systems in our footprint, which is, I think, tremendous and just shows the dedication and the value that we're providing to these communities."

But the thing that typically will slow us down from going into a new state is we believe it's important that within 5 years, we have 50,000 customer connections because part of our brand is affordability and the fact that we're looking at O&M efficiency. And if you just have a couple of 3,000 in a state, it's very hard to get those efficiencies.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover our third quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations.
American Water employees continued to deliver strong results. Let me highlight just a few of our third quarter accomplishments. We continued to have strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 10.8% compared to last year's third quarter, and we saw growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses.
In our Regulated business, we've added more than 57,000 customer connections year-to-date. This includes of 46,900 customers through closed acquisitions and 10,400 through organic growth in our existing service areas.
We most recently closed on the water asset of Steelton Borough, Pennsylvania and Lake Station, Indiana as well as the wastewater asset of Exeter Township in Pennsylvania. We're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees.
Additionally, in the coming months, we will welcome an additional 26,400 customer connections through agreements that are signed and pending.
Moving to our Market-Based businesses. We're extremely honored to be awarded Department of Defense contracts for the water and wastewater systems at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Joint Base San Antonio includes Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis and Lackland Air Force Base. These installations support over 187,000 jobs across the state of Texas. 
The United States Military Academy at West Point is the oldest continually operated army post in the United States. The campus is home to 4,400 cadets and was once home to our own COO, Walter Lynch, a West Point alumnus and Army veteran.
The opportunity to expand our military footprint to 16 bases across the country is a testament to American Water's industry-leading water research, development and operational excellence. It's a privilege to ensure the delivery of safe, clean and reliable water and wastewater services for our country's military members and their families.
With these continued strong performance and our disciplined approach to our business, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 to $3.64 per share from $3.54 to $3.64.
Moving to Slide 6. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. Through September 30, we invested around $1.3 billion, with about $1.2 billion into our existing regulated infrastructure and around $85 million in regulated acquisition closings. We expect to invest approximately $1.9 billion total for the full year with projections of more than $260 million for regulated acquisition closing and around $1.7 billion to address the continued and growing need for infrastructure investment across our footprint.
Results for our Market-Based businesses are also strong, contributing to both net income growth and cash flow generation given the capital-light nature of these businesses. 
So in summary, we will continue to invest in our infrastructure and we have line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023, which is key to ensuring affordability for our customers as we make these much needed investments.
And finally, we remain on track to meet our 7% to 10% long-term earnings growth target. 
Now Walter will give a more detailed update on our Regulated Businesses."

Our Regulated Businesses had a strong third quarter in making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water services.  We also continued to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers and grow our business through acquisitions.
On Slide 8, let me touch briefly on the weather. As you recall, we had an unusually wet weather in the second quarter of 2019, which led to auto quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of $0.05. This quarter has been more typical. But once again, you can see how our geographic diversity helps mitigate weather variability. For example, this quarter, New Jersey American Water experienced at or below average precipitation, which offset Missouri's slightly above average precipitation. As a result, weather had no material impact on our revenues for the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 9. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights, starting with our 2 pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect the decision in the first quarter of 2020.
California American Water filed for new rates this past July. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements for the 2021 to 2022 capital test years. We expect the decision on this case in late 2020 with new rates to take effect by January 1, 2021.
In other activities, several bills were recently signed into law in Indiana by Governor Holcomb. First, House Bill 1406, known as the Water Infrastructure Funding Act, establishes the first state appropriation of $20 million per year for water infrastructure investment. Paired with another bill, Senate Bill 4, this combined legislation supports regional water planning and the reduction of water loss caused by poor or aging infrastructure. The goal is to promote a consistent approach to providing clean and safe water across all water systems in Indiana.
A third bill, Senate Bill 472, enhances Indiana's version of fair market value legislation by now including qualified nonmunicipal systems. Previously, the legislation only covered distressed municipal systems. An in Pennsylvania, on October 3, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our proposal to replace customer-owned lead service lines in accordance with Act 120. This act authorizes the costs associated with the replacement of the customer-owned portion of lead service lines to be included in a regulated utilities rate base.
Turning to Slide 10. We continued to grow the size of our footprint with 19 acquisitions occurring in 8 states, totaling 46,900 new customer connections. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania American Water completed the acquisition of both the Steelton water and Exeter wastewater systems. The Steelton Water System added approximately 2,400 new water connections. The sale of the water system will allow the borough to eliminate its existing water debt and invest in capital projects.
In Exeter, Pennsylvania where we've been providing water service for more than 17 years, we welcomed approximately 9,000 wastewater customer connections. According to Township Manager, John Granger, ""The sale of the wastewater treatment plant and collection system to Pennsylvania American Water is a great benefit to current and future residents of Exeter. The plant and system were becoming an increasing burden on the Township as federal and state regulations were becoming too difficult for the Township to manage."" This is a great example of how communities are better simply because we're there. This marks Pennsylvania American Water's fifth acquisition in the state in 2019.
Indiana American Water also closed on the Lake Station water system earlier this month, adding about 3,300 water connections to the existing Indiana customer base.
We also welcomed 10,400 new customer connections from organic growth to date, and we'll welcome another 26,400 customer connections through 24 signed agreements in 10 states. 
As we've shared with you before, with the consistent pipeline of opportunities we see in the water and wastewater industry, we're confident in our disciplined growth strategy and our ability to provide solutions across the nation.
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to balance making critical investments to ensure reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers' bills. In the first 9 months, we have invested approximately $1.2 billion in our existing regulated infrastructure. At the same time, we're making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.5% by 2023. 
To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. However, over the last 9 years, we welcomed approximately 338,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers.
Moving to Slide 12. We're pleased that our new customer service site, myWater, is now live for all American Water customers nationwide. Customers are now able to access their accounts through this mobile-friendly site. myWater allows customers to easily make payments, view their water usage history and receive alert notifications from any location 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
We launched this new platform by listening to our customers who told us they wanted to more easily manage their accounts online. Since the launch, we've received very positive customer feedback, especially on ease of use. This is just another great example of how our customers are at the center of everything we do.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start on Slide 15 with a summary of results.

Let me start on Slide 15 with a summary of results. 
Third quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $1.33 per share compared to $1.04 in 2018. 2018 results included a $0.06 gain from the sale of the majority of the contracts in our Contract Services Group in a $0.22 charge from the Keystone impairment. Excluding these 2 adjustments in 2018, adjusted earnings per share were up 10.8% primarily driven by growth in the Regulated Business.
The Regulated Business segment results were up $0.12 per share or an increase of 10.2% compared to 2018. The Market-Based Business results were about flat and the parent results improved $0.01 per share compared to 2018.
Our 2019 adjusted earnings through September 30 were $2.88 per share or a 10.3% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.15 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.09 per share. And finally, the parent results improved by $0.03 per share year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Let me walk through the details of the quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.12 in total. We had an $0.11 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Also, O&M expenses decreased $0.02 per share for the quarter as a result of the continued focus on cost management and higher costs in the third quarter of 2018 related primarily to the New York American Water settlement. Depreciation and interest increased $0.01 per share primarily to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. 
The Market-Based Business results for the quarter were similar to last year on continued strong performance.
Finally, earnings at the parent were $0.01 per share, reflective of the impact of a lower consolidated effective tax rate offset somewhat by increased interest expense.
Moving to Slide 16. 9 months ended September 30, 2019, adjusted EPS increased 10.3% year-over-year even with the weather negatively impacting the second quarter of 2019. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously for the Regulated Business also explain the year-over-year results. 
For Market-Based Businesses, the year-to-date improved results reflect, among other things, the addition of customers under new partnerships at Homeowner Services and growth from the 2018 additions of 2 bases in the Military Services Group.
Moving on to Slide 17. It's been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $93 million in annualized new revenue this year. This includes $45 million from rate cases and $48 million from infrastructure surcharges. As Walter noted, we have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 2 rate cases and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $41 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 18. Because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, as Susan mentioned, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 to $3.64 per share. Our previous guidance was to $3.54 to $3.64 per share.
We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be on the top half of that 7% to 10% range.
Now moving on to Slide 17 -- Slide 19, excuse me. As we noted in the release, on October 29, 2019, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock payable on December 4, 2019. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 17, 2019.
We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue the growth at the high end of that 7% to 10% range. 
We continue to deliver a very strong consolidated results. For the 12 months ended September 2019, our total company consolidated return on equity is 10.4%. Our weighted average authorized regulated ROE stands at 9.8%. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our Market-Based businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment.
We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations, continues to provide excellent value for our investors.
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Susan."

At the top of that list is the commitment to be the best at the fundamentals of the business. One of the most basic things we have to do as a water utility is the quality of the over 1 billion gallons of water we provide every day throughout United States. And whether you call it our purpose or mission or just part of ESG, we know that if we don't deliver water that is safe and reliable, nothing else we do matters.
You see on the slide just a few of the headlines we're all reading about threats to the safety of drinking water including lead, Legionella, PFAS and cyanotoxins. These are real threats that require expert and knowledgeable people in organizations who have the breadth, depth and experience to ensure the safety of the critical unique human need of water.
And at American Water, we never forget that at that end of every water pipe, there's a family that's depending on us to provide this critical need and that every fire hydrant life could depend on the right pressures and volumes and that every wastewater plant serves as a shield against potential disease and every community should be stronger because we're there.
And at the end of the day, we also know that what we do in our customers' and communities' best long-term interest will also be in our investors' best long-term interest. And that's what we believe it means to be a truly sustainable company. 
I want to close our prepared remarks by saying how much our hearts go out to the millions of people who are affected by the horrific fires in California and how much we are in awe of the amazing work being done around the clock by the incredibly brave and talented firefighters. Our California American Water employees have also been working 24/7 to keep water service to our customers there when the power is out. We're using backup mobile and permanent generators. We're also using remote monitoring for our facilities when they're under mandatory evacuation so we can minimize the hardship our customers may be facing during these difficult times.
We were able to maintain service the entire time during the Kincade fire and power outages, which affected 2 of our smaller operations in Geyserville with approximately 300,000 customer connections and Larkfield with approximately 2,100 connections. Our infrastructure assets have not been damaged. I just want to publicly thank our hard-working employees who have truly kept the water flowing to our customers under these difficult conditions.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So I mean our response to that is that we take water quality and safety very seriously. The EPA establishes drinking water standards to protect the public health. We treat and deliver water that is -- meets or surpasses every one of those. And in fact, the EPA has a special program that's called the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, which looks at another 40 contaminants that really aren't regulated, but we voluntarily have adopted those so that they can look and see what the impacts of those are. We made or surpassed all of our states. At the end of the day, there are a lot of groups out there who may decide that they're going to set their own goals and their own policies, but we really can't follow what every individual group does along those lines. So -- but we are meeting all the EPA. We are voluntarily adopting 40 that aren't even regulated but we're continuing to monitor and we're acting as if they're regulated and meeting all state requirements."

And West Point is nice sized military installation also. We do know that just like across the U.S. where there are infrastructure needs, we're finding at the military bases that a lot of their infrastructure is from -- right after World War II when most of the military bases were built. So if you remember, we make money 3 ways through with the military bases. There's the 50-year O&M contract. Then when we take over, there's typically upgrades we need to make. And then any future projects that are capital or working capital on these bases, we then can add that as part of the O&M and we get paid to do those plus a fee. So what we're finding is the military bases also need infrastructure upgrades and investment just like the rest of the country does. So we're looking at these in terms of all 3 of those areas. So we're very pleased. In Texas, we have Fort Hood which also, I believe, one of the top 2 or 3 large bases we have. So it's very exciting to us to be able to grow in that respect. 
And then we look, and the Air Force and the army continue to be quite active. There's a lot of opportunity in Navy, we believe. They have really not done much privatization. So we're stepping back, looking at the bases and facilities across the country. Again, we have 5 outstanding RFPs that we're already in the middle of the process and we're looking to any new ones that may come up in the next year."

So I'm quite clear on things and some of my other questions have been answered. But I do want to actually revert back to a question I would periodically ask in the past for an update due to some of the events that transpired during the quarter. And to avoid being granular, I'm going to ask this on a very high level. So when we think about the company's portfolio, obviously it has a nice portfolio of states given the quarter report -- given quarter reports going back for many quarters. But that doesn't mean that there's not opportunity in states outside the portfolio. On the other hand, the states where the company has a footprint are very compelling from a need-to-upgrade infrastructure perspective and also on the regulatory front. 
So moving forward in the near to intermediate term, is the strategy maybe more to work within the states in which the company operates and try to expand within the states? Or could we maybe expect the company to more and more announce that it's trying to enter other states?"

We continue to look for opportunities in those states. But we also look outside our footprint. And for us to enter a new state, we really need a good business environment, a good regulatory environment and then the opportunity to grow to a certain size because we just don't want to buy a small system and just be -- just have that system. So we want to be able to expand in the state. 
So we're looking at that and we actively look at that. But we do both. And as far as growth goes inside, our growth, we're investing as we said $1.7 billion this year and we're going to be spending over $250 million to acquire systems in our footprint, which is, I think, tremendous and just shows the dedication and the value that we're providing to these communities."

We actually have them kind of in a -- looking at the regulatory environment, the business environment. But the thing that typically will slow us down from going into a new state is we believe it's important that within 5 years, we have 50,000 customer connections because part of our brand is affordability and the fact that we're looking at O&M efficiency. And if you just have a couple of 3,000 in a state, it's very hard to get those efficiencies. So when we're looking at whether we would go into a new state, those are kind of the 3 gates that we have that we would go through."
