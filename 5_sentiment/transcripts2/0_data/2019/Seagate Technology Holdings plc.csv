For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the December quarter and offer some market commentary. Gianluca Romano, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the March quarter. Following our prepared demos, we will open the call for questions.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenue of over $2.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.41, meeting and in some aspects exceeding our expectations. We executed our plans well and with strong operational efficiency, delivered solid financial results.
As we indicated last quarter, we were working to effectively manage through a near-term demand downturn that is having an impact in our current business. For the overall HDD industry, the December quarter exabyte demand declined for the first time after 6 quarters of continued growth. In the nearline market, we continue to see a cyclical impact affecting a broad base of customers globally. While some of the demand variation is due to intermittent periods of digestions we have experienced in this market over the last few years, some cloud customers are also pausing ahead of next-generation mass storage technology transitions that will deliver significant capacity, performance and total cost of ownership benefits.
While inventory levels for our HDD, storage devices and global channels are fairly healthy, other market dynamics, including seasonality, parts shortages and liquidity have created strain for some smaller end customers. For example, in the surveillance market, demand was soft compared to this time last year, impacted by tightening of downstream customer credit as well as government project delays.
We believe that these storage demand headwinds are short lived and that the long-term demand picture for our mass storage product portfolio continues to be strong. Data creation and data utilization are forecasted to grow rapidly over the next decade. 
According to a recent IDC study, global data creation will grow from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 175 zettabytes by 2025, representing a 27% compound annual growth rate. Efficient and cost-effective data technologies are becoming more critical for productivity expansion, data monetization and value creation than ever before. 
To support future storage customer needs, storage capacity across all media types will need to grow rapidly. And IDC estimates that at least 59% of those zettabyte demand in 2025 will be supplied by the HDD industry. Seagate is a critical supplier to both the mature and emerging businesses that are only just beginning to derive value from massive application workloads coming in Big Data analytics, smart cities and machine learning devices using both edge and cloud-based architectures.
At CES a few weeks ago, we demonstrated the breadth of our storage solutions covering diverse products from consumer to enterprise, leveraging our 40-year history of storage technology innovation. We are highly encouraged by the continued engagement we have with customers on their future capacity and performance requirements. These technical insights are driving many of the performance and flexibility attributes of our future product portfolio. 
As evidence of our drive for innovation, we showcased our future generations of single and multi actually devices that many customers are testing in their own data center environments. We're confident in our ability to achieve 16-terabyte drive shipments in the first half of this calendar year, growing to over 20 terabytes next year.
These significant product introductions delivering high capacity and performance options will be critical in the efficient scaling of cloud data centers for the next decade.
This was our second year showcasting -- showcasing Seagate's HAMR technology at CES. In the December quarter, we broke another areal density record, demonstrating almost 2.4 terabit per square inch in spin testing, indicating technology than can enable the capacity of 3 terabytes per disc or 24-terabyte drive production capability. 
In the past few months, we shipped fully functional HAMR demonstration drives to select global hyperscale and OEM partners. These drives are meeting expectation. Central to that is to establish the plug-and-play nature of HAMR recording technologies in all storage ecosystems. With that, in mind, our HAMR recording systems have demonstrated more than 4 petabyte per head data transfers, much greater than the workloads required for today's drives.
This means our focus is now on the volume manufacturability of these designs, designs that will fuel the future global data center. 
Along with HAMR, we are also working to improve the efficiency of mass storage by eliminating the stranded capacity when a drive becomes too large for its ideal bandwidth. This is already being seen today on 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte drives at many data centers and will become more challenging as drive capacities increases. 
Our mark to dual actuator drive unlocks significant capability with a rough doubling of the I/O bandwidth. We have successfully deployed sample drives to customer sites. And for the past 6 months, some of these drives have been serving live production traffic. Later this calendar year, we will begin our volume ramp of these important new designs.
The gaming industry continues to be a richer storage market opportunity, driven by demand for increased capacity points. This year at CES, we showcased our new M.2 NVMe which delivers blazing performance with the intense read and write speeds for the ultimate gaming experience. We are confident Seagate's complete gaming portfolio, including internal drives and attached gaming console drives with the HDD and footprints will continue to provide optimal user experiences. 
Also at CES, we introduced our Iron 110 SATA SSD, the world's first purpose-built NAS SSD with enterprise-class endurance and reliability. Looking ahead, we believe we are on the front end of a long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing data through cloud and edge computing layers will remain within the top priority of the growing data economy.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution and technology advancement for Seagate. With near-term demand headwinds, we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance and the resilience of our company through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for long-term revenue growth, properly staged capital investment for the coming growth opportunities, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. Now I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our financial performance."

Seagate executed well in the December quarter. Total second quarter revenue was over $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin was 29.7%, aligned with our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33% of revenue. The sequential decline of 130",952,"Thank you, Dave. Seagate executed well in the December quarter. Total second quarter revenue was over $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin was 29.7%, aligned with our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33% of revenue. The sequential decline of 130 basis points was mainly due to overall product portfolio mix, and in particular, to a decline in the nearline volume sold. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.41, higher than expected, gaining from overall solid execution and successful expense management.
Our enterprise market includes mission-critical and nearline applications, which represents 39% of total revenue. In the second quarter, we shipped a total of 36.4 exabyte in the enterprise market, down 3% compared to last year's strong demand.
The average capacity per enterprise drive was 4.5 terabyte, up 4% year-over-year. 
In the mission-critical market, we continue to address strong demand, better resulted in 44% year-over-year exabyte growth, with average capacity per drive of over 1.1 terabyte, up 30% year-over-year. Our breadth of portfolio, up to 2.4 terabyte, continues to provide customers with a cost effective solution required for mature enterprise application.
In the nearline market, we shipped 33 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 6.5 terabytes, up 10% over last year and up 44% from the same quarter 2 years ago.
The most recorded digestion phase that we are experiencing with cloud service provider customers is temporary affecting the exabyte demand and the overall nearline market. However, demand from OEM enterprise customers for nearline drives remains very stable.
As cloud and enterprise customers transition to higher capacity points, our nearline hard disk drive portfolio is well positioned to monetize storage demand over the long term. Our 12-terabyte nearline drive was the leading enterprise revenue product in the December quarter. And our highest capacity products, the 14-terabyte drive, continue to ramp in volume. Looking ahead, we are on scheduled to launch 16-terabyte products in the first half of this calendar year.
Edge noncompute market include our consumer, surveillance, NAS, gaming and DVR portfolio offering. In the December quarter, this market represented 31% of total revenue, 1% higher compared to the December quarter a year ago.
With growth year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for almost all end markets in the December quarter. Within this, the consumer portfolio at 27% sequential capacity growth is driven by strong seasonal demand and market share gains. While we are confident of the long-term growth and profitability of this market, we are mindful when near-term demand in some markets and channels was impacted by the liquidity issues that Dave discussed earlier.
As compute market include desktop and notebook and disk drive applications, in the December quarter, this market represented 21% of total revenue, 2% lower compared to the December quarter a year ago. Total exabyte shipment declined 4% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive grew 9% year-over-year.
While these markets remain largely stable, there are some headwinds affecting near-term demand. Particularly, in the December quarter, the industry was negatively impacted by a CPU shortage, which affected some vendor's ability to fulfill demand created by business PC upgrades.
This, coupled with economic uncertainties in some countries, affected the performance of the normally seasonally strong quarter for the compute market. Note hard disk drive revenue in the December quarter were $225 million, up 8% year-over-year, mainly driven by higher SSD revenue. Cloud systems decreased year-over-year due to a planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products. Sequentially, revenue has been stable in the past 2 quarters as we optimize the product portfolio.
SSD revenue were up mostly year-over-year and sequentially. We are optimistic about our long-term opportunities as we invest in developing appropriate SSD product portfolio in the SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming market. We are mindful of the short-term market dynamics and then pricing movement, and are managing our business to meet current customer demand and a prudent manner.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $365 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower, mostly due to reduced discretionary spending and overall operational efficiency. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15% of revenue.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $288 million. The sequential decrease was mostly related to the timing of some working capital transactions. We do not expect adverse impact to cash flow from working capital changes to reoccur in the March quarter.
On a fiscal-to-date basis, Seagate has generated $875 million in cash flow from operations and $571 million in free cash flow. Total inventory levels are slightly lower sequentially and consistent with demand expectations. 
Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $127 million in the December quarter. For fiscal year '19, we expect total capital expenditures to be at the low end of our content range of 6% to 8% revenue.
In the December quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares and we exited the quarter with 283 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalent, and our board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on April 12, 2019.
As planned, we also repaid the remaining 2018 senior notes for approximately $500 million. The company's debt balance as of December quarter was $4.3 billion.
Our net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the December quarter.
Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. Overall, our financial performance in the December quarter reflects solid execution in a challenging demand environment. I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments and outlook."

As we enter calendar year 2019, there are a number of market uncertainties that are broadly affecting IT companies. Macroeconomic risks and softness persist in global demand from cloud service providers and supply chain frictions and liquidity have created strain for some smaller end customers. We are navigating through these market dynamics with conservative same and managing our business with a focus on profitability and cash flow generation. 
As we go through this cycle of compressed exabyte demand, we are taking measures to control our costs and capital spending with the expectation that the exabyte growth will resume sometime in the second half of the calendar year. 
Within our revenue expectations for the March quarter, we anticipate nearline HDD demand to remain soft and our nearline exabyte shipments to be flat to down -- to slightly down sequentially. 
We expect the consumer and gaming markets to 
be seasonally down in the March quarter, and desktop and notebook demand to be slightly lower than seasonal demand as CPU shortage and macro uncertainty overhang continue to affect the volume in these markets. We also expect our cloud systems revenue to be relatively flat sequentially and our SSD revenues to be down sequentially due to product transitions and our near-term conservative approach to the demand market. 
We expect total revenues in the March quarter to be in the range of $2.3 billion, plus or minus 5%. Total exabyte shipments are forecasted to be 10% to 15% lower sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margins for the March quarter to be at least 26%, with the majority of the sequential change related to mix and manufacturing underutilization. This forecast is outside of our long-term margin range of 29% to 33% as we adjust our manufacturing plant to a lower build volume and to keep a lean inventory level. As demand resumes and other market trends stabilize, we expect margins to return for the long-term range.
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $0.70, plus or minus 5%. We remain confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years as we leverage our mass storage solutions portfolio for existing in new market opportunities. 
In closing, like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong second fiscal quarter results. Seagate's deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will allow us to meaningfully participate in the long-term growth trajectory for storage, delivering sustainable success for the company and value for our shareholders. I'm confident Seagate will continue to lead the HDD industry and serve our customers with the best technology developments, product offerings and supply chain responsiveness. Thanks, Latif.

It really looks like we're in the trough now again, and the question is how deep is the trough and how wide is it. So there's no reason to believe that this is necessarily how much different than the prior, but it was different than 90 days ago, I would say that we do see some customers coming back for mix changes and things like that, so there are signs in life but nothing that I would call growth back to the next peak. And I think there are various reasons for that, you can see that in our capital spending. I don't really think there's very many competitive dynamics that are changing. We did allude to in our script, if you'll notice, that there could be some waiting for the next capacity points to be qualified, if you will. Because once you go into one of these cycles, everyone -- not just the suppliers with hard drives, but also the customers and the filters are requesting a resources and the timing of what they want to ramp when. So there maybe some of that, that's impacting things a little bit. I do  think that this cycle will come back because just the exabyte demand and that -- and servicing -- what's already in the legacy data centers would have to get back on the pace."

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the December quarter and offer some market commentary. Gianluca Romano, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the March quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenue of over $2.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.41, meeting and in some aspects exceeding our expectations. We executed our plans well and with strong operational efficiency, delivered solid financial results.
As we indicated last quarter, we were working to effectively manage through a near-term demand downturn that is having an impact in our current business. For the overall HDD industry, the December quarter exabyte demand declined for the first time after 6 quarters of continued growth. 
In the nearline market, we continue to see a cyclical impact affecting a broad base of customers globally. While some of the demand variation is due to the intermittent periods of digestions we have experienced in this market over the last few years, some cloud customers are also pausing ahead of next-generation mass storage technology transitions that will deliver significant capacity, performance and total cost of ownership benefits.
While inventory levels for our HDD, storage devices and global channels appear fairly healthy, other market dynamics, including seasonality, parts shortages and liquidity have created strain for some smaller end customers. For example, in the surveillance market, demand was soft compared to this time last year, impacted by tightening of downstream customer credit as well as government project delays.
We believe that these storage demand headwinds are short lived and that the long-term demand picture for our mass storage product portfolio continues to be strong. Data creation and data utilization are forecasted to grow rapidly over the next decade. 
According to a recent IDC study, global data creation will grow from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 175 zettabytes by 2025, representing a 27% compound annual growth rate. Efficient and cost-effective data technologies are becoming more critical for productivity expansion, data monetization and value creation than ever before. 
To support future storage customer needs, storage capacity across all media types will need to grow rapidly. And IDC estimates that at least 59% of the zettabyte demand in 2025 will be supplied by the HDD industry. Seagate is a critical supplier to both the mature and emerging businesses that are only just beginning to derive value from massive application workloads coming in Big Data analytics, smart cities and machine learning devices using both edge and cloud-based architectures.
At CES a few weeks ago, we demonstrated the breadth of our storage solutions covering diverse products from consumer to enterprise, leveraging our 40-year history of storage technology innovation. We are highly encouraged by the continued engagement we have with customers on their future capacity and performance requirements. These technical insights are driving many of the performance and flexibility attributes of our future product portfolio. 
As evidence of our drive for innovation, we showcased our future generations of single and multi-actuator devices that many customers are testing in their own data center environments. We're confident in our ability to achieve 16-terabyte drive shipments in the first half of this calendar year, growing to over 20 terabytes next year.
These significant product introductions delivering high capacity and performance options will be critical in the efficient scaling of cloud data centers for the next decade.
This was our second year showcasing Seagate's HAMR technology at CES. In the December quarter, we broke another areal density record, demonstrating almost 2.4 terabit per square inch in spin stand testing, indicating technology than can enable the capacity of 3 terabytes per disc or 24-terabyte drive production capability. 
In the past few months, we shipped fully functional HAMR demonstration drives to select global hyperscale and OEM partners. These drives are meeting expectation. Central to that is to establish the plug-and-play nature of HAMR recording technologies in all storage ecosystems. With that in mind, our HAMR recording systems have demonstrated more than 4 petabyte per head data transfers, much greater than the workloads required for today's drives. This means our focus is now on the volume manufacturability of these designs, designs that will fuel the future global datasphere.  
Along with HAMR, we are also working to improve the efficiency of mass storage by eliminating the stranded capacity when a drive becomes too large for its IO bandwidth. This is already being seen today on 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte drives at many data centers and will become more challenging as drive capacities increases. 
Our Mach 2 dual actuator drive unlocks significant capability with a rough doubling of the IO bandwidth. We have successfully deployed Mach 2 sample drives to customer sites. And for the past 6 months, some of these drives have been serving live production traffic. Later this calendar year, we will begin our volume ramp of these important new designs.
The gaming industry continues to be a rich storage market opportunity, driven by demand for increased capacity points. This year at CES, we showcased our new M.2 NVMe SSD, which delivers blazing performance with intense read and write speeds for the ultimate gaming experience. We are confident Seagate's complete gaming portfolio, including internal drives and attached gaming console drives with the HDD and footprints, will continue to provide optimal user experiences. 
Also at CES, we introduced our IronWolf 110 SATA SSD, the world's first purpose-built NAS SSD with enterprise-class endurance and reliability. Looking ahead, we believe we are on the front end of a long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing data through cloud and edge computing layers will remain within the top priority of the growing data economy.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution and technology advancement for Seagate. With near-term demand headwinds, we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance and the resilience of our company through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for long-term revenue growth, properly staged capital investment for the coming growth opportunities, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. Now I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our financial performance."

Seagate executed well in the December quarter. Total second quarter revenue was over $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin was 29.7%, in line with our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33% of revenue. The sequential decline of 130",953,"Thank you, Dave. Seagate executed well in the December quarter. Total second quarter revenue was over $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin was 29.7%, in line with our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33% of revenue. The sequential decline of 130 basis points was mainly due to overall product portfolio mix, and in particular, to a decline in the nearline volume sold. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.41, higher than expected, gaining from overall solid execution and successful expense management.
Our enterprise market includes mission-critical and nearline applications, which represents 39% of total revenue. In the second quarter, we shipped a total of 36.4 exabyte in the enterprise market, down 3% compared to last year's strong demand.
The average capacity per enterprise drive was 4.5 terabyte, up 4% year-over-year. 
In the mission-critical market, we continue to address strong demand that resulted in 44% year-over-year exabyte growth, with average capacity per drive of over 1.1 terabyte, up 30% year-over-year. Our breadth of portfolio, up to 2.4 terabyte, continues to provide customers with a cost-effective solution required for mature enterprise application.
In the nearline market, we shipped 33 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 6.5 terabytes, up 10% over last year and up 44% from the same quarter 2 years ago.
The multi-quarter digestion phase that we are experiencing with cloud service provider customers is temporary affecting the exabyte demand in the overall nearline market. However, demand from OEM enterprise customers for nearline drives remains fairly stable.
As cloud and enterprise customers transition to higher capacity points, our nearline hard disk drive portfolio is well positioned to monetize storage demand over the long term. Our 12-terabyte nearline drive was the leading enterprise revenue product in the December quarter. And our highest capacity products, the 14-terabyte drive, continue to ramp in volume. Looking ahead, we are on scheduled to launch 16-terabyte products in the first half of this calendar year.
Edge noncompute market include our consumer, surveillance, NAS, gaming and DVR portfolio offering. In the December quarter, this market represented 31% of total revenue, 1% higher compared to the December quarter a year ago.
With growth, year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for almost all end markets in the December quarter. Within this, the consumer portfolio at 27% sequential capacity growth is driven by strong seasonal demand and market share gains. While we are confident of the long-term growth and profitability of this market, we are mindful when near-term demand in some markets and channels was impacted by the liquidity issues that Dave discussed earlier.
As compute market include desktop and notebook and disk drive applications, in the December quarter, this market represented 21% of total revenue, 2% lower compared to the December quarter a year ago. Total exabyte shipment declined 4% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive grew 9% year-over-year.
While these markets remain largely stable, there are some headwinds affecting near-term demand. Particularly, in the December quarter, the industry was negatively impacted by a CPU shortage, which affected some vendor's ability to fulfill demand created by business PC upgrades. This, coupled with economic uncertainties in some countries, affected the performance of the normally seasonally strong quarter for the compute market.
Non-hard disk drive revenue in the December quarter were $225 million, up 8% year-over-year, mainly driven by higher SSD revenue. Cloud systems decreased year-over-year due to a planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products. Sequentially, revenue has been stable in the past 2 quarters as we optimize the product portfolio.
SSD revenue were up both year-over-year and sequentially. We are optimistic about our long-term opportunities as we invest in developing a broad-based SSD product portfolio in the SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming market. We are mindful of the short-term market dynamics and NAND pricing movement, and are managing our business to meet current customer demand in a prudent manner.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $365 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower, mostly due to reduced discretionary spending and overall operational efficiency. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15% of revenue.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $288 million. The sequential decrease was mostly related to the timing of some working capital transactions. We do not expect adverse impact to cash flow from working capital changes to reoccur in the March quarter.
On a fiscal-to-date basis, Seagate has generated $875 million in cash flow from operations and $571 million in free cash flow. Total inventory levels are slightly lower sequentially and consistent with demand expectations. 
Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $127 million in the December quarter. For fiscal year '19, we expect total capital expenditures to be at the low end of our long-term range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
In the December quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares, and we exited the quarter with 283 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalent, and our board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on April 12, 2019.
As planned, we also repaid the remaining 2018 senior notes for approximately $500 million. The company's debt balance as of December quarter was $4.3 billion. Our net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the December quarter.
Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. Overall, our financial performance in the December quarter reflects solid execution in a challenging demand environment. I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments and the outlook."

As we enter calendar year 2019, there are a number of market uncertainties that are broadly affecting IT companies. Macroeconomic risks and softness persist in global demand from cloud service providers and supply-chain frictions and liquidity have created strain for some smaller end customers. We are navigating through these market dynamics with a conservatism and managing our business with a focus on profitability and cash flow generation. As we go through this cycle of compressed exabyte demand, we are taking measures to control our costs and capital spending with the expectation that the exabyte growth will resume sometime in the second half of the calendar year. 
Within our revenue expectations for the March quarter, we anticipate nearline HDD demand to remain soft and our nearline exabyte shipments to be flat to down -- to slightly down sequentially. 
We expect the consumer and gaming markets to 
be seasonally down in the March quarter, and desktop and notebook demand to be slightly lower than seasonal demand as CPU shortage and macro uncertainty overhang continue to affect the volume in these markets. We also expect our cloud systems revenue to be relatively flat sequentially and our SSD revenues to be down sequentially due to product transitions in our near-term conservative approach to the NAND market. 
We expect total revenues in the March quarter to be in the range of $2.3 billion, plus or minus 5%. Total exabyte shipments are forecasted to be 10% to 15% lower sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margins for the March quarter to be at least 26%, with the majority of the sequential change related to mix and manufacturing underutilization. This forecast is outside of our long-term margin range of 29% to 33% as we adjust our manufacturing plan to a lower build volume and to keep a lean inventory level. As demand resumes and other market trends stabilize, we expect margins to return for the long-term range.
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $0.70, plus or minus 5%. We remain confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years as we leverage our mass storage solutions portfolio for existing and new market opportunities. 
In closing, like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong second fiscal quarter results. Seagate's deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will allow us to meaningfully participate in the long-term growth trajectory for storage, delivering sustainable success for the company and value for our shareholders. I'm confident Seagate will continue to lead the HDD industry and serve our customers with the best technology developments, product offerings and supply chain responsiveness.

First of all, when you talked about the outlook for the current quarter for nearline, I was wondering how that's different than maybe 90 days ago? And along similar lines, can you just sort of talk about what gave you the confidence in the second half recovery in nearline spending? And then last question on nearline, will there just be any noticeable market share shifts on different capacity points that you might want to call out?"

I'd say that we've talked about the cyclicality before, the peak that we were in, in probably fiscal Q4 of last year, maybe even fiscal Q1 of this year. It really looks like we're in the trough now again. And the question is how deep is the t",256,"Yes, Steven. I'd say that we've talked about the cyclicality before, the peak that we were in, in probably fiscal Q4 of last year, maybe even fiscal Q1 of this year. It really looks like we're in the trough now again. And the question is how deep is the trough and how wide is it and so on. So there's no reason to believe that this is necessarily that much different than the prior. But what's different than 90 days ago? I would say that we do see some customers coming back for mix changes and things like that, so there are signs of life, but nothing that I would call growth back to the next peak. And I think there are various reasons for that, you can see that in our capital spending. I don't really think there's very many competitive dynamics that are changing. We did allude to in our script, if you'll notice, that there could be some waiting for the next capacity points to be qualified, if you will. Because once you go into one of these cycles, everyone -- not just the suppliers with hard drives, but also the customers and the filters are requesting their qualification resources and the timing of what they want to ramp, when. So there maybe some of that, that's impacting things a little bit. I do think that the cycle will come back because just the exabyte demand and servicing that's already in the legacy data centers would have to get back on the pace."

Maybe you have software issues that you're looking to stage yourselves up. I think there's a lot of things going on in the world.

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the December quarter and offer some market commentary. Gianluca Romano, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the March quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenue of over $2.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.41, meeting and in some aspects exceeding our expectations. We executed our plans well and with strong operational efficiency, delivered solid financial results.
As we indicated last quarter, we were working to effectively manage through a near-term demand downturn that is having an impact in our current business. For the overall HDD industry, the December quarter exabyte demand declined for the first time after 6 quarters of continued growth. 
In the nearline market, we continue to see a cyclical impact affecting a broad base of customers globally. While some of the demand variation is due to the intermittent periods of digestions we have experienced in this market over the last few years, some cloud customers are also pausing ahead of next-generation mass storage technology transitions that will deliver significant capacity, performance and total cost of ownership benefits.
While inventory levels for our HDD, storage devices and global channels appear fairly healthy, other market dynamics, including seasonality, parts shortages and liquidity have created strain for some smaller end customers. For example, in the surveillance market, demand was soft compared to this time last year, impacted by tightening of downstream customer credit as well as government project delays.
We believe that these storage demand headwinds are short lived and that the long-term demand picture for our mass storage product portfolio continues to be strong. Data creation and data utilization are forecasted to grow rapidly over the next decade. 
According to a recent IDC study, global data creation will grow from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 175 zettabytes by 2025, representing a 27% compound annual growth rate. Efficient and cost-effective data technologies are becoming more critical for productivity expansion, data monetization and value creation than ever before. 
To support future storage customer needs, storage capacity across all media types will need to grow rapidly. And IDC estimates that at least 59% of the zettabyte demand in 2025 will be supplied by the HDD industry. Seagate is a critical supplier to both the mature and emerging businesses that are only just beginning to derive value from massive application workloads coming in Big Data analytics, smart cities and machine learning devices using both edge and cloud-based architectures.
At CES a few weeks ago, we demonstrated the breadth of our storage solutions covering diverse products from consumer to enterprise, leveraging our 40-year history of storage technology innovation. We are highly encouraged by the continued engagement we have with customers on their future capacity and performance requirements. These technical insights are driving many of the performance and flexibility attributes of our future product portfolio. 
As evidence of our drive for innovation, we showcased our future generations of single and multi-actuator devices that many customers are testing in their own data center environments. We're confident in our ability to achieve 16-terabyte drive shipments in the first half of this calendar year, growing to over 20 terabytes next year.
These significant product introductions delivering high capacity and performance options will be critical in the efficient scaling of cloud data centers for the next decade.
This was our second year showcasing Seagate's HAMR technology at CES. In the December quarter, we broke another areal density record, demonstrating almost 2.4 terabit per square inch in spin stand testing, indicating technology than can enable the capacity of 3 terabytes per disc or 24-terabyte drive production capability. 
In the past few months, we shipped fully functional HAMR demonstration drives to select global hyperscale and OEM partners. These drives are meeting expectation. Central to that is to establish the plug-and-play nature of HAMR recording technologies in all storage ecosystems. With that in mind, our HAMR recording systems have demonstrated more than 4 petabyte per head data transfers, much greater than the workloads required for today's drives. This means our focus is now on the volume manufacturability of these designs, designs that will fuel the future global datasphere.  
Along with HAMR, we are also working to improve the efficiency of mass storage by eliminating the stranded capacity when a drive becomes too large for its IO bandwidth. This is already being seen today on 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte drives at many data centers and will become more challenging as drive capacities increases. 
Our Mach 2 dual actuator drive unlocks significant capability with a rough doubling of the IO bandwidth. We have successfully deployed Mach 2 sample drives to customer sites. And for the past 6 months, some of these drives have been serving live production traffic. Later this calendar year, we will begin our volume ramp of these important new designs.
The gaming industry continues to be a rich storage market opportunity, driven by demand for increased capacity points. This year at CES, we showcased our new M.2 NVMe SSD, which delivers blazing performance with intense read and write speeds for the ultimate gaming experience. We are confident Seagate's complete gaming portfolio, including internal drives and attached gaming console drives with the HDD and SSD footprints, will continue to provide optimal user experiences. 
Also at CES, we introduced our IronWolf 110 SATA SSD, the world's first purpose-built NAS SSD with enterprise-class endurance and reliability. Looking ahead, we believe we are on the front end of a long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing data through cloud and edge computing layers will remain within the top priority of the growing data economy.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution and technology advancement for Seagate. With near-term demand headwinds, we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance and the resilience of our company through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for long-term revenue growth, properly staged capital investment for the coming growth opportunities, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. Now I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our financial performance."

Seagate executed well in the December quarter. Total second quarter revenue was over $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin was 29.7%, in line with our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33% of revenue. The sequential decline of 130",953,"Thank you, Dave. Seagate executed well in the December quarter. Total second quarter revenue was over $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin was 29.7%, in line with our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33% of revenue. The sequential decline of 130 basis points was mainly due to overall product portfolio mix, and in particular, to a decline in the nearline volume sold. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.41, higher than expected, gaining from overall solid execution and successful expense management.
Our enterprise market includes mission-critical and nearline applications, which represents 39% of total revenue. In the second quarter, we shipped a total of 36.4 exabyte in the enterprise market, down 3% compared to last year's strong demand.
The average capacity per enterprise drive was 4.5 terabyte, up 4% year-over-year. 
In the mission-critical market, we continue to address strong demand that resulted in 44% year-over-year exabyte growth, with average capacity per drive of over 1.1 terabyte, up 30% year-over-year. Our breadth of portfolio, up to 2.4 terabyte, continues to provide customers with a cost-effective solution required for mature enterprise application.
In the nearline market, we shipped 33 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 6.5 terabytes, up 10% over last year and up 44% from the same quarter 2 years ago.
The multi-quarter digestion phase that we are experiencing with cloud service provider customers is temporary affecting the exabyte demand in the overall nearline market. However, demand from OEM enterprise customers for nearline drives remains fairly stable.
As cloud and enterprise customers transition to higher capacity points, our nearline hard disk drive portfolio is well positioned to monetize storage demand over the long term. Our 12-terabyte nearline drive was the leading enterprise revenue product in the December quarter. As our highest capacity products, the 14-terabyte drive, continue to ramp in volume. Looking ahead, we are on scheduled to launch 16-terabyte products in the first half of this calendar year.
Edge noncompute market include our consumer, surveillance, NAS, gaming and DVR portfolio offering. In the December quarter, this market represented 31% of total revenue, 1% higher compared to the December quarter a year ago.
We drove year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for almost all end markets in the December quarter. Within this, the consumer portfolio at 27% sequential capacity growth is driven by strong seasonal demand and market share gains. While we are confident of the long-term growth and profitability of this market, we are mindful when near-term demand in some markets and channels was impacted by the liquidity issues that Dave discussed earlier.
Edge compute market include desktop and notebook and disk drive applications, in the December quarter, this market represented 21% of total revenue, 2% lower compared to the December quarter a year ago. Total exabyte shipment declined 4% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive grew 9% year-over-year.
While these markets remain largely stable, there are some headwinds affecting near-term demand. Particularly, in the December quarter, the industry was negatively impacted by a CPU shortage, which affected some vendor's ability to fulfill demand created by business PC upgrades. This, coupled with economic uncertainties in some countries, affected the performance of the normally seasonally strong quarter for the compute market.
Non-hard disk drive revenue in the December quarter were $225 million, up 8% year-over-year, mainly driven by higher SSD revenue. Cloud systems decreased year-over-year due to a planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products. Sequentially, revenue has been stable in the past 2 quarters as we optimize the product portfolio.
SSD revenue were up both year-over-year and sequentially. We are optimistic about our long-term opportunities as we invest in developing a broad-based SSD product portfolio in the SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming market. We are mindful of the short-term market dynamics and NAND pricing movement, and are managing our business to meet current customer demand in a prudent manner.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $365 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower, mostly due to reduced discretionary spending and overall operational efficiency. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15% of revenue.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $288 million. The sequential decrease was mostly related to the timing of some working capital transactions. We do not expect adverse impact to cash flow from working capital changes to reoccur in the March quarter.
On a fiscal-to-date basis, Seagate has generated $875 million in cash flow from operations and $571 million in free cash flow. Total inventory levels are slightly lower sequentially and consistent with demand expectations. 
Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $127 million in the December quarter. For fiscal year '19, we expect total capital expenditures to be at the low end of our long-term range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
In the December quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares, and we exited the quarter with 283 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalent, and our board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on April 12, 2019.
As planned, we also repaid the remaining 2018 senior notes for approximately $500 million. The company's debt balance as of December quarter was $4.3 billion. Our net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the December quarter.
Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. Overall, our financial performance in the December quarter reflects solid execution in a challenging demand environment. I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments and the outlook."

As we enter calendar year 2019, there are a number of market uncertainties that are broadly affecting IT companies. Macroeconomic risks and softness persist in global demand from cloud service providers and supply-chain frictions and liquidity have created strain for some smaller end customers. We are navigating through these market dynamics with a conservatism and managing our business with a focus on profitability and cash flow generation. As we go through this cycle of compressed exabyte demand, we are taking measures to control our costs and capital spending with the expectation that the exabyte growth will resume sometime in the second half of the calendar year. 
Within our revenue expectations for the March quarter, we anticipate nearline HDD demand to remain soft and our nearline exabyte shipments to be flat to down -- to slightly down sequentially. 
We expect the consumer and gaming markets to 
be seasonally down in the March quarter, and desktop and notebook demand to be slightly lower than seasonal demand as CPU shortage and macro uncertainty overhang continue to affect the volume in these markets. We also expect our cloud systems revenue to be relatively flat sequentially and our SSD revenues to be down sequentially due to product transitions in our near-term conservative approach to the NAND market. 
We expect total revenues in the March quarter to be in the range of $2.3 billion, plus or minus 5%. Total exabyte shipments are forecasted to be 10% to 15% lower sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margins for the March quarter to be at least 26%, with the majority of the sequential change related to mix and manufacturing underutilization. This forecast is outside of our long-term margin range of 29% to 33% as we adjust our manufacturing plan to a lower build volume and to keep a lean inventory level. As demand resumes and other market trends stabilize, we expect margins to return to the long-term range.
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $0.70, plus or minus 5%. We remain confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years as we leverage our mass storage solutions portfolio for existing and new market opportunities. 
In closing, like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong second fiscal quarter results. Seagate's deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will allow us to meaningfully participate in the long-term growth trajectory for storage, delivering sustainable success for the company and value for our shareholders. I'm confident Seagate will continue to lead the HDD industry and serve our customers with the best technology developments, product offerings and supply chain responsiveness. 
Thanks, Latif. Now we'll open up the call for questions."

I'd say that we've talked about the cyclicality before, the peak that we were in, in probably fiscal Q4 of last year, maybe even fiscal Q1 of this year. It really looks like we're in the trough now again. And the question is how deep is the trough and how wide is it and so on. So there's no reason to believe that this is necessarily that much different than the prior. But what's different than 90 days ago? I would say that we do see some customers coming back for mix changes and things like that, so there are signs of life, but nothing that I would call growth back to the next peak. And I think there are various reasons for that, you can see that in our capital spending. I don't really think there's very many competitive dynamics that are changing. We did allude to in our script, if you'll notice, that there could be some waiting for the next capacity points to be qualified, if you will. Because once you go into one of these cycles, everyone -- not just the suppliers with hard drives, but also the customers and the filters are requesting their qualification resources and the timing of what they want to ramp, when. So there maybe some of that, that's impacting things a little bit. I do think that the cycle will come back because just the exabyte demand and servicing that's already in the legacy data centers would have to get back on the pace."

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the December quarter and offer some market commentary. Gianluca Romano, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the March quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenue of over $2.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.41, meeting and in some aspects exceeding our expectations. We executed our plans well and with strong operational efficiency, delivered solid financial results.
As we indicated last quarter, we were working to effectively manage through a near-term demand downturn that is having an impact in our current business. For the overall HDD industry, the December quarter exabyte demand declined for the first time after 6 quarters of continued growth. 
In the nearline market, we continue to see a cyclical impact affecting a broad base of customers globally. While some of the demand variation is due to the intermittent periods of digestions we have experienced in this market over the last few years, some cloud customers are also pausing ahead of next-generation mass storage technology transitions that will deliver significant capacity, performance and total cost of ownership benefits.
While inventory levels for our HDD, storage devices and global channels appear fairly healthy, other market dynamics, including seasonality, parts shortages and liquidity have created strain for some smaller end customers. For example, in the surveillance market, demand was soft compared to this time last year, impacted by tightening of downstream customer credit as well as government project delays.
We believe that these storage demand headwinds are short lived and that the long-term demand picture for our mass storage product portfolio continues to be strong. Data creation and data utilization are forecasted to grow rapidly over the next decade. 
According to a recent IDC study, global data creation will grow from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 175 zettabytes by 2025, representing a 27% compound annual growth rate. Efficient and cost-effective data technologies are becoming more critical for productivity expansion, data monetization and value creation than ever before. 
To support future storage customer needs, storage capacity across all media types will need to grow rapidly. And IDC estimates that at least 59% of the zettabyte demand in 2025 will be supplied by the HDD industry. Seagate is a critical supplier to both the mature and emerging businesses that are only just beginning to derive value from massive application workloads coming in Big Data analytics, smart cities and machine learning devices using both edge and cloud-based architectures.
At CES a few weeks ago, we demonstrated the breadth of our storage solutions covering diverse products from consumer to enterprise, leveraging our 40-year history of storage technology innovation. We are highly encouraged by the continued engagement we have with customers on their future capacity and performance requirements. These technical insights are driving many of the performance and flexibility attributes of our future product portfolio. 
As evidence of our drive for innovation, we showcased our future generations of single and multi-actuator devices that many customers are testing in their own data center environments. We're confident in our ability to achieve 16-terabyte drive shipments in the first half of this calendar year, growing to over 20 terabytes next year.
These significant product introductions delivering high capacity and performance options will be critical in the efficient scaling of cloud data centers for the next decade.
This was our second year showcasing Seagate's HAMR technology at CES. In the December quarter, we broke another areal density record, demonstrating almost 2.4 terabit per square inch in spin stand testing, indicating technology than can enable the capacity of 3 terabytes per disc or 24-terabyte drive production capability. 
In the past few months, we shipped fully functional HAMR demonstration drives to select global hyperscale and OEM partners. These drives are meeting expectation. Central to that is to establish the plug-and-play nature of HAMR recording technologies in all storage ecosystems. With that in mind, our HAMR recording systems have demonstrated more than 4 petabyte per head data transfers, much greater than the workloads required for today's drives. This means our focus is now on the volume manufacturability of these designs, designs that will fuel the future global datasphere.  
Along with HAMR, we are also working to improve the efficiency of mass storage by eliminating the stranded capacity when a drive becomes too large for its IO bandwidth. This is already being seen today on 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte drives at many data centers and will become more challenging as drive capacities increases. 
Our Mach 2 dual actuator drive unlocks significant capability with a rough doubling of the IO bandwidth. We have successfully deployed Mach 2 sample drives to customer sites. And for the past 6 months, some of these drives have been serving live production traffic. Later this calendar year, we will begin our volume ramp of these important new designs.
The gaming industry continues to be a rich storage market opportunity, driven by demand for increased capacity points. This year at CES, we showcased our new M.2 NVMe SSD, which delivers blazing performance with intense read and write speeds for the ultimate gaming experience. We are confident Seagate's complete gaming portfolio, including internal drives and attached gaming console drives with the HDD and SSD footprints, will continue to provide optimal user experiences. 
Also at CES, we introduced our IronWolf 110 SATA SSD, the world's first purpose-built NAS SSD with enterprise-class endurance and reliability. Looking ahead, we believe we are on the front end of a long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing data through cloud and edge computing layers will remain within the top priority of the growing data economy.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution and technology advancement for Seagate. With near-term demand headwinds, we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance and the resilience of our company through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for long-term revenue growth, properly staged capital investment for the coming growth opportunities, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. Now I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our financial performance."

Seagate executed well in the December quarter. Total second quarter revenue was over $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin was 29.7%, in line with our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33% of revenue. The sequential decline of 130",953,"Thank you, Dave. Seagate executed well in the December quarter. Total second quarter revenue was over $2.7 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin was 29.7%, in line with our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33% of revenue. The sequential decline of 130 basis points was mainly due to overall product portfolio mix, and in particular, to a decline in the nearline volume sold. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.41, higher than expected, gaining from overall solid execution and successful expense management.
Our enterprise market includes mission-critical and nearline applications, which represents 39% of total revenue. In the second quarter, we shipped a total of 36.4 exabyte in the enterprise market, down 3% compared to last year's strong demand.
The average capacity per enterprise drive was 4.5 terabyte, up 4% year-over-year. 
In the mission-critical market, we continue to address strong demand that resulted in 44% year-over-year exabyte growth, with average capacity per drive of over 1.1 terabyte, up 30% year-over-year. Our breadth of portfolio, up to 2.4 terabyte, continues to provide customers with a cost-effective solution required for mature enterprise application.
In the nearline market, we shipped 33 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 6.5 terabytes, up 10% over last year and up 44% from the same quarter 2 years ago.
The multi-quarter digestion phase that we are experiencing with cloud service provider customers is temporary affecting the exabyte demand in the overall nearline market. However, demand from OEM enterprise customers for nearline drives remains fairly stable.
As cloud and enterprise customers transition to higher capacity points, our nearline hard disk drive portfolio is well positioned to monetize storage demand over the long term. Our 12-terabyte nearline drive was the leading enterprise revenue product in the December quarter. As our highest capacity products, the 14-terabyte drive, continue to ramp in volume. Looking ahead, we are on scheduled to launch 16-terabyte products in the first half of this calendar year.
Edge noncompute market include our consumer, surveillance, NAS, gaming and DVR portfolio offering. In the December quarter, this market represented 31% of total revenue, 1% higher compared to the December quarter a year ago.
We drove year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for almost all end markets in the December quarter. Within this, the consumer portfolio at 27% sequential capacity growth is driven by strong seasonal demand and market share gains. While we are confident of the long-term growth and profitability of this market, we are mindful when near-term demand in some markets and channels was impacted by the liquidity issues that Dave discussed earlier.
Edge compute market include desktop and notebook and disk drive applications, in the December quarter, this market represented 21% of total revenue, 2% lower compared to the December quarter a year ago. Total exabyte shipment declined 4% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive grew 9% year-over-year.
While these markets remain largely stable, there are some headwinds affecting near-term demand. Particularly, in the December quarter, the industry was negatively impacted by a CPU shortage, which affected some vendor's ability to fulfill demand created by business PC upgrades. This, coupled with economic uncertainties in some countries, affected the performance of the normally seasonally strong quarter for the compute market.
Non-hard disk drive revenue in the December quarter were $225 million, up 8% year-over-year, mainly driven by higher SSD revenue. Cloud systems decreased year-over-year due to a planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products. Sequentially, revenue has been stable in the past 2 quarters as we optimize the product portfolio.
SSD revenue were up both year-over-year and sequentially. We are optimistic about our long-term opportunities as we invest in developing a broad-based SSD product portfolio in the SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming market. We are mindful of the short-term market dynamics and NAND pricing movement, and are managing our business to meet current customer demand in a prudent manner.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $365 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower, mostly due to reduced discretionary spending and overall operational efficiency. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15% of revenue.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $288 million. The sequential decrease was mostly related to the timing of some working capital transactions. We do not expect adverse impact to cash flow from working capital changes to reoccur in the March quarter.
On a fiscal-to-date basis, Seagate has generated $875 million in cash flow from operations and $571 million in free cash flow. Total inventory levels are slightly lower sequentially and consistent with demand expectations. 
Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $127 million in the December quarter. For fiscal year '19, we expect total capital expenditures to be at the low end of our long-term range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
In the December quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares, and we exited the quarter with 283 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalent, and our board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on April 12, 2019.
As planned, we also repaid the remaining 2018 senior notes for approximately $500 million. The company's debt balance as of December quarter was $4.3 billion. Our net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the December quarter.
Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. Overall, our financial performance in the December quarter reflects solid execution in a challenging demand environment. I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments and the outlook."

As we enter calendar year 2019, there are a number of market uncertainties that are broadly affecting IT companies. Macroeconomic risks and softness persist in global demand from cloud service providers and supply-chain frictions and liquidity have created strain for some smaller end customers. We are navigating through these market dynamics with a conservatism and managing our business with a focus on profitability and cash flow generation. As we go through this cycle of compressed exabyte demand, we are taking measures to control our costs and capital spending with the expectation that the exabyte growth will resume sometime in the second half of the calendar year. 
Within our revenue expectations for the March quarter, we anticipate nearline HDD demand to remain soft and our nearline exabyte shipments to be flat to down -- to slightly down sequentially. 
We expect the consumer and gaming markets to 
be seasonally down in the March quarter, and desktop and notebook demand to be slightly lower than seasonal demand as CPU shortage and macro uncertainty overhang continue to affect the volume in these markets. We also expect our cloud systems revenue to be relatively flat sequentially and our SSD revenues to be down sequentially due to product transitions in our near-term conservative approach to the NAND market. 
We expect total revenues in the March quarter to be in the range of $2.3 billion, plus or minus 5%. Total exabyte shipments are forecasted to be 10% to 15% lower sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margins for the March quarter to be at least 26%, with the majority of the sequential change related to mix and manufacturing underutilization. This forecast is outside of our long-term margin range of 29% to 33% as we adjust our manufacturing plan to a lower build volume and to keep a lean inventory level. As demand resumes and other market trends stabilize, we expect margins to return to the long-term range.
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $0.70, plus or minus 5%. We remain confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years as we leverage our mass storage solutions portfolio for existing and new market opportunities. 
In closing, like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong second fiscal quarter results. Seagate's deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will allow us to meaningfully participate in the long-term growth trajectory for storage, delivering sustainable success for the company and value for our shareholders. I'm confident Seagate will continue to lead the HDD industry and serve our customers with the best technology developments, product offerings and supply chain responsiveness.

So there's no reason to believe that this is necessarily that much different than the prior. But what's different than 90 days ago? I would say that we do see some customers coming back for mix changes and things like that, so there are signs of life, but nothing that I would call growth back to the next peak. And I think there are various reasons for that, you can see that in our capital spending. I don't really think there's very many competitive dynamics that are changing. We did allude to in our script, if you'll notice, that there could be some waiting for the next capacity points to be qualified, if you will. Because once you go into one of these cycles, everyone -- not just the suppliers with hard drives, but also the customers and the filters are requesting their qualification resources and the timing of what they want to ramp, when. So there maybe some of that, that's impacting things a little bit. I do think that the cycle will come back because just the exabyte demand and servicing that's already in the legacy data centers would have to get back on the pace."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call, which we are joining from Dublin, Ireland. During today's call, I will cover the key highlights from the March quarter, share some perspectives on the market and outline our progress on advancing our technology road map. Gianluca will then discuss details of our March quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the June quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate executed well in the March quarter, navigating challenging business conditions to deliver financial results that met or exceeded our expectations across every financial metric. We recorded revenue of $2.31 billion and achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83, nearly $0.10 above the high end of our guidance range.
Free cash flow increased to $291 million, up 81% quarter-over-quarter and we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns. We achieved these results through our focused efforts to drive operational efficiencies, controlled expenses and optimize cash flow generation, proactively managing the business the faces of multiple revenue headwinds.
In the edge compute market, revenue was impacted by the expected transition to SSDs, ongoing CPU shortages and seasonal demand slowdown for notebooks and desktop PCs. In the surveillance market, revenue remains suppressed by economic and geopolitical uncertainties. However, over the long term, we expect the market to grow as camera resolution improves to 8 megapixels and drive the average capacity per drive above current levels of 3 to 4 terabytes. In the enterprise market, both seasonal and macroeconomic challenges weighed on revenue for our nearline drives.
Revenue from a few hyperscale customers improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. However, the revenue did not fully offset the slower demand from OEM and other global cloud customers. As a reminder, demand for our nearline drives begin to slow in the December quarter as cloud service providers work through the inventory buildup during calendar 2018. However, we anticipate this pause to be short-lived. The demand improvements I just mentioned, among select hyperscale customers, is an indication that we were approaching the end of this inventory digestion phase, and we expect broader demand recovery starting in the second half of the calendar year.
We also believe some of the slowdown we are experiencing in our nearline product demand is attributed to cloud customers anticipating the transition to our next generation high-capacity drives.
We are very pleased to announce that we began shipping our 16 terabyte drives in late March as planned. We are delivering the industry's highest capacity disk drives to enable improved performance at the lowest total cost of ownership for our customers. Qualifications are underway at many major cloud and enterprise customers. We expect to begin ramping to high volume later in calendar 2019 and expect 16 terabyte drives will be our highest revenue SKU by this time next year.
For Seagate, fiscal 2019 is a year of focused execution and technology advancement, and we continue to successfully deliver on our plans. We expect to introduce drives with over 20 terabytes of capacity in calendar year 2020, based on our innovative HAMR recording technology. These technology breakthroughs are significant enablers, providing a path of 40 terabytes and higher capacities, that's more than double the capacities available today. While at the same time making the transition to this new technology seamless for customers. Perhaps best stated by one of our large hyperscale customers working to qualify HAMR, it just works.
We also made strides on our multi-actuator technology. During the recent open compute project Summit, we set a new speed record for video streaming data rates from a hard drive. With our mock dual actuator, we demonstrated twice the bandwidth compared to a single actuator drive, the fastest ever sustained transfer rates from a hard drive. We believe HAMR high dentistry drives comply with our multi-actuator technology will not only address of the heavy workloads and high utilization rates required by large cloud data centers but also new use cases that are merging at the edge. The global data experience is expected to double once every 3 years to reach a staggering 175 zettabytes by 2025.
This rapid growth in data creation is giving rise to new applications, including smart cities, smart factories, genomics, autonomous vehicles and other IoT applications, all of which employ a high machine learning to derive value from big data.
To inform realtime decision making, we believe more data processing and machine learning will need to occur closer to the source of data creation. Seagate has referred to this transition as the IT 4.0 era or the rise of the edge computing. We are starting to see a buildup in private and edge cloud environments to enable fast, secure access to data 24/7.
With this transition to IT 4.0 and associated growth in data at the edge, exit by demand for nearline drives may exceed our prior growth estimates of between 35% and 40% over the long term. Importantly, Seagate's innovative technology portfolio positions us well to capture and monetize these opportunities.
I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our third quarter results and share our outlook for the fourth quarter."

Our results are reflecting of softer demand from cloud service provider in advance of our transition to 16 terabytes nearline drives as well as the ongoing global macro concern and typical seasonality, as Dave has discussed earlier.
Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical drives represented 39% of March quarter revenue, less as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. We shipped approximately 33 exabytes into the enterprise market, down 10% quarter-over-quarter. The vast majority of the exabyte shipment were into the nearline market.
Exabyte shipment for cloud customers were up quarter over quarter, which partially offset the decline in shipments to OEMs. The capacity for nearline drive hits a new record of 7.2 terabytes, up 11% over the prior quarter.
Our 12 terabyte nearline drive remains our highest selling enterprise product in the March quarter. As Dave indicated earlier, we have started to ship the industry's highest capacity 16 terabyte drive in the current quarter and expect to ramp production as customers complete their qualification over the next few quarters. Given the total cost of ownership for customers and expected high reliability of these drives, we believe we are well positioned to capture market opportunities in the coming quarters.
We also continue to leverage our existing product portfolio through customer demand for mission-critical drives, which positively contributes to our margin and cash flow. Revenue for the edge noncompute market contributed 32% of the total March quarter revenue compared to 31% in the prior quarter and includes sales for surveillance, gaming, NAND, DVR and consumer application.
Sales for data reapplication, including gaming, NAND and DVR agree sequentially, which partially offsets the Marco headwind and seasonal trend surveillance and consumer market, respectively.
Exabyte shipments, whereas noncompute platforms were 29 exabyte and down 10% quarter-over-quarter, while average capacity per drive remain approximately flat at 2.4 terabytes.
Revenue from the edge compute market including desktop and notebook and disk drive represented 20% of total revenue compared to 21% in the December quarter. Our results reflect difficult seasonality combined with ongoing CPU shortages. Exabyte shipments for edge compute platforms were nearly 15 exabyte, down 21% quarter-over-quarter, which differs in seasonal decline of notebooks and desktop PCs.
Our non-hard disk drive business, including SSD and close systems solutions made up the remaining 8% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter.
As we have shared over the past several quarters, we are focused on portfolio management to capture opportunities that deliver the highest value to our customers. We continue to make good progress also will take time to fully make this transition. Cloud systems revenue has remained relatively stable over the past several quarters. SSD revenue declined sequentially, and of product transition, which are expected to occur over the next couple of quarters.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was above our expectations at 26.6% compared to 29.7% in the December quarter, about half of the sequential margin decline was associated with money pensioning under utilization because as to effectively manage our production to more closely align with industry condition. Capacity utilization is directly correlated to portfolio mix. Highest capacity drives such as nearline and surveillance utilize more head and disk and takes longer to test compared to lower capacity SSDs.
While we expect capacity under utilization cost the decline in gross margin to improve when demand resume on higher capacity drives.
Non-GAAP operating expenses came in better than our expectation at $349 million, down 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The decline in spending reflect the ongoing expense discipline and lower variable compensation expense. We continue to focus on managing expenses and utilizing capital for R&D investment to advance our future technology, products and solutions.
The operational and expense discipline, we deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 in the March quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range. Our operational focus has also led to solid return on invested capital. On a rolling fourth quarter basis, ROIC expended to nearly 27% in the March quarter compared to 25% in the prior-year period. We generated $438 million in cash from operations, as 52% sequentially as to improve working capital, including a 9% decline in total inventory value quarter-over-quarter.
Capital expenditures were $147 million during the March quarter at the lower end of our long-term targeted range of between 6% and 8% of revenue. Our resulting free cash flow was $291 million, up 81% from the prior quarter. We utilized $327 million to repurchase 7.2 million ordinary shares, and we exited the quarter with 277 million ordinary shares outstanding.
Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 13.4 million ordinary shares and reduced our share count by 4%. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter. And our Board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on July 3, 2019.
During the March quarter, we entered a new $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. The company debt balance as of March quarter was $4.5 billion, including $200 million drawn from the revolver. Our gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio is 1.9x as of the March quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the June quarter. We anticipate a relatively flat to the business environment in the June quarter, resuming demand conditions across our end market. this environment, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.32 billion, plus or minus 5%. Non-GAAP gross margin to be at least 26.5% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83, plus or minus 5%.
During this period, Seagate will continue to drive operational efficiencies to optimize our profitability and free cash flow. When business conditions should meet somewhat challenging in the June quarter, based on our interaction with customers, we expect demand to recover starting in the second half of the calendar year.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

We are driving operational efficiencies by managing our costs and capital investments to align with near-term industry conditions and optimize profitability and free cash flow. We are harvesting HDD opportunities in markets with a low exabyte growth such as mission-critical drives, which contribute nicely to our bottom line, particularly during these lower demand periods, while requiring no R&D investment. We are executing our technology road map leveraging our 40-plus year heritage of innovation expertise in precision engineered data solutions to introduce new products with the highest area density, quality and availability to address our customers future requirements.
We believe the near-term industry headwinds we are experiencing will abate in the coming quarters and the long-term growth trajectory of mass storage demand provides a rich set of opportunities for Seagate.
Data hungry applications are fueling demand for higher capacity storage in both public and private clouds. Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we expect that the exabyte and for nearline drives to be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40%. Importantly, Seagate's strong technology portfolio and customer relationships make us well positioned to capitalize on this growth.

Otherwise, we would have stacked back a little bit faster. Sure, if the cloud comes back faster than we're anticipating right now, which we're starting to see signs over the back half, then I think we should be able to get back into the range. And I think I've said this before, our solve is not gross margin percentage either. We were in the January time frame when we last spoke to everyone, we were really focused on free cash flow, just making sure carefully, make sure we weren't pulling too much inventory and things like that. So that may have actually hindered our ability to move a little bit extra product in this last few months. Again, I'd say that's towards the conservative side on my part, but that's how I think about the gross margin."

In the distribution channel, there are some people still making the lower capacity described partners but very few I think, they tend to be much more entrepreneurial, I talked about his little bit less quarter. We still haven't seen the healthy channels just yet so while [indiscernible] are fairly healthy on a relative basis, I would to be absolute value of the channel and its not a strong nearly as it was just a couple of quarters ago and that includes the higher capacity staff, which should be some of those new markets have created the new markets.

I think one the February call, we were just coming off of a fairly disturbed pull dynamics that we're going on all the way through December. And the one aspect of it, not the only one, obviously. It was fairly global, it's also got a long tail, it's not just 1 CSPs or something, but it's also the smaller build-out. The reason we have confidence in the back half of the year now is we're starting to see some of the data center build-out that's was anticipated, say, 6 months or 9 months ago, to be discussed again, the exact same data centers again, especially globally. And then we also think that there's been some inventory readjustments that have gone on for the last 6 months. There will be an anticipation of moving to higher capacity drives with that our total cost of ownership compositions on the back half of the year. So we're feeling a lot more confident that we were there talking with you on February, for sure. As far as the next cycle, this one's been a little bit more pronounced than the last one that feels that way, and it's been more global, and it's been touching as we reach out through the OEMs and ODMs that were helping do the builds, it's been more broad based on the last one. The last one came back pretty quickly because of the world turning on at the same time. We're hearing rumors of all this but it still wouldn't say strong, so it feels like this one may be a bigger peak in exabytes but much wider, because there will be a little bit of trepidation."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call, which we are joining from Dublin, Ireland. During today's call, I will cover the key highlights from the March quarter, share some perspectives on the market and outline our progress on advancing our technology road map. Gianluca will then discuss details of our March quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the June quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate executed well in the March quarter, navigating challenging business conditions to deliver financial results that met or exceeded our expectations across every financial metric. We recorded revenue of $2.31 billion and achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83, nearly $0.10 above the high end of our guidance range.
Free cash flow increased to $291 million, up 81% quarter-over-quarter. And we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns. We achieved these results through our focused efforts to drive operational efficiencies, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation, proactively managing the business in the face of multiple revenue headwinds.
In the edge compute market, revenue was impacted by the expected transition to SSDs, ongoing CPU shortages and seasonal demand slowdown for notebooks and desktop PCs. In the surveillance market, revenue remains suppressed by economic and geopolitical uncertainties. However, over the long term, we expect the market to grow as camera resolution improves to 8 megapixels and drive the average capacity per drive above current levels of 3 to 4 terabytes. In the enterprise market, both seasonal and macroeconomic challenges weighed on revenue for our nearline drives.
Revenue from a few hyperscale customers improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. However, that revenue did not fully offset the slower demand from OEM and other global cloud customers.
As a reminder, demand for our nearline drives began to slow in the December quarter as cloud service providers work through the inventory buildup during calendar 2018. However, we anticipate this pause to be short-lived. The demand improvement I just mentioned among select hyperscale customers is an indication that we are approaching the end of this inventory digestion phase, and we expect broader demand recovery starting in the second half of the calendar year.
We also believe some of the slowdown we are experiencing in our nearline product demand is attributed to cloud customers anticipating the transition to our next-generation, high-capacity drives.
We are very pleased to announce that we began shipping our 16-terabyte drives in late March, as planned. We are delivering the industry's highest-capacity disk drives to enable improved performance at the lowest total cost of ownership for our customers. Qualifications are underway at many major cloud and enterprise customers. We expect to begin ramping to high volume later in calendar 2019 and expect 16-terabyte drives will be our highest revenue SKU by this time next year.
For Seagate, fiscal 2019 is a year of focused execution and technology advancement, and we continue to successfully deliver on our plans. We expect to introduce drives with over 20 terabytes of capacity in calendar year 2020 based on our innovative HAMR recording technology. These technology breakthroughs are significant enablers, providing a path of 40 terabytes and higher capacities, that's more than double the capacities available today, while at the same time making the transition to this new technology seamless for our customers. Perhaps best stated by one of our large hyperscale customers working to qualify HAMR, it just works.
We also made strides on our multi-actuator technology. During the recent Open Compute Project summit, we set a new speed record for video streaming data rates from a hard drive. With our MACH.2 dual actuator, we demonstrated twice the bandwidth compared to a single-actuator drive, the fastest-ever sustained transfer rates from a hard drive. We believe HAMR high-dentistry drives combined with our multi-actuator technology will not only address the heavy workloads and high utilization rates required by large cloud data centers but also new use cases that are merging at the edge.
The Global DataSphere is expected to double once every 3 years to reach a staggering 175 zettabytes by 2025. This rapid growth in data creation is giving rise to new applications, including smart cities, smart factories, genomics, autonomous vehicles and other IoT applications, all of which employ AI and machine learning to derive value from big data.
To inform realtime decision-making, we believe more data processing and machine learning will need to occur closer to the source of data creation. Seagate has referred to this transition as the IT 4.0 era or the rise in edge computing. We are starting to see a buildup in private and edge cloud environments to enable fast, secure access to data 24/7.
With this transition to IT 4.0 and associated growth in data at the edge, exit by demand for nearline drives may exceed our prior growth estimates of between 35% and 40% over the long term. Importantly, Seagate's innovative technology portfolio positions us well to capture and monetize these opportunities.
I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our third quarter results and share our outlook for the fourth quarter."

In the March quarter, we delivered strong earnings and free cash flow, underscored by our solid operational execution and focus on profitability in the face of a challenging business environment. Consistent with our expectations, March qu",1041,"Thank you, Dave. In the March quarter, we delivered strong earnings and free cash flow, underscored by our solid operational execution and focus on profitability in the face of a challenging business environment. Consistent with our expectations, March quarter revenue was $2.31 billion, down 15% sequentially, with total shipment of 77 exabyte, down 12% quarter-over-quarter.
Our results are reflecting back of softer demand from cloud service provider in advance of our transition to 16-terabyte nearline drives as well as the ongoing global macro concern and typical seasonality, as Dave had discussed earlier.
Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives, represented 39% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. We shipped approximately 33 exabytes into the enterprise market, down 10% quarter-over-quarter. The vast majority of the exabyte shipments were into the nearline market.
Exabyte shipment for cloud customers were up quarter-over-quarter, which partially offset the decline in shipments to OEMs. The average capacity for nearline drive hit a new record of 7.2 terabytes, up 11% over the prior quarter.
Our 12-terabyte nearline drive remains the highest-selling enterprise product in the March quarter. As Dave indicated earlier, we have started to ship the industry's highest-capacity 16-terabyte drive in the current quarter and expect to ramp production as customers complete their qualification over the next few quarters. Given the total cost of ownership benefit for customers and expected high reliability of these drives, we believe we are well positioned to capture market opportunities in the coming quarters.
We also continue to leverage our existing product portfolio to harvest customer demand for mission-critical drives, which positively contributes to our margin and cash flow. Revenue for the edge noncompute market contributed 32% of the total March quarter revenue compared to 31% in the prior quarter and includes sales for surveillance, gaming, NAS, DVR and consumer application.
Sales for data-rich applications, including gaming, NAS and DVR, grew sequentially, which partially offset the macro headwind and seasonal trend impacting the surveillance and consumer market, respectively.
Exabyte shipments for edge noncompute platforms were 29 exabyte and down 10% quarter-over-quarter, while average capacity per drive remain approximately flat at 2.4 terabytes.
Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook hard disk drives, represented 20% of total revenue compared to 21% in the December quarter. Our results reflect typical seasonality combined with ongoing CPU shortages. Exabyte shipments for edge compute platforms were nearly 15 exabyte, down 21% quarter-over-quarter, with steeper-than-seasonal decline from notebooks and desktop PCs.
Our non-hard disk drive business, including SSD and cloud system solutions, made up the remaining 8% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. As we have shared over the past couple of quarters, we are focused on portfolio management to capture opportunities that deliver the highest value to our customers. We continue to make good progress. Also, it will take time to fully make this transition.
Cloud systems revenue has remained relatively stable over the past several quarters. SSD revenue declined sequentially, ahead of planned product transition, which are expected to occur over the next couple of quarters.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was above our expectation at 26.6% compared to 29.7% in the December quarter. About half of the sequential margin decline was associated with money-venturing underutilization cost as we effectively managed our production to more closely align with industry conditions.
Capacity utilization is directly correlated to portfolio mix. Higher-capacity drives, such as nearline and surveillance, utilized more head and disk and takes longer to test compared to lower-capacity HDDs. Accordingly, we expect capacity underutilization cost to decline and gross margin to improve when demand resumes on higher-capacity drives.
Non-GAAP operating expenses came in better than our expectation at $349 million, down 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The decline in spending reflect ongoing expense discipline and lower variable compensation expense. We continue to focus on managing expenses and utilizing capital for R&D investment to advance our future technology, products and solutions.
Through operational efficiency and expense discipline, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 in the March quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range. Our operational focus has also led to solid return on invested capital. On a rolling 4-quarter basis, ROIC expanded to nearly 27% in the March quarter compared to 25% in the prior year period.
We generated $438 million in cash from operations at 52% sequentially as we improved working capital, including a 9% decline in total inventory value quarter-over-quarter. Capital expenditures were $147 million during the March quarter, at the lower end of our long-term target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue. Our resulting free cash flow was $291 million, up 81% from the prior quarter.
We utilized $327 million to repurchase 7.2 million ordinary shares, and we exited the quarter with 277 million ordinary shares outstanding. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 13.4 million ordinary shares and reduced our share count by 4%. 
Cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter. And our Board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on July 3, 2019.
During the March quarter, we entered a new $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. The company debt balance as of March quarter was $4.5 billion, including $200 million drawn from the revolver. Our gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio is 1.9x as of the March quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the June quarter. We anticipate a relatively flat business environment in the June quarter with [ sooner ] demand conditions across all of our end markets. In this environment, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.32 billion, plus or minus 5%; non-GAAP gross margin to be at least 26.5%; and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83, plus or minus 5%.
During this period, Seagate will continue to drive operational efficiencies to optimize our profitability and free cash flow. While business conditions remain somewhat challenging in the June quarter, based on our interaction with customers, we expect demand to recover starting in the second half of the calendar year.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

We are driving operational efficiencies by managing our costs and capital investments to align with near-term industry conditions and optimize profitability and free cash flow. We are harvesting HDD opportunities in markets with low exabyte growth, such as mission-critical drives, which contribute nicely to our bottom line, particularly during these slower demand periods, while requiring no R&D investment. 
We are executing our technology road map and leveraging our 40-plus-year heritage of innovation and expertise in precision-engineered data solutions to introduce new products with the highest areal density, quality and reliability to address our customers' future mass storage requirements.
We believe the near-term industry headwinds we are experiencing will abate in the coming quarters, and the long-term growth trajectory of mass storage demand provides a rich set of opportunities for Seagate. Data-hungry applications are fueling demand for high-capacity storage in both public and private clouds.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we expect the exabyte TAM for nearline drives to be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40%. Importantly, Seagate's strong technology portfolio and customer relationships make us well positioned to capitalize on this growth.

But what I would say, what I talked about last quarter was if gross margins, as we went through these digested phases, if we got it out of the period of factory underutilization faster, then we might see expansion. I think what we're seeing right now is rather a bit of a build ahead for the fall, and we've got these product transitions going on, which I think is weighing us down just a little bit. Otherwise, we would have snapped back a little bit faster.
Sure, if the cloud comes back faster than we're anticipating right now, which we're starting to see signs over the back half, then I think we should be able to get back into the range. And I think I've said this before, our solve is not gross margin percentage either. We were, in the January time frame when we last spoke to everyone, we were really focused on free cash flow, just making sure we watched our cash very carefully, make sure we weren't pulling too much inventory and things like that. So that may have actually hindered our ability to move a little bit extra product in this last few months. Again, I'd say that's towards the conservative side on my part, but that's how I think about the gross margin. Go ahead, Gianluca."

Mitch, I would say, it's against the backdrop, like we talked about in the script, of all the SSD incursions, natural transitions, especially for the lower-capacity stuff. So in what we call the enterprise -- or sorry, the edge compute markets, you're seeing some low capacities, 500 gigabytes and 1 terabyte, and then you see in some high capacity some bifurcation, if you will, to 2 and 4 terabytes. Where the CPU constraints are a problem usually are at smaller players. So the long-tail, if you will, distribution channel, I think, would be a good way to think about it.
In the distribution channel, there are some people still making the lower-capacity disk drive products, but very few. I think they tend to be much more entrepreneurial. I talked about this a little bit last quarter. We still haven't seen the healthy channels just yet. So while weeks on hand are fairly healthy on a relative basis, I look at the absolute value on the channel, and it's not as strong nearly as it was just a couple of quarters ago. And that includes the higher-capacity stuff, which should be some of those new markets and creative new markets. So my perspective is this will start to come online as well through -- in the back of the year, but it really hasn't built up as much momentum as I expected in the January time frame."

So I think on the February call, we were just coming off of a fairly disturbed pull dynamics that were going on all the way through December. And the [ COGS ] was one aspect of it, not the only one, obviously. It was fairly global. It's also got a long tail. It's not just one CSP or 3 CSPs or something, but it's also the smaller build-out. The reason we have confidence in the back half of the year now is we're starting to see some of the data center build-out that was anticipated, say, 6 months or 9 months ago to be discussed again, the exact same data centers again, especially globally. And then we also think that there's been some inventory readjustments that have gone on for the last 6 months. There will be an anticipation of moving to higher high-capacity drives with better total cost of ownership propositions on the back half of the year. So we're feeling a lot more confident that we were there talking to you in February, for sure.
As far as the next cycle, this one's been a little bit more pronounced than the last one, that it feels that way. And it's been more global, and it's been touching -- as we reach out through OEMs and ODMs who were helping do the builds, it's been much more broad-based than the last one. The last one came back pretty quickly because of the world turning on at the same time. We're hearing rumors of all this, but I still wouldn't say strong. So it feels like this one may be a bigger peak in exabytes, but much wider. I'd say that might be just because there will be a little bit of trepidation."

So in the last couple of months, just given the lead times for largely the head -- the wafers that are required for that, that's where we focused a lot of our efforts internally. My sense is as well that given some of the pause that's gone on in hyperscale and other places around the world, that the value proposition of 16 terabytes versus maybe 12 that was thought of 6 months ago when the pause started, it's pretty substantial.

So we were, like I said earlier, we were, 90 days ago, we were really watching our cash and controlling our build very, very carefully to make sure we didn't carry too much inventory. If we had pushed out more of the lower-capacity drives in anticipation of higher capacity, I don't know if that always serves us right either. So that's what we were thinking about, if that helps."

I think relative to my earlier comments about some of the channels have been disrupted, there were lots of liquidity issues, especially amongst smaller players, more entrepreneurial people who were trying to do edge build-out, very application-specific items. And because of that, I think the market has been pretty choppy. We're starting to see our way through that. People are coming back to those plans again. As we all know, data will grow, and some of these new applications will take off. So -- but I think given some of the issues the world was having back in the December time frame, we just didn't have very good visibility into them.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call, which we are joining from Dublin, Ireland. During today's call, I will cover the key highlights from the March quarter, share some perspectives on the market and outline our progress on advancing our technology road map. Gianluca will then discuss details of our March quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the June quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate executed well in the March quarter, navigating challenging business conditions to deliver financial results that met or exceeded our expectations across every financial metric. We recorded revenue of $2.31 billion and achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83, nearly $0.10 above the high end of our guidance range.
Free cash flow increased to $291 million, up 81% quarter-over-quarter. And we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns. We achieved these results through our focused efforts to drive operational efficiencies, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation, proactively managing the business in the face of multiple revenue headwinds.
In the edge compute market, revenue was impacted by the expected transition to SSDs, ongoing CPU shortages and seasonal demand slowdown for notebooks and desktop PCs. In the surveillance market, revenue remains suppressed by economic and geopolitical uncertainties. However, over the long term, we expect the market to grow as camera resolution improves to 8 megapixels and drive the average capacity per drive above current levels of 3 to 4 terabytes. In the enterprise market, both seasonal and macroeconomic challenges weighed on revenue for our nearline drives.
Revenue from a few hyperscale customers improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. However, that revenue did not fully offset the slower demand from OEM and other global cloud customers.
As a reminder, demand for our nearline drives began to slow in the December quarter as cloud service providers work through the inventory buildup during calendar 2018. However, we anticipate this pause to be short-lived. The demand improvement I just mentioned among select hyperscale customers is an indication that we are approaching the end of this inventory digestion phase, and we expect broader demand recovery starting in the second half of the calendar year.
We also believe some of the slowdown we are experiencing in our nearline product demand is attributed to cloud customers anticipating the transition to our next-generation, high-capacity drives.
We are very pleased to announce that we began shipping our 16-terabyte drives in late March, as planned. We are delivering the industry's highest-capacity disk drives to enable improved performance at the lowest total cost of ownership for our customers. Qualifications are underway at many major cloud and enterprise customers. We expect to begin ramping to high volume later in calendar 2019 and expect 16-terabyte drives will be our highest revenue SKU by this time next year.
For Seagate, fiscal 2019 is a year of focused execution and technology advancement, and we continue to successfully deliver on our plans. We expect to introduce drives with over 20 terabytes of capacity in calendar year 2020 based on our innovative HAMR recording technology. These technology breakthroughs are significant enablers, providing a path of 40 terabytes and higher capacities, that's more than double the capacities available today, while at the same time making the transition to this new technology seamless for our customers. Perhaps best stated by one of our large hyperscale customers working to qualify HAMR, it just works.
We also made strides on our multi actuator technology. During the recent Open Compute Project Summit, we set a new speed record for video streaming data rates from a hard drive. With our MACH.2 dual actuator, we demonstrated twice the bandwidth compared to a single-actuator drive, the fastest-ever sustained transfer rates from a hard drive. We believe HAMR high-density drives combined with our multi actuator technology will not only address the heavy workloads and high utilization rates required by large cloud data centers but also new use cases that are emerging at the edge.
The Global Datasphere is expected to double once every 3 years to reach a staggering 175 zettabytes by 2025. This rapid growth in data creation is giving rise to new applications, including smart cities, smart factories, genomics, autonomous vehicles and other IoT applications, all of which employ AI and machine learning to derive value from big data.
To inform real-time decision-making, we believe more data processing and machine learning will need to occur closer to the source of data creation. Seagate has referred to this transition as the IT 4.0 era or the rise of edge computing. We are starting to see a buildout in private and edge cloud environments to enable fast, secure access to data 24/7.
With this transition to IT 4.0 and associated growth in data at the edge, exabyte demand for nearline drives may exceed our prior growth estimates of between 35% and 40% over the long term. Importantly, Seagate's innovative technology portfolio positions us well to capture and monetize these opportunities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our third quarter results and share our outlook for the fourth quarter."

In the March quarter, we delivered strong earnings and free cash flow, underscored by our solid operational execution and focus on profitability in the phase of a challenging business environment. Consistent with our expectations, March q",1038,"Thank you, Dave. In the March quarter, we delivered strong earnings and free cash flow, underscored by our solid operational execution and focus on profitability in the phase of a challenging business environment. Consistent with our expectations, March quarter revenue was $2.31 billion, down 15% sequentially, with total shipment of 77 exabyte, down 12% quarter-over-quarter.
Our results are reflecting path of softer demand from cloud service provider in advance of our transition to 16-terabyte nearline drives as well as the ongoing global macro concern and typical seasonality, as Dave had discussed earlier.
Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives, represented 39% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. We shipped approximately 33 exabytes into the enterprise market, down 10% quarter-over-quarter. The vast majority of the exabyte shipments were into the nearline market.
Exabyte shipment for cloud customers were up quarter-over-quarter, which partially offset the decline in shipments to OEMs. The average capacity for nearline drive hit a new record of 7.2 terabytes, up 11% over the prior quarter.
Our 12-terabyte nearline drive remains the highest-selling enterprise product in the March quarter. As Dave indicated earlier, we have started to ship the industry's highest-capacity 16-terabyte drive in the current quarter and expect to ramp production as customers complete their qualification over the next few quarters. Given the total cost of ownership benefit for customers and expected high reliability of these drives, we believe we are well positioned to capture market opportunities in the coming quarters.
We also continue to leverage our existing product portfolio to harvest customer demand for mission-critical drives, which positively contributes to our margin and cash flow. 
Revenue for the edge noncompute market contributed 32% of the total March quarter revenue compared to 31% in the prior quarter and includes sales for surveillance, gaming, NAS, DVR and consumer application.
Sales for data-rich applications, including gaming, NAS and DVR, grew sequentially, which partially offset the macro headwind and seasonal trend impacting the surveillance and consumer market, respectively.
Exabyte shipments for edge noncompute platforms were 29 exabyte and down 10% quarter-over-quarter, while average capacity per drive remain approximately flat at 2.4 terabytes.
Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook hard disk drives, represented 20% of total revenue compared to 21% in the December quarter. Our results reflect typical seasonality combined with ongoing CPU shortages. Exabyte shipments for edge compute platforms were nearly 15 exabyte, down 21% quarter-over-quarter, with steeper-than-seasonal decline from notebooks and desktop PCs.
Our non-hard disk drive business, including SSD and cloud system solutions, made up the remaining 8% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. As we have shared over the past couple of quarters, we are focused on portfolio management to capture opportunities that deliver the highest value to our customers. We continue to make good progress. Also, it will take time to fully make this transition.
Cloud systems revenue has remained relatively stable over the past several quarters. SSD revenue declined sequentially, ahead of planned product transition, which are expected to occur over the next couple of quarters.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was above our expectation at 26.6% compared to 29.7% in the December quarter. About half of the sequential margin decline was associated with manufacturing underutilization cost as we effectively managed our production to more closely align with industry conditions.
Capacity utilization is directly correlated to portfolio mix. Higher-capacity drives, such as nearline and surveillance, utilized more head and disk and takes longer to test compared to lower-capacity HDDs. Accordingly, we expect capacity underutilization cost to decline and gross margin to improve when demand resumes on higher-capacity drives.
Non-GAAP operating expenses came in better than our expectation at $349 million, down 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The decline in spending reflect ongoing expense discipline and lower variable compensation expense. We continue to focus on managing expenses and utilizing capital for R&D investment to advance our future technology, products and solutions.
Through operational efficiency and expense discipline, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 in the March quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range. Our operational focus has also led to solid return on invested capital. On a rolling 4-quarter basis, ROIC expanded to nearly 27% in the March quarter compared to 25% in the prior year period.
We generated $438 million in cash from operations, up 52% sequentially as we improved working capital, including a 9% decline in total inventory value quarter-over-quarter. Capital expenditures were $147 million during the March quarter, at the lower end of our long-term target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue. Our resulting free cash flow was $291 million, up 81% from the prior quarter.
We utilized $327 million to repurchase 7.2 million ordinary shares, and we exited the quarter with 277 million ordinary shares outstanding. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 13.4 million ordinary shares and reduced our share count by 4%. 
Cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter. And our Board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on July 3, 2019.
During the March quarter, we entered a new $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. The company debt balance as of March quarter was $4.5 billion, including $200 million drawn from the revolver. Our gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio is 1.9x as of the March quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the June quarter. We anticipate a relatively flat business environment in the June quarter consumer demand conditions across all of our end markets. In this environment, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.32 billion, plus or minus 5%; non-GAAP gross margin to be at least 26.5%; and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83, plus or minus 5%.
During this period, Seagate will continue to drive operational efficiencies to optimize our profitability and free cash flow. While business conditions remain somewhat challenging in the June quarter, based on our interaction with customers, we expect demand to recover starting in the second half of the calendar year.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

We are driving operational efficiencies by managing our costs and capital investments to align with near-term industry conditions and optimize profitability and free cash flow. We are harvesting HDD opportunities in markets with low exabyte growth, such as mission-critical drives, which contribute nicely to our bottom line, particularly during these slower demand periods, while requiring no R&D investment. 
We are executing our technology road map and leveraging our 40-plus-year heritage of innovation and expertise in precision-engineered data solutions to introduce new products with the highest areal density, quality and reliability to address our customers' future mass storage requirements.
We believe the near-term industry headwinds we are experiencing will abate in the coming quarters, and the long-term growth trajectory of mass storage demand provides a rich set of opportunities for Seagate. Data-hungry applications are fueling demand for high-capacity storage in both public and private clouds.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we expect the exabyte TAM for nearline drives to be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40%. Importantly, Seagate's strong technology portfolio and customer relationships make us well positioned to capitalize on this growth.

But what I would say, what I talked about last quarter was if gross margins, as we went through these digested phases, if we got out of the period of factory underutilization faster, then we might see expansion. I think what we're seeing right now is rather a bit of a build ahead for the fall, and we've got these product transitions going on, which I think is weighing us down just a little bit. Otherwise, we would have stepped back a little bit faster.
Sure, if the cloud comes back faster than we're anticipating right now, which we're starting to see signs over the back half, then I think we should be able to get back into the range. And I think I've said this before, our solve is not gross margin percentage either. We were, in the January time frame when we last spoke to everyone, we were really focused on free cash flow, just making sure we watched our cash very carefully, make sure we weren't pulling too much inventory and things like that. So that may have actually hindered our ability to move a little bit extra product in this last few months. Again, I'd say that's towards the conservative side on my part, but that's how I think about the gross margin. Go ahead, Gianluca."

Mitch, I would say, it's against the backdrop, like we talked about in the script, of all the SSD incursions, natural transitions, especially for the lower-capacity stuff. So in what we call the enterprise -- or sorry, the edge compute markets, you're seeing some low capacities, 500 gigabytes and 1 terabyte, and then you see in some high capacity, some bifurcation, if you will, to 2 and 4 terabytes. Where the CPU constraints are a problem usually are at smaller players. So the long-tail, if you will, distribution channel, I think, would be a good way to think about it.
In the distribution channel, there are some people still making the lower-capacity disk drive products, but very few. I think they tend to be much more entrepreneurial. I talked about this a little bit last quarter. We still haven't seen the healthy channels just yet. So while weeks on hand are fairly healthy on a relative basis, I look at the absolute value on the channel, and it's not as strong nearly as it was just a couple of quarters ago. And that includes the higher-capacity stuff, which should be some of those new markets and creative new markets. So my perspective is this will start to come online as well through -- in the back of the year, but it really hasn't built up as much momentum as I expected in the January time frame."

So I think on the February call, we were just coming off of a fairly disturbed pull dynamics that were going on all the way through December. And the cloud was one aspect of it, not the only one, obviously. It was fairly global. It's also got a long tail. It's not just one CSP or 3 CSPs or something, but it's also the smaller build-out. The reason we have confidence in the back half of the year now is we're starting to see some of the data center build-out that was anticipated, say, 6 months or 9 months ago to be discussed again, the exact same data centers again, especially globally. And then we also think that there's been some inventory readjustments that have gone on for the last 6 months. There will be an anticipation of moving to higher high-capacity drives with better total cost of ownership propositions on the back half of the year. So we're feeling a lot more confident that we were there talking to you in February, for sure.
As far as the next cycle, this one's been a little bit more pronounced than the last one, that it feels that way. And it's been more global, and it's been touching -- as we reach out through OEMs and ODMs who were helping do the builds, it's been much more broad-based than the last one. The last one came back pretty quickly because of the world turning on at the same time. We're hearing rumors of all this, but I still wouldn't say strong. So it feels like this one may be a bigger peak in exabytes, but much wider. I'd say that might be just because there will be a little bit of trepidation."

There's -- we've been through a lot of transitions, to your point, different drives going from 6 to 8 to 10 to 12 to 14, we've had different drive platforms. This particular platform for us will take us 16 and 18 with SMR and other variants. It will take us beyond 18 terabytes and probably into the HAMR families as well, because HAMR has basically dropped in into this when we're ready. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to yield and ramp this product. It's gone through all its internal qualification testing really well, and so that's why we're fairly aggressive about it. I think it's going to be a pretty steep ramp as well.
So in the last couple of months, just given the lead times for largely the head -- the wafers that are required for that, that's where we focused a lot of our efforts internally. My sense is as well that given some of the pause that's gone on in hyperscale and other places around the world, that the value proposition of 16 terabytes versus maybe 12 that was thought of 6 months ago when the pause started, it's pretty substantial. And I think we'll start to see those revenue ramps in early fiscal year 2020."

Relative to stocking, I do think there are a few customers that have such huge scale that they start talking like that because other customers are much more opportunistic. And it's been a buyer's market recently. So we were, like I said earlier, we were, 90 days ago, we were really watching our cash and controlling our build very, very carefully to make sure we didn't carry too much inventory.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call, which we are joining from Dublin, Ireland. During today's call, I will cover the key highlights from the March quarter, share some perspectives on the market and outline our progress on advancing our technology road map. Gianluca will then discuss details of our March quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the June quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate executed well in the March quarter, navigating challenging business conditions to deliver financial results that met or exceeded our expectations across every financial metric. We recorded revenue of $2.31 billion and achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83, nearly $0.10 above the high end of our guidance range.
Free cash flow increased to $291 million, up 81% quarter-over-quarter. And we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns. We achieved these results through our focused efforts to drive operational efficiencies, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation, proactively managing the business in the face of multiple revenue headwinds.
In the edge compute market, revenue was impacted by the expected transition to SSDs, ongoing CPU shortages and seasonal demand slowdown for notebooks and desktop PCs. In the surveillance market, revenue remains suppressed by economic and geopolitical uncertainties. However, over the long term, we expect the market to grow as camera resolution improves to 8 megapixels and drive the average capacity per drive above current levels of 3 to 4 terabytes. In the enterprise market, both seasonal and macroeconomic challenges weighed on revenue for our nearline drives.
Revenue from a few hyperscale customers improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. However, that revenue did not fully offset the slower demand from OEM and other global cloud customers.
As a reminder, demand for our nearline drives began to slow in the December quarter as cloud service providers work through the inventory buildup during calendar 2018. However, we anticipate this pause to be short-lived. The demand improvement I just mentioned among select hyperscale customers is an indication that we are approaching the end of this inventory digestion phase, and we expect broader demand recovery starting in the second half of the calendar year.
We also believe some of the slowdown we are experiencing in our nearline product demand is attributed to cloud customers anticipating the transition to our next-generation, high-capacity drives.
We are very pleased to announce that we began shipping our 16-terabyte drives in late March, as planned. We are delivering the industry's highest-capacity disk drives to enable improved performance at the lowest total cost of ownership for our customers. Qualifications are underway at many major cloud and enterprise customers. We expect to begin ramping to high volume later in calendar 2019 and expect 16-terabyte drives will be our highest revenue SKU by this time next year.
For Seagate, fiscal 2019 is a year of focused execution and technology advancement, and we continue to successfully deliver on our plans. We expect to introduce drives with over 20 terabytes of capacity in calendar year 2020 based on our innovative HAMR recording technology. These technology breakthroughs are significant enablers, providing a path of 40 terabytes and higher capacities, that's more than double the capacities available today, while at the same time making the transition to this new technology seamless for our customers. Perhaps best stated by one of our large hyperscale customers working to qualify HAMR, it just works.
We also made strides on our multi actuator technology. During the recent Open Compute Project Summit, we set a new speed record for video streaming data rates from a hard drive. With our MACH.2 dual actuator, we demonstrated twice the bandwidth compared to a single-actuator drive, the fastest-ever sustained transfer rates from a hard drive. We believe HAMR high-density drives combined with our multi actuator technology will not only address the heavy workloads and high utilization rates required by large cloud data centers but also new use cases that are emerging at the edge.
The Global Datasphere is expected to double once every 3 years to reach a staggering 175 zettabytes by 2025. This rapid growth in data creation is giving rise to new applications, including smart cities, smart factories, genomics, autonomous vehicles and other IoT applications, all of which employ AI and machine learning to derive value from big data.
To inform real-time decision-making, we believe more data processing and machine learning will need to occur closer to the source of data creation. Seagate has referred to this transition as the IT 4.0 era or the rise of edge computing. We are starting to see a buildout in private and edge cloud environments to enable fast, secure access to data 24/7.
With this transition to IT 4.0 and associated growth in data at the edge, exabyte demand for nearline drives may exceed our prior growth estimates of between 35% and 40% over the long term. Importantly, Seagate's innovative technology portfolio positions us well to capture and monetize these opportunities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our third quarter results and share our outlook for the fourth quarter."

In the March quarter, we delivered strong earnings and free cash flow, underscored by our solid operational execution and focus on profitability in the phase of a challenging business environment. Consistent with our expectations, March q",1038,"Thank you, Dave. In the March quarter, we delivered strong earnings and free cash flow, underscored by our solid operational execution and focus on profitability in the phase of a challenging business environment. Consistent with our expectations, March quarter revenue was $2.31 billion, down 15% sequentially, with total shipment of 77 exabyte, down 12% quarter-over-quarter.
Our results are reflecting path of softer demand from cloud service provider in advance of our transition to 16-terabyte nearline drives as well as the ongoing global macro concern and typical seasonality, as Dave had discussed earlier.
Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives, represented 39% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. We shipped approximately 33 exabytes into the enterprise market, down 10% quarter-over-quarter. The vast majority of the exabyte shipments were into the nearline market.
Exabyte shipment for cloud customers were up quarter-over-quarter, which partially offset the decline in shipments to OEMs. The average capacity for nearline drive hit a new record of 7.2 terabytes, up 11% over the prior quarter.
Our 12-terabyte nearline drive remains the highest-selling enterprise product in the March quarter. As Dave indicated earlier, we have started to ship the industry's highest-capacity 16-terabyte drive in the current quarter and expect to ramp production as customers complete their qualification over the next few quarters. Given the total cost of ownership benefit for customers and expected high reliability of these drives, we believe we are well positioned to capture market opportunities in the coming quarters.
We also continue to leverage our existing product portfolio to harvest customer demand for mission-critical drives, which positively contributes to our margin and cash flow. 
Revenue for the edge noncompute market contributed 32% of the total March quarter revenue compared to 31% in the prior quarter and includes sales for surveillance, gaming, NAS, DVR and consumer application.
Sales for data-rich applications, including gaming, NAS and DVR, grew sequentially, which partially offset the macro headwind and seasonal trend impacting the surveillance and consumer market, respectively.
Exabyte shipments for edge noncompute platforms were 29 exabyte and down 10% quarter-over-quarter, while average capacity per drive remain approximately flat at 2.4 terabytes.
Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook hard disk drives, represented 20% of total revenue compared to 21% in the December quarter. Our results reflect typical seasonality combined with ongoing CPU shortages. Exabyte shipments for edge compute platforms were nearly 15 exabyte, down 21% quarter-over-quarter, with steeper-than-seasonal decline from notebooks and desktop PCs.
Our non-hard disk drive business, including SSD and cloud system solutions, made up the remaining 8% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. As we have shared over the past couple of quarters, we are focused on portfolio management to capture opportunities that deliver the highest value to our customers. We continue to make good progress. Also, it will take time to fully make this transition.
Cloud systems revenue has remained relatively stable over the past several quarters. SSD revenue declined sequentially, ahead of planned product transition, which are expected to occur over the next couple of quarters.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was above our expectation at 26.6% compared to 29.7% in the December quarter. About half of the sequential margin decline was associated with manufacturing underutilization cost as we effectively managed our production to more closely align with industry conditions.
Capacity utilization is directly correlated to portfolio mix. Higher-capacity drives, such as nearline and surveillance, utilized more head and disk and takes longer to test compared to lower-capacity HDDs. Accordingly, we expect capacity underutilization cost to decline and gross margin to improve when demand resumes on higher-capacity drives.
Non-GAAP operating expenses came in better than our expectation at $349 million, down 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The decline in spending reflect ongoing expense discipline and lower variable compensation expense. We continue to focus on managing expenses and utilizing capital for R&D investment to advance our future technology, products and solutions.
Through operational efficiency and expense discipline, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 in the March quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range. Our operational focus has also led to solid return on invested capital. On a rolling 4-quarter basis, ROIC expanded to nearly 27% in the March quarter compared to 25% in the prior year period.
We generated $438 million in cash from operations, up 52% sequentially as we improved working capital, including a 9% decline in total inventory value quarter-over-quarter. Capital expenditures were $147 million during the March quarter, at the lower end of our long-term target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue. Our resulting free cash flow was $291 million, up 81% from the prior quarter.
We utilized $327 million to repurchase 7.2 million ordinary shares, and we exited the quarter with 277 million ordinary shares outstanding. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 13.4 million ordinary shares and reduced our share count by 4%. 
Cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter. And our Board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on July 3, 2019.
During the March quarter, we entered a new $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. The company debt balance as of March quarter was $4.5 billion, including $200 million drawn from the revolver. Our gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio is 1.9x as of the March quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the June quarter. We anticipate a relatively flat business environment in the June quarter consumer demand conditions across all of our end markets. In this environment, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.32 billion, plus or minus 5%; non-GAAP gross margin to be at least 26.5%; and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83, plus or minus 5%.
During this period, Seagate will continue to drive operational efficiencies to optimize our profitability and free cash flow. While business conditions remain somewhat challenging in the June quarter, based on our interaction with customers, we expect demand to recover starting in the second half of the calendar year.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

Sure, if the cloud comes back faster than we're anticipating right now, which we're starting to see signs over the back half, then I think we should be able to get back into the range.

Mitch, I would say, it's against the backdrop, like we talked about in the script, of all the SSD incursions, natural transitions, especially for the lower-capacity stuff. So in what we call the enterprise -- or sorry, the edge compute markets, you're seeing some low capacities, 500 gigabytes and 1 terabyte, and then you see in some high capacity, some bifurcation, if you will, to 2 and 4 terabytes. Where the CPU constraints are a problem usually are at smaller players. So the long-tail, if you will, distribution channel, I think, would be a good way to think about it.
In the distribution channel, there are some people still making the lower-capacity disk drive products, but very few. I think they tend to be much more entrepreneurial. I talked about this a little bit last quarter. We still haven't seen the healthy channels just yet. So while weeks on hand are fairly healthy on a relative basis, I look at the absolute value on the channel, and it's not as strong nearly as it was just a couple of quarters ago. And that includes the higher-capacity stuff, which should be some of those new markets and creative new markets. So my perspective is this will start to come online as well through -- in the back of the year, but it really hasn't built up as much momentum as I expected in the January time frame."

So I think on the February call, we were just coming off of a fairly disturbed pull dynamics that were going on all the way through December. And the cloud was one aspect of it, not the only one, obviously. It was fairly global. It's also got a long tail. It's not just one CSP or 3 CSPs or something, but it's also the smaller build-out. The reason we have confidence in the back half of the year now is we're starting to see some of the data center build-out that was anticipated, say, 6 months or 9 months ago to be discussed again, the exact same data centers again, especially globally. And then we also think that there's been some inventory readjustments that have gone on for the last 6 months. There will be an anticipation of moving to higher high-capacity drives with better total cost of ownership propositions on the back half of the year. So we're feeling a lot more confident that we were there talking to you in February, for sure.
As far as the next cycle, this one's been a little bit more pronounced than the last one, that it feels that way. And it's been more global, and it's been touching -- as we reach out through OEMs and ODMs who were helping do the builds, it's been much more broad-based than the last one. The last one came back pretty quickly because of the world turning on at the same time. We're hearing rumors of all this, but I still wouldn't say strong. So it feels like this one may be a bigger peak in exabytes, but much wider. I'd say that might be just because there will be a little bit of trepidation."

It will take us beyond 18 terabytes and probably into the HAMR families as well, because HAMR has basically dropped in into this when we're ready. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to yield and ramp this product. It's gone through all its internal qualification testing really well, and so that's why we're fairly aggressive about it. I think it's going to be a pretty steep ramp as well.
So in the last couple of months, just given the lead times for largely the head -- the wafers that are required for that, that's where we focused a lot of our efforts internally. My sense is as well that given some of the pause that's gone on in hyperscale and other places around the world, that the value proposition of 16 terabytes versus maybe 12 that was thought of 6 months ago when the pause started, it's pretty substantial.

So we were, like I said earlier, we were, 90 days ago, we were really watching our cash and controlling our build very, very carefully to make sure we didn't carry too much inventory.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call, which we are joining from Dublin, Ireland.

Gianluca will then discuss details of our March quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the June quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate executed well in the March quarter, navigating challenging business conditions to deliver financial results that met or exceeded our expectations across every financial metric. We recorded revenue of $2.31 billion and achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83, nearly $0.10 above the high end of our guidance range.
Free cash flow increased to $291 million, up 81% quarter-over-quarter. And we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns. We achieved these results through our focused efforts to drive operational efficiencies, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation, proactively managing the business in the face of multiple revenue headwinds.
In the edge compute market, revenue was impacted by the expected transition to SSDs, ongoing CPU shortages and seasonal demand slowdown for notebooks and desktop PCs. In the surveillance market, revenue remains suppressed by economic and geopolitical uncertainties. However, over the long term, we expect the market to grow as camera resolution improves to 8 megapixels and drive the average capacity per drive above current levels of 3 to 4 terabytes. In the enterprise market, both seasonal and macroeconomic challenges weighed on revenue for our nearline drives.
Revenue from a few hyperscale customers improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. However, that revenue did not fully offset the slower demand from OEM and other global cloud customers.
As a reminder, demand for our nearline drives began to slow in the December quarter as cloud service providers work through the inventory buildup during calendar 2018. However, we anticipate this pause to be short-lived. The demand improvement I just mentioned among select hyperscale customers is an indication that we are approaching the end of this inventory digestion phase, and we expect broader demand recovery starting in the second half of the calendar year.
We also believe some of the slowdown we are experiencing in our nearline product demand is attributed to cloud customers anticipating the transition to our next-generation, high-capacity drives.
We are very pleased to announce that we began shipping our 16-terabyte drives in late March, as planned. We are delivering the industry's highest-capacity disk drives to enable improved performance at the lowest total cost of ownership for our customers. Qualifications are underway at many major cloud and enterprise customers. We expect to begin ramping to high volume later in calendar 2019 and expect 16-terabyte drives will be our highest revenue SKU by this time next year.
For Seagate, fiscal 2019 is a year of focused execution and technology advancement, and we continue to successfully deliver on our plans. We expect to introduce drives with over 20 terabytes of capacity in calendar year 2020 based on our innovative HAMR recording technology. These technology breakthroughs are significant enablers, providing a path of 40 terabytes and higher capacities, that's more than double the capacities available today, while at the same time making the transition to this new technology seamless for our customers. Perhaps best stated by one of our large hyperscale customers working to qualify HAMR, it just works.
We also made strides on our multi actuator technology. During the recent Open Compute Project Summit, we set a new speed record for video streaming data rates from a hard drive. With our MACH.2 dual actuator, we demonstrated twice the bandwidth compared to a single-actuator drive, the fastest-ever sustained transfer rates from a hard drive. We believe HAMR high-density drives combined with our multi actuator technology will not only address the heavy workloads and high utilization rates required by large cloud data centers but also new use cases that are emerging at the edge.
The Global Datasphere is expected to double once every 3 years to reach a staggering 175 zettabytes by 2025. This rapid growth in data creation is giving rise to new applications, including smart cities, smart factories, genomics, autonomous vehicles and other IoT applications, all of which employ AI and machine learning to derive value from big data.
To inform real-time decision-making, we believe more data processing and machine learning will need to occur closer to the source of data creation. Seagate has referred to this transition as the IT 4.0 era or the rise of edge computing. We are starting to see a buildout in private and edge cloud environments to enable fast, secure access to data 24/7.
With this transition to IT 4.0 and associated growth in data at the edge, exabyte demand for nearline drives may exceed our prior growth estimates of between 35% and 40% over the long term. Importantly, Seagate's innovative technology portfolio positions us well to capture and monetize these opportunities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our third quarter results and share our outlook for the fourth quarter."

In the March quarter, we delivered strong earnings and free cash flow, underscored by our solid operational execution and focus on profitability in the phase of a challenging business environment. Consistent with our expectations, March q",1038,"Thank you, Dave. In the March quarter, we delivered strong earnings and free cash flow, underscored by our solid operational execution and focus on profitability in the phase of a challenging business environment. Consistent with our expectations, March quarter revenue was $2.31 billion, down 15% sequentially, with total shipment of 77 exabyte, down 12% quarter-over-quarter.
Our results are reflecting path of softer demand from cloud service provider in advance of our transition to 16-terabyte nearline drives as well as the ongoing global macro concern and typical seasonality, as Dave had discussed earlier.
Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives, represented 39% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. We shipped approximately 33 exabytes into the enterprise market, down 10% quarter-over-quarter. The vast majority of the exabyte shipments were into the nearline market.
Exabyte shipment for cloud customers were up quarter-over-quarter, which partially offset the decline in shipments to OEMs. The average capacity for nearline drive hit a new record of 7.2 terabytes, up 11% over the prior quarter.
Our 12-terabyte nearline drive remains the highest-selling enterprise product in the March quarter. As Dave indicated earlier, we have started to ship the industry's highest-capacity 16-terabyte drive in the current quarter and expect to ramp production as customers complete their qualification over the next few quarters. Given the total cost of ownership benefit for customers and expected high reliability of these drives, we believe we are well positioned to capture market opportunities in the coming quarters.
We also continue to leverage our existing product portfolio to harvest customer demand for mission-critical drives, which positively contributes to our margin and cash flow. 
Revenue for the edge noncompute market contributed 32% of the total March quarter revenue compared to 31% in the prior quarter and includes sales for surveillance, gaming, NAS, DVR and consumer application.
Sales for data-rich applications, including gaming, NAS and DVR, grew sequentially, which partially offset the macro headwind and seasonal trend impacting the surveillance and consumer market, respectively.
Exabyte shipments for edge noncompute platforms were 29 exabyte and down 10% quarter-over-quarter, while average capacity per drive remain approximately flat at 2.4 terabytes.
Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook hard disk drives, represented 20% of total revenue compared to 21% in the December quarter. Our results reflect typical seasonality combined with ongoing CPU shortages. Exabyte shipments for edge compute platforms were nearly 15 exabyte, down 21% quarter-over-quarter, with steeper-than-seasonal decline from notebooks and desktop PCs.
Our non-hard disk drive business, including SSD and cloud system solutions, made up the remaining 8% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. As we have shared over the past couple of quarters, we are focused on portfolio management to capture opportunities that deliver the highest value to our customers. We continue to make good progress. Also, it will take time to fully make this transition.
Cloud systems revenue has remained relatively stable over the past several quarters. SSD revenue declined sequentially, ahead of planned product transition, which are expected to occur over the next couple of quarters.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was above our expectation at 26.6% compared to 29.7% in the December quarter. About half of the sequential margin decline was associated with manufacturing underutilization cost as we effectively managed our production to more closely align with industry conditions.
Capacity utilization is directly correlated to portfolio mix. Higher-capacity drives, such as nearline and surveillance, utilized more head and disk and takes longer to test compared to lower-capacity HDDs. Accordingly, we expect capacity underutilization cost to decline and gross margin to improve when demand resumes on higher-capacity drives.
Non-GAAP operating expenses came in better than our expectation at $349 million, down 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The decline in spending reflect ongoing expense discipline and lower variable compensation expense. We continue to focus on managing expenses and utilizing capital for R&D investment to advance our future technology, products and solutions.
Through operational efficiency and expense discipline, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 in the March quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range. Our operational focus has also led to solid return on invested capital. On a rolling 4-quarter basis, ROIC expanded to nearly 27% in the March quarter compared to 25% in the prior year period.
We generated $438 million in cash from operations, up 52% sequentially as we improved working capital, including a 9% decline in total inventory value quarter-over-quarter. Capital expenditures were $147 million during the March quarter, at the lower end of our long-term target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue. Our resulting free cash flow was $291 million, up 81% from the prior quarter.
We utilized $327 million to repurchase 7.2 million ordinary shares, and we exited the quarter with 277 million ordinary shares outstanding. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 13.4 million ordinary shares and reduced our share count by 4%. 
Cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter. And our Board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on July 3, 2019.
During the March quarter, we entered a new $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. The company debt balance as of March quarter was $4.5 billion, including $200 million drawn from the revolver. Our gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio is 1.9x as of the March quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the June quarter. We anticipate a relatively flat business environment in the June quarter consumer demand conditions across all of our end markets. In this environment, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.32 billion, plus or minus 5%; non-GAAP gross margin to be at least 26.5%; and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83, plus or minus 5%.
During this period, Seagate will continue to drive operational efficiencies to optimize our profitability and free cash flow. While business conditions remain somewhat challenging in the June quarter, based on our interaction with customers, we expect demand to recover starting in the second half of the calendar year.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

We",235,"Thanks, Gianluca. In summary, Seagate has executed well on multiple levels. We are driving operational efficiencies by managing our costs and capital investments to align with near-term industry conditions and optimize profitability and free cash flow. We are harvesting HDD opportunities in markets with low exabyte growth, such as mission-critical drives, which contribute nicely to our bottom line, particularly during these slower demand periods, while requiring no R&D investment. 
We are executing our technology road map and leveraging our 40-plus-year heritage of innovation and expertise in precision-engineered data solutions to introduce new products with the highest areal density, quality and reliability to address our customers' future mass storage requirements.
We believe the near-term industry headwinds we are experiencing will abate in the coming quarters, and the long-term growth trajectory of mass storage demand provides a rich set of opportunities for Seagate. Data-hungry applications are fueling demand for high-capacity storage in both public and private clouds.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we expect the exabyte TAM for nearline drives to be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40%. Importantly, Seagate's strong technology portfolio and customer relationships make us well positioned to capitalize on this growth.
Before opening the call for questions, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their ongoing support and contributions to the success of our business. Gianluca and I will now open up for your questions."

Otherwise, we would have stepped back a little bit faster.
Sure, if the cloud comes back faster than we're anticipating right now, which we're starting to see signs over the back half, then I think we should be able to get back into the range. And I think I've said this before, our solve is not gross margin percentage either. We were, in the January time frame when we last spoke to everyone, we were really focused on free cash flow, just making sure we watched our cash very carefully, make sure we weren't pulling too much inventory and things like that. So that may have actually hindered our ability to move a little bit extra product in this last few months. Again, I'd say that's towards the conservative side on my part, but that's how I think about the gross margin. Go ahead, Gianluca."

Mitch, I would say, it's against the backdrop, like we talked about in the script, of all the SSD incursions, natural transitions, especially for the lower-capacity stuff.

Where the CPU constraints are a problem usually are at smaller players. So the long-tail, if you will, distribution channel, I think, would be a good way to think about it.
In the distribution channel, there are some people still making the lower-capacity disk drive products, but very few. I think they tend to be much more entrepreneurial. I talked about this a little bit last quarter. We still haven't seen the healthy channels just yet. So while weeks on hand are fairly healthy on a relative basis, I look at the absolute value on the channel, and it's not as strong nearly as it was just a couple of quarters ago. And that includes the higher-capacity stuff, which should be some of those new markets and creative new markets. So my perspective is this will start to come online as well through -- in the back of the year, but it really hasn't built up as much momentum as I expected in the January time frame."

So I think on the February call, we were just coming off of a fairly disturbed pull dynamics that were going on all the way through December. And the cloud was one aspect of it, not the only one, obviously. It was fairly global. It's also got a long tail. It's not just one CSP or 3 CSPs or something, but it's also the smaller build-out. The reason we have confidence in the back half of the year now is we're starting to see some of the data center build-out that was anticipated, say, 6 months or 9 months ago to be discussed again, the exact same data centers again, especially globally. And then we also think that there's been some inventory readjustments that have gone on for the last 6 months. There will be an anticipation of moving to higher high-capacity drives with better total cost of ownership propositions on the back half of the year. So we're feeling a lot more confident that we were there talking to you in February, for sure.
As far as the next cycle, this one's been a little bit more pronounced than the last one, that it feels that way. And it's been more global, and it's been touching -- as we reach out through OEMs and ODMs who were helping do the builds, it's been much more broad-based than the last one. The last one came back pretty quickly because of the world turning on at the same time. We're hearing rumors of all this, but I still wouldn't say strong. So it feels like this one may be a bigger peak in exabytes, but much wider. I'd say that might be just because there will be a little bit of trepidation."

It will take us beyond 18 terabytes and probably into the HAMR families as well, because HAMR has basically dropped in into this when we're ready. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to yield and ramp this product. It's gone through all its internal qualification testing really well, and so that's why we're fairly aggressive about it. I think it's going to be a pretty steep ramp as well.
So in the last couple of months, just given the lead times for largely the head -- the wafers that are required for that, that's where we focused a lot of our efforts internally. My sense is as well that given some of the pause that's gone on in hyperscale and other places around the world, that the value proposition of 16 terabytes versus maybe 12 that was thought of 6 months ago when the pause started, it's pretty substantial.

So we were, like I said earlier, we were, 90 days ago, we were really watching our cash and controlling our build very, very carefully to make sure we didn't carry too much inventory.

Afterwards, Gianluca will discuss details on our June quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the September quarter. Following the prepared markets, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate continues to deliver on its financial commitments, achieving June quarter results that results that were solidly in line with our expectations. We recorded revenue of $2.37 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, both towards the upper end of our guidance range against the backdrop of increasing geopolitical uncertainty and the regulatory hurdles.
These broader macro conditions disrupted our customers' buying partners causing trepidation amongst some of our enterprise and OEM partners, while prompting others to accelerate demand, including a few surveillance customers.
Our ability to adapt to market volatility and intelligently manage our business enabled us to increase revenue and expedite shipments quarter-by-quarter, supported by improved demand for nearline drives from cloud and hyperscale customers. Additionally, our fiscal year performance demonstrates solid execution on our priorities to optimize profitability and free cash flow.
We've been successfully pivoting the business towards growing markets, which include enterprise nearline drives, add stores for surveillance and NAND and our cloud system solutions. In fiscal 2019, we delivered annual revenue of $10.4 billion, of which approximately half was derived from these markets. These applications require reliable, cost-effective NAND storage, making them well suited to our portfolio products. Importantly, we contributed an even higher percentage of our gross profit, providing a solid platform for margins to expand as they become a greater part of our overall revenue. At the same time, we are continuing to supply HDDs into mature markets, which include mission-critical, edge compute, DVR, gaming and consumer applications to support our customers' needs. These products require minimal for that investment, while contributing nicely to our overall operating income.
We are continuing to tightly manage expenses while prioritizing investments towards areas that deliver the greatest value to our customers and stronger terms for Seagate. In fiscal year 2019, we reduced our full year non-GAAP operating expenses by 9%, while increasing our investments in next-generation technologies improve areal density and lower cost per terabyte. We are leveraging our significant free cash flow generation to enhance shareholder value.
In fiscal 2019, we delivered $1.2 billion of free cash flow and returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns as well as our confidence in sustainable cash flow generation.
We continue to advance our technology road map and focus on being first to market with new product solutions. This strategy enables us to provide our customers with cost and performance benefits attractive margin for Seagate.
As we shared last quarter, we began shipping our 16-terabyte drive in late March to deliver the world's highest capacity storage solutions, and we have already introduced products for both enterprise and edge stores applications. Customer qualifications are progressing well, and we remain on track to ramp high-volume shipments later in calendar year 2019.
In addition to driving the next generation of high capacity storage, we are the first to introduce dual actuator technology. This technology effectively doubles the performance of the same capacity points, making it ideal for cloud workloads and edge sequential operations, servicing large data flows such as video streaming, smart factories, AI and machine learning. Our Mach 2 dual actuator technology is garnering strong interest.
Customers are starting to qualified these drives, which we expect to begin shipping later this calendar year and become increasingly critical across the industry starting around the 20-terabyte capacity point.
Looking ahead, we expect to capture another industry first with the introduction of 20-terabyte capacity drives, which will be based on our highly scalable HAMR technology. Six years ago, I stated that HDDs would be 20 terabytes by the end of calendar 2020, and we remain on track to hit that target.
We are focused on making the transition to HAMR technology seamless for our customers. Our HAMR drives are built on a common platform to current 16-terabyte drives, which is helping to accelerate maturity and adoption in the market.
As we enter fiscal year 2020, we expect of the macro related in certainties that I described earlier will continue to have some influence on near-term industry dynamics. However, we expect demand from global cloud and hyperscale customers will continue to improve, particularly for high-capacity drives.
Seagate is well positioned to address this growing demand with a strong technology portfolio, deep customer relationships, manufacturing expertise and precision robotics, assembly and analytics and the supply chain flexibility, which, together, all enable manufacturing cost advantages. We expect our Exabyte shipments into the enterprise nearline market will be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40% in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, we expect to deliver healthy revenue growth year-over-year.
With that, turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our June quarter results and share of our outlook for the September quarter."

We're going to focus on riding strong operational efficiency and effectively managing the business through dynamic market conditions. On a sequential basis, we grew June quarter revenue by 3% to $2.37 billion, and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We increased total exabyte shipments by 10% to 84.5 exabytes and we expended non-GAAP operating income by 8% to $286 million.
While the geopolitical situation will remain uncertain, we are seeing improving demand condition particularly among cloud [indiscernible] customers for higher capacity nearline drives.
Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives, represented 41% of total June quarter revenue, up from 39% in the March quarter, mainly due to stronger demand in drives.
Exabyte shipment into the enterprise market were up 16% quarter-over-quarter at 38 exabyte. Nearline drive accounted for more than 90% of that total, with average capacity per nearline drive in nearly 8 terabytes.
Revenue from 12 terabytes and higher capacity drives now represents more than 50% of total nearline revenue compared with 36% in the prior quarter. We have successfully qualified our 16 terabyte drive with the customer and expect shipment volume to increase through the fiscal year.
Revenue for the edge noncompute market, which includes a surveillance, NAND, gaming, DVR and consumer application increased to 34% of the total June quarter revenue compared to 32% in the prior quarter.
Forecast for the calendar year is typically a weaker period for the edge noncompute market. We saw some acceleration in demand from a few surveillance and gaming customers, which led to a sequential increase in revenue and Exabyte shipments.
We shipped a total of 33 exabytes into the edge noncompute market for the June quarter compared to 29 exabytes in the prior period.
Moving now to nearline application and the majority of edge noncompute platforms require a reliable and secure mass data storage, which is we're aligned high-capacity disk drives. Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook hard disk drives, contributed 18% of total revenue, relative to 20% of revenue in the March quarter.
With Exabyte shipment down approximately 6% to 14 Exabyte, reflecting typical seasonality. Our non-hard disk drive business, including cloud systems and SSD solutions, made up the remaining 7% of June quarter revenue, down from 8% in the prior year period.
The quarter-over-quarter revenue decline was mainly driven by lower demand from our enterprise SSD customers. Revenue for our cloud system business was slightly down quarter-over-quarter. However, we improved operating profit, which reflect our ability to transition our portfolio to higher revenue products.
During the quarter, we jointly announced a new partnership with for a private cloud market opportunity and across health care and research media and entertainment. Decline solution will be powered by Seagate 16 terabyte high-capacity drives and our new high density product platform, which deliver a cost-effective solution for large-scale deployment.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 26.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially on a more favorable product mix. Consistent with our expectations, during the quarter, we incurred underutilization cost, which we're only trying to improve from the March quarter and thus, negatively impacting gross margin. We continue to cost manage our manufacturing outlook while I'm closely with the demand environment, which is that with capacity drives. Therefore, we are expanding our production capabilities to address future growth opportunities. As a result of this dynamic, underutilization cost will remain a headwind on gross margin until demand fully our production capacity later in the calendar year.
Efficiently managed our non-GAAP operating expenses the income flat quarter-over-quarter at $350 million, down nearly $60 million on the year-ago period. The combination of slide to higher gross margin and plat operating expenses resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 for the June quarter as a high-end of our guidance range and reflecting our ongoing operational efficiency and the expense activity.
Cash flow from operations was $448 million in the June quarter. After expenditures, [indiscernible] $151 million in the June quarter and above $600 million for the fiscal year, which was just below 6% of full year revenue.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we expect CapEx to be near the midpoint of our target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue to support our plan to increase our manufacturing Exabyte capacity to address growing demand.
Free cash flow was a healthy $297 million for the June quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year. During the quarter, we received a cash payment of $1.35 billion from [indiscernible] holding company for the redemption of outstanding shares we had with the company. As a reminder, just over a year ago, Seagate made a $1.27 billion investment in [indiscernible] The proceeds represent our original investment as well as interest income.
During the June quarter, we retired $272 million in debt, including the repayment of our revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, the company debt balance was $4.25 billion, with a gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio of just below 2x.
We repurchased 7.8 million ordinary shares for $350 million, in stating our view Seagate share implement an attractive investment. We exit the June quarter with 269 million ordinary shares outstanding, down 6% from the prior year. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization.
Our Board has again approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on October 9, 2019. Through the combination of dividends and share buyback, Seagate returned approximately $1.7 billion to shareholder in fiscal year 2019 or about 145% of free cash flow, which reflect our focus on financing shareholder value.
As of the end of June, cash and cash equivalents were at $2.2 billion, up $832 million from the prior quarter with an additional $1.5 billion available through our revolver.
As we enter fiscal year 2020, the industry landscape is improving, and we remain focused on executing plans to expand our manufacturing capacity to address growing demand for mass capacity storage. While these actions as a near-term impact from gross margin, we believe they position Seagate well to capitalize on future growth opportunities.
Prior to sharing our quarterly outlook, I would like to outline a change to our financial reporting. In the September quarter, we will begin, excluding share-based compensation expense, from our non-GAAP results because companies utilize different factors and methodologies to calculate their spend as well as to be more consistent with the majority of our industry peers. This expense is approximately $30 million per quarter, of which majority is included in operating expenses.
I would also point out that September quarter give the 14-week period, and we expect to incur additional operating expenses due to higher variable compensation and are weak in the quarter. We expect the net impact to operating expense to be an additional $20 million in the September quarter.
Taking these factors into account, our outlook for the September quarter is as follows: We expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion, plus or minus 5%.; non-GAAP gross margin to be relatively flat sequentially; non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, plus or minus 5%.
While the macro environment continues to be near-term demand, we expect Exabyte volumes to meaningfully grow. Over the long term, our focus on the cash generation and a solid balance sheet will provide us the financial strength to capitalize on future storage growth opportunities in enhance shareholder value.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

But I'll describe the market dynamics and then I'll let Gianluca do a walk on specific impacts if that's more helpful. I don't think we should underestimate disruptions in the market from a demand perspective that we saw in Q4 and continuously ratifications in the Q1. There's a lot of supply that was pushed into the market, I think into channels that are not necessarily tied to revenue quickly, and that's partly because people are buying things in anticipation of the maybe supply disruptions that didn't happen. And I think those factors have actually played into the quarter to quarter compare, it may be live part of underutilization as well just as we try to tie those things back together. Because as you know, we like to build only with the customers that absolutely need those disruptions that impacted us. I think to divide very high level of the industry look at revenue per terabyte, you can see the revenue point terabytes are going down quite a bit. Now some of that as we transition to higher capacity drives and some of its that cloud is still not fully turned on, but you can see that competitive progress there. How do we get out of it and when? As to your question, that's when we can go through our cost per terabyte and the biggest product that we have coming there impact of 16, But I'll let Gianluca do the walk."

The overall gross margin was very well aligned to our guidance and as you know, even EPS, we are actually higher than the midpoint of our guidance. So I don't know no expectation was to either match higher gross margin for F Q4. In F Q1, you will see that underutilization cost impacting the gross margin. Less than in F Q4, but still probably 50, 60 basis points. So as I said, it's not really [indiscernible] to the 16 terabyte specifically, but we are adding capacity to our manufacturing capabilities because of our expectation of much higher volume coming in the next few quarters. So until we ramp on our production and fulfill the factories, we will have some underutilization cost. And as Dave said, will also some pricing pressure in the market that is keeping gross margin maybe a bit lower than what you were expecting. And maybe let me take this opportunity to talk about those EPS for F Q1. So we got $0.90, plus or minus 5%. But on several items that will impact EPS in Q1 in different directions. So the first of all, we will have the quality of the impact of higher revenue. It's a similar gross margin as we guided. We also have a positive impact from, excluding share-based compensation's starting F Q1 in order to be better aligned to our competitors and the normal in the industry. And then we have the couple of negative impact. One is OpEx because F Q1 is a 14-week quarter, we will add about $20 million, $25 million higher OpEx in the quarter, and we also have higher OpEx due to the variable compensation. So we discover another $20 million. Finally, we also have lower interest income because we redeemed our investment in Toshiba. As you know, that investment was generating about $20 million of interest income that we will not have in F Q1. So how you consolidate $0.86 in F Q4 to the $0.90 in F Q1."

So when we say last cycle, gosh, it was only a year ago, it feels like these cycles are going very quickly. We're investing to be able to hit the peaks of those cycles, better to your point, and then I think there's competition as well, which is to my commentary about revenue per terabyte. We need to get cost per terabyte down, but we also have to realize that revenue per terabyte is coming down fairly aggressively as we moved. So all these things factor in over a longer period of time, the margin rates serves as a guide for how much we want to invest, where we think we are going to go and I think if you look over the entire fiscal year, to your point, you saw a peak in the valley, if you will. We think there's another pea coming as well, exactly to your point. So if we -- I think if we get to the top end of the range again, we earned it, and we would also -- I would also -- always ask the team the kind of in quarter if we have the opportunity to go grab dollars, even they're dilutive to gross margin percentage, will take it tactically.

I don't think it's near term, so just to be quite frank, I think there is some smaller customers who have very high performance workloads who are really pushing for this technology. There are some smaller divisions of cloud service providers because of everything -- all cloud service provides are not created equal, many have different roadmaps. So where this technology is immediately applicable is a subset. I think the technology, over time, becomes much more important. And I would think about it as above 20 terabytes. You just can't continue to have bigger drives all behind 1 actuator at a relative [indiscernible] per terabyte streaming speed if that makes sense. So we need to go to this technology. I think it'll be competitive and I think we're being driven very hard for it, but I also think since we're providing so much more value, we happen to [indiscernible] is really good for us. I think the other interesting about the technology is everything is about the cloud. It's very applicable back into the edge data centers, which are right now, starved for that value, I think, from a lower cost per terabyte perspective and also from a performance perspective. And then the rest of the edge is also, if we talk about surveillance drives or something, we're getting driven from multiple streams of surveillance drive. But for the technology is probably relevant thereto, but I just did just want to be very upfront to say that the first instantiation that we're shifting this product is going to be from the early adopters, if you will, are going to be for nitchie for a while."

So from my perspective, it's going to be a bigger, bigger portion and the leverage that we get because we're doing fewer drive types than before, I think we'll get relatively better payout.

And I am not saying that the hard drive sites as the primary driver that I think there are many drivers, but I think that's the biggest thing driving us near term.
Longer term, to your point, if I think about enterprise, the cloud will continue to grow. The cloud will continue to cycle through some of their existing footprint and upgrade as well, but I think data is still going to grow in the cloud. I think the other interesting topic that we have going on right now is that on prime data centers, data is being repatriated but there's a market difference in the cost between the cloud and the on-prem. And what we're seeing is lot of people in the on-prem where we're going to have focus on high-performance storage, and that's fine, it's going to be a lot of needs to recompute there and the high-performance storage or high-performance memory, if you will, need to be very close edge compute. But in order to put the extreme data growth is going on, in order to have enterprise growth in those places, you're going to need cost-effective solutions vis-à-vis the cloud. So we'd see a great opportunity there. We talked about it a little bit in the script, and I think that's also an opportunity for us to get to market little bit faster with the same technology, and that will drive Exabyte growth."

There are other people who you can tell the data that's growing against our application, and they want to continue to invest, but they wait for the right architectural decisions, sometimes it's hard drives capacity point, sometimes it has to do with other architectures that are going on. So it's hard to point -- to paint the cloud with a uniform brush because there's so many different applications and strategies that are going on. But I do think the overall data growth is very consistent, and that's what drives that period is the data that we're referring to. A little wider and deeper this time. Maybe, I think, certainly, its felt like that in the last 6 months. And I think what I said 1.5 years ago was that geographically was that geographically, we're starting to see enough diversity that maybe it wouldn't be as deep.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call.

Afterward, Gianluca will discuss details on our June quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the September quarter. Following the prepared markets, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate continues to deliver on its financial commitments, achieving June quarter results that were solidly in line with our expectations. We recorded revenue of $2.37 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, both towards the upper end of our guidance range against a backdrop of increasing geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory hurdles.
These broader macro conditions disrupted our customers' buying patterns causing trepidation amongst some of our enterprise and OEM partners, while prompting others to accelerate demand, including a few surveillance customers.
Our ability to adapt to market volatility and intelligently manage our business enabled us to increase revenue and expedite shipments quarter-over-quarter, supported by improving demand for nearline drives from cloud and hyperscale customers. Additionally, our fiscal year performance demonstrates solid execution on our priorities to optimize profitability and free cash flow.
We've been successfully pivoting the business towards growing markets, which include enterprise nearline drives in stores for surveillance and NAS and our cloud system solutions. 
In fiscal 2019, we delivered annual revenue of $10.4 billion, of which approximately half was derived from these markets. These applications require reliable, cost-effective mass storage, making them well suited to our portfolio products. Importantly, they contributed an even higher percentage of our gross profit, providing a solid platform for margins to expand as they become a greater part of our overall revenue. 
At the same time, we are continuing to supply HDDs into mature markets, which include mission-critical, edge compute, DVR, gaming and consumer applications to support our customers' needs. These products require minimal further investment, while contributing nicely to our overall operating income.
We are continuing to tightly manage expenses while prioritizing investments towards areas that deliver the greatest value to our customers and strong returns for Seagate. In fiscal year 2019, we reduced our full year non-GAAP operating expenses by 9%, while increasing our investments in next-generation technologies to improve aerial density and lower cost per terabyte. We are leveraging our significant free cash flow generation to enhance shareholder value.
In fiscal 2019, we delivered $1.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns as well as our confidence in sustainable cash flow generation.
We continue to advance our technology road map and focus on being first to market with new product solutions. This strategy enables us to provide our customers with cost and performance benefits and an attractive margin for Seagate.
As we shared last quarter, we began shipping our 16-terabyte drives in late March to deliver the world's highest capacity storage solutions, and we have already introduced products for both enterprise and edge storage applications. Customer qualifications are progressing well, and we remain on track to ramp high-volume shipments later in calendar year 2019.
In addition to driving the next generation of high-capacity storage, we are the first to introduce dual-actuator technology. This technology effectively doubles the performance at the same capacity points, making it ideal for cloud workloads and edge sequential operations, servicing large data flows such as video streaming, smart factories, AI and machine learning. Our Mach 2 dual-actuator technology is garnering strong interest.
Customers have started to qualify these drives, which we expect to begin shipping later this calendar year and become increasingly critical across the industry starting around the 20-terabyte capacity point.
Looking ahead, we expect to capture another industry first with the introduction of 20-terabyte capacity drives, which will be based on our highly scalable HAMR technology. Six years ago, I stated that HDDs would be 20 terabytes by the end of calendar 2020, and we remain on track to hit that target.
We are focused on making the transition to HAMR technology seamless for our customers. Our HAMR drives are built on a common platform to current 16-terabyte drives, which is helping to accelerate maturity and adoption in the market.
As we enter fiscal year 2020, we expect the macro-related uncertainties that I described earlier, will continue to have some influence on near-term industry dynamics. However, we expect demand from Global, cloud and hyperscale customers will continue to improve, particularly for high-capacity drives.
Seagate is well positioned to address this growing demand with a strong technology portfolio, deep customer relationships, manufacturing expertise and precision robotics, assembly and analytics and the supply chain flexibility, which, together, all enable manufacturing cost advantages. 
We expect our exabyte shipments into the enterprise nearline market will be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40% in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, we expect to deliver healthy revenue growth year-over-year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our June quarter results and share of our outlook for the September quarter."

We're going to focus on riding strong operational efficiency and effectively managing the business through dynamic market conditions. On a sequential basis, we grew June quarter revenue by 3% to $2.37 billion, and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We increased total exabyte shipments by 10% to 84.5 exabytes, and we expended non-GAAP operating income by 8% to $286 million.
While the geopolitical situation will remain uncertain, we are seeing improving demand condition, particularly among cloud, hyperscale customers for higher capacity nearline drives. Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives, represented 41% of total June quarter revenue, up from 39% in the March quarter, mainly due to stronger demand in nearline drives.
Exabyte shipment into the enterprise market were up 16% quarter-over-quarter at 38 exabyte. Nearline drive accounted for more than 90% of that total, with average capacity per nearline drive in nearly 8 terabytes.
Revenue from 12 terabytes and higher capacity drives now represents more than 50% of total nearline revenue compared with 36% in the prior quarter. We have successfully qualified our 16-terabyte drives with a number of customer, and we expect shipment volume to increase through the fiscal year.
Revenue for the edge noncompute market, which includes a surveillance, NAS, gaming, DVR and consumer application, increased to 34% of the total June quarter revenue compared to 32% in the prior quarter. And the first half of the calendar year is typically a weaker period for the edge noncompute market. We saw some acceleration in demand from a few surveillance and gaming customers, which led to a sequential increase in revenue and exabyte shipments.
We shipped a total of 33 exabytes into the edge noncompute market during the June quarter compared to 29 exabytes in the prior period.
Similar to nearline application, a majority of edge noncompute platforms require reliable and secure mass data storage, which is well aligned to high-capacity disk drives. 
Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook hard disk drives, contributed 18% of total revenue, relative to 20% of revenue in the March quarter. With exabyte shipment down approximately 6% to 14 exabytes, reflecting typical seasonality. Our nonhard disk drive business, including cloud systems and SSD solutions, made up the remaining 7% of June quarter revenue, down from 8% in the prior year period.
The quarter-over-quarter revenue decline was mainly driven by lower demand from our enterprise SSD customers. Revenue for our cloud system business was slightly down quarter-over-quarter. However, we improved operating profit, which reflect our ability to transition our portfolio to higher revenue products.
During the quarter, we jointly announced a new partnership with Cloudian to address the private cloud market opportunity across healthcare and scientific research and media and entertainment. A Cloudian solution will be powered by Seagate 16-terabyte high-capacity drives and our new high-density storage server platform, which deliver a cost-effective solution for large-scale deployment.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 26.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially on a more favorable product mix. Consistent with our expectations, during the June quarter, we incurred underutilization cost, which were only slightly improved from the March quarter and, thus, negatively impacting gross margin. 
We continue to proactively manage our manufacturing output to align closely with the demand environment, which is starting to improve for higher-capacity drives. Therefore, we are expanding our production capabilities to address future growth opportunities. As a result of this dynamic, underutilization cost will remain a headwind on gross margin until demand fully met our production capacity later in the calendar year.
We efficiently managed our non-GAAP operating expenses holding them flat quarter-over-quarter at $350 million, down nearly $50 million from the year-ago period. The combination of slightly higher gross margin and slight operating expenses resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 for the June quarter as a high end of our guidance range and reflecting our ongoing operational efficiencies and the expense activities.
Cash flow from operations was $448 million in the June quarter. After expenditures, we're at $151 million in the June quarter and above $600 million for the fiscal year, which was just below 6% of full year revenue. Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we expect CapEx to be near the midpoint of our target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue to support our plans to increase our manufacturing exabyte capacity to address growing demand.
Free cash flow was a healthy $297 million for the June quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year. During the quarter, we received a cash payment of $1.35 billion from Toshiba Memory holding company for the early redemption of outstanding preferred shares we held in the company. As a reminder, just over a year ago, Seagate made a $1.27 billion investment in TMC preferred shares. The proceeds represent our original investment as well as 1ac rued interest income.
During the June quarter, we retired $272 million in debt, including the repayment of our revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, the company debt balance was $4.25 billion, with a gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio of just below 2x.
We repurchased 7.8 million ordinary shares for $350 million in stating our view that Seagate shares represent an attractive investment. We exit the June quarter with 269 million ordinary shares outstanding, down 6% from the prior year. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization.
Our Board has again approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on October 9, 2019. Through the combination of dividends and share buyback, Seagate returned approximately $1.7 billion to shareholder in fiscal year 2019 or about 145% of free cash flow, which reflect our focus on enhancing shareholder value.
As of the end of June, cash and cash equivalents were at $2.2 billion, up $832 million from the prior quarter with an additional $1.5 billion available through our revolver. As we enter fiscal year 2020, the industry landscape is improving, and we remain focused on executing plans to expand our manufacturing capacity to address growing demand for mass capacity storage. While these actions have a near-term impact on gross margin, we believe they position Seagate well to capitalize on future growth opportunities.
Prior to sharing our quarterly outlook, I would like to outline a change to our financial reporting. Starting in the September quarter, we will begin excluding share-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results because companies utilize different factors and methodologies to calculate their spend as well as to be more consistent with the majority of our industry peers. This expense is approximately $30 million per quarter, of which a majority is included in operating expenses.
I would also point out the December quarter is a 14-week period, and we expect to incur additional operating expenses due to higher variable compensation and the extra week in the quarter. We expect the net impact to operating expense to be an additional $20 million in the September quarter.
Taking these factors into account, our outlook for the September quarter is as follows: we expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion, plus or minus 5%.; non-GAAP gross margin to be relatively flat sequentially; non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, plus or minus 5%.
While the macro environment continues disrupt near-term demand, we expect exabyte volumes to meaningfully grow. Over the long term, our focus on cash generation and a solid balance sheet will provide us the financial strength to capitalize on future storage growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

To summarize, Seagate is executing well on its strategic priorities to optimize profit and free cash flow. We are continuing to manage the business intelligently through industry-related cycles and the current market dynamics. Over the longer term, we believe the fundamental demand for data is driving the need for mass storage capacity. Seagate is creating solutions to help customers manage the exponential volumes of data securely, efficiently and cost effectively.
As we enter fiscal 2020, I am confident that we have the financial foundation, manufacturing expertise and technology portfolio to capitalize on these future growth opportunities. We will be hosting an analyst event on September 19 in New York City, where we plan to outline our strategy in more detail.
Before opening the call for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for all of their contributions to the success of our business.

But I'll describe the market dynamics, and then I'll let Gianluca do a walk on specific impacts if that's more helpful. 
I don't think we should underestimate disruptions in the market from a demand perspective that we saw in Q4 and continue to see ramifications on Q1. There's a lot of supply that was pushed into the market, I think, into channels that are not necessarily tied to revenue quickly, and that's partly because people are buying things in anticipation of maybe supply disruptions that didn't happen. 
And I think those factors have actually played into the quarter-over-quarter compare and may even be a little part of underutilization as well, just as we try to tie those things back together. Because, as you know, we like to build only with the customers that absolutely need, and those disruptions have impacted us. 
I think if I step to the very high level of the industry and looked at revenue per terabyte, you can see the revenue per terabytes going down quite a bit. Now some of that's the transition to higher-capacity drives and some of it's fact that the cloud is still not fully turned on, but you can see that competitive progress there. 
How do we get out of it and when? As to your question, that's when we can go draw at cost per terabyte, and the biggest product that we have coming there that's going to be impactful with 16s as well. 
But I'll let Gianluca do the walk as well."

So in terms of underutilization cost, in this Q4, we still had about 100 basis point of gross margin that we lost due to underutilization. The overall gross margin was fairly well aligned to our guidance. And as you know, even in EPS, we are actually",366,"Yes. So in terms of underutilization cost, in this Q4, we still had about 100 basis point of gross margin that we lost due to underutilization. The overall gross margin was fairly well aligned to our guidance. And as you know, even in EPS, we are actually higher than the midpoint of our guidance. So I don't know if the expectation was to have much higher gross margins for F Q4. 
In F Q1, you will see have some underutilization cost impacting the gross margin, less than in F Q4 but still probably 50, 60 basis points. So as they said, it's not really related to the 16 terabyte, specifically, but we are adding capacity to our manufacturing capabilities because of our expectation of much higher volume coming in the next few quarters. So until we ramp all our production and fulfill the factories, we will have some underutilization cost. 
And as Dave said, there is also some pricing pressure in the market that is keeping gross margin maybe a little bit lower than what you are expecting. 
And maybe -- let me take the opportunity to talk about also EPS for F Q1. So we guided $0.90, plus or minus 5%. There are several items that will impact EPS in Q1 in different directions. So first of all, we will have the positive impact of higher revenue. It's similar gross margin as we guided. We also have a positive impact from excluding share-based compensation's starting F Q1 in order to be better aligned to our competitors and the normal prices in the industry. 
And then we have the couple of negative impact. One is OpEx because F Q1 is a 14-week quarter, we will have about $20 million, $25 million higher OpEx in the quarter, and we also have higher OpEx due to the variable compensation. So that is probably another $20 million. 
Finally, we also have lower interest income because we redeemed our investment in Toshiba. As you know, that investment was generating about $20 million of interest income that we will not have in F Q1. So it is how you can reconsolidate $0.86 in F Q4 to the $0.90 in F Q1."

So that's a platform we've been outselling to our customers, getting them to align to -- getting them to align on the ramps and so on. 
So to your point, especially when the market is relatively soft for nearline, we've been down -- it's actually starting to pick back up as we talked about, but it's not -- still not up to full speed, and you can see that versus where we were, say, a year ago when things were really hot. 
We don't -- we want to make sure we don't push the wrong drives out there. So from our perspective, let's not overbuild, say, for example, on 12s or 10s, and push those into slots that, ultimately, the customers maybe they don't want for their long-term TCO propositions. They're going to be putting these data centers up and running drives for 5, 7 years. So the TCO proposition for the 16 is huge. 
We don't want to be temporarily going after that. So if you call that share loss or something like that, that's fine. That's not a metric we're really managing on to your point."

So all these things factor in. Over a longer period of time, the margin range serves as a guide for how much we want to invest, where we think we are going to go, and I think if you look over the entire fiscal year, to your point, you saw a peak and a valley, if you will.

I think there are some smaller customers who have very high-performance workloads who are really pushing for this technology. There are some smaller divisions of cloud service providers because of everything. All cloud service provides are not created equal, and many have different workloads. 
So where this technology is immediately applicable is a subset. I think the technology, over time, becomes much more important. And I would think about it as above 20 terabytes. There -- you just can't continue to have bigger drives all behind one actuator at relative apps per terabyte streaming speed that's less if that makes sense. So we need to go to this technology. 
I think it'll be competitive, and I think we're being driven very hard for it, but I also think it -- since we're providing so much more value, if we happen to outcompete, it should be good for us. I think the other interesting about the technology is everything I just said about the cloud. It's very applicable back into the edge data centers, which are, right now, starved for that value, I think, from a lower-cost-per-terabyte perspective but also from a performance perspective. And then the rest of the edge is also, if we talk about surveillance drives or something, we're getting driven from multiple streams of surveillance drive. 
So the technology is probably relevant there, too, but I just want to be very upfront and say that the first instantiation now that we're shipping these products is going to be -- the early adopters, if you will, are going to be more nitchie for a while."

We said in the script that the -- I don't know if you caught this week, we talked about how we're doing minimal investments in some of these spaces. But I think what's important is we're managing the business for free cash flow over the long term, not over the short term, right? 
And some of these markets are still -- without -- with minimal investment, the free cash flow is still quite good. The operating margin's still quite good. As a matter of fact, I would argue that today, the competitor, if you will, that you just talked about being flash drives or something like that are not as good. So -- but there's a reality of the market space. 
So we're not really investing a lot in those spaces. We'll continue to run them over the long haul and think about them as how do we generate free cash flow. There will be disruptions in some of those spaces, and we can forecast that over time. But I think we have to be careful because the tail is actually quite long as well. 
I'll just pick on PCs for a second because a lot of people like to talk about it. From my perspective, from a hard drive perspective, PCs -- the interesting one for hard drives, they already have dual drives in them, so it's actually a longer tail. And there's a reason why the HDDs and the SSDs in there, and so I don't really think of it as per se an either/or. 
And then the other thing to keep in mind is we're off to service our customers, and our customers kind of dictate the demand. We don't make demand by our strategy. We don't think of it that way so if that helps you."

It's becoming a bigger and bigger portion, I think, in the script, we talked about it already being 50%. So from my perspective, it's going to be a bigger and bigger portion, and the leverage that we get because we're doing fewer drive types than before, I think, we'll get relatively better pay off. 
If I think about the large part of the driver for exabyte growth, it's the fact that we're getting higher capacity points, 16 versus 10 in the last peak of the last cycle. And I am not saying that the hard drive size is the primary driver of that. I think there are many drivers, but I think that's the biggest thing driving us near term.
Longer term, to your point, if I think about enterprise, the cloud will continue to grow. The cloud will continue to cycle through some of their existing footprint and upgrade as well, but I think data is still going to grow on the cloud. I think the other interesting topic that we have going on right now is that in the on-prem data centers, data is being repatriated, but there's a market difference in the cost between the cloud and the on-prem. 
And what we're seeing is lot of people in the on-prem arena have focused on high-performance storage, and that's fine. It's going to be a lot of needs for compute there, and the high-performance storage or high-performance memory, if you will, needs to be very close to that compute. 
But in order to -- with the extreme data growth that's going on, in order to have enterprise growth in those places, you're going to need cost-effective solutions, vis-à-vis the cloud. So we'd see a great opportunity there. We talked about it a little bit in the script, and I think that's also an opportunity for us to get to market a little bit faster with the same technology, and that will drive Exabyte growth."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. I will start off by summarizing key highlights from the June quarter and sharing some perspectives on the market before outlining our progress on our key priorities. Afterward, Gianluca will discuss details on our June quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the September quarter. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate continues to deliver on its financial commitments, achieving June quarter results that were solidly in line with our expectations. We recorded revenue of $2.37 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, both towards the upper end of our guidance range against a backdrop of increasing geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory hurdles.
These broader macro conditions disrupted our customers' buying patterns causing trepidation amongst some of our enterprise and OEM partners, while prompting others to accelerate demand, including a few surveillance customers.
Our ability to adapt to market volatility and intelligently manage our business enabled us to increase revenue and expedite shipments quarter-over-quarter, supported by improving demand for nearline drives from cloud and hyperscale customers. Additionally, our fiscal year performance demonstrates solid execution on our priorities to optimize profitability and free cash flow.
We've been successfully pivoting the business towards growing markets, which include enterprise nearline drives, edge storage for surveillance and NAS and our cloud system solutions. 
In fiscal 2019, we delivered annual revenue of $10.4 billion, of which approximately half was derived from these markets. These applications require reliable, cost-effective mass storage, making them well suited to our portfolio of products. Importantly, they contributed an even higher percentage of our gross profit, providing a solid platform for margins to expand as they become a greater part of our overall revenue. 
At the same time, we are continuing to supply HDDs into mature markets, which include mission-critical, edge compute, DVR, gaming and consumer applications to support our customers' needs. These products require minimal further investment, while contributing nicely to our overall operating income.
We are continuing to tightly manage expenses while prioritizing investments towards the areas that deliver the greatest value to our customers and strong returns for Seagate. In fiscal year 2019, we reduced our full year non-GAAP operating expenses by 9%, while increasing our investments in next-generation technologies to improve aerial density and lower cost per terabyte. We are leveraging our significant free cash flow generation to enhance shareholder value.
In fiscal 2019, we delivered $1.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns as well as our confidence in sustainable cash flow generation.
We continue to advance our technology road map and focus on being first to market with new product solutions. This strategy enables us to provide our customers with cost and performance benefits at an attractive margin for Seagate.
As we shared last quarter, we began shipping our 16-terabyte drives in late March to deliver the world's highest capacity storage solutions, and we have already introduced products for both enterprise and edge storage applications. Customer qualifications are progressing well, and we remain on track to ramp high-volume shipments later in calendar year 2019.
In addition to driving the next generation of high-capacity storage, we are the first to introduce dual-actuator technology. This technology effectively doubles the performance at the same capacity points, making it ideal for cloud workloads and edge sequential operations, servicing large data flows such as video streaming, smart factories, AI and machine learning. Our Mach 2 dual-actuator technology is garnering strong interest.
Customers have started to qualify these drives, which we expect to begin shipping later this calendar year and become increasingly critical across the industry starting around the 20-terabyte capacity point.
Looking ahead, we expect to capture another industry first with the introduction of 20-terabyte capacity drives, which will be based on our highly scalable HAMR technology. Six years ago, I stated that HDDs would be 20 terabytes by the end of calendar 2020, and we remain on track to hit that target.
We are focused on making the transition to HAMR technology seamless for our customers. Our HAMR drives are built on a common platform to current 16-terabyte drives, which is helping to accelerate maturity and adoption in the market.
As we enter fiscal year 2020, we expect the macro-related uncertainties that I described earlier, will continue to have some influence on near-term industry dynamics. However, we expect demand from Global, cloud and hyperscale customers will continue to improve, particularly for high-capacity drives.
Seagate is well positioned to address this growing demand with a strong technology portfolio, deep customer relationships, manufacturing expertise and precision robotics, assembly and analytics and the supply chain flexibility, which, together, all enable manufacturing cost advantages. 
We expect our exabyte shipments into the enterprise nearline market will be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40% in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, we expect to deliver healthy revenue growth year-over-year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our June quarter results and share of our outlook for the September quarter."

We're going to focus on driving strong operational efficiency and effectively managing the business through dynamic market conditions. On a sequential basis, we grew June quarter revenue by 3% to $2.37 billion, and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We increased total exabyte shipments by 10% to 84.5 exabytes, and we expanded non-GAAP operating income by 8% to $286 million.
While the geopolitical situation will remain uncertain, we are seeing improving demand condition, particularly among cloud, hyperscale customers for higher capacity nearline drives. Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives, represented 41% of total June quarter revenue, up from 39% in the March quarter, mainly due to stronger demand in nearline drives.
Exabyte shipments into the enterprise market were up 15% quarter-over-quarter at 38 exabyte. Nearline drive accounted for more than 90% of that total, with average capacity per nearline drive in nearly 8 terabytes.
Revenue from 12 terabytes and higher capacity drives now represents more than 50% of total nearline revenue compared with 36% in the prior quarter. We have successfully qualified our 16-terabyte drives with a number of customer, and we expect shipment volume to increase through the fiscal year.
Revenue for the edge noncompute market, which includes surveillance, NAS, gaming, DVR and consumer application, increased to 34% of the total June quarter revenue compared to 32% in the prior quarter. And the first half of the calendar year is typically a weaker period for the edge noncompute market. We saw some acceleration in demand from a few surveillance and gaming customers, which led to a sequential increase in revenue and exabyte shipments.
We shipped a total of 33 exabytes into the edge noncompute market during the June quarter compared to 29 exabytes in the prior period.
Similar to nearline application, a majority of edge noncompute platforms require reliable and secure mass data storage, which is well aligned to high-capacity disk drives. 
Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook hard disk drives, contributed 18% of total revenue, relative to 20% of revenue in the March quarter. With exabyte shipment down approximately 6% to 14 exabytes, reflecting typical seasonality. Our nonhard disk drive business, including cloud systems and SSD solutions, made up the remaining 7% of June quarter revenue, down from 8% in the prior year period.
The quarter-over-quarter revenue decline was mainly driven by lower demand from our enterprise SSD customers. Revenue for our cloud system business was slightly down quarter-over-quarter. However, we improved operating profit, which reflect our ability to transition our portfolio to higher revenue products.
During the quarter, we jointly announced a new partnership with Cloudian to address the private cloud market opportunity across healthcare and scientific research and media and entertainment. A Cloudian solution will be powered by Seagate 16-terabyte high-capacity drives and our new high-density storage server platform, which deliver a cost-effective solution for large-scale deployment.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 26.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially on a more favorable product mix. Consistent with our expectations, during the June quarter, we incurred underutilization cost, which were only slightly improved from the March quarter and, thus, negatively impacting gross margin. 
We continue to proactively manage our manufacturing output to align closely with the demand environment, which is starting to improve for higher-capacity drives. Therefore, we are expanding our production capabilities to address future growth opportunities. As a result of this dynamic, underutilization cost will remain a headwind on gross margin until demand fully matches our production capacity later in the calendar year.
We efficiently managed our non-GAAP operating expenses holding them flat quarter-over-quarter at $350 million, down nearly $50 million from the year-ago period. The combination of slightly higher gross margin and flat operating expenses resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 for the June quarter as a high end of our guidance range and reflecting our ongoing operational efficiencies and the expense discipline.
Cash flow from operations was $448 million in the June quarter. After expenditures, we're at $151 million in the June quarter and above $600 million for the fiscal year, which was just below 6% of full year revenue. Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we expect CapEx to be near the midpoint of our target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue to support our plans to increase our manufacturing exabyte capacity to address growing demand.
Free cash flow was a healthy $297 million for the June quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year. During the quarter, we received a cash payment of $1.35 billion from Toshiba Memory holding company for the early redemption of outstanding preferred shares we held in the company. As a reminder, just over a year ago, Seagate made a $1.27 billion investment in TMC preferred shares. The proceeds represent our original investment as well as accrued interest income.
During the June quarter, we retired $272 million in debt, including the repayment of our revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, the company debt balance was $4.25 billion, with a gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio of just below 2x.
We repurchased 7.8 million ordinary shares for $350 million in stating our view that Seagate shares represent an attractive investment. We exit the June quarter with 269 million ordinary shares outstanding, down 6% from the prior year. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization.
Our Board has again approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on October 9, 2019. Through the combination of dividends and share buyback, Seagate returned approximately $1.7 billion to shareholder in fiscal year 2019 or about 145% of free cash flow, which reflect our focus on enhancing shareholder value.
As of the end of June, cash and cash equivalents were at $2.2 billion, up $832 million from the prior quarter with an additional $1.5 billion available through our revolver. As we enter fiscal year 2020, the industry landscape is improving, and we remain focused on executing plans to expand our manufacturing capacity to address growing demand for mass capacity storage. While these actions have a near-term impact on gross margin, we believe they position Seagate well to capitalize on future growth opportunities.
Prior to sharing our quarterly outlook, I would like to outline a change to our financial reporting. Starting in the September quarter, we will begin excluding share-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results because companies utilize different factors and methodologies to calculate their spend as well as to be more consistent with the majority of our industry peers. This expense is approximately $30 million per quarter, of which a majority is included in operating expenses.
I would also point out the December quarter is a 14-week period, and we expect to incur additional operating expenses due to higher variable compensation and the extra week in the quarter. We expect the net impact to operating expense to be an additional $20 million in the September quarter.
Taking these factors into account, our outlook for the September quarter is as follows: we expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion, plus or minus 5%; non-GAAP gross margin to be relatively flat sequentially; non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, plus or minus 5%.
While the macro environment continues disrupt near-term demand, we expect exabyte volumes to meaningfully grow. Over the long term, our focus on cash generation and a solid balance sheet will provide us the financial strength to capitalize on future storage growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

But I'll describe the market dynamics, and then I'll let Gianluca do a walk on specific impacts if that's more helpful. 
I don't think we should underestimate disruptions in the market from a demand perspective that we saw in Q4 and continue to see ramifications of in Q1. There's a lot of supply that was pushed into the market, I think, into channels that are not necessarily tied to revenue quickly, and that's partly because people are buying things in anticipation of maybe supply disruptions that didn't happen. 
And I think those factors have actually played into the quarter-over-quarter compare and may even be a little part of underutilization as well, just as we try to tie those things back together. Because, as you know, we like to build only with the customers that absolutely need, and those disruptions have impacted us. 
I think if I step to the very high level of the industry and looked at revenue per terabyte, you can see the revenue per terabytes going down quite a bit. Now some of that's the transition to higher-capacity drives and some of it's fact that the cloud is still not fully turned on, but you can see that competitive progress there. 
How do we get out of it and when? As to your question, that's when we can go draw at cost per terabyte, and the biggest product that we have coming there that's going to be impactful with 16s as well. 
But I'll let Gianluca do the walk as well."

The overall gross margin was fairly well aligned to our guidance. And as you know, even in EPS, we are actually higher than the midpoint of our guidance. So I don't know if the expectation was to have a much higher gross margins for F Q4. 
In F Q1, you will see have some underutilization cost impacting the gross margin, less than in F Q4 but still probably 50, 60 basis points. So as Dave said, it's not really related to the 16 terabyte, specifically, but we are adding capacity to our manufacturing capabilities because of our expectation of much higher volume coming in the next few quarters. So until we ramp all our production and fulfill the factories, we will have some underutilization cost. 
And as Dave said, there is also some pricing pressure in the market that is keeping gross margin maybe a little bit lower than what you are expecting. 
And maybe -- let me take the opportunity to talk about also EPS for F Q1. So we guided $0.90, plus or minus 5%. There are several items that will impact EPS in Q1 in different directions. So first of all, we will have the positive impact of higher revenue. It's a similar gross margin, as we guided. We also have a positive impact from excluding share-based compensation's starting F Q1 in order to be better aligned to our competitors and the normal prices in the industry. 
And then we have the couple of negative impact. One is OpEx because F Q1 is a 14-week quarter, we will have about $20 million, $25 million higher OpEx in the quarter, and we also have higher OpEx due to the variable compensation. So that is probably another $20 million. 
Finally, we also have lower interest income because we redeemed our investment in Toshiba. As you know, that investment was generating about $20 million of interest income that we will not have in F Q1. So it is how probably you can reconsolidate the $0.86 in F Q4 to the $0.90 in F Q1."

So that's a platform we've been out selling to our customers, getting them to align to -- getting them to align on the ramps and so on. 
So to your point, especially when the market is relatively soft for nearline, we've been down -- it's actually starting to pick back up as we talked about, but it's not -- still not up to full speed, and you can see that versus where we were, say, a year ago when things were really hot. 
We don't -- we want to make sure we don't push the wrong drives out there. So from our perspective, let's not overbuild, say, for example, on 12s or 10s, and push those into slots that, ultimately, the customers maybe they don't want for their long-term TCO proposition. They're going to be putting these data centers up and running drives for 5, 7 years. So the TCO proposition for the 16 is huge. 
We don't want to be temporarily going after that. So if you call that share loss or something like that, that's fine. That's not a metric we're really managing on to your point."

So when we say last cycle, gosh, it was only a year ago. It just -- it feels like these cycles are going very, very quickly. 
We're investing to be able to hit the peaks of those cycles, better to your point, and then I think there's competition as well, which is -- to my commentary about revenue per terabyte. We need to get cost per terabyte down, but we also have to realize that revenue per terabyte is coming down fairly aggressively as we moved. 
So all these things factor in. Over a longer period of time, the margin range serves as a guide for how much we want to invest, where we think we are going to go, and I think if you look over the entire fiscal year, to your point, you saw a peak and a valley, if you will. We think there's another peak coming as well, exactly to your point. 
So if we -- I think if we get to the top end of the range again, we earned it, and we would also -- I would also -- I would always ask the team, though, kind of end quarter if we have the opportunity to go grab dollars.

I think there are some smaller customers who have very high-performance workloads who are really pushing for this technology. And there are some smaller divisions of cloud service providers because of everything. All cloud service providers are not created equal, and many have different workloads. 
So where this technology is immediately applicable is a subset. I think the technology, over time, becomes much more important. And I would think about it as above 20 terabytes. There -- you just can't continue to have bigger drives all behind one actuator at a relative apps per terabyte streaming speed that's less if that makes sense. So we need to go to this technology. 
I think it'll be competitive, and I think we're being driven very hard for it, but I also think it -- since we're providing so much more value, if we happen to outcompete, it should be good for us. I think the other interesting about the technology is everything I just said about the cloud. It's very applicable back into the edge data centers, which are, right now, starved for that value, I think, from a lower-cost-per-terabyte perspective but also from a performance perspective. And then the rest of the edge is also, if we talk about surveillance drives or something, we're getting driven for multiple streams of surveillance drive.

So -- but there's a reality of the market space. 
So we're not really investing a lot in those spaces. We'll continue to run them over the long haul and think about them as how do we generate free cash flow.

I'll just pick on PCs for a second because a lot of people like to talk about it.

It's becoming a bigger and bigger portion, I think, in the script, we talked about it already being 50%. So from my perspective, it's going to be a bigger and bigger portion, and the leverage that we get because we're doing fewer drive types than before, I think, we'll get relatively better payoff. 
If I think about the large part of the driver for exabyte growth, it's the fact that we're getting higher capacity points, 16s versus 10 in the last peak of the last cycle. And I am not saying that the hard drive size is the primary driver of that. I think there are many drivers, but I think that's the biggest thing driving us near term.
Longer term, to your point, if I think about enterprise, the cloud will continue to grow. The cloud will continue to cycle through some of their existing footprint and upgrade as well, but I think data is still going to grow on the cloud. I think the other interesting topic that we have going on right now is that in the on-prem data centers, data is being repatriated, but there's a market difference in the cost between the cloud and the on-prem. 
And what we're seeing is lot of people in the on-prem arena have focused on high-performance storage, and that's fine. It's going to be a lot of needs for compute there, and the high-performance storage or high-performance memory, if you will, needs to be very close to that compute. 
But in order to -- with the extreme data growth that's going on, in order to have enterprise growth in those places, you're going to need cost-effective solutions, vis-à-vis the cloud. So we'd see a great opportunity there. We talked about it a little bit in the script, and I think that's also an opportunity for us to get to market a little bit faster with the same technology, and that will drive exabyte growth."

There are other people who you can tell that data is growing against their application, and they want to continue to invest, but they wait for the right architectural decisions. Sometimes, it's hard drives capacity point. Sometimes, it has to do with other architectures that are going on. 
So it's hard to point -- to paint the cloud with a uniform brush because there's so many different applications and strategies that are going on. But I do think the overall data growth is very consistent, and that's what drives that period is that we're referring to. 
A little wider and deeper this time, maybe, I think, and certainly, it has felt like that in the last 6 months. And I think what I said 1.5 years ago was that geographically we're starting to see enough diversity that maybe it wouldn't be as deep.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. I will start off by summarizing key highlights from the June quarter and sharing some perspectives on the market before outlining our progress on our key priorities. Afterward, Gianluca will discuss details on our June quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the September quarter. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate continues to deliver on its financial commitments, achieving June quarter results that were solidly in line with our expectations. We recorded revenue of $2.37 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, both towards the upper end of our guidance range against a backdrop of increasing geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory hurdles.
These broader macro conditions disrupted our customers' buying patterns causing trepidation amongst some of our enterprise and OEM partners, while prompting others to accelerate demand, including a few surveillance customers.
Our ability to adapt to market volatility and intelligently manage our business enabled us to increase revenue and expedite shipments quarter-over-quarter, supported by improving demand for nearline drives from cloud and hyperscale customers. Additionally, our fiscal year performance demonstrates solid execution on our priorities to optimize profitability and free cash flow.
We've been successfully pivoting the business towards growing markets, which include enterprise nearline drives, edge storage for surveillance and NAS and our cloud system solutions. 
In fiscal 2019, we delivered annual revenue of $10.4 billion, of which approximately half was derived from these markets. These applications require reliable, cost-effective mass storage, making them well suited to our portfolio of products. Importantly, they contributed an even higher percentage of our gross profit, providing a solid platform for margins to expand as they become a greater part of our overall revenue. 
At the same time, we are continuing to supply HDDs into mature markets, which include mission-critical, edge compute, DVR, gaming and consumer applications to support our customers' needs. These products require minimal further investment, while contributing nicely to our overall operating income.
We are continuing to tightly manage expenses while prioritizing investments towards the areas that deliver the greatest value to our customers and strong returns for Seagate. In fiscal year 2019, we reduced our full year non-GAAP operating expenses by 9%, while increasing our investments in next-generation technologies to improve aerial density and lower cost per terabyte. We are leveraging our significant free cash flow generation to enhance shareholder value.
In fiscal 2019, we delivered $1.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns as well as our confidence in sustainable cash flow generation.
We continue to advance our technology road map and focus on being first to market with new product solutions. This strategy enables us to provide our customers with cost and performance benefits at an attractive margin for Seagate.
As we shared last quarter, we began shipping our 16-terabyte drives in late March to deliver the world's highest capacity storage solutions, and we have already introduced products for both enterprise and edge storage applications. Customer qualifications are progressing well, and we remain on track to ramp high-volume shipments later in calendar year 2019.
In addition to driving the next generation of high-capacity storage, we are the first to introduce dual-actuator technology. This technology effectively doubles the performance at the same capacity points, making it ideal for cloud workloads and edge sequential operations, servicing large data flows such as video streaming, smart factories, AI and machine learning. Our Mach 2 dual-actuator technology is garnering strong interest.
Customers have started to qualify these drives, which we expect to begin shipping later this calendar year and become increasingly critical across the industry starting around the 20-terabyte capacity point.
Looking ahead, we expect to capture another industry first with the introduction of 20-terabyte capacity drives, which will be based on our highly scalable HAMR technology. Six years ago, I stated that HDDs would be 20 terabytes by the end of calendar 2020, and we remain on track to hit that target.
We are focused on making the transition to HAMR technology seamless for our customers. Our HAMR drives are built on a common platform to current 16-terabyte drives, which is helping to accelerate maturity and adoption in the market.
As we enter fiscal year 2020, we expect the macro-related uncertainties that I described earlier, will continue to have some influence on near-term industry dynamics. However, we expect demand from Global, cloud and hyperscale customers will continue to improve, particularly for high-capacity drives.
Seagate is well positioned to address this growing demand with a strong technology portfolio, deep customer relationships, manufacturing expertise and precision robotics, assembly and analytics and the supply chain flexibility, which, together, all enable manufacturing cost advantages. We expect our exabyte shipments into the enterprise nearline market will be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40% in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, we expect to deliver healthy revenue growth year-over-year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our June quarter results and share of our outlook for the September quarter."

We're going to focus on driving strong operational efficiency and effectively managing the business through dynamic market conditions. On a sequential basis, we grew June quarter revenue by 3% to $2.37 billion, and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We increased total exabyte shipments by 10% to 84.5 exabytes, and we expanded non-GAAP operating income by 8% to $286 million.
While the geopolitical situation will remain uncertain, we are seeing improving demand condition, particularly among cloud, hyperscale customers for higher capacity nearline drives. Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives, represented 41% of total June quarter revenue, up from 39% in the March quarter, mainly due to stronger demand in nearline drives.
Exabyte shipments into the enterprise market were up 15% quarter-over-quarter at 38 exabyte. Nearline drive accounted for more than 90% of that total, with average capacity per nearline drive in nearly 8 terabytes. Revenue from 12 terabytes and higher capacity drives now represents more than 50% of total nearline revenue compared with 36% in the prior quarter. We have successfully qualified our 16-terabyte drives with a number of customer, and we expect shipment volume to increase through the fiscal year.
Revenue for the edge noncompute market, which includes surveillance, NAS, gaming, DVR and consumer application, increased to 34% of the total June quarter revenue compared to 32% in the prior quarter. And the first half of the calendar year is typically a weaker period for the edge noncompute market. We saw some acceleration in demand from a few surveillance and gaming customers, which led to a sequential increase in revenue and exabyte shipments. We shipped a total of 33 exabytes into the edge noncompute market during the June quarter compared to 29 exabytes in the prior period.
Similar to nearline application, a majority of edge noncompute platforms require reliable and secure mass data storage, which is well aligned to high-capacity disk drives. Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook hard disk drives, contributed 18% of total revenue, relative to 20% of revenue in the March quarter. With exabyte shipment down approximately 6% to 14 exabytes, reflecting typical seasonality. Our nonhard disk drive business, including cloud systems and SSD solutions, made up the remaining 7% of June quarter revenue, down from 8% in the prior year period.
The quarter-over-quarter revenue decline was mainly driven by lower demand from our enterprise SSD customers. Revenue for our cloud system business was slightly down quarter-over-quarter. However, we improved operating profit, which reflect our ability to transition our portfolio to higher revenue products.
During the quarter, we jointly announced a new partnership with Cloudian to address the private cloud market opportunity across healthcare and scientific research and media and entertainment. A Cloudian solution will be powered by Seagate 16-terabyte high-capacity drives and our new high-density storage server platform, which deliver a cost-effective solution for large-scale deployment.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 26.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially on a more favorable product mix. Consistent with our expectations, during the June quarter, we incurred underutilization cost, which were only slightly improved from the March quarter and, thus, negatively impacting gross margin. 
We continue to proactively manage our manufacturing output to align closely with the demand environment, which is starting to improve for higher-capacity drives. Therefore, we are expanding our production capabilities to address future growth opportunities. As a result of this dynamic, underutilization cost will remain a headwind on gross margin until demand fully matches our production capacity later in the calendar year.
We efficiently managed our non-GAAP operating expenses holding them flat quarter-over-quarter at $350 million, down nearly $50 million from the year-ago period. The combination of slightly higher gross margin and flat operating expenses resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 for the June quarter as a high end of our guidance range and reflecting our ongoing operational efficiencies and the expense discipline.
Cash flow from operations was $448 million in the June quarter. After expenditures, we're at $151 million in the June quarter and above $600 million for the fiscal year, which was just below 6% of full year revenue. Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we expect CapEx to be near the midpoint of our target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue to support our plans to increase our manufacturing exabyte capacity to address growing demand.
Free cash flow was a healthy $297 million for the June quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year. During the quarter, we received a cash payment of $1.35 billion from Toshiba Memory holding company for the early redemption of outstanding preferred shares we held in the company. As a reminder, just over a year ago, Seagate made a $1.27 billion investment in TMC preferred shares. The proceeds represent our original investment as well as accrued interest income.
During the June quarter, we retired $272 million in debt, including the repayment of our revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, the company debt balance was $4.25 billion, with a gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio of just below 2x.
We repurchased 7.8 million ordinary shares for $350 million in stating our view that Seagate shares represent an attractive investment. We exit the June quarter with 269 million ordinary shares outstanding, down 6% from the prior year. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization.
Our Board has again approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on October 9, 2019. Through the combination of dividends and share buyback, Seagate returned approximately $1.7 billion to shareholder in fiscal year 2019 or about 145% of free cash flow, which reflect our focus on enhancing shareholder value.
As of the end of June, cash and cash equivalents were at $2.2 billion, up $832 million from the prior quarter with an additional $1.5 billion available through our revolver. As we enter fiscal year 2020, the industry landscape is improving, and we remain focused on executing plans to expand our manufacturing capacity to address growing demand for mass capacity storage. While these actions have a near-term impact on gross margin, we believe they position Seagate well to capitalize on future growth opportunities.
Prior to sharing our quarterly outlook, I would like to outline a change to our financial reporting. Starting in the September quarter, we will begin excluding share-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results because companies utilize different factors and methodologies to calculate their spend as well as to be more consistent with the majority of our industry peers. This expense is approximately $30 million per quarter, of which a majority is included in operating expenses.
I would also point out the December quarter is a 14-week period, and we expect to incur additional operating expenses due to higher variable compensation and the extra week in the quarter. We expect the net impact to operating expense to be an additional $20 million in the September quarter.
Taking these factors into account, our outlook for the September quarter is as follows: we expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion, plus or minus 5%; non-GAAP gross margin to be relatively flat sequentially; non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, plus or minus 5%.
While the macro environment continues disrupt near-term demand, we expect exabyte volumes to meaningfully grow. Over the long term, our focus on cash generation and a solid balance sheet will provide us the financial strength to capitalize on future storage growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

But I'll describe the market dynamics, and then I'll let Gianluca do a walk on specific impacts if that's more helpful. 
I don't think we should underestimate disruptions in the market from a demand perspective that we saw in Q4 and continue to see ramifications of in Q1. There's a lot of supply that was pushed into the market, I think, into channels that are not necessarily tied to revenue quickly, and that's partly because people are buying things in anticipation of maybe supply disruptions that didn't happen. 
And I think those factors have actually played into the quarter-over-quarter compare and may even be a little part of underutilization as well, just as we try to tie those things back together. Because, as you know, we like to build only with the customers that absolutely need, and those disruptions have impacted us. 
I think if I step to the very high level of the industry and looked at revenue per terabyte, you can see the revenue per terabytes going down quite a bit. Now some of that's the transition to higher-capacity drives and some of it's fact that the cloud is still not fully turned on, but you can see that competitive progress there. 
How do we get out of it and when? As to your question, that's when we can go draw at cost per terabyte, and the biggest product that we have coming there that's going to be impactful with 16s as well. 
But I'll let Gianluca do the walk as well."

So in terms of underutilization cost, in this Q4, we still had about 100 basis point of gross margin that we lost due to underutilization. The overall gross margin was fairly well aligned to our guidance. And as you know, even in EPS, we are actually",370,"Yes. So in terms of underutilization cost, in this Q4, we still had about 100 basis point of gross margin that we lost due to underutilization. The overall gross margin was fairly well aligned to our guidance. And as you know, even in EPS, we are actually higher than the midpoint of our guidance. So I don't know if the expectation was to have a much higher gross margins for F Q4. 
In F Q1, you will see have some underutilization cost impacting the gross margin, less than in F Q4 but still probably 50, 60 basis points. So as Dave said, it's not really related to the 16 terabyte, specifically, but we are adding capacity to our manufacturing capabilities because of our expectation of much higher volume coming in the next few quarters. So until we ramp all our production and fulfill the factories, we will have some underutilization cost. 
And as Dave said, there is also some pricing pressure in the market that is keeping gross margin maybe a little bit lower than what you are expecting. 
And maybe -- let me take the opportunity to talk about also EPS for F Q1. So we guided $0.90, plus or minus 5%. There are several items that will impact EPS in Q1 in different directions. So first of all, we will have the positive impact of higher revenue. It's a similar gross margin, as we guided. We also have a positive impact from excluding share-based compensation's starting F Q1 in order to be better aligned to our competitors and the normal prices in the industry. 
And then we have the couple of negative impact. One is OpEx because F Q1 is a 14-week quarter, we will have about $20 million, $25 million higher OpEx in the quarter, and we also have higher OpEx due to the variable compensation. So that is probably another $20 million. 
Finally, we also have lower interest income because we redeemed our investment in Toshiba. As you know, that investment was generating about $20 million of interest income that we will not have in F Q1. So it is how probably you can reconsolidate the $0.86 in F Q4 to the $0.90 in F Q1."

So that's a platform we've been out selling to our customers, getting them to align to -- getting them to align on the ramps and so on. 
So to your point, especially when the market is relatively soft for nearline, we've been down -- it's actually starting to pick back up as we talked about, but it's not -- still not up to full speed, and you can see that versus where we were, say, a year ago when things were really hot. 
We don't -- we want to make sure we don't push the wrong drives out there. So from our perspective, let's not overbuild, say, for example, on 12s or 10s, and push those into slots that, ultimately, the customers maybe they don't want for their long-term TCO proposition. They're going to be putting these data centers up and running drives for 5, 7 years. So the TCO proposition for the 16 is huge. 
We don't want to be temporarily going after that. So if you call that share loss or something like that, that's fine. That's not a metric we're really managing on to your point."

We're investing to be able to hit the peaks of those cycles, better to your point, and then I think there's competition as well, which is -- to my commentary about revenue per terabyte. We need to get cost per terabyte down, but we also have to realize that revenue per terabyte is coming down fairly aggressively as we moved. 
So all these things factor in. Over a longer period of time, the margin range serves as a guide for how much we want to invest, where we think we are going to go, and I think if you look over the entire fiscal year, to your point, you saw a peak and a valley, if you will. We think there's another peak coming as well, exactly to your point. 
So if we -- I think if we get to the top end of the range again, we earned it, and we would also -- I would also -- I would always ask the team, though, kind of end quarter if we have the opportunity to go grab dollars.

I think there are some smaller customers who have very high-performance workloads who are really pushing for this technology. And there are some smaller divisions of cloud service providers because of everything. All cloud service providers are not created equal, and many have different workloads. 
So where this technology is immediately applicable is a subset. I think the technology, over time, becomes much more important. And I would think about it as above 20 terabytes. There -- you just can't continue to have bigger drives all behind one actuator at a relative apps per terabyte streaming speed that's less if that makes sense. So we need to go to this technology. 
I think it'll be competitive, and I think we're being driven very hard for it, but I also think it -- since we're providing so much more value, if we happen to outcompete, it should be good for us. I think the other interesting about the technology is everything I just said about the cloud. It's very applicable back into the edge data centers, which are, right now, starved for that value, I think, from a lower-cost-per-terabyte perspective but also from a performance perspective. And then the rest of the edge is also, if we talk about surveillance drives or something, we're getting driven for multiple streams of surveillance drive. 
So the technology is probably relevant there, too, but I just want to be very upfront and say that the first instantiation now that we're shipping these products is going to be -- the early adopters, if you will, are going to be more [ nichey ] for a while."

And some of these markets are still -- without -- with minimal investment, the free cash flow is still quite good. The operating margin's still quite good. As a matter of fact, I would argue that today, the competitor, if you will, that you just talked about being flash drives or something like that are not as good. So -- but there's a reality of the market space. 
So we're not really investing a lot in those spaces. We'll continue to run them over the long haul and think about them as how do we generate free cash flow. There will be disruptions in some of those spaces, and we can forecast that over time. But I think we have to be careful because the tail is actually quite long as well. 
I'll just pick on PCs for a second because a lot of people like to talk about it. From my perspective, from a hard drive perspective, PCs -- the interesting one for hard drives, they already have dual drives in them, so it's actually a longer tail. And there's a reason why the HDDs and the SSDs in there, and so I don't really think of it as per se an either/or.

So from my perspective, it's going to be a bigger and bigger portion, and the leverage that we get because we're doing fewer drive types than before, I think, we'll get relatively better payoff. 
If I think about the large part of the driver for exabyte growth, it's the fact that we're getting higher capacity points, 16s versus 10 in the last peak of the last cycle. And I am not saying that the hard drive size is the primary driver of that. I think there are many drivers, but I think that's the biggest thing driving us near term.
Longer term, to your point, if I think about enterprise, the cloud will continue to grow. The cloud will continue to cycle through some of their existing footprint and upgrade as well, but I think data is still going to grow on the cloud. I think the other interesting topic that we have going on right now is that in the on-prem data centers, data is being repatriated, but there's a market difference in the cost between the cloud and the on-prem. 
And what we're seeing is lot of people in the on-prem arena have focused on high-performance storage, and that's fine. It's going to be a lot of needs for compute there, and the high-performance storage or high-performance memory, if you will, needs to be very close to that compute. 
But in order to -- with the extreme data growth that's going on, in order to have enterprise growth in those places, you're going to need cost-effective solutions, vis-à-vis the cloud. So we'd see a great opportunity there.

There are other people who you can tell that data is growing against their application, and they want to continue to invest, but they wait for the right architectural decisions. Sometimes, it's hard drives capacity point. Sometimes, it has to do with other architectures that are going on. 
So it's hard to point -- to paint the cloud with a uniform brush because there's so many different applications and strategies that are going on. But I do think the overall data growth is very consistent, and that's what drives that period is that we're referring to. 
A little wider and deeper this time, maybe, I think, and certainly, it has felt like that in the last 6 months. And I think what I said 1.5 years ago was that geographically we're starting to see enough diversity that maybe it wouldn't be as deep.

The cloud and surveillance markets. Surveillance used to have a little bit of seasonality. I think it's been a little disrupted. So I would say, it's aseasonal; and the cloud, certainly, is aseasonal. It goes through different patterns because the spikes that we talked about. 
With all these things considered, though, just looking at the data growth, the total data growth over the last few years, we think, FY '19, exactly to your point, people have been very conservative.

Afterwards, Gianluca will provide further details on our financial results and our outlook for the December quarter. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Let's start to the fiscal year, increasing revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, earnings per share, cash flow quarter-over-quarter. Our focus on optimizing profit dollars is driving strong and sustainable operating cash flow to fund our future growth, extend our technology leadership and sustain our strong capital return program.
Over the past 12 months, we have returned a total of $2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our ongoing commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Our Board approved an increase to our quarterly dividend, demonstrating their confidence in our future growth and cash generation capabilities. This marks the first time in 4 years that we've raised our dividend. Moving forward, we plan to review the dividend payment consistently over time.
Let me now share some perspectives on the near-term market environment, starting with mass capacity storage. This market is growing, both in terms of dollars and exabytes and is comprised of nearline, video and image applications including surveillance and Madras. The mass capacity storage market supports cloud and edge applications that are data centric and require reliable, cost-effective, high capacity storage best suited to HDDs.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in nearline. Supported by improving demand across cloud and hyperscale customers. We are aggressively ramping our 16-terabyte nearline drives to fulfill strong customer demand for these products. With more than a dozen cloud and OEM customers qualified and several others underway, we are executing very well and are tracking to plan against our product maturity and customer qualification times. Based on our current outlook, we expect to ship more than 1 million drives in the December quarter, which would make 16 terabytes, the fastest nearline product ramp in Seagate's history.
Revenue from video and image applications declined in the September quarter following an unusually strong June period. Geopolitical tensions and regulatory hurdles continue to disrupt the customers' typical buying patterns across most of all markets, including surveillance. We expect some demand volatility to persist over the near term.
With the transition to IT 4.0 we see the emergence of edge storage applications, which like surveillance, utilize high-definition video and image processing. For example, smart factories, smart cities and IoT all require large amounts of data, which can benefit from low cost, high reliability disk drives. We believe these video and image processing applications continue to represent meaningful growth opportunities for Seagate over the long term.
In our legacy markets, which include mission-critical desktop, notebook, DVR, gaming and consumer applications, we saw a seasonal uptick in revenue in the September quarter. As we've shared in the past, these markets contribute to Seagate's cash flow while requiring little additional investment. Importantly, many of the enterprise customers and OEM partners that we are supporting in the legacy markets are the same ones we expect to create new storage growth opportunities at the edge and in private clouds, along with other new customers.
With the trend towards a multi-cloud world and the build-out of the private cloud, customers are seeking to follow the same economical centric storage architectures at the large public cloud providers. Low cost, high-density storage platforms are an integral part of the solution to address data-rich workload requirement, and Seagate's high-density scalable system solutions are ideally suited to these big data applications.
We believe Seagate's strong technology road map, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships make us well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunities we foresee ahead. We forecast the mass capacity storage revenue TAM will more than double from current levels by 2025, supported by ongoing demand from the public cloud to build-out of the private cloud and emerging end storage applications.
To capture this growing demand, we are executing our strategy to be first to introduce new product solutions to the market and consistently deliver cost and performance benefits to our customers. Today, Seagate is the only company mass producing 16-terabyte drives, which are the capacity benchmark for the industry. We are preparing to ship 18-terabyte drives in the first half of calendar year 2020, to maintain our industry capacity leadership. We are also driving aerial density leadership with our revolutionary HAMR technology, which enables Seagate to achieve at least 20% aerial density CAGR over the next decade. We remain on track to ship 20-terabyte HAMR drives in late calendar year 2020.
As drive densities increase, multi-actuator technologies required to maintain fast access to data and scale drive capacity without compromising performance. We generated revenue from our MACH.2 Dual Actuator solutions for the first time in the September quarter. We are working with multiple customers to qualify these drives, including a leading U.S. hyperscale customer who is qualifying the technology to meet their rigorous service level agreements without having to employ costly hardware upgrades. We expect to see demand for Dual Actuator technology to increase as customers transition to drive capacities above 20 terabytes.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our September quarter results and share our outlook for the December quarter."
3738520,639832622,1849905,"Seagate Technology plc, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2019",2019-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thank you, Dave. We executed well in the fourth quarter growing revenue, operating income and operating cash flow to support strong return for our shareholders. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 9% to $2.58 billion, above our guidance midpo",1173,"Thank you, Dave. We executed well in the fourth quarter growing revenue, operating income and operating cash flow to support strong return for our shareholders. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 9% to $2.58 billion, above our guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.03 at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was underpinned by improving demand for mass capacity storage. So the reserve shipments increased 16% quarter-over-quarter to 98 exabytes, driven largely by our nearline products. Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes the nearline and mission-critical drives, representing 45% of total September quarter revenue, up from 41% in the June quarter.
Next achievements into the enterprise market increased 34% sequentially to 51 exabyte, with nearline drives, representing the vast majority of that total. Average capacity at nearline drives increased 10% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the ongoing transition to higher capacity volumes.
Our 16-terabyte drive was the fastest-growing nearline product, both in terms of revenue and exabyte. We anticipate strong and for these products across cloud, hyperscale and OEM partners, and expect 16 terabytes to be our highest enterprise revenue product in fiscal Q2 and our largest company revenue contributor in fiscal Q3, ahead of our prior expectation to meet this milestone in the fiscal Q4 time frame.
Revenue and exabyte for our mission-critical drives were sequentially higher in the September quarter. We continue to service customer demand for these performance drives, which has remained fairly consistent over the past several quarters. Revenue for the edge non-compute market, representing 31% of total September quarter revenue. Compared with 34% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipment remained flat at 33 exabyte quarter-over-quarter as non-compute is comprised of surveillance and gaming, TVs and consumer applications.
As noted on our prior call, I used surveillance accelerated demand into the June quarter, which resulted in slightly lower revenue in the quarter. As Dave mentioned earlier, applications such as surveillance, which utilize high-definition video and image processing continue to be a meaningful growth opportunity for Seagate moving forward.
Revenue from the Edge compute market, including desktop and contributed 17% of total revenue compared to 18% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments increased 7% sequentially to 15 exabyte, reflecting seasonal demand for both desktop and drive.
Aligned with what we presented during our recent Analyst Day we will change how we present our HDD business. Starting in the December quarter, we will break out revenue and exabyte shipment in 2 primary categories. Mass capacity storage and negative market. Mass capacity is made up of nearline, either an image application and not. This represents growing market that support data-centric applications requiring high capacity, low-cost storage HDD. Our standard HDD products are sold in late demand. Mass capacity sold has been increasing as a percentage of our total revenue and contributed 47% of September quarter revenue compared with 35% just 2 years ago. We expect this growth trend to continue over the next few years. The legacy market made up 46% of total September quarter revenue.
Our non-HDD business made up the remaining 7% of revenue, with growth from both systems and SSD solutions, adding revenue, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to gain traction in our system business with OEMs and other customers.
Within our SSD business, the pricing environment has been challenging for multiple quarters. Our main focus has been on enterprise SSDs, which complements our mass capacity HDD solution to provide our customers with a more complete storage solution portfolio. We remain focused on servicing those of the market where Seagate can deliver value to our customers. As a reminder, we are sending the useful lives of our capital agreement from a range of 3 to 5 years to a range of 3 to 7 years, which resulted from a more efficient use of capital. This change lower September quarter depreciation at approximately $23 million, a matter of which was included in cost of goods sold.
Accounting for this change non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was approximately flat with the prior period at about 27%. On top of the challenging industry conditions we discussed over the last few quarters. Incurred higher-than-expected costs associated with the initial ramp of our new products, which impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. Looking ahead, we expect margins to improve as production scales and 16-terabyte drives become a more meaningful part of our total revenue.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the 14-week quarter, came in lower than planned at $359 million. Discretionary costs and costs associated with the extra week were both lower than our original outlook. We are continuing to efficiently manage expenses and optimize profitability.
In the September quarter, we expanded non-GAAP operating income to $329 million or approximately 13% of revenue. We expect to see financial leverage as we grow revenue and execute our road map to reduce cost per tailback. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.03, which was at the high end of our guidance range.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $147 million, representing about 6% of September quarter revenue. The expense CapEx for the fiscal year to be near the midpoint of our target range of 6% to 8% of revenue to support our external capacity expansion plans and preparing for the ramp of our HAMR technology.
We delivered at free cash flow of $309 million, up 4% sequentially. We utilized $450 million to retire 9.2 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 263 million shares outstanding, down 8% from the prior year. Through a combination of opportunistic share repurchases and dividends, we returned $620 million to shareholders in the quarter. And we are adding during the Analyst Day, our Board approved a 3% increase to our quarterly dividend payment to $0.65 per share, visible on January 8, 2020. This increase reflects our positive long-term demand outlook as well as our confidence in sustainable cash generation.
We have also been focused on further improving our balance sheet. During the September quarter, we successfully marketed a $500 million 6-year term loan to restructure a portion of our debt. Through these efforts, we extended leverage debt maturity profile over annual interest expenses by $13 million and reduced total debt to $4.1 billion. As of the end of September, cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 billion, with access to up to $1.5 billion available to our revolver.
Looking ahead to our outlook for the December quarter. We expect total revenues to be in the range of $2.72 billion, plus or minus 5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be above the midpoint of our long-term target range of 13% to 16% of revenue driven by top line growth and improved gross margin, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.32, plus or minus 5%.
Overall, we are executing very well. And while we continue to face geopolitical challenges, we believe improving industry demand, combined with the ramp of our 16-terabyte drives. The current formation for revenue and profitability growth in the fiscal year 2020.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

We are generating sustainable cash flow and directing capital towards areas that provide the greatest return for all of our stakeholders. We are successfully scaling exabyte capacity and executing the company's fastest ever production ramp on a nearline drive at 16 terabytes. We are on track to introduce HAMR and MAC.2 Dual Actuator technologies to drive aerial density and scale performance with capacity to deliver lower total cost of ownership to our customers over the next decade.
While we are mindful of global macro uncertainties and the recent industry dynamics, we remain focused on delivering value for all of our stakeholders by executing our technology road map and optimizing profitability and free cash flow. We continue to expect revenue and profitability to grow in fiscal 2020, with the second half projected to be somewhat stronger than the first, supported by our 16-terabyte ramp and improving mass capacity storage demand.
Through our ongoing execution, leading technology road map and deep customer relationships, Seagate is well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunities in mass capacity storage.
Before opening the call for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their contributions to the ongoing success of our business. Gianluca and I will now take your questions."

If I could ask your question on gross margins, which I know the message today and on your Analyst Day has been around operating margins. But one of your competitors this week alluded to some pricing pressure in nearline, do you think that pricing pressure will get worse before it gets better? Do you think pricing is the main reason why maybe we haven't seen an inflection yet their margins, or gross margins, that is, despite higher levels of enterprise mix? And maybe more importantly, though, as we continue to push the arrow density curve and you certainly can leverage the additional capital required to pursue this greater complexity of heads of disks in the high-capacity points, why can't margins push toward that for handle?"

I'll let Gianluca, elaborate on the impact of the ram costs that you mentioned in the script. But first, just let me say that in our business, to your point, gross margin is a function of supply and demand is very specific to the demand for the products that you have. And for the last few quarters, exabyte demand was relatively weak. I mean, if I go back 3 quarters ago, we sense that this was happening. We made conscious decisions to throttle builds, managed cash inventory really carefully. And also start converting production to the new platform. So by the way, the new platforms are not just the 16-terabyte, but we have continued ramp of various cost reductions for other products across the portfolio. So demand is definitely picking up, that's why one of the reasons why we're confident. The strength of the demand will go through the back half of this fiscal year, I think, and potentially, even further than that. So we feel like calendar year '20 is very -- is a lot stronger than calendar year '19. And with new products, I'm confident we'll get into the OpEx model range that we talked about. Quite quickly, that's why Gianluca mentioned that we'd be above the midpoint of our long-term operating range in Q2, than what we driving to your point.

And that was generating underutilization charges that was higher, let's say, 3 quarters ago, and they're starting to reduce. During this period of time, we were still adding CapEx, giving us the opportunity for even a higher capacity when we were ready to take benefit from that. Right now, we have strong demand. So we are ramping hard, especially our 16-terabyte, but also other products on lower capacity. When we run so fast, sometimes you have additional cost, a little bit lower yield, a little bit of additional spread. We had a little bit of those impacts in F Q1, we don't expect that to happen again in Q2 and after that. So we expect margins, in general, so gross margin and operating margin to improve as in Q2."

And I think part of the issue that you might see with other companies, I don't want to speculate too much, but the issues you might see if you're qualified on 1 part of an architecture and also that architecture gets delayed for whatever reason, it can be impactful. I think, generally speaking, some componentry in hard drives are in there as well, tend to be fairly broad-based, although, for example, we may have an 8-terabyte drive qualified on 1 architectural point and that doesn't move as fast. So it's not like the entire fleet transitions at the same time. These customers have complex, not only supply chains but also problems themselves. And I'm speaking globally as well as the bigger the world gets, the more -- there's some of these inherent inhibitions to transitions. They have to make sure they test them against more complex sets. So it's not surprising to me that from time to time that you could see 1 architecture affecting you.

Good morning, everyone, and for those of you here in Europe, good afternoon. Thanks for joining us.

Good morning, everyone, and for those of you here in Europe, good afternoon. Thanks for joining us. I will start today's call by summarizing key highlights from the September quarter, sharing our views on the market and their relevance to Seagate and outlining the progress we've made on our key priorities. Afterwards, Gianluca will provide further details on our financial results and our outlook for the December quarter. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate had a solid start to the fiscal year, increasing revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, earnings per share, cash flow quarter-over-quarter. Our focus on optimizing profit dollars is driving strong and sustainable operating cash flow to fund our future growth, extend our technology leadership and sustain our strong capital return program.
Over the past 12 months, we have returned a total of $2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our ongoing commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Our Board approved an increase to our quarterly dividend, demonstrating their confidence in our future growth and cash generation capabilities. This marks the first time in 4 years that we've raised our dividend. Moving forward, we plan to review the dividend payment consistently over time.
Let me now share some perspectives on the near-term market environment, starting with mass capacity storage. This market is growing, both in terms of dollars and exabytes and is comprised of nearline, video and image applications including surveillance and NAS drives. The mass capacity storage market supports cloud and edge applications that are data-centric and require reliable, cost-effective, high capacity storage best suited to HDDs.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in nearline, supported by improving demand across cloud and hyperscale customers. We are aggressively ramping our 16-terabyte nearline drives to fulfill strong customer demand for these products. With more than a dozen cloud and OEM customers qualified and several others underway, we are executing very well and are tracking to plan against our product maturity and customer qualification time lines. Based on our current outlook, we expect to ship more than 1 million drives in the December quarter, which would make 16 terabytes the fastest nearline product ramp in Seagate's history.
Revenue from video and image applications declined in the September quarter following an unusually strong June period. Geopolitical tensions and regulatory hurdles continue to disrupt the customers' typical buying patterns across multiple markets, including surveillance. We expect some demand volatility to persist over the near term.
With the transition to IT 4.0, we see the emergence of edge storage applications, which like surveillance, utilize high-definition video and image processing. For example, smart factories, smart cities and IoT all require large amounts of data, which can benefit from low cost, high reliability disk drives. We believe these video and image processing applications continue to represent meaningful growth opportunities for Seagate over the long term.
In our legacy markets, which include mission-critical, desktop, notebook, DVR, gaming and consumer applications, we saw a seasonal uptick in revenue in the September quarter. As we've shared in the past, these markets contribute to Seagate's cash flow while requiring little additional investment. Importantly, many of the enterprise customers and OEM partners that we are supporting in the legacy markets are the same ones we expect to create new storage growth opportunities at the edge and in private clouds, along with other new customers.
With the trend towards a multi-cloud world and the build-out of the private cloud, customers are seeking to follow the same economical disk-centric storage architectures as the large public cloud providers. Low cost, high-density storage platforms are an integral part of the solution to address data-rich workload requirement, and Seagate's high-density scalable system solutions are ideally suited to these big data applications.
We believe Seagate's strong technology road map, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships make us well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunities we foresee ahead. We forecast the mass capacity storage revenue TAM will more than double from current levels by 2025, supported by ongoing demand from the public cloud to build-out of the private cloud and emerging edge storage applications.
To capture this growing demand, we are executing our strategy to be first to introduce new product solutions to the market and consistently deliver cost and performance benefits to our customers. Today, Seagate is the only company mass producing 16-terabyte drives, which are the capacity benchmark for the industry. We are preparing to ship 18-terabyte drives in the first half of calendar year 2020, to maintain our industry capacity leadership. We are also driving aerial density leadership with our revolutionary HAMR technology, which enables Seagate to achieve at least 20% aerial density CAGR over the next decade. We remain on track to ship 20-terabyte HAMR drives in late calendar year 2020.
As drive densities increase, multi-actuator technology is required to maintain fast access to data and scale drive capacity without compromising performance. We generated revenue from our MACH.2 dual actuator solutions for the first time in the September quarter. We are working with multiple customers to qualify these drives, including a leading U.S. hyperscale customer who is qualifying the technology to meet their rigorous service level agreements without having to employ costly hardware upgrades. We expect to see demand for dual actuator technology to increase as customers transition to drive capacities above 20 terabytes.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our September quarter results and share our outlook for the December quarter."
3738520,639832622,1850313,"Seagate Technology plc, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2019",2019-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thank you, Dave. We executed well in the first quarter, growing revenue, operating income and operating cash flow to support strong return for our shareholders. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 9% to $2.58 billion, above our guidance midpo",1187,"Thank you, Dave. We executed well in the first quarter, growing revenue, operating income and operating cash flow to support strong return for our shareholders. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 9% to $2.58 billion, above our guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.03, at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was underpinned by improving demand for mass capacity storage. Further, exabyte shipment increased 16% quarter-over-quarter to 98 exabytes, driven largely by our nearline products. Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical drives, represented 45% of total September quarter revenue, up from 41% in the June quarter.
Exabyte shipments into the enterprise market increased 34% sequentially to 51 exabytes, with nearline drives representing the vast majority of that total. Average capacity for nearline drives increased 10% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the ongoing transition to higher capacity volumes.
Our 16-terabyte drive was the fastest-growing nearline product, both in terms of revenue and exabyte. We anticipate strong demand for these products across cloud, hyperscale and OEM partners, and expect 16 terabytes to be our highest enterprise revenue product in fiscal Q2 and our largest company revenue contributor in fiscal Q3, ahead of our prior expectation to meet this milestone in the fiscal Q4 time frame.
Revenue and exabyte shipments for our mission-critical drives were sequentially higher in the September quarter. We continue to service customer demand for these performance drives, which has remained fairly consistent over the past several quarters. Revenue for the edge noncompute market, represented 31% of total September quarter revenue compared with 34% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments remained flat at 33 exabytes quarter-over-quarter. Edge noncompute is comprised of surveillance, NAS, gaming, DVR and consumer applications.
As noted on our prior call, a few surveillance customers accelerated demand into the June quarter, which resulted in slightly lower revenue in the quarter. As Dave mentioned earlier, applications such as surveillance, which utilize high-definition video and image processing continue to be a meaningful growth opportunity for Seagate moving forward.
Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook drives contributed 17% of total revenue compared to 18% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments increased 7% sequentially to 15 exabytes, reflecting seasonal demand for both desktop and notebook drives.
Aligned with what we presented during our recent Analyst Day, we will change how we present our HDD business. Starting in the December quarter, we will break out revenue and exabyte shipment in 2 primary categories, mass capacity storage and legacy market. Mass capacity is made up of nearline, video and image applications and NAS. This represents growing market that support data-centric applications requiring high capacity low-cost storage well-suited to HDD. Our other HDD products are sold into legacy market. Mass capacity storage has been increasing as a percentage of our total revenue and contributed 47% of September quarter revenue compared with 35% just 2 years ago. We expect this growth trend to continue over the next few years. The legacy market made up 46% of total September quarter revenue.
Our non-HDD business made up the remaining 7% of revenue, with growth from both system and SSD solutions, [ but adding ] non-hard disk drive revenue, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to gain traction in our system business with OEMs and other customers.
Within our SSD business, the pricing environment has been challenging for multiple quarters. Our main focus has been on enterprise SSDs, which complements our mass capacity HDD solution to provide our customers with a more complete storage solution portfolio. We remain focused on servicing those areas of the market where Seagate can deliver value to our customers. As a reminder, we're extending the [ useful life ] of our capital equipment from a range of 3 to 5 years to a range of 3 to 7 years, which resulted from a more efficient use of capital. This change lowered September quarter depreciation by approximately $23 million, a majority of which was included in cost of goods sold.
Accounting for this change, non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was approximately flat with the prior period at about 27%. On top of the challenging industry conditions we discussed over the last few quarters, we incurred higher-than-expected costs associated with the initial ramp of our new products, which impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. Looking ahead, we expect margins to improve as production scales and 16-terabyte drives become a more meaningful part of our total revenue.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the 14-week quarter, came in lower than planned at $359 million. Discretionary costs and costs associated with the extra week were both lower than our original outlook. We are continuing to efficiently manage expenses and optimize profitability.
In the September quarter, we expanded non-GAAP operating income to $329 million or approximately 13% of revenue. We expect to see financial leverage as we grow revenue and execute our road map to reduce cost per terabyte. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.03, which was at the high end of our guidance range.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $147 million, representing about 6% of September quarter revenue. We expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be near the midpoint of our target range of 6% to 8% of revenue to support our exabyte capacity expansion plans and prepare for the ramp of our HAMR technology.
We delivered healthy free cash flow of $309 million, up 4% sequentially. We utilized $450 million to retire 9.2 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 263 million shares outstanding, down 8% from the prior year. Through a combination of opportunistic share repurchases and dividends, we returned $620 million to shareholders in the quarter. As we [indiscernible] during the Analyst Day, our Board approved a 3% increase to our quarterly dividend payment to $0.65 per share, payable on January 8, 2020. This increase reflect our positive long-term demand outlook as well as our confidence in sustainable cash generation.
We have also been focused on further improving our balance sheet. During the September quarter, we successfully marketed a $500 million 6-year term loan to restructure a portion of our debt. Through these efforts, we extended leverage debt maturity profile, lowered annual interest expenses by $13 million and reduced total debt to $4.1 billion. As of the end of September, cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 billion, with access to up to $1.5 billion available through our revolver.
Looking ahead to our outlook for the December quarter, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $2.72 billion, plus or minus 5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be above the midpoint of our long-term target range of 13% to 16% of revenue, driven by top line growth and improved gross margin. And non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.32, plus or minus 5%.
Overall, we are executing very well. And while we continue to face geopolitical challenges, we believe improving industry demand combined with the ramp of our 16-terabyte drives, is the solid foundation for revenue and profitability growth in the fiscal year 2020.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

But one of your competitors this week alluded to some pricing pressure in nearline. Do you think that pricing pressure will get worse before it gets better? Do you think pricing is the main reason why maybe we haven't seen an inflection yet in your margins -- gross margins, that is, despite higher levels of enterprise mix? And maybe more importantly, though, as we continue to push the aerial density curve, and you certainly can leverage the additional capital required to pursue this greater complexity of heads and disks in the high-capacity points, why can't margins push toward that [indiscernible]?"

But first, just let me say that in our business, to your point, gross margin is a function of supply and demand. It's very specific to the demand for the products that you have. And for the last few quarters, exabyte demand was relatively weak. I mean, if I go back 3 quarters ago, we sensed that this was happening. We made conscious decisions to throttle builds, manage cash inventory really carefully. And then also start converting production to the new platform. So by the way, the new platforms are not just the 16-terabyte, but we have continued ramp of various cost reductions for other products across the portfolio. So demand is definitely picking up, that's one of the reasons why we're confident. The strength of the demand will go through the back half of this fiscal year, I think, and potentially, even further than that. So we feel like calendar year '20 is very -- is a lot stronger than calendar year '19.

So as we discussed in the previous earnings release call, we did not ramp all the production at full capacity in the last 2 or 3 quarters. And that was generating underutilization charges that was higher, let's say 3 quarters ago, and they're starting to reduce. During this period of time, we were still adding CapEx, giving us the opportunity for even higher capacity when we were ready to take benefit from that. Right now, we have strong demand. So we are ramping hard, especially our 16-terabyte, but also other products on lower capacities. When we ramp so fast, sometimes you have additional cost, a little bit lower yield, a little bit of additional spread. We had a little bit of those impacts in F Q1. We don't expect that to happen again in F Q2 and after that. So we expect margins in general, so gross margin and operating margin, to improve starting F Q2."

Exactly how we satisfy that end demand is still in question. And what's interesting about some of the global markets is they're really more what we call [ white van ] markets.

I think, generally speaking, some componentry, and hard drives are in there as well, tend to be fairly broad-based, although, for example, we may have an 8-terabyte drive qualified on 1 architectural point and that doesn't move as fast. So it's not like the entire fleet transitions at the same time. These customers have complex, not only supply chains, but also problem sets themselves. And I'm speaking globally as well. As the bigger the world gets, the more -- there's some of these inherent inhibitions to transitions. They have to make sure they test them against more complex sets. So it's not surprising to me that from time to time that you could see 1 architecture affecting you. But I think most of the demand that we see across exabytes is broad-based across architectures.

There is some indication that there's -- to the point I made earlier about the complexity that some of the global partners have to qualify new products and things like that, we think that there's a little bit of an urge around that, but obviously, suggest that even though it might be later, it suggests a higher demand, to get back to the point of 18 months ago when the demand was very high. So that's one of the reasons we feel comfortable about the demand cycle. I think what we talked about was the 16-terabyte is on plan to slightly ahead of plan. So happy with the qualifications across more than a dozen OEMs now. We shipped those first drives in April, remember, so there's been a lot of work to get here. The qualifications have run very well, customer demand is high and that's where we get more bullish."

Good morning, everyone, and for those of you here in Europe, good afternoon. Thanks for joining us. I will start today's call by summarizing key highlights from the September quarter, sharing our views on the market and their relevance to Seagate and outlining the progress we've made on our key priorities. Afterwards, Gianluca will provide further details on our financial results and our outlook for the December quarter. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate had a solid start to the fiscal year, increasing revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, earnings per share, cash flow quarter-over-quarter. Our focus on optimizing profit dollars is driving strong and sustainable operating cash flow to fund our future growth, extend our technology leadership and sustain our strong capital return program.
Over the past 12 months, we have returned a total of $2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our ongoing commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Our Board approved an increase to our quarterly dividend, demonstrating their confidence in our future growth and cash generation capabilities. This marks the first time in 4 years that we've raised our dividend. Moving forward, we plan to review the dividend payment consistently over time.
Let me now share some perspectives on the near-term market environment, starting with mass capacity storage. This market is growing, both in terms of dollars and exabytes and is comprised of nearline, video and image applications including surveillance and NAS drives. The mass capacity storage market supports cloud and edge applications that are data-centric and require reliable, cost-effective, high capacity storage best suited to HDDs.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in nearline, supported by improving demand across cloud and hyperscale customers. We are aggressively ramping our 16-terabyte nearline drives to fulfill strong customer demand for these products. With more than a dozen cloud and OEM customers qualified and several others underway, we are executing very well and are tracking to plan against our product maturity and customer qualification time lines. Based on our current outlook, we expect to ship more than 1 million drives in the December quarter, which would make 16 terabytes the fastest nearline product ramp in Seagate's history.
Revenue from video and image applications declined in the September quarter following an unusually strong June period. Geopolitical tensions and regulatory hurdles continue to disrupt the customers' typical buying patterns across multiple markets, including surveillance. We expect some demand volatility to persist over the near term.
With the transition to IT 4.0, we see the emergence of edge storage applications, which like surveillance, utilize high-definition video and image processing. For example, smart factories, smart cities and IoT all require large amounts of data, which can benefit from low cost, high reliability disk drives. We believe these video and image processing applications continue to represent meaningful growth opportunities for Seagate over the long term.
In our legacy markets, which include mission-critical, desktop, notebook, DVR, gaming and consumer applications, we saw a seasonal uptick in revenue in the September quarter. As we've shared in the past, these markets contribute to Seagate's cash flow while requiring little additional investment. Importantly, many of the enterprise customers and OEM partners that we are supporting in the legacy markets are the same ones we expect to create new storage growth opportunities at the edge and in private clouds, along with other new customers.
With the trend towards a multi-cloud world and the build-out of the private cloud, customers are seeking to follow the same economical disk-centric storage architectures as the large public cloud providers. Low cost, high-density storage platforms are an integral part of the solution to address data-rich workload requirement, and Seagate's high-density scalable system solutions are ideally suited to these big data applications.
We believe Seagate's strong technology road map, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships make us well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunities we foresee ahead. We forecast the mass capacity storage revenue TAM will more than double from current levels by 2025, supported by ongoing demand from the public cloud to build-out of the private cloud and emerging edge storage applications.
To capture this growing demand, we are executing our strategy to be first to introduce new product solutions to the market and consistently deliver cost and performance benefits to our customers. Today, Seagate is the only company mass producing 16-terabyte drives, which are the capacity benchmark for the industry. We are preparing to ship 18-terabyte drives in the first half of calendar year 2020, to maintain our industry capacity leadership. We are also driving aerial density leadership with our revolutionary HAMR technology, which enables Seagate to achieve at least 20% aerial density CAGR over the next decade. We remain on track to ship 20-terabyte HAMR drives in late calendar year 2020.
As drive densities increase, multi-actuator technology is required to maintain fast access to data and scale drive capacity without compromising performance. We generated revenue from our MACH.2 dual actuator solutions for the first time in the September quarter. We are working with multiple customers to qualify these drives, including a leading U.S. hyperscale customer who is qualifying the technology to meet their rigorous service level agreements without having to employ costly hardware upgrades. We expect to see demand for dual actuator technology to increase as customers transition to drive capacities above 20 terabytes.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our September quarter results and share our outlook for the December quarter."

We executed well in the first quarter, growing revenue, operating income and operating cash flow to support strong return for our shareholders. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 9% to $2.58 billion, above our guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.03, at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was underpinned by improving demand for mass capacity storage. Further, exabyte shipments increased 16% quarter-over-quarter to 98 exabytes, driven largely by our nearline products. Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical drives, represented 45% of total September quarter revenue, up from 41% in the June quarter.
Exabyte shipments into the enterprise market increased 34% sequentially to 51 exabytes, with nearline drives representing the vast majority of that total. Average capacity for nearline drives increased 10% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the ongoing transition to higher capacity volumes.
Our 16-terabyte drive was the fastest-growing nearline product, both in terms of revenue and exabyte. We anticipate strong demand for these products across cloud, hyperscale and OEM partners, and expect 16 terabytes to be our highest enterprise revenue product in fiscal Q2 and our largest company revenue contributor in fiscal Q3, ahead of our prior expectation to meet this milestone in the fiscal Q4 time frame.
Revenue and exabyte shipments for our mission-critical drives were sequentially higher in the September quarter. We continue to service customer demand for these performance drives, which has remained fairly consistent over the past several quarters. Revenue for the edge noncompute market, represented 31% of total September quarter revenue compared with 34% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments remained flat at 33 exabytes quarter-over-quarter. Edge noncompute is comprised of surveillance, NAS, gaming, DVR and consumer applications.
As noted on our prior call, a few surveillance customers accelerated demand into the June quarter, which resulted in slightly lower revenue in the quarter. As Dave mentioned earlier, applications such as surveillance, which utilize high-definition video and image processing continue to be a meaningful growth opportunity for Seagate moving forward.
Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook drives contributed 17% of total revenue compared to 18% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments increased 7% sequentially to 15 exabytes, reflecting seasonal demand for both desktop and notebook drives.
Aligned with what we presented during our recent Analyst Day, we will change how we present our HDD business. Starting in the December quarter, we will break out revenue and exabyte shipment in 2 primary categories, mass capacity storage and legacy market. Mass capacity is made up of nearline, video and image applications and NAS. This represents growing market that support data-centric applications requiring high capacity low-cost storage well-suited to HDD. Our other HDD products are sold into legacy market. Mass capacity storage has been increasing as a percentage of our total revenue and contributed 47% of September quarter revenue compared with 35% just 2 years ago. We expect this growth trend to continue over the next few years. The legacy market made up 46% of total September quarter revenue.
Our non-HDD business made up the remaining 7% of revenue, with growth from both system and SSD solutions, [ but adding ] non-hard disk drive revenue, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to gain traction in our system business with OEMs and other customers.
Within our SSD business, the pricing environment has been challenging for multiple quarters. Our main focus has been on enterprise SSDs, which complements our mass capacity HDD solution to provide our customers with a more complete storage solution portfolio. We remain focused on servicing those areas of the market where Seagate can deliver value to our customers. As a reminder, we're extending the [ useful life ] of our capital equipment from a range of 3 to 5 years to a range of 3 to 7 years, which resulted from a more efficient use of capital. This change lowered September quarter depreciation by approximately $23 million, a majority of which was included in cost of goods sold.
Accounting for this change, non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was approximately flat with the prior period at about 27%. On top of the challenging industry conditions we discussed over the last few quarters, we incurred higher-than-expected costs associated with the initial ramp of our new products, which impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. Looking ahead, we expect margins to improve as production scales and 16-terabyte drives become a more meaningful part of our total revenue.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the 14-week quarter, came in lower than planned at $359 million. Discretionary costs and costs associated with the extra week were both lower than our original outlook. We are continuing to efficiently manage expenses and optimize profitability.
In the September quarter, we expanded non-GAAP operating income to $329 million or approximately 13% of revenue. We expect to see financial leverage as we grow revenue and execute our road map to reduce cost per terabyte. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.03, which was at the high end of our guidance range.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $147 million, representing about 6% of September quarter revenue. Expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be near the midpoint of our target range of 6% to 8% of revenue to support our exabyte capacity expansion plans and prepare for the ramp of our HAMR technology.
We delivered healthy free cash flow of $309 million, up 4% sequentially. We utilized $450 million to retire 9.2 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 263 million shares outstanding, down 8% from the prior year. Through a combination of opportunistic share repurchases and dividends, we returned $620 million to shareholders in the quarter. As we announced during the Analyst Day, our Board approved a 3% increase to our quarterly dividend payment to $0.65 per share, payable on January 8, 2020. This increase reflect our positive long-term demand outlook as well as our confidence in sustainable cash generation.
We have also been focused on further improving our balance sheet. During the September quarter, we successfully marketed a $500 million 6-year term loan to restructure a portion of our debt. Through these efforts, we extended leverage debt maturity profile, lowered annual interest expenses by $13 million and reduced total debt to $4.1 billion. As of the end of September, cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 billion, with access to up to $1.5 billion available through our revolver.
Looking ahead to our outlook for the December quarter, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $2.72 billion, plus or minus 5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be above the midpoint of our long-term target range of 13% to 16% of revenue, driven by top line growth and improved gross margin. And non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.32, plus or minus 5%.
Overall, we are executing very well. And while we continue to face geopolitical challenges, we believe improving industry demand combined with the ramp of our 16-terabyte drives, is the solid foundation for revenue and profitability growth in the fiscal year 2020.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

In summary, Seagate is consistently delivering solid performance and advancing our key business initiatives. We are generating sustainable cash flow and directing capital towards areas that provide the greatest return for all of our stakeholders. We are successfully scaling exabyte capacity and executing the company's fastest ever production ramp on a nearline drive at 16 terabytes. We are on track to introduce HAMR and MACH.2 dual actuator technologies to drive aerial density and scale performance with capacity to deliver lower total cost of ownership to our customers over the next decade.
While we are mindful of global macro uncertainties and the recent industry dynamics, we remain focused on delivering value for all of our stakeholders by executing our technology road map and optimizing profitability and free cash flow. We continue to expect revenue and profitability to grow in fiscal 2020, with the second half projected to be somewhat stronger than the first, supported by our 16-terabyte ramp and improving mass capacity storage demand.
Through our ongoing execution, leading technology road map and deep customer relationships, Seagate is well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunities in mass capacity storage.
Before opening the call for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their contributions to the ongoing success of our business. 
Gianluca and I will now take your questions."

Do you think pricing is the main reason why maybe we haven't seen an inflection yet in your margins -- gross margins, that is, despite higher levels of enterprise mix?

I'll let Gianluca elaborate on the impact to the ramp costs that he mentioned in the script. But first, just let me say that in our business, to your point, gross margin is a function of supply and demand. It's very specific to the demand for the products that you have. And for the last few quarters, exabyte demand was relatively weak. I mean, if I go back 3 quarters ago, we sensed that this was happening. We made conscious decisions to throttle builds, manage cash inventory really carefully. And then also start converting production to the new platform. So by the way, the new platforms are not just the 16-terabyte, but we have continued ramp of various cost reductions for other products across the portfolio. So demand is definitely picking up, that's one of the reasons why we're confident. The strength of the demand will go through the back half of this fiscal year, I think, and potentially, even further than that. So we feel like calendar year '20 is very -- is a lot stronger than calendar year '19. And with new products, I'm confident we'll get into that [ OpEx ] model range that we talked about, quite quickly. That's why Gianluca mentioned that we'd be above the midpoint of our long-term operating range in Q2 than what we drive it. To your point, I think gross margins will rise with all those dynamics.

During this period of time, we were still adding CapEx, giving us the opportunity for even higher capacity when we were ready to take benefit from that. Right now, we have strong demand. So we are ramping hard, especially our 16-terabyte, but also other products on lower capacities. When we ramp so fast, sometimes you have additional cost, a little bit lower yield, a little bit of additional spread. We had a little bit of those impacts in F Q1. We don't expect that to happen again in F Q2 and after that. So we expect margins in general, so gross margin and operating margin, to improve starting F Q2."

The bigger the world gets, the more -- there's some of these inherent inhibitions to transitions. They have to make sure they test them against more complex sets. So it's not surprising to me that from time to time that you could see 1 architecture affecting you. But I think most of the demand that we see across exabytes is broad-based across architectures. That's what drives our confidence."

And then the quarter after that is the seasonally weakest quarter, but we think that there's such strength that's why we're so confident in our back half revenue numbers that I made reference to earlier. There's also a fairly large transition that will happen between people who -- exactly to the earlier question, that people who were on 8s or 12s or 14s and may transition to 16s or 18s some time way late next year. As all those transitions go up, the exabytes growth is very good. And so getting our stuff staged, again, is our top priority."

Good morning, everyone, and for those of you here in Europe, good afternoon. Thanks for joining us.

Good morning, everyone, and for those of you here in Europe, good afternoon. Thanks for joining us. I will start today's call by summarizing key highlights from the September quarter, sharing our views on the market and their relevance to Seagate and outlining the progress we've made on our key priorities. Afterwards, Gianluca will provide further details on our financial results and our outlook for the December quarter. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Seagate had a solid start to the fiscal year, increasing revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, earnings per share, cash flow quarter-over-quarter. Our focus on optimizing profit dollars is driving strong and sustainable operating cash flow to fund our future growth, extend our technology leadership and sustain our strong capital return program.
Over the past 12 months, we have returned a total of $2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our ongoing commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Our Board approved an increase to our quarterly dividend, demonstrating their confidence in our future growth and cash generation capabilities. This marks the first time in 4 years that we've raised our dividend. Moving forward, we plan to review the dividend payment consistently over time.
Let me now share some perspectives on the near-term market environment, starting with mass capacity storage. This market is growing, both in terms of dollars and exabytes and is comprised of nearline, video and image applications including surveillance and NAS drives. The mass capacity storage market supports cloud and edge applications that are data-centric and require reliable, cost-effective, high capacity storage best suited to HDDs.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in nearline, supported by improving demand across cloud and hyperscale customers. We are aggressively ramping our 16-terabyte nearline drives to fulfill strong customer demand for these products. With more than a dozen cloud and OEM customers qualified and several others underway, we are executing very well and are tracking to plan against our product maturity and customer qualification time lines. Based on our current outlook, we expect to ship more than 1 million drives in the December quarter, which would make 16 terabytes the fastest nearline product ramp in Seagate's history.
Revenue from video and image applications declined in the September quarter following an unusually strong June period. Geopolitical tensions and regulatory hurdles continue to disrupt the customers' typical buying patterns across multiple markets, including surveillance. We expect some demand volatility to persist over the near term.
With the transition to IT 4.0, we see the emergence of edge storage applications, which like surveillance, utilize high-definition video and image processing. For example, smart factories, smart cities and IoT all require large amounts of data, which can benefit from low cost, high-reliability disk drives. We believe these video and image processing applications continue to represent meaningful growth opportunities for Seagate over the long term.
In our legacy markets, which include mission-critical, desktop, notebook, DVR, gaming and consumer applications, we saw a seasonal uptick in revenue in the September quarter. As we've shared in the past, these markets contribute to Seagate's cash flow while requiring little additional investment. Importantly, many of the enterprise customers and OEM partners that we are supporting in the legacy markets are the same ones we expect to create new storage growth opportunities at the edge and in private clouds, along with other new customers.
With the trend towards a multicloud world and the build-out of the private cloud, customers are seeking to follow the same economical disk-centric storage architectures as the large public cloud providers. Low cost, high-density storage platforms are an integral part of the solution to address data-rich workload requirement, and Seagate's high-density scalable system solutions are ideally suited to these big data applications.
We believe Seagate's strong technology road map, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships make us well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunities we foresee ahead. We forecast the mass capacity storage revenue TAM will more than double from current levels by 2025, supported by ongoing demand from the public cloud to build-out of the private cloud and emerging edge storage applications.
To capture this growing demand, we are executing our strategy to be first to introduce new product solutions to the market and consistently deliver cost and performance benefits to our customers. Today, Seagate is the only company mass producing 16-terabyte drives, which are the capacity benchmark for the industry. We are preparing to ship 18-terabyte drives in the first half of calendar year 2020, to maintain our industry capacity leadership. We are also driving aerial density leadership with our revolutionary HAMR technology, which enables Seagate to achieve at least 20% aerial density CAGR over the next decade. We remain on track to ship 20-terabyte HAMR drives in late calendar year 2020.
As drive densities increase, multiactuator technology is required to maintain fast access to data and scale drive capacity without compromising performance. We generated revenue from our MACH.2 dual actuator solutions for the first time in the September quarter. We are working with multiple customers to qualify these drives, including a leading U.S. hyperscale customer who is qualifying the technology to meet their rigorous service level agreements without having to employ costly hardware upgrades. We expect to see demand for dual actuator technology to increase as customers transition to drive capacities above 20 terabytes.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our September quarter results and share our outlook for the December quarter."
3738520,639832622,1861031,"Seagate Technology plc, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2019",2019-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thank you, Dave. We executed well in the first quarter, growing revenue, operating income and operating cash flow to support strong return for our shareholders. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 9% to $2.58 billion, above our guidance midpo",1186,"Thank you, Dave. We executed well in the first quarter, growing revenue, operating income and operating cash flow to support strong return for our shareholders. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 9% to $2.58 billion, above our guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.03, at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was underpinned by improving demand for mass capacity storage. Further, exabyte shipments increased 16% quarter-over-quarter to 98 exabytes, driven largely by our nearline products. Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical drives, represented 45% of total September quarter revenue, up from 41% in the June quarter.
Exabyte shipments into the enterprise market increased 34% sequentially to 51 exabytes, with nearline drives representing the vast majority of that total. Average capacity for nearline drives increased 10% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the ongoing transition to higher capacity volumes.
Our 16-terabyte drive was the fastest-growing nearline product, both in terms of revenue and exabyte. We anticipate strong demand for these products across cloud, hyperscale and OEM partners, and expect 16 terabytes to be our highest enterprise revenue product in fiscal Q2 and our largest company revenue contributor in fiscal Q3, ahead of our prior expectation to meet this milestone in the fiscal Q4 time frame.
Revenue and exabyte shipments for our mission-critical drives were sequentially higher in the September quarter. We continue to service customer demand for these performance drives, which has remained fairly consistent over the past several quarters. Revenue for the edge noncompute market, represented 31% of total September quarter revenue compared with 34% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments remained flat at 33 exabytes quarter-over-quarter. Edge noncompute is comprised of surveillance, NAS, gaming, DVR and consumer applications.
As noted on our prior call, a few surveillance customers accelerated demand into the June quarter, which resulted in slightly lower revenue in the quarter. As Dave mentioned earlier, applications such as surveillance, which utilize high-definition video and image processing continue to be a meaningful growth opportunity for Seagate moving forward.
Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook drives contributed 17% of total revenue compared to 18% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments increased 7% sequentially to 15 exabytes, reflecting seasonal demand for both desktop and notebook drives.
Aligned with what we presented during our recent Analyst Day, we will change how we present our HDD business. Starting in the December quarter, we will break out revenue and exabyte shipment in 2 primary categories, mass capacity storage and legacy market. Mass capacity is made up of nearline, video and image applications and NAS. This represents growing market that support data-centric applications requiring high capacity low-cost storage well-suited to HDD. Our other HDD products are sold into legacy market. Mass capacity storage has been increasing as a percentage of our total revenue and contributed 47% of September quarter revenue compared with 35% just 2 years ago. We expect this growth trend to continue over the next few years. The legacy market made up 46% of total September quarter revenue.
Our non-HDD business made up the remaining 7% of revenue, with growth from both system and SSD solutions, [ but adding ] non-hard disk drive revenue, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to gain traction in our system business with OEMs and other customers.
Within our SSD business, the pricing environment has been challenging for multiple quarters. Our main focus has been on enterprise SSDs, which complements our mass capacity HDD solution to provide our customers with a more complete storage solution portfolio. We remain focused on servicing those areas of the market where Seagate can deliver value to our customers. As a reminder, we're extending the [ useful life ] of our capital equipment from a range of 3 to 5 years to a range of 3 to 7 years, which resulted from a more efficient use of capital. This change lowered September quarter depreciation by approximately $23 million, a majority of which was included in cost of goods sold.
Accounting for this change, non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was approximately flat with the prior period at about 27%. On top of the challenging industry conditions we discussed over the last few quarters, we incurred higher-than-expected costs associated with the initial ramp of our new products, which impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. Looking ahead, we expect margins to improve as production scales and 16-terabyte drives become a more meaningful part of our total revenue.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the 14-week quarter, came in lower than planned at $359 million. Discretionary costs and costs associated with the extra week were both lower than our original outlook. We are continuing to efficiently manage expenses and optimize profitability.
In the September quarter, we expanded non-GAAP operating income to $329 million or approximately 13% of revenue. We expect to see financial leverage as we grow revenue and execute our road map to reduce cost per terabyte. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.03, which was at the high end of our guidance range.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $147 million, representing about 6% of September quarter revenue. Expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be near the midpoint of our target range of 6% to 8% of revenue to support our exabyte capacity expansion plans and prepare for the ramp of our HAMR technology.
We delivered healthy free cash flow of $309 million, up 4% sequentially. We utilized $450 million to retire 9.2 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 263 million shares outstanding, down 8% from the prior year. Through a combination of opportunistic share repurchases and dividends, we returned $620 million to shareholders in the quarter. As we announced during the Analyst Day, our Board approved a 3% increase to our quarterly dividend payment to $0.65 per share, payable on January 8, 2020. This increase reflect our positive long-term demand outlook as well as our confidence in sustainable cash generation.
We have also been focused on further improving our balance sheet. During the September quarter, we successfully marketed a $500 million 6-year term loan to restructure a portion of our debt. Through these efforts, we extended leverage debt maturity profile, lowered annual interest expenses by $13 million and reduced total debt to $4.1 billion. As of the end of September, cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 billion, with access to up to $1.5 billion available through our revolver.
Looking ahead to our outlook for the December quarter, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $2.72 billion, plus or minus 5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be above the midpoint of our long-term target range of 13% to 16% of revenue, driven by top line growth and improved gross margin. And non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.32, plus or minus 5%.
Overall, we are executing very well. And while we continue to face geopolitical challenges, we believe improving industry demand combined with the ramp of our 16-terabyte drives, is the solid foundation for revenue and profitability growth in the fiscal year 2020.
I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments."

But one of your competitors this week alluded to some pricing pressure in nearline. Do you think that pricing pressure will get worse before it gets better? Do you think pricing is the main reason why maybe we haven't seen an inflection yet in your margins -- gross margins, that is, despite higher levels of enterprise mix? And maybe more importantly, though, as we continue to push the areal density curve, and you certainly can leverage the additional capital required to pursue this greater complexity of heads and disks in the high-capacity points, why can't margins push toward that [ four handle ]?"

I'll let Gianluca elaborate on the impact to the ramp costs that he mentioned in the script. But first, just let me say that in our business, to your point, gross margin is a function of supply and demand. It's very specific to the demand for the products that you have. And for the last few quarters, exabyte demand was relatively weak. I mean if I go back 3 quarters ago, we sensed that this was happening. We made conscious decisions to throttle builds, manage cash inventory really carefully. And then also start converting production to the new platform. 
So by the way, the new platforms are not just the 16-terabyte, but we have continued ramp of various cost reductions for other products across the portfolio. So demand is definitely picking up, that's one of the reasons why we're confident. The strength of the demand will go through the back half of this fiscal year, I think, and potentially, even further than that. So we feel like calendar year '20 is very -- is a lot stronger than calendar year '19. And with new products, I'm confident we'll get into that [ OpEx ] model range that we talked about, quite quickly.

During this period of time, we were still adding CapEx, giving us the opportunity for even higher capacity when we were ready to take benefit from that. Right now, we have strong demand. So we are ramping hard, especially our 16-terabyte, but also other products on lower capacities. When we ramp so fast, sometimes you have additional cost, a little bit lower yield, a little bit of additional spread. We had a little bit of those impacts in F Q1. We don't expect that to happen again in F Q2 and after that. So we expect margins in general, so gross margin and operating margin, to improve starting F Q2."

But really, that can be much more broadly based, and it could have to do with people pulling stuff in because they're speculative, maybe they think they can gain share or something like that. So that demand has been disruptive for quite a while. 
The end demand, the end market demand is strong for exabytes, and we believe it will continue to grow strongly next year. Exactly how we satisfy that end demand is still in question. And what's interesting about some of the global markets is they're really more what we call [ white van ] markets. The people making the final buy decision out there is actually doing integration in a business or in a home or something like that, versus fairly small lot size. We don't think that end demand is slowing down at all. As a matter of fact, we think it's growing."

And I think part of the issue that you might see with other companies, I don't want to speculate too much, but the issues you might see if you're qualified on 1 part of an architecture and also that architecture gets delayed for whatever reason, it can be impactful. I think generally speaking, some componentry, and hard drives are in there as well, tend to be fairly broad-based, although, for example, we may have an 8-terabyte drive qualified on 1 architectural point and that doesn't move as fast. So it's not like the entire fleet transitions at the same time. 
These customers have complex, not only supply chains, but also problems themselves. And I'm speaking globally as well. The bigger the world gets, the more -- there's some of these inherent inhibitions to transitions. They have to make sure they test them against more complex sets. So it's not surprising to me that from time to time that you could see 1 architecture affecting you. But I think most of the demand that we see across exabytes is broad-based across architectures.

I understand there's been some near-term headwinds around costs and yields. But if we look at gross margins for both Seagate and your main competitor, they're a down cycle in the cycle compared to where they had been in past points when nearline was doing well. I'm assuming pricing has gotten a bit more difficult. But is there anything else beyond pricing, that those may be more structural? I don't know if as nearline mix increases more towards hyperscale compared to being more balanced in the past between OEM and hyperscale. Is that having an effect? Or anything else that may be more structural versus temporal and nearline gross margins?"
