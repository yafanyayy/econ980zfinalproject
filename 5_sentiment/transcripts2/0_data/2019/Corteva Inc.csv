Earlier today, we reported the second quarter results for Corteva. Our first quarter reporting as an independent company. 2 months ago, on June 1, we completed the separation of Cortev",2000,"Thank you, Meggan, and thank you also to those joining our call today. Earlier today, we reported the second quarter results for Corteva. Our first quarter reporting as an independent company. 2 months ago, on June 1, we completed the separation of Corteva from DowDuPont. The combination of 3.5 years of journey and a significant milestone for our employees, our customers and now, we are pleased to say, our shareholders. With our spend, we created a new kind of ad company. A global pure play, built on a foundation of industry leadership and focused on bringing new and integrated solutions to farmers, enriching the lives of those who produce and those who consume, and ensuring progress for generations to come. 
That is our purpose. And our early days, as a public company, have deepened our results on delivering on that purpose. 
The unprecedented market backdrop for the second quarter presented considerable challenges to our customers and in turn, to us. flooding -- planting delays, prevented planting, delayed deliveries, insect pressures, trade-related market disruptions, the list is long and exceptional when viewed from the lens of history. In 150 years of tracking data in our industry, the events that inspired in North America region this season are without precedent. Now amid these historic events, both our spend and market disruptions, we've worked hard to deliver progress this quarter on our priorities for shareholder value creation noted on Slide 4. These priorities continue to guide our actions and underscore the quality of the results that we are targeting. 
First, 2 announcements this quarter reinforced our commitment to return the excess cash to shareholders. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next 3 years. Additionally, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, consistent with our earlier indications. 
These are proof points regarding our confidence in the strength of our long-term strategy. On our purity related to developing innovative solutions, I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter, we began recognizing licensing income related to our Enlist E3 trait where we already have over 100 executed licenses to date. We also began seeing traction in the market in terms of units sold. 
Over 150,000 units were sold through our rep network in the quarter. 
Although, this represents a small percentage of our overall units, it highlights our early groundwork toward reaching our target of having this technology on 10% of North America planted acres in 2020. 
Now beyond Enlist E3 soybeans, new product launches overall are driving both sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter with growth from Qrome and PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicide, Zorvec fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. 
We continue to see solid momentum in our crop production product portfolio with geographic label expansions for Arylex, Isoclast, Rinskor and Zorvec. This includes the very recent registration we received in Brazil for Isoclast and Rinskor. 
On cost advantage and our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $115 million in cost energies in the quarter and approximately $200 million in cost energies through the first half of this year, exceeding the original target set for this timeframe by about $50 million. 
Overall, when you add up what we have delivered since the merger closed, we have realized cumulative of cost savings of $700 million to the end of this quarter, which is approximately 60% of our $1.2 billion commitment. 
On top of that, we announced earlier this year that we are targeting an additional $500 million in operating EBITDA improvement over the next 5 years. To further our progress in this regard, we launched a company-wide initiative this quarter that we are calling Execute To Win, or  ETW. This effort is focused on establishing and owner mindset for all of our employees to drive the cultural reinforcement that will be needed to deliver and sustain our growth and productivity gains long-term. 
We look forward to providing additional detail on this effort and our productivity plans in the coming months. 
And finally, regarding our second quarter performance. Outside of North America, we've realized net sales growth of 10% and organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter, demonstrating the balance inherent in our global operating footprint today. 
Though our results were negatively impacted by the North American market, we capitalize on strong performance outside of North America and realized results that demonstrate our ability to set expectations and deliver what we promise. 
So moving to chart 5 and a few highlights on our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales decreased 3% versus the same quarter last year. Market disruptions due to the weather in North America significantly delayed planting, resulted in volume declines in both segments from reduced planted acres and missed Crop Protection applications during the quarter. 
Sales were also impacted by ongoing currency headwinds and pricing pressures in seed. Outside of North America, organic net sales were up 17% versus the same period last year on both volume and price improvement, demonstrating the strength of our new product launches and reflecting significant benefit to the quarter from an early start to the season in Latin America. 
Operating EBITDA decreased 6% for the quarter, largely driven by declines in the North American market. Demand for new Crop Protection products resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the impact of currency, raw material cost increases and declines in North America. 
Selling, administrative and R&D costs declined 9% in the quarter on a net basis. This result highlights the benefit of our cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions our teams are taking to retail spending in light of the impacts of the market-driven declines in our results. 
Slide 6 shows second quarter highlights by region. I'll start with our results in North America. North American sales declined 8% for the quarter due to the weather-related planting delays that drove reductions in planted area, a significant level of products switching and a loss of Crop Protection applications. Uncertainty remains on the planted acres, and the USDA announced plans to perform a Broadway re-survey in July that is expected to be released on August 12. 
The Crop Protection North America elevated channel inventories are impacting restocking. Additionally, competitive price actions, generic price pressure and large distributor inventory-reduction initiatives are impacting pricing. 
On a positive note, indications are that demand for Corteva Crop Protection products with Pioneer customers is strong driven by joint offers, like TruChoice and Corteva cash. 
Moving to Latin America, we are seeing strong early demand with net sales up 39% on an organic basis. The trend toward an early-season started in December of 2018 with the [indiscernible] season and has continued with a very strong early start to the summer season. We estimate that approximately $80 million in sales that would normally have occurred in the third quarter, have moved into the second quarter. 
Sales have also been bolstered by demand for new products, including year-over-year growth for methoxy, chemical and herbicides in Crop Protection in PowerCore Ultra and Lumiposa products in seed. in Asia Pacific, with organic net sales up 10%, the clear headline is Crop Protection volume growth due to higher pest pressure and pricing on supply constrained high-demand products across. The region is seeing broad-based volume and price growth in [indiscernible] and insecticides across several markets in crops. 
Corteva is pleased to have a strong solution to offer customers to address pest pressures evident in the region [indiscernible] technology, while supply constrained remains an important tool in the local market. 
In addition to the stenosis growth, the launch of Rinskor rice herbicide in China and pricing growth in both Corn and rice Seed contributed to results in the quarter in Asia Pacific. 
Finishing with Europe, Middle East and Africa, up 6% on an organic basis. EMEA has had a strong season, particularly in Seed. Share gains in our old Seed portfolio, particularly in sunflower in Eastern Europe and implementation of a direct agency model in Eastern Europe have delivered volume gains. 
The region also delivered organic growth in Crop Protection due to strong penetration of Lumiposa Seed treatments. Increased demand for new crop production products, like Zorvec fungicide, recently launched in grapes and potatoes. And Arylex cereal herbicides are also contributing to growth in the region. 
Currency devaluation in the region has impacted overall sales growth by 9%. 
I'll turn now to Slide 7 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA results for the first half an updates to our guidance for the second half and full year operating EBITDA. 
Looking at the first half, pro forma operating EBITDA is down 13% compared to the same period last year. Our focus on controlling costs and realizing cost synergies delivered about $200 million in the first half, $50 million ahead of where we expected it to be. In terms of volume and price, there were several drivers that impacted our results. 
Starting with new products, we generated $50 million of EBITDA improvement in the first half, predominantly in the Crop Protection segment. Price and volume improvements across the rest of our portfolio contributed $120 million an incremental benefit to the first half versus last year before we factor in the impact of the North American market. We estimate that the North American market for the first half represents an approximate $350 million headwind, an estimate that reflects lower-than-expected planted area for corn, soybeans and canola, missed Crop Protection applications and shifts to lower margin products, including shorter maturity Corn products. This estimate also includes the impact of delayed sales a sea delivery shifted into the third quarter as well as early deliveries that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Netting with the seasonal shifts, the full year impact from the challenging market conditions in North America is estimated to be approximately $250 million. Looking ahead to the second half due to the late North American season, we see some Seed revenue shifting into the third quarter, primarily in soybeans. 
This impact is almost directly offset by the volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early-season in Latin America. Consistent with our statements earlier this year on the second half, we continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply-constrained high-demand products, primarily in our insecticide portfolio. And we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America in the second half. 
We will keep up our momentum to deliver original cost savings from synergies in the second half, bringing our annual incremental savings to $350 million. 
On top of this, we are beginning to stage other productivity initiatives related to the additional $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA improvements, I mentioned earlier. 
We'll have more to share on specific actions as we work through them. 
In total, we expect to deliver operating EBITDA that's about breakeven for the second half by using the midpoint of the range provided. 
This represents an approximate $200 million improvement over prior year, which is in line with the improvement we guided to back in May for the second half. 
We added all up, this means we are guiding to an operating EBITDA range of $1.9 billion to $2.05 billion for fiscal 2019, down about 5% versus 2018 using the midpoint. Our net sales for full year 2019, we expect declines of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. 
On an organic basis, we expect sales to be about flat year-over-year. 
Now before I turn the call over to Greg, I will summarize by saying that it is difficult to overstate how challenging this year has been to date. 
However, our team has waited a long time for the chance to be a stand-alone company, and we intend to show the market that we can deliver. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg, who will get into the details behind our second quarter and first half results Greg?"

Turning to Slide 8 for a summary of our second quarter results. Please note that all the periods, except for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effects of our North America business from unprecedented weather-related events continue to impact our overall results for the second quarter via delayed planting and lower-than-expected planted area in corn, soybeans and canola and missed Crop Protection applications. Net sales of $5.6 billion were down 3% versus prior year on currency headwinds of 2%, a 1% decline in local price and volumes that were essentially flat. Excluding North America, Rest Of the World volumes were up 14% led by strong early demand in Latin America Crop Protection products, including 73% year-over-year growth in sales from new products worldwide. 
This includes products, such as our Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide. Competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans coupled with higher replant in Corn, more than offset the price improvements we achieved in Asia Pacific from broad-based demand for new products across several crops and market. For Rest of the world, we recorded organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter versus prior year. 
Turning to operating EBITDA, we reported $1.45 billion or a 6% decline versus the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. Overall, declines were led by lower margins in Seed for the impact of replanting Corn and pricing pressures in soybeans. We delivered a $115 million of synergies in the quarter, and currency was a headwind in the quarter. Our operating EBITDA margins were equally pressured by headwinds within the Seed, driven by the overall North American market. 
This more than offset the 150 basis point margin next expansion we delivered in Crop Protection in the second quarter. 
Overall, we delivered an operating EBITDA margin of 26%, down 80 basis points from the prior year on a pro forma basis. 
This translated into operating earnings per share of $1.42, down 9% from the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. 
Turning now to Slide 9 for a year-over-year comparison on our operating EPS. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.13 to operating EPS in the quarter, while volume and price improvements across the rest of the portfolio of $0.06 were offset by the impact of the North American market. 
Currency was a 5% headwind in the quarter. In addition, the impact of changes in our base tax rate on pretax income was a hurt of $0.07. Our base tax rate for the quarter, which excludes exchange gains and losses, was 17.4%, up from the second quarter of 2018 rate of 13.8%. 
And lastly, we generated $0.04 of benefit from foreign exchange gains related to our hedging program to offset exposures for the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet. 
Turning to our segment results, Slide 10 highlights the performance for the quarter and the half in both our Crop Protection and Seed centers. In Crop Protection, net sales were $3.3 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 2% from the prior period. 
The decrease was primarily due to a 5% decline from currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. 
For the quarter, our top line was impacted similarly by currency, offsetting the strong growth that we experienced in Latin America. 
Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $670 million for the first 6 months of 2019, down 10% from the first 6 months of 2018. Unfavorable currency, volume declines in North America and higher input costs drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment delivered on cost synergies. In the quarter, Crop Protection delivered 150 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. 
In Seed, we reported net sales of $5.7 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 8% from the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to weather-related impacts of North America and the impact of early deliveries of corn seed in the fourth quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by favorable corn seed demand in the EMEA. Currency was a headwind of 3%. 
In the quarter, we saw similar impacts from the North American market, partially offset by strong early demand in Latin America. 
Seed operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion for the first half of 2019 was equally challenged by the impact of the North American market, down 15%. 
Our results reflect pricing pressure and lower volumes from weather, coupled with a favorable currency and the delivery of cost synergy benefits in the quarter. Our second quarter Seed operating EBITDA was equally impacted by the North American market. 
Turning now to Slide 11 for a closer look at our operating results on a seasonal or first-half basis. 
Starting with Crop Protection. Reported net sales were down 2%, primarily due to the impact of currency, partially offset by 2% increase in local price and 1% increase in volume. 
Organic sales growth was 3%. And outside North America, organic sales growth was 17%. In North America, organic sales were down 17%, a lower volumes due to lost spring applications and nitrogen stabilizers and corn and soybean herbicides from the impacts of wet weather. Latin America sales grew substantially with 43% organic growth, [ a ] 37% higher volumes with strong early demand for the upcoming season. Approximately $80 million of sales were realized in the have missed typically occur in the third quarter. Early demand was concentrated in our insect management product portfolio, including [indiscernible] and insecticide and Seed applied technologies as we worked with growers on providing the best solutions to their current health challenges that they face in that market. 
We also delivered a 6% price improvement for the quarter, and currency was a headwind of 7% for the region. In Asia Pacific, organic net sales were up 16% of higher volume and price, our results reflect strong demand for insecticides from broad-based growth in several markets, coupled with continued traction in new products, like Rinskor herbicides and Isoclast insecticide. Currency was a headwind of 5%. 
In EM EA, organic sales were up 5%. Sales growth was driven by the strong and balanced season, coupled with continued demand for Zorvec fungicide. Currency was a headwind of 9%. 
Turning to Slide 12 where I'll cover the first half performance for our Seed segment. In Seed, reported net sales were down 8% on 4% lower volume, a 3% decline in currency and 1% lower price. Outside of North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 7%. 
In North America, Seed sales were down 10%. Volume was down 8% on weaker volumes from weather-related delays and reduced plantings, coupled with the early shipments of Seed that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Price was down 2% due to the competitive pricing environment around soybeans as well as higher corn we plant. In Latin America, organic sales were up 2% driven by 2% higher volumes. We delivered an increased early demand for corn Seed in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Currency was a headwind of 5%. In Asia Pacific, organic sales were up 3% driven by higher prices in the Southeast Asia market. Volumes were flat to slightly up as we did see some demand impact on corn due to the dry weather in the region. Currency was a headwind of 7%. And lastly, in the EMEA, we delivered organic sales growth of 9% from volume and price improvements for the half on balanced and increased demand in the local market. Our top line results reflect strong demand for corn in Southern Europe as well as volume and price improvements, together with expected share gains in our sunflower lineup in Eastern Europe. Currency was a headwind of 10%. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update to the modeling guidance that we shared earlier this year for 2019. Just to recap Jim's earlier on how we will see second half of the year playing out. We're expecting about her $200 million improvement in the operating EBITDA for the second half versus prior year. 
In terms of the quarterly split for the second half, we have historically run at a loss in the third quarter and generated a profit in the fourth quarter. 
In the 8-K we filed this morning, we have provided historical quarterly data for pro forma sales and operating EBITDA. For interest expense, given better visibility into our delevering of heritage debt, we have narrowed our range for interest expense to be $140 million to $160 million for 2019. 
The next few items remain unchanged from our prior guidance. Operating tax rate of 19% to 21%, and depreciation and amortization of $1 billion. 
Note that we exclude all amortization expense from our operating EPS, which is estimated at $400 million for 2019. Additionally, in terms of our $1 [ billion ] stock repurchase program, I would expect that we will capitalize on some opportunity in 2019 depending on the current market environment, cash levers and operating needs. We expect little bit more opportunity to expand on this in 2020. As it relates to cost and the current market environment, I will emphasize the focus the organization has on delivering on our commitments in light of the current market situation. 
This includes delivering on the synergy targets we have communicated, executing on the initial $500 million of operational EBITDA improvements over the next 5 years from ongoing productivity actions driven by Execute To Win, and reducing our standalone cost to achieve best-in-class cost structure as a company. And finally, I'm pleased to announce that I will host a webcast on August 15 to cover certain topics related to our standalone financials. Year, I would take a deeper dive into the modeling considerations and address some of the questions that we received. More details to come, and I hope you can join us. I'll now turn the call back over to Megan to open the Q&A."

It comes down to also than the market backdrop. What can be expect around commodity prices on corn and soy, and given the focus on planting intentions. 
As we sit here today, we've got a couple of minutes still to clear through. We've got to finalize the North America market that we have in the ground right now. There are obviously going to be questions about the actual harvested quantities of grain versus the acres that got planted. So quality as well as yield is still a big question. 
And then we have a strong Latin American market to work through both the summer and the [indiscernible] season is down there. So all in all, it could be shaping up to be a strong season as we see some stand back and a few other things that I've talked about really start to add to our results in a very positive way.

As you would expect, in 2019, we did have some onetime cash needs that are reflected regarding our spend as well as our integration. 
Those are onetime cash uses that will be completed in 2019. 
So moving to 2020, we should see a more normalized cash flow. We will have some seasonality in our cash flow just driven by our industry. But we are targeting that 50% cash conversion ratio."

Just looking at your existing Seed inventories, whatever it is produced this year, are you at all worried about a potential shortfall in Seed production in the U.S. that could potentially force you to do some winter production in South America? And just more generally, how are you thinking about your Seed production cost into next year just given these moving parts?"

Thanks for that question. You're right. Our early part of this season as we were working to shore up our planting plans and working with key growers across the North American market to kind of nail down acres and get our production -- kind of our production plants up and running. The good news about kind of our approach is, we've been doing this long time, and we have a pretty broad footprint of production facilities kind of across North America. So as we saw those early rains starting, I can't say enough about our production team and how quickly they were able to relocate acres out of some of the hardest-hit states, Indiana, Illinois, and even at western Ohio area were pretty hard hit. And that allowed us to go in favor Seed production markets where we can take some of those extremes out of play. So we've got good footprint in Nebraska, Iowa and other markets. 
So at this point right now, we feel like we've got the right number Seed in the ground for production given where we think the market will turn out to be in 2020. And our early monitoring would suggest that the quality of that production is about where we would expect it to be. And so Answer right now, we're not factoring in any big changes to our cost of goods or the Seed site going into 2020, except maybe for the commodity price impact that might flow through. And in terms of winter production right now, we don't see any need or any plans to do that. But part of the reason why we don't think we'll need that in corn is we'll have some carryover. We got returns back early enough. We got it into storage to help protect the termination rate. And so that will allow us to make sure we've got some additional quantities on Seed beyond our production out there. And on soybeans, we were right on top of the season there. So we feel good about where we're sitting."

And as we -- as the season unfolds. And so you had a few dynamics going on there. You did -- we did have that weather affects, replant rates, seed that we were swapping out as we try to help with maturity wages. And so you see some of that effect clearly in our current pricing. 
On soybeans, the key -- one of the key factors there was a really strong competitive environment that unfolded as you had quantities seed out chasing fewer and fewer acres as that season unfolded. And we feel pretty good about the way we performed but we also felt like we needed to meet some of that competition, some of the demand to essentially hold where we are in the marketplace. The A-Series soybeans performance continues to be kind of at the top of the pack in terms of the comparisons. And we feel really good about the competitive side of that from a product performance. 
So we weren't going to let a lot of acres walk away from it. So than the other thing we talked about in our results is we actually have a little more of our soybean business left report as we had seed deliveries occurred into first part of the third quarter from our revenue-recognition approach that we deliver -- when we deliver Seed, we would report that revenue. I've got him Glenn here with me obviously, our -- head of our commercial teams, and he was right out there in the middle of all that. Tim, you got anything us to add."

[indiscernible] the landfall we had really exceptional product performance with our E series soybean. So we had strong demand. .
One thing you got to remember that when we were actually selling soybeans in the season, farmers were at a really different spot. Soybeans were really out of favor and a lot of uncertainty because that was kind of maybe the most severe impact from the trait disruption. 
So it was a tough environment. We definitely have some aggressive competitive actions. And I think a part of that was a result of some of the really strong performance that we saw on our product line. And I would emphasize one other part is, it was a tough production season for us. And so we ended up selling more, what I would describe as, reduced quality soybean. So that we had to make a price concession on that. 
So we definitely felt competitive pressure. We definitely had a difficult environment in terms of farmers' attitude towards soybeans. But the fact that we had to sell some lower determination beans and make a price concession impacted our price. 
The one my thing I would emphasize is, from a technology adoption, we didn't see farmers putting down on technology. We saw them sticking with our leader products. And our technology mix actually ended up very close to what we had anticipated. So we didn't see necessarily a behavioral change from farmers but it was definitely a challenging reason on multiple fronts for soybeans."

And given how big you are in -- with the Pioneer brand in terms of going direct to growers, you must have a pretty good feel for what actual acres are?

So on acreage, you're right, with our Pioneer brand, we do get a good sense of what's going on. It's really hard for us to talk about that number we're still waiting on USDA survey data. They've gone out and decided that they wanted to completely resurvey because some of their information coming in didn't make sense. 
And a lot of that is caught up between the actual what was planted versus their intentions to plant versus previous year. So we're sort of trying to sort through what is the basis that we're working of your intention. If I -- can I just keep it very simple and I think about what was planted last year versus this year. In corn, we can be down a couple of million dollars acres year-over-year. I think when it all sorted out, there were strong intentions early. But when it actually settled, I think we can be down just a couple of million dollars or so. And in soybeans, again, we still have a little bit of business to finish up here as we closed out the first part of the third quarter. So we're still getting hit on that. So we could be down as much maybe as 10% in soybeans, which will be helpful around carryover and other things like that. So -- but it's still too early to really call it we're all waiting to see what USDA says here in a couple of days. And then Tim, do you want to talk about multichannel a little bit?"

What I'd emphasize is we -- as we went into the season, we were going through a very insignificant reorganization of our regional brand, that multichannel approach. And so we reduced number of brands. We did some consolidation and that great deception in the marketplace in terms of existing relationships in terms of dealers and customers. 
We had anticipated that we would lose some volume through that process. And I would describe what's happened through the process is very consistent or maybe a little bit better than we had anticipated in terms of retention of our dealer network as well as retention of customer. So I think it's going well. On the retail side, this year was really about preparation for the future. 
So we're actively repositioning the [indiscernible] brand and retail. Part of that process is kind of turning over the product portfolio, and we're midstep from that. Last week, we had the opportunity to participate in a kickoff meeting with several of our key channel partners in a western Corn Belt there. Johnson had -- we were in kind of reintroducing [indiscernible] brand to them, sharing what our plans in the future of the brand. We introduced 42 new hybrid, so really excited about the product that we're putting on the table for them, and also working on building our business plans for 2020. For 2019 was really a transition year for [indiscernible] and 2020 is about really going out there and aggressively ramping up in the channels as we build that brand. And the thing I would emphasize is, as we think about 2019 and how Seed year turned out, we've had very good insight as you say into kind of our relationship with farmers. 
We felt very comfortable however, order activity for both corn and soybeans have proceeded throughout the year. And as we went through the changes in the spring, obviously, lot of farmers, they were switching hybrid, potential switching crops or [indiscernible] in the prevented planning. We feel comfortable and how things are turned out. So we have a good understanding of the numerator when you talk about share, the denominator is a little uncertain right now but we feel like we felt really good through the transition to Spring and other changes. And I think that direct relationship with farmers really paid out in our favor."

So on your pricing around Enlist, it's a little early for us to be talking about how we're going to price that product. We -- we've got some great information going on out in the market place.

So on inventories and quantities and volumes, we'll save it probably a little elevated going into the fourth quarter.

319130234,630734810,1787405,"Corteva, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Corteva, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Megan, and thank you also to those joining our call today. Earlier today, we reported the second quarter results for Corteva, our first quarter reporting as an independent company.

Earlier today, we reported the second quarter results for Corteva, our first quarter reporting as an independent company. Two months ago, on June 1, we completed the separation of Corteva from DowDuPont, a culmination of 3.5 years of journey and a significant milestone for our employees, our customers and now, we are pleased to say, our shareholders. With our spend, we created a new kind of ag company. A global pure play, built on a foundation of industry leadership and focused on bringing new and integrated solutions to farmers, enriching the lives of those who produce and those who consume, and ensuring progress for generations to come. That is our purpose. And our early days, as a public company, have deepened our resolve on delivering on that purpose. 
The unprecedented market backdrop for the second quarter presented considerable challenges to our customers and, in turn, to us; flooding, planting delays, prevented planting, delayed deliveries, insect pressures, trade-related market disruptions, the list is long and exceptional when viewed from the lens of history. In 150 years of tracking data in our industry, the events that transpired in North America region this season are without precedent. Now amid these historic events, both our spend and market disruptions, we've worked hard to deliver progress this quarter on our priorities for shareholder value creation noted on Slide 4. These priorities continue to guide our actions and underscore the quality of the results that we are targeting. 
First, 2 announcements this quarter reinforced our commitment to return the excess cash to shareholders. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next 3 years. Additionally, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, consistent with our earlier indications. These are proof points regarding our confidence in the strength of our long-term strategy. 
On our priority related to developing innovative solutions, I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter, we began recognizing licensing income related to our Enlist E3 trait, where we already have over 100 executed licenses to date. We also began seeing traction in the market in terms of units sold. Over 150,000 units were sold through our rep network in the quarter. Although, this represents a small percentage of our overall units, it highlights our early groundwork toward reaching our target of having this technology on 10% of North America planted acres in 2020. 
Now beyond Enlist E3 soybeans, new product launches overall are driving both sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter with growth from Qrome and PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicides, Zorvec fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. 
We continue to see solid momentum in our Crop Protection product portfolio with geographic label expansions for Arylex, Isoclast, Rinskor and Zorvec. This includes the very recent registration we received in Brazil for Isoclast and Rinskor. 
On cost advantage and our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $115 million in cost synergies in the quarter and approximately $200 million in cost synergies through the first half of this year, exceeding the original target set for this time frame by about $50 million. Overall, when you add up what we have delivered since the merger closed, we have realized cumulative cost savings of $700 million through the end of this quarter, which is approximately 60% of our $1.2 billion commitment. 
On top of that, we announced earlier this year that we are targeting an additional $500 million in operating EBITDA improvement over the next 5 years. To further our progress in this regard, we launched a company-wide initiative this quarter that we are calling Execute To Win, or E To W. This effort is focused on establishing an owner mindset for all of our employees to drive the cultural reinforcement that will be needed to deliver and sustain our growth and productivity gains long term. We look forward to providing additional detail on this effort and our productivity plans in the coming months. 
And finally, regarding our second quarter performance. Outside of North America, we've realized net sales growth of 10% and organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter, demonstrating the balance inherent in our global operating footprint today. Though our results were negatively impacted by the North American market, we capitalize on strong performance outside of North America and realize results that demonstrate our ability to set expectations and deliver what we promise. 
So moving to Chart 5 and a few highlights on our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales decreased 3% versus the same quarter last year. Market disruptions due to the weather in North America significantly delayed planting, resulted in volume declines in both segments from reduced planted acres and missed Crop Protection applications during the quarter. 
Sales were also impacted by ongoing currency headwinds and pricing pressures in Seed. Outside of North America, organic net sales were up 17% versus the same period last year on both volume and price improvement, demonstrating the strength of our new product launches and reflecting significant benefit to the quarter from an early start to the season in Latin America. 
Operating EBITDA decreased 6% for the quarter, largely driven by declines in the North American market. Demand for new Crop Protection products resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the impact of currency, raw material cost increases and declines in North America. 
Selling, administrative and R&D costs declined 9% in the quarter on a net basis. This result highlights the benefit of our cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions our teams are taking to curtail spending in light of the impacts of the market-driven declines in our results. 
Slide 6 shows second quarter highlights by region. I'll start with our results in North America. North American sales declined 8% for the quarter due to the weather-related planting delays that drove reductions in planted area, a significant level of products switching and a loss of Crop Protection applications. Uncertainty remains on the planted acres, and the USDA announced plans to perform a broad resurvey in July that is expected to be released on August 12. 
The Crop Protection in North America, elevated channel inventories are impacting restocking. Additionally, competitive price actions, generic price pressure and large distributor inventory-reduction initiatives are impacting pricing. 
On a positive note, indications are that demand for Corteva Crop Protection products with Pioneer customers is strong, driven by joint offers like TruChoice and Corteva Cash. 
Moving to Latin America, we are seeing strong early demand with net sales up 39% on an organic basis. The trend toward an early season started in December of 2018 with the [indiscernible] season and has continued with a very strong early start to the summer season. We estimate that approximately $80 million in sales, that would normally have occurred in the third quarter, have moved into the second quarter. 
Sales have also been bolstered by demand for new products, including year-over-year growth for picoxy, Dermacor and herbicides in Crop Protection in PowerCore Ultra and Leptra corn products in Seed. 
In Asia Pacific, with organic net sales up 10%, the clear headline is Crop Protection volume growth due to higher pest pressure and pricing on supply-constrained, high-demand products across. The region is seeing broad-based volume and price growth in Spinosyn insecticides across several markets and crops. Corteva is pleased to have a strong solution to offer customers to address pest pressures evident in the region. Our Spinosyn's technology, while supply constrained, remains an important tool in the local market. 
In addition to the Spinosyn growth, the launch of Rinskor rice herbicide in China and pricing growth in both corn and rice seed contributed to results in the quarter in Asia Pacific. 
Finishing with Europe, Middle East and Africa. Up 6% on an organic basis. EMEA has had a strong season, particularly in Seed. Share gains in our oil seed portfolio, particularly in sunflower in Eastern Europe and implementation of a direct agency model in Eastern Europe have delivered volume gains. 
The region also delivered organic growth in Crop Protection due to strong penetration of Lumiposa seed treatments. Increased demand for new Crop Production products, like Zorvec fungicide, recently launched in grapes and potatoes. And Arylex cereal herbicides are also contributing to growth in the region. Currency devaluation in the region has impacted overall sales growth by 9%. 
I'll turn now to Slide 7 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA results for the first half and updates to our guidance for the second half and full year operating EBITDA. Looking at the first half, pro forma operating EBITDA is down 13% compared to the same period last year. Our focus on controlling costs and realizing cost synergies delivered about $200 million in the first half, $50 million ahead of where we expected it to be. 
In terms of volume and price, there were several drivers that impacted our results. Starting with new products, we generated $50 million of EBITDA improvement in the first half, predominantly in the Crop Protection segment. Price and volume improvements across the rest of our portfolio contributed $120 million in incremental benefit to the first half versus last year before we factor in the impact of the North American market. We estimate that the North American market for the first half represents an approximate $350 million headwind, an estimate that reflects lower-than-expected planted area for corn, soybeans and canola, missed Crop Protection applications and shifts to lower margin products, including shorter-maturity corn products. This estimate also includes the impact of delayed sales, a Seed delivery shifted into the third quarter as well as early deliveries that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Netting with the seasonal shifts, the full year impact from the challenging market conditions in North America is estimated to be approximately $250 million. 
Looking ahead to the second half due to the late North American season, we see some Seed revenue shifting into the third quarter, primarily in soybeans. This impact is almost directly offset by the volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early-season in Latin America. Consistent with our statements earlier this year on the second half, we continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply-constrained, high-demand products, primarily in our insecticide portfolio. And we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America in the second half.  We will keep up our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, bringing our annual incremental savings to $350 million. On top of this, we are beginning to stage other productivity initiatives related to the additional $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA improvements, I mentioned earlier. We'll have more to share on specific actions as we work through them. 
In total, we expect to deliver operating EBITDA that's about breakeven for the second half by using the midpoint of the range provided. This represents an approximate $200 million improvement over prior year, which is in line with the improvement we guided to back in May for the second half. We add it all up, this means we are guiding to an operating EBITDA range of $1.9 billion to $2.05 billion for fiscal 2019, down about 5% versus 2018, using the midpoint. On net sales for full year 2019, we expect declines of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. On an organic basis, we expect sales to be about flat year-over-year. 
Now before I turn the call over to Greg, I will summarize by saying that it is difficult to overstate how challenging this year has been to date. However, our team has waited a long time for the chance to be a standalone company, and we intend to show the market what we can deliver. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg, who will get into the details behind our second quarter and first half results Greg?"

Please note that all the periods, except for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effec",1674,"Thank you, Jim. Turning now to Slide 8 for a summary of our second quarter results. Please note that all the periods, except for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effects of our North America business from unprecedented weather-related events continue to impact our overall results for the second quarter via delayed planting and lower-than-expected planted area in corn, soybeans and canola and missed Crop Protection applications. Net sales of $5.6 billion were down 3% versus prior year on currency headwinds of 2%, a 1% decline in local price and volumes that were essentially flat. Excluding North America, Rest Of the World volumes were up 14%, led by strong early demand in Latin America Crop Protection products, including 73% year-over-year growth in sales from new products worldwide. 
This includes products, such as our Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide. Competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans coupled with higher replant in corn, more than offset the price improvements we achieved in Asia Pacific from broad-based demand from new products across several crops and market. For Rest of the World, we recorded organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter versus prior year. 
Turning to operating EBITDA, we reported $1.45 billion or a 6% decline versus the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. Overall, declines were led by lower margins in Seed from the impacts of replanting corn and pricing pressures in soybeans. We delivered $115 million of synergies in the quarter, and currency was a headwind in the quarter. Our operating EBITDA margins were equally pressured by headwinds within Seed, driven by the overall North American market. This more than offset the 150 basis point margin  expansion we delivered in Crop Protection in the second quarter. Overall, we delivered an operating EBITDA margin of 26%, down 80 basis points from the prior year on a pro forma basis. This translated into operating earnings per share of $1.42, down 9% from the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. 
Turning now to Slide 9 for a year-over-year comparison on our operating EPS. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.13 to operating EPS in the quarter, while volume and price improvements across the rest of the portfolio of $0.06 were offset by the impact of the North American market. Currency was a $0.05 headwind in the quarter. 
In addition, the impact of changes in our base tax rate on pretax income was a hurt of $0.07. Our base tax rate for the quarter, which excludes exchange gains and losses, was 17.4%, up from the second quarter of 2018 rate of 13.8%. 
And lastly, we generated $0.04 of benefit from foreign exchange gains, related to our hedging program to offset exposures for the foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet. 
Turning to our segment results, Slide 10 highlights the performance for the quarter and the half in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments. In Crop Protection, net sales were $3.3 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 2% from the prior period. 
The decrease was primarily due to a 5% decline from currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. 
For the quarter, our top line was impacted similarly by currency, offsetting the strong growth that we experienced in Latin America. 
Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $670 million for the first 6 months of 2019, down 10% from the first 6 months of 2018. Unfavorable currency, volume declines in North America and a higher input costs drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment delivered on cost synergies. In the quarter, Crop Protection delivered 150 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. 
In Seed, we reported net sales of $5.7 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 8% from the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to weather-related impacts in North America and the impact of early deliveries of corn seed in the fourth quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by a favorable corn seed demand in the EMEA. Currency was a headwind of 3%. In the quarter, we saw similar impacts from the North American market, partially offset by strong early demand in Latin America. 
Seed operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion for the first half of '19 was equally challenged by the impact of the North American market, down 15%. 
Our results reflect pricing pressure and lower volumes from weather, coupled with unfavorable currency and the delivery of cost synergy benefits in the quarter. Our second quarter Seed operating EBITDA was equally impacted by the North American market. 
Turning now to Slide 11 for a closer look at our operating results on a seasonal or first-half basis. Starting with Crop Protection. Reported net sales were down 2%, primarily due to the impact of currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. Organic sales growth was 3%. And outside North America, organic sales growth was 17%. In North America, organic sales were down 17% on lower volumes due to lost spring applications in nitrogen stabilizers and corn and soybean herbicides from the impacts of wet weather. Latin America sales grew substantially with 43% organic growth on 37% higher volumes with strong early demand for the upcoming season. Approximately $80 million of sales were realized in the half which typically occur in the third quarter. Early demand was concentrated in our insect management product portfolio, including Spinosyn insecticide and Seed applied technologies as we worked with growers on providing the best solutions to their current pest challenges that they face in that market. We also delivered a 6% price improvement for the quarter, and currency was a headwind of 7% for the region. 
In Asia Pacific, organic net sales were up 16% on higher volume and price, our results reflect strong demand for insecticides from broad-based growth in several markets, coupled with continued traction in new products, like Rinskor herbicides and Isoclast insecticides. Currency was a headwind of 5%. 
In EMEA, organic sales were up 5%. Sales growth was driven by the strong and balanced season, coupled with continued demand for Zorvec fungicide. Currency was a headwind of 9%. 
Turning to Slide 12, where I'll cover the first half performance for our Seed segment. In Seed, reported net sales were down 8% on 4% lower volume, a 3% decline in currency and 1% lower price. Outside of North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 7%. 
In North America, Seed sales were down 10%. Volume was down 8% on weaker volumes from weather-related delays and reduced plantings, coupled with the early shipments of Seed that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Price was down 2% due to the competitive pricing environment around soybeans as well as higher corn replant. 
In Latin America, organic sales were up 2% driven by 2% higher volumes. We delivered an increased early demand for corn seed in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Currency was a headwind of 5%. 
And in Asia Pacific, organic sales were up 3% driven by higher prices in the Southeast Asia market. Volumes were flat to slightly up as we did see some demand impact on corn due to dry weather in the region. Currency was a headwind of 7%. 
And lastly, in EMEA, we delivered organic sales growth of 9% from volume and price improvements for the half on balanced and increased demand in the local market. Our top line results reflect strong demand for corn in Southern Europe as well as volume and price improvements, together with expected share gains in our sunflower lineup in Eastern Europe. Currency was a headwind of 10%. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update to the modeling guidance that we shared earlier this year for 2019. Just to recap Jim's earlier comment on how we will see the second half of the year playing out, we are expecting about $200 million improvement in our operating EBITDA for the second half versus prior year. 
In terms of the quarterly split for the second half, we have historically run at a loss in the third quarter and generated a profit in the fourth quarter. In the 8-K we filed this morning, we have provided historical quarterly data for pro forma sales and operating EBITDA. 
For interest expense, given better visibility into our delevering of heritage debt, we have narrowed our range for interest expense to be $140 million to $160 million for 2019. 
The next few items remain unchanged from our prior guidance. Operating tax rate of 19% to 21%, and depreciation and amortization of $1 billion. 
Note that we exclude all amortization expense from our operating EPS, which is estimated at $400 million for 2019. Additionally, in terms of our $1 billion stock repurchase program, I would expect that we will capitalize on some opportunity in 2019 depending on the current market environment, cash levers and operating needs. We expect there will be more opportunity to expand on this in 2020. As it relates to costs and the current market environment, I will emphasize the focus the organization has on delivering on our commitments in light of the current market situation. This includes delivering on the synergy targets we have communicated, executing on the additional $500 million of operational EBITDA improvements over the next 5 years from ongoing productivity actions driven by Execute To Win, and reducing our standalone cost to achieve best-in-class cost structure as a company. 
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that I will host a webcast on August 15 to cover certain topics related to our standalone financials. Here, I will take a deeper dive into the modeling considerations and address some of the questions that we've received. More details to come, and I hope you can join us. I'll now turn the call back over to Megan to open the Q&A."

Obviously, we've got to factor in what it -- what's the impact of the North American market in '19 and what return we can expect as that market comes back to us. Clearly, we'll continue to have the synergy programs, that we talked to you about, flowing through the momentum that we're carrying through from 2019, and we've given guidance on kind of what to expect year-over-year in that area. It comes down to also then the market backdrop, what can be expect around commodity prices on corn and soy, and given the focus on planting intentions. And as we sit here today, we've got a couple of big markets still to clear through. We've got to finalize the North American market that we have in the ground right now. There are obviously going to be questions about the actual harvested quantities of grain versus the acres that got planted. So quality as well as yield is still a big question. 
And then we have a strong Latin American market to work through, both the summer and the [indiscernible] seasons down there. So all in all, it could be shaping up to be a strong season as we see some snapback and a few of the things that I've talked about really start to add to our results in a very positive way. So we'll -- we've obviously not given any guidance for 2020 here at this point, and we'll be back as we close out the year to kind of set that up. I don't know.

Your question on what are the big ones that we're waiting on, I'd say the one that would kind of be at the top of my list right now would be Conkesta, which is the protein for aboveground insect control in Brazil. And from like in-country cultivation perspective, that product is ready to go. What we're really waiting on is that really important China as well as European grain import tolerance. And in my conversations with folks that are involved in that trade negotiations with China, we know that these traits are on the list and have been discussed as opportunities once a trade deal gets finalized, there's an opportunity for China to go ahead and approve the import of those, and that would really give us the green light. So that's really it.

Thanks for that question. You're right. The early part of this season as we were working to shore up our planting plans and working with key growers across the North American market to kind of nail down acres and get our production -- kind of our production plants up and running. The good news about kind of our approach is, we've been doing this a long time, and we have a pretty broad footprint of production facilities kind of across North America. So as we saw those early rains starting, I can't say enough about our production team and how quickly they were able to relocate acres out of some of the hardest-hit states, Indiana, Illinois, even that Western Ohio area where we're pretty hard hit. And that allowed us to go in favor Seed production markets where we can take some of those extremes out of play. And -- so we've got good footprint in Nebraska, Iowa and other markets. So at this point right now, we feel like we've got the right amount of Seed in the ground for production, given where we think the market will turn out to be in 2020. And our early monitoring would suggest that the quality of that production is about where we would expect it to be. And so right now, we're not factoring in any big changes to our cost of goods on the Seed side, going into 2020, except maybe for the commodity price impact that might flow through. And in terms of winter production, right now we don't see any need or any plans to do that. But part of the reason why we don't think we'll need that in corn is we'll have some carryover. We got returns back early enough. We got it into storage to help protect the germination rate. And so that will allow us to make sure we've got some additional quantities of Seed beyond our production out there. And on soybeans, we were right on top of the season there. So we feel good about where we're sitting."

And as we -- as the season unfolded. And so you had a few dynamics going on there. You did -- we did have that weather affects, replant rates, seed that we were swapping out as we tried to help with maturity  ranges. And so you see some of that effect clearly in our corn pricing. 
On soybeans, the key -- one of the key factors there was a really strong competitive environment that unfolded as you had quantities of seed out chasing fewer and fewer acres as that season unfolded. And we feel pretty good about the way we performed but we also felt like we needed to meet some of that competition, some of that demand to essentially hold where we are in the marketplace. The A-Series soybeans performance continues to be kind of at the top of the pack in terms of the comparisons. And we feel really good about the competitive side of that from the product performance. So we weren't going to let a lot of acres walk away from us. And then the other thing we talked about in our results is, we actually have a little more of our soybean business left report as we had seed deliveries that occurred into first part of the third quarter and you know from our revenue-recognition approach that we deliver -- when we deliver seed, we report that revenue. I've got Tim Glenn here with me obviously, our -- Head of our Commercial Teams, and he was right out there in the middle of all that. Tim, you got anything else us to add?"

But I'd emphasize that last fall we had really exceptional product performance with our A-Series soybean. So we had strong demand. One thing you've got to remember, when we were actively selling soybeans in the season, farmers were at a really difficult spot. Soybeans were really out of favor and a lot of uncertainty because that was kind of maybe the most severe impact from the trade disruption. So it was a tough environment. We definitely had some aggressive competitive actions. And I think part of that was a result of some of the -- really strong performance that we saw on our product line. And I would emphasize one other part is, it was a tough production season for us. And so we ended up selling more, what I would describe as, reduced quality soybean. So that we had to make a price concession on that. So we definitely felt competitive pressure. We definitely had a difficult environment in terms of farmer's attitude towards soybeans. But that -- the fact that we did have to sell some lower germination beans and make a price concession impacted our price. The one my thing I would emphasize is, from a technology adoption, we didn't see farmers trade down on technology. We saw them sticking with our leader products. And our technology mix actually ended up very close to what we had anticipated. So we didn't see necessarily a behavioral change from farmers but it was definitely a challenging season on multiple fronts for soybeans."

I'll start with your -- second part of your question and maybe, I'll toss it over to Tim to talk about the multichannel results here. So on acreage, you're right, with our Pioneer brand, we do get a good sense of what's going on. It's really hard for us to talk about that number, we're still waiting on USDA survey data. They've gone out and decided that they wanted to completely resurvey because some of their information coming in didn't make sense. And a lot of that is caught up between the actual what was planted versus their intentions to plant versus previous year. So we're sort of trying to sort through what is the basis that we're working off of here, is it intention? If I just keep it really simple and I think about what was planted last year versus this year. In corn, we could be down a couple of million acres year-over-year. I think when it all sorted out, there were strong intentions early. But when it actually settled, I think we could be down just a couple of million or so, a few million. 
And in soybeans, again, we still have a little bit of business to finish up here as we closed out the first part of the third quarter. So we're still getting data on that. But we could be down as much maybe as 10% in soybeans, which will be helpful around carryover and other things like that. So -- but it's still too early to really call it, and we're all waiting to see what USDA says here in a couple of days. And then, Tim, do you want to talk about multichannel a little bit?"
319130234,630734810,1787405,"Corteva, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Corteva, Inc.","Executives","Yes, I will. Don, good question.

The -- how -- what I'd emphasize is, we -- as we went into the season, we were going through a very insignificant reorganization of our regional brands, that multichannel approach. And -- so we reduced the number of brands, we did some consolidation and that created disruption in the marketplace in terms of existing relationships in terms of dealers and customers. We had anticipated that we would lose some volume through that process. And I would describe what's happened through the process is very consistent or maybe even a little bit better than we had anticipated in terms of retention of our dealer network as well as retention of customers. So I think it's going well. 
On the retail side, this year was really about preparation for the future. So we were actively repositioning the Mycogen brand in retail. Part of that process is kind of turning over the product portfolio, and we're mid step from that. Last week, I had the opportunity to participate in a kickoff meeting with several of our key channel partners at the western Corn Belt there at Johnston and we were in -- we were kind of reintroducing the Mycogen brand to them, sharing what our plans for the future are for the brand. We introduced 42 new hybrids, so really excited about the products that we're putting on the table for them, and also working on building our business plans for 2020. So 2019 was really a transition year for Mycogen and 2020 is about really going out there and aggressively ramping up in the channel as we build that brand. And the thing I would emphasize is, as we think about 2019 and how the Seed here turned out, we've had very good insight, as you say, into kind of our relationship with farmers. We felt very comfortable how our order activity for both corn and soybeans have proceeded throughout the year. And as we went through the changes in the spring, obviously a lot of farmers, they were switching hybrids, potentially switching crops or flat-out going into prevented planting. We feel comfortable with how things have turned out. So we have a good understanding of the numerator when you talk about share, the denominator is a little uncertain right now but we feel like we've fared very well through the transition this spring and all the changes. And I think that direct relationship with farmers really played out in our favor."

And as we've talked before, we're about 65% or so of lineup converted over to that.

So hard for me to talk about kind of what -- where others were, what motivations were. But I can tell you we have some of the best-performing products in our A-Series lineup.

So -- and then on your pricing around Enlist, it's a little early for us to be talking about how we're going to price that product. We -- we've got some great demonstration going on out in the marketplace.

And that is then tempered by some concerns that as this season will very naturally go long, just because everything got in late and farmers are going to -- they'll keep crops in the ground as long as they possibly can to milk as minute degree days right out to the end as possible. And that could close windows that would allow for fall-applied Crop Protection as well as nitrogen product.

And in soybeans, a unit of 1 back of soybean seed will plant about 1 acre of field. So the seed industry typically talks in terms of units. It's a standardizing way to talk about our lineup and our products. 
And when it comes to product lineup, maybe I'll start. But I'll ask Rajan or Tim -- maybe Rajan to say a few words. We're clearly in the mode right now of exploring the integration of that trait into the elite Pioneer and Corteva germplasm that we have in house due to the timing of the merge and any trust windows. We were sort of precluded from having any really good conversations and understanding of that technology until the deal closed last -- in September of 2018, so we -- 2017. So we really have -- now just had this one first good season to take a strong look at that. And so as we begin to ramp in 2020, we'll utilize germplasm that, that Dow already had, that our scientists had and had  began that work in the Mycogen brand. Some of our partners out there are -- the other regional brands have had a look at that and had begun working with it, and we've got some partnerships with others there we can in-license technology for a few years until we can get that breeding engine that everybody really knows and respects out there in the market. So we can get that breeding engine up and running and start those conversions. So we might go through a couple of years where you're going to see a Corteva branded, Pioneer, Mycogen branded lineup in Enlist that won't compete with the elitist of products that are out there, but it won't take as long to get right back up on that curve. I don't know. Rajan, anything else you'd add?"

And there's a little bit of land, I would say, in that Nebraska market where you had the horrific flooding and you had some sandy -- some sand that got up out of the rivers and kind of got into some pretty good farmland and growers are working hard to try to save that. But when you think about that total of all the millions of acres that are out there, you won't really feel that piece nearly as much. So I would say, no, I would believe that this market could come right back to where it has been previously and it's really just a function of how many acres go in the ground and the yield that will able to get out of those acres."

So on Crop Protection Chemistries, clearly, inventories in North America are going to be a little bit elevated just because we didn't create the pull through on those early spring-applied chemistries as well as -- we've got a really strong business in the nitrogen-fixing area. So on inventories and quantities and volumes, we'd say, we're probably a little elevated going into the fourth quarter. And we've dialed in the fact that if acres go long and late, you may not get some of that late-season prep work that growers have traditionally tried to do to maybe take some of the heat off of the spring season, get some fall-applied chemistry that goes out and get the fall-applied nitrogen and our nitrogen-fixation products. But we think we've got that dialed in about right for our outlook. The thing about price, if I think about the rest of world, we had a great start in Latin America, channel inventories there don't appear to be elevated and are right about where they need to be.

And just building on Jim's point about pricing, where we see the new products being launched, we are able to capture value in all parts of the globe and North America, given the market dynamics, it was tough but I think there is cautious optimism on Crop Protection pricing across the globe. For example, if you see Asia Pacific, the products of Spinosyn, which we are seeing there, they have seen as much as 10%, 11% price increase, a double-digit price increase, as a data point. So where there is value for new, differentiated product across Crop Protection, across the globe, we are seeing price increases."

Earlier today, we reported the second quarter results for Corteva, our first quarter reporting as an independent company. Two months ago, on June 1, we completed the separation of Corteva from DowDuPont, a culmination of 3.5 years of journey and a significant milestone for our employees, our customers and now, we are pleased to say, our shareholders. With our spend, we created a new kind of ag company. A global pure play, built on a foundation of industry leadership and focused on bringing new and integrated solutions to farmers, enriching the lives of those who produce and those who consume, and ensuring progress for generations to come. That is our purpose. And our early days as a public company have deepened our resolve on delivering on that purpose. 
The unprecedented market backdrop for the second quarter presented considerable challenges to our customers and, in turn, to us; flooding, planting delays, prevented planting, delayed deliveries, insect pressures, trade-related market disruptions, the list is long and exceptional when viewed from the lens of history. In 150 years of tracking data in our industry, the events that transpired in North America region this season are without precedent. Now amid these historic events, both our spend and market disruptions, we've worked hard to deliver progress this quarter on our priorities for shareholder value creation noted on Slide 4. These priorities continue to guide our actions and underscore the quality of the results that we are targeting. 
First, 2 announcements this quarter reinforced our commitment to return the excess cash to shareholders. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next 3 years. Additionally, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, consistent with our earlier indications. These are proof points regarding our confidence in the strength of our long-term strategy. 
On our priority related to developing innovative solutions, I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter, we began recognizing licensing income related to our Enlist E3 trait, where we already have over 100 executed licenses to date. We also began seeing traction in the market in terms of units sold. Over 150,000 units were sold through our rep network in the quarter. Although, this represents a small percentage of our overall units, it highlights our early groundwork toward reaching our target of having this technology on 10% of North America planted acres in 2020. 
Now beyond Enlist E3 soybeans, new product launches overall are driving both sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter with growth from Qrome and PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicides, Zorvec fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. 
We continue to see solid momentum in our Crop Protection product portfolio with geographic label expansions for Arylex, Isoclast, Rinskor and Zorvec. This includes the very recent registration we received in Brazil for Isoclast and Rinskor. 
On cost advantage and our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $115 million in cost synergies in the quarter and approximately $200 million in cost synergies through the first half of this year, exceeding the original target set for this time frame by about $50 million. Overall, when you add up what we have delivered since the merger close, we have realized cumulative cost savings of $700 million through the end of this quarter, which is approximately 60% of our $1.2 billion commitment. 
On top of that, we announced earlier this year that we are targeting an additional $500 million in operating EBITDA improvement over the next 5 years. To further our progress in this regard, we launched a company-wide initiative this quarter that we are calling Execute to Win, or E to W. This effort is focused on establishing an owner mindset for all of our employees to drive the cultural reinforcement that will be needed to deliver and sustain our growth and productivity gains long term. We look forward to providing additional detail on this effort and our productivity plans in the coming months. 
And finally, regarding our second quarter performance. Outside of North America, we realized net sales growth of 10% and organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter, demonstrating the balance inherent in our global operating footprint today. Though our results were negatively impacted by the North American market, we capitalized on strong performance outside of North America and realized results that demonstrate our ability to set expectations and deliver what we promised. 
So moving to Chart 5 and a few highlights on our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales decreased 3% versus the same quarter last year. Market disruptions due to the weather in North America significantly delayed planting, resulted in volume declines in both segments from reduced planted acres and missed Crop Protection applications during the quarter. 
Sales were also impacted by ongoing currency headwinds and pricing pressures in Seed. Outside of North America, organic net sales were up 17% versus the same period last year on both volume and price improvement, demonstrating the strength of our new product launches and reflecting significant benefit to the quarter from an early start to the season in Latin America. 
Operating EBITDA decreased 6% for the quarter, largely driven by declines in the North American market. Demand for new Crop Protection products resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the impact of currency, raw material cost increases and declines in North America. 
Selling, administrative and R&D costs declined 9% in the quarter on a net basis. This result highlights the benefit of our cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions our teams are taking to curtail spending in light of the impacts of the market-driven declines in our results. 
Slide 6 shows second quarter highlights by region. I'll start with our results in North America. North American sales declined 8% for the quarter due to the weather-related planting delays that drove reductions in planted area, a significant level of product switching and a loss of Crop Protection applications. Uncertainty remains on the planted acres, and the USDA announced plans to perform a broad resurvey in July that is expected to be released on August 12. 
In Crop Protection in North America, elevated channel inventories are impacting restocking. Additionally, competitive price actions, generic price pressure and large distributor inventory-reduction initiatives are impacting pricing. 
On a positive note, indications are that demand for Corteva Crop Protection products with Pioneer customers is strong, driven by joint offers like TruChoice and Corteva Cash. 
Moving to Latin America, we are seeing strong early demand with net sales up 39% on an organic basis. The trend toward an early season started in December of 2018 with the safrinha season and has continued with a very strong early start to the summer season. We estimate that approximately $80 million in sales that would normally have occurred in the third quarter have moved into the second quarter. 
Sales have also been bolstered by demand for new products, including year-over-year growth for picoxy, Dermacor and herbicides in Crop Protection in PowerCore Ultra and Leptra corn products in Seed. 
In Asia Pacific, with organic net sales up 10%, the clear headline is Crop Protection volume growth due to higher pest pressure and pricing on supply-constrained, high-demand products across. The region is seeing broad-based volume and price growth in Spinosyn insecticides across several markets and crops. Corteva is pleased to have a strong solution to offer customers to address pest pressures evident in the region. Our Spinosyn technology, while supply constrained, remains an important tool in the local market. 
In addition to the Spinosyn growth, the launch of Rinskor rice herbicide in China and pricing growth in both corn and rice seed contributed to results in the quarter in Asia Pacific. 
Finishing with Europe, Middle East and Africa, up 6% on an organic basis. EMEA has had a strong season, particularly in Seed. Share gains in our oil seed portfolio, particularly in sunflower in Eastern Europe and implementation of a direct agency model in Eastern Europe have delivered volume gains. 
The region also delivered organic growth in Crop Protection due to strong penetration of Lumiposa seed treatments. Increased demand for new Crop Production products, like Zorvec fungicide, recently launched in grapes and potatoes. And Arylex cereal herbicides are also contributing to growth in the region. Currency devaluation in the region has impacted overall sales growth by 9%. 
I'll turn now to Slide 7 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA results for the first half and updates to our guidance for the second half and full year operating EBITDA. Looking at the first half, pro forma operating EBITDA is down 13% compared to the same period last year. Our focus on controlling costs and realizing cost synergies delivered about $200 million in the first half, $50 million ahead of where we expected to be. 
In terms of volume and price, there were several drivers that impacted our results. Starting with new products, we generated $50 million of EBITDA improvement in the first half, predominantly in the Crop Protection segment. Price and volume improvements across the rest of our portfolio contributed $120 million in incremental benefit to the first half versus last year before we factor in the impact of the North American market. We estimate that the North American market for the first half represents an approximate $350 million headwind, an estimate that reflects lower-than-expected planted area for corn, soybeans and canola, missed Crop Protection applications and shifts to lower margin products, including shorter-maturity corn products. This estimate also includes the impact of delayed sales, a Seed deliveries shifted into the third quarter as well as early deliveries that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Netting with the seasonal shifts, the full year impact from the challenging market conditions in North America is estimated to be approximately $250 million. 
Looking ahead to the second half, due to the late North American season, we see some Seed revenue shifting into the third quarter, primarily in soybeans. This impact is almost directly offset by the volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early-season in Latin America. Consistent with our statements earlier this year on the second half, we continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply-constrained, high-demand products, primarily in our insecticide portfolio. And we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America in the second half.  We will keep up our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, bringing our annual incremental savings to $350 million. On top of this, we are beginning to stage other productivity initiatives related to the additional $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA improvements I mentioned earlier. We'll have more to share on specific actions as we work through them. 
In total, we expect to deliver operating EBITDA that's about breakeven for the second half by using the midpoint of the range provided. This represents an approximate $200 million improvement over prior year, which is in line with the improvement we guided to back in May for the second half. We add it all up, this means we are guiding to an operating EBITDA range of $1.9 billion to $2.05 billion for fiscal 2019, down about 5% versus 2018, using the midpoint. On net sales for full year 2019, we expect declines of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. On an organic basis, we expect sales to be about flat year-over-year. 
Now before I turn the call over to Greg, I will summarize by saying that it is difficult to overstate how challenging this year has been to date. However, our team has waited a long time for the chance to be a standalone company, and we intend to show the market what we can deliver. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg, who will get into the details behind our second quarter and first half results Greg?"

Please note that all the periods, except for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effec",1674,"Thank you, Jim. Turning now to Slide 8 for a summary of our second quarter results. Please note that all the periods, except for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effects of our North America business from unprecedented weather-related events continued to impact our overall results for the second quarter via delayed planting and lower-than-expected planted area in corn, soybeans and canola and missed Crop Protection applications. Net sales of $5.6 billion were down 3% versus prior year on currency headwinds of 2%, a 1% decline in local price and volumes that were essentially flat. Excluding North America, Rest Of the World volumes were up 14%, led by strong early demand in Latin America Crop Protection products, including 73% year-over-year growth in sales from new products worldwide. 
This includes products, such as our Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide. Competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans coupled with higher replant in corn more than offset the price improvements we achieved in Asia Pacific from broad-based demand from new products across several crops and market. For Rest of the World, we recorded organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter versus prior year. 
Turning to operating EBITDA, we reported $1.45 billion or a 6% decline versus the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. Overall, declines were led by lower margins in Seed from the impacts of replanting corn and pricing pressures in soybeans. We delivered $115 million of synergies in the quarter, and currency was a headwind in the quarter. Our operating EBITDA margins were equally pressured by headwinds within Seed, driven by the overall North American market. This more than offset the 150 basis point margin  expansion we delivered in Crop Protection in the second quarter. Overall, we delivered an operating EBITDA margin of 26%, down 80 basis points from the prior year on a pro forma basis. This translated into operating earnings per share of $1.42, down 9% from the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. 
Turning now to Slide 9 for a year-over-year comparison on our operating EPS. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.13 to operating EPS in the quarter, while volume and price improvements across the rest of the portfolio of $0.06 were offset by the impact of the North American market. Currency was a $0.05 headwind in the quarter. 
In addition, the impact of changes in our base tax rate on pretax income was a hurt of $0.07. Our base tax rate for the quarter, which excludes exchange gains and losses, was 17.4%, up from the second quarter of 2018 rate of 13.8%. 
And lastly, we generated $0.04 of benefit from foreign exchange gains, related to our hedging program to offset exposures for the foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet. 
Turning to our segment results, Slide 10 highlights the performance for the quarter and the half in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments. In Crop Protection, net sales were $3.3 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 2% from the prior period. 
The decrease was primarily due to a 5% decline from currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. 
For the quarter, our top line was impacted similarly by currency, offsetting the strong growth that we experienced in Latin America. 
Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $670 million for the first 6 months of 2019, down 10% from the first 6 months of 2018. Unfavorable currency, volume declines in North America and a higher input costs drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment delivered on cost synergies. In the quarter, Crop Protection delivered 150 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. 
In Seed, we reported net sales of $5.7 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 8% from the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to weather-related impacts in North America and the impact of early deliveries of corn seed in the fourth quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by a favorable corn seed demand in EMEA. Currency was a headwind of 3%. In the quarter, we saw similar impacts from the North America market, partially offset by strong early demand in Latin America. 
Seed operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion for the first half of '19 was equally challenged by the impact of the North American market, down 15%. 
Our results reflect pricing pressure and lower volumes from weather, coupled with unfavorable currency and the delivery of cost synergy benefits in the quarter. Our second quarter Seed operating EBITDA was equally impacted by the North American market. 
Turning now to Slide 11 for a closer look at our operating results on a seasonal or first-half basis. Starting with Crop Protection. Reported net sales were down 2%, primarily due to the impact of currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. Organic sales growth was 3%. And outside North America, organic sales growth was 17%. In North America, organic sales were down 17% on lower volumes due to lost spring applications in nitrogen stabilizers and corn and soybean herbicides from the impacts of wet weather. Latin America sales grew substantially with 43% organic growth on 37% higher volumes with strong early demand for the upcoming season. Approximately $80 million of sales were realized in the half which typically occur in the third quarter. Early demand was concentrated in our insect management product portfolio, including Spinosyn insecticide and Seed applied technologies as we worked with growers on providing the best solutions to the current pest challenges that they face in that market. We also delivered a 6% price improvement for the quarter, and currency was a headwind of 7% for the region. 
In Asia Pacific, organic net sales were up 16% on higher volume and price, our results reflect strong demand for insecticides from broad-based growth in several markets, coupled with continued traction in new products, like Rinskor herbicides and Isoclast insecticides. Currency was a headwind of 5%. 
In EMEA, organic sales were up 5%. Sales growth was driven by the strong and balanced season, coupled with continued demand for Zorvec fungicide. Currency was a headwind of 9%. 
Turning to Slide 12, where I'll cover the first half performance for our Seed segment. In Seed, reported net sales were down 8% on 4% lower volume, a 3% decline in currency and 1% lower price. Outside of North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 7%. 
In North America, Seed sales were down 10%. Volume was down 8% on weaker volumes from weather-related delays and reduced plantings, coupled with the early shipments of Seed that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Price was down 2% due to the competitive pricing environment around soybeans as well as higher corn replant. 
In Latin America, organic sales were up 2% driven by 2% higher volumes. We delivered an increased early demand for corn seed in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Currency was a headwind of 5%. 
And in Asia Pacific, organic sales were up 3% driven by higher prices in the Southeast Asia market. Volumes were flat to slightly up as we did see some demand impact on corn due to dry weather in the region. Currency was a headwind of 7%. 
And lastly, in EMEA, we delivered organic sales growth of 9% from volume and price improvements for the half on balanced and increased demand in the local market. Our top line results reflect strong demand for corn in Southern Europe as well as volume and price improvements, together with expected share gains in our sunflower lineup in Eastern Europe. Currency was a headwind of 10%. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update to the modeling guidance that we shared earlier this year for 2019. Just to recap Jim's earlier comment on how we will see the second half of the year playing out, we are expecting about a $200 million improvement in our operating EBITDA for the second half versus prior year. 
In terms of the quarterly split for the second half, we have historically run at a loss in the third quarter and generated a profit in the fourth quarter. In the 8-K we filed this morning, we have provided historical quarterly data for pro forma sales and operating EBITDA. 
For interest expense, given better visibility into our delevering of heritage debt, we have narrowed our range for interest expense to be $140 million to $160 million for 2019. 
The next few items remain unchanged from our prior guidance. Operating tax rate of 19% to 21%, and depreciation and amortization of $1 billion. 
Note that we exclude all amortization expense from our operating EPS, which is estimated at $400 million for 2019. Additionally, in terms of our $1 billion stock repurchase program, I would expect that we will capitalize on some opportunity in 2019 depending on the current market environment, cash levers and operating needs. We expect there will be more opportunity to expand on this in 2020. As it relates to costs and the current market environment, I will emphasize the focus the organization has on delivering on our commitments in light of the current market situation. This includes delivering on the synergy targets we have communicated, executing on the additional $500 million of operational EBITDA improvements over the next 5 years from ongoing productivity actions driven by Execute to Win, and reducing our standalone costs to achieve best-in-class cost structure as a company. 
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that I will host a webcast on August 15 to cover certain topics related to our standalone financials. Here, I will take a deeper dive into the modeling considerations and address some of the questions that we've received. More details to come, and I hope you can join us. I'll now turn the call back over to Megan to open the Q&A."

Clearly, we'll continue to have the synergy programs that we talked to you about flowing through the momentum that we're carrying through from 2019, and we've given guidance on kind of what to expect year-over-year in that area. It comes down to also then the market backdrop, what can be expect around commodity prices on corn and soy, and given the focus on planting intentions. And as we sit here today, we've got a couple of big markets still to clear through. We've got to finalize the North American market that we have in the ground right now. There are obviously going to be questions about the actual harvested quantities of grain versus the acres that got planted. So quality as well as yield is still a big question. 
And then we have a strong Latin American market to work through, both the summer and the safrinha seasons down there. So all in all, it could be shaping up to be a strong season as we see some snapback and a few of the things that I've talked about really start to add to our results in a very positive way.

Your question on what are the big ones that we're waiting on, I'd say the one that would kind of be at the top of my list right now would be Conkesta, which is the protein for above ground insect control in Brazil. And from like in-country cultivation perspective, that product is ready to go. What we're really waiting on is that really important China as well as European grain import tolerance. And in my conversations with folks that are involved in the trade negotiations with China, we know that these trades are on the list and have been discussed as opportunities once a trade deal gets finalized, as an opportunity for China to go ahead and approve the import of those, and that would really give us the green light. So that's really it.

Just looking at your existing Seed inventories, whatever is produced this year, are you at all worried about a potential shortfall in Seed production in the U.S. that could potentially force you to do some winter production in South America?

Thanks for that question. You're right. The early part of this season as we were working to shore up our planting plans and working with key growers across the North American market to kind of nail down acres and get our production -- kind of our production plans up and running. The good news about kind of our approach is, we've been doing this a long time, and we have a pretty broad footprint of production facilities kind of across North America. So as we saw those early rains starting, I can't say enough about our production team and how quickly they were able to relocate acres out of some of the hardest-hit states, Indiana, Illinois, even that Western Ohio area where we're pretty hard hit. And that allowed us to go in favor Seed production markets where we can take some of those extremes out of play. And -- so we've got good footprint in Nebraska, Iowa and other markets. So at this point right now, we feel like we've got the right amount of Seed in the ground for production, given where we think the market will turn out to be in 2020. And our early monitoring would suggest that the quality of that production is about where we would expect it to be. And so right now, we're not factoring in any big changes to our cost of goods on the Seed side, going into 2020, except maybe for the commodity price impact that might flow through. And in terms of winter production, right now we don't see any need or any plans to do that. But part of the reason why we don't think we'll need that in corn is we'll have some carryover. We got returns back early enough. We got it into storage to help protect the germination rate. And so that'll allow us to make sure we've got some additional quantities of Seed beyond our production out there. And on soybeans, we were right on top of the season there. So we feel good about where we're sitting."

And as we -- as the season unfolded. And so you had a few dynamics going on there. You did -- we did have the weather effects, replant rates, seed that we were swapping out as we tried to help with maturity  ranges. And so you see some of that effect clearly in our corn pricing. 
On soybeans, the key -- one of the key factors there was a really strong competitive environment that unfolded as you had quantities of seed out chasing fewer and fewer acres as that season unfolded. And we feel pretty good about the way we performed but we also felt like we needed to meet some of that competition, some of that demand to essentially hold where we are in the marketplace. The A-Series soybeans performance continues to be kind of at the top of the pack in terms of the comparisons. And we feel really good about the competitive side of that from the product performance. So we weren't going to let a lot of acres walk away from us. And then the other thing we talked about in our results is, we actually have a little more of our soybean business left report as we had seed deliveries that occurred into first part of the third quarter and you know from our revenue-recognition approach that we deliver -- when we deliver seed, we report that revenue.

But I'd emphasize that last fall we had really exceptional product performance with our A-Series soybean. So we had strong demand. One thing you've got to remember, when we were actively selling soybeans in the season, farmers were in a really difficult spot. Soybeans were really out of favor and a lot of uncertainty because that was kind of maybe the most severe impact from the trade disruption. So it was a tough environment. We definitely had some aggressive competitive actions. And I think part of that was a result of some of the -- really strong performance that we saw on our product line. And I would emphasize one other part is, it was a tough production season for us. And so we ended up selling more, what I would describe as reduced quality soybean. So that we had to make a price concession on that. So we definitely felt competitive pressure. We definitely had a difficult environment in terms of farmers' attitude towards soybeans. But that -- the fact that we did have to sell some lower germination beans and make a price concession impacted our price. The one thing I would emphasize is, from a technology adoption, we didn't see farmers trade down on technology. We saw them sticking with our leader products, and our technology mix actually ended up very close to what we had anticipated. So we didn't see necessarily a behavioral change from farmers, but it was definitely a challenging season on multiple fronts for soybeans."

What was the impact of this change in channel strategy? Did you see an increase in share? And given how big you are in -- with the Pioneer brand in terms of going direct to growers, you must have a pretty good feel for what actual acres are.

I'll start with your -- second part of your question and maybe I'll also toss it over to Tim to talk about the multichannel results here. So on acreage, you're right, with our Pioneer brand, we do get a good sense of what's going on. It's really hard for us to talk about that number, we're still waiting on USDA survey data. They've gone out and decided that they wanted to completely resurvey because some of their information coming in didn't make sense. And a lot of that is caught up between the actual what was planted versus their intentions to plant versus previous year. So we're sort of trying to sort through what is the basis that we're working off of here, is it intention? If I just keep it really simple and I think about what was planted last year versus this year. In corn, we could be down a couple of million acres year-over-year. I think when it all sorted out, there were strong intentions early. But when it actually settled, I think we could be down just a couple of million or so, a few million. 
And in soybeans, again, we still have a little bit of business to finish up here as we closed out the first part of the third quarter. So we're still getting data on that. But we could be down as much maybe as 10% in soybeans, which will be helpful around carryover and other things like that. So but it's still too early to really call it, and we're all waiting to see what USDA says here in a couple of days. And then, Tim, do you want to talk about multichannel a little bit?"

The -- what I would emphasize is, we -- as we went into the season, we were going through a very insignificant reorganization of our regional brands, that multichannel approach. And so we reduced the number of brands, we did some consolidation and that created disruption in the marketplace in terms of existing relationships in terms of dealers and customers. We had anticipated that we would lose some volume through that process. And I would describe what's happened through the process is very consistent or maybe even a little bit better than we had anticipated in terms of retention of our dealer network as well as retention of customers. So I think it's going well. 
On the retail side, this year was really about preparation for the future. So we were actively repositioning the Mycogen brand in retail. Part of that process is kind of turning over the product portfolio, and we're mid step from that. Last week, I had the opportunity to participate in a kickoff meeting with several of our key channel partners at the western Corn Belt there at Johnston and we were in -- we were kind of reintroducing the Mycogen brand to them, sharing what our plans for the future are for the brand. We introduced 42 new hybrids, so really excited about the products that we're putting on the table for them, and also working on building our business plans for 2020. So 2019 was really a transition year for Mycogen and 2020 is about really going out there and aggressively ramping up in the channel as we build that brand. And the thing I would emphasize is, as we think about 2019 and how the Seed year turned out, we've had very good insight, as you say, into kind of our relationship with farmers. We felt very comfortable how our order activity for both corn and soybeans had proceeded throughout the year. And as we went through the changes in the spring, obviously a lot of farmers, they were switching hybrids, potentially switching crops or flat-out going into preventive planting. We feel comfortable with how things have turned out. So we have a good understanding of the numerator when you talk about share, the denominator is a little uncertain right now but we feel like we've fared very well through the transition this spring and all the changes. And I think that direct relationship with farmers really played out in our favor."

And it really was about, kind of tied to that whole Xtend portfolio. So and we feel good about our conversions, we feel good about our product performance. And as we've talked before, we're about 65% or so of our lineup converted over to that. So when I look overall kind of at soybean pricing, we were probably down 0.1% kind of year-over-year and that is a direct response to that competition that was going on in that market. So hard for me to talk about kind of what -- where others were, what motivations were. But I can tell you we have some of the best-performing products in our A-Series lineup. And that really allowed us, I think, to hold our own in a lot of cases when things got really tight. 
So and then on your pricing around Enlist, it's a little early for us to be talking about how we're going to price that product. We've got some great demonstration going on out in the marketplace. We have a lot of really strong pent-up farmer demand that's coming to us about their excitement about the system, and we'll take a fresh look at that here at the year-end and compare that to, okay, what varieties are we going to have available, what are their performance attributes in terms of yield and Seed packages that'll be on board. And then we'll set the price accordingly along with all the benefits that the Enlist system brings in terms of convenience, ease of use, peace of mind, those type of things."

We've still got synergies to deliver it at the end of the year. And that is then tempered by some concerns that as this season will very naturally go long, just because everything got in late and farmers are going to -- they'll keep crops in the ground as long as they possibly can to milk as many degree days right out to the end as possible. And that could close windows that would allow for fall-applied Crop Protection as well as nitrogen product. So but we feel like we called that right, and that's the second half that we've outlooked basically around sales -- about reported sales down about 3% versus previous year. And it puts us on a full year basis of about flat when you look at just price volume. So we think we've got that dialed in.

And when it comes to product lineup, maybe I'll start, but I'll ask Rajan or Tim -- maybe Rajan to say a few words. We're clearly in the mode right now of exploring the integration of that trait into the elite Pioneer and Corteva germplasm that we have in house due to the timing of the merge and antitrust windows, we were sort of precluded from having any really good conversations and understanding of that technology until the deal closed last -- in September of 2018, so we -- 2017. So we really have -- now just had this one first good season to take a strong look at that. And so as we begin to ramp in 2020, we'll utilize germplasm that Dow already had, Dow AgroSciences had and had began that work in the Mycogen brand. Some of our partners out there are -- the other regional brands have had a look at that and had begun working with it, and we've got some partnerships with others where we can in-license technology for a few years until we can get that breeding engine that everybody really knows and respects out there in the market. So we can get that breeding engine up and running and start those conversions. So we might go through a couple of years where you're going to see a Corteva branded, Pioneer, Mycogen branded lineup in Enlist that won't compete with the elite-est of products that are out there, but it won't take as long to get right back up on that curve. I don't know. Rajan, anything else you'd add?"

And there's a little bit of land, I would say, in that Nebraska market where you had the horrific flooding and you had some sandy -- some sand that got up out of the rivers and kind of got into some pretty good farmland and growers are working hard to try to save that. But when you think about that total of all the millions of acres that are out there, you won't really feel that piece nearly as much.

And we've dialed in the fact that if acres go long and late, you may not get some of that late-season prep work that growers have traditionally tried to do to maybe take some of the heat off of the spring.  You get some fall-applied chemistry that goes out and get the fall-applied nitrogen and our nitrogen-fixation products. But we think we've got that dialed in about right for our outlook.

Earlier today, we reported the second quarter results for Corteva, our first quarter reporting as an independent company.

Earlier today, we reported the second quarter results for Corteva, our first quarter reporting as an independent company. Two months ago, on June 1, we completed the separation of Corteva from DowDuPont, a culmination of 3.5 years of journey and a significant milestone for our employees, our customers and now, we are pleased to say, our shareholders. With our spend, we created a new kind of ag company. A global pure play, built on a foundation of industry leadership and focused on bringing new and integrated solutions to farmers, enriching the lives of those who produce and those who consume, and ensuring progress for generations to come. That is our purpose. And our early days as a public company have deepened our resolve on delivering on that purpose. 
The unprecedented market backdrop for the second quarter presented considerable challenges to our customers and, in turn, to us; flooding, planting delays, prevented planting, delayed deliveries, insect pressures, trade-related market disruptions, the list is long and exceptional when viewed from the lens of history. In 150 years of tracking data in our industry, the events that transpired in North America region this season are without precedent. Now amid these historic events, both our spend and market disruptions, we've worked hard to deliver progress this quarter on our priorities for shareholder value creation noted on Slide 4. These priorities continue to guide our actions and underscore the quality of the results that we are targeting. 
First, 2 announcements this quarter reinforced our commitment to return the excess cash to shareholders. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next 3 years. Additionally, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, consistent with our earlier indications. These are proof points regarding our confidence in the strength of our long-term strategy. 
On our priority related to developing innovative solutions, I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter, we began recognizing licensing income related to our Enlist E3 trait, where we already have over 100 executed licenses to date. We also began seeing traction in the market in terms of units sold. Over 150,000 units were sold through our rep network in the quarter. Although this represents a small percentage of our overall units, it highlights our early groundwork toward reaching our target of having this technology on 10% of North America planted acres in 2020. 
Now beyond Enlist E3 soybeans, new product launches overall are driving both sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter with growth from Qrome and PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicides, Zorvec fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. 
We continue to see solid momentum in our Crop Protection product portfolio with geographic label expansions for Arylex, Isoclast, Rinskor and Zorvec. This includes the very recent registration we received in Brazil for Isoclast and Rinskor. 
On cost advantage and our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $115 million in cost synergies in the quarter and approximately $200 million in cost synergies through the first half of this year, exceeding the original target set for this time frame by about $50 million. Overall, when you add up what we have delivered since the merger close, we have realized cumulative cost savings of $700 million through the end of this quarter, which is approximately 60% of our $1.2 billion commitment. 
On top of that, we announced earlier this year that we are targeting an additional $500 million in operating EBITDA improvement over the next 5 years. To further our progress in this regard, we launched a company-wide initiative this quarter that we are calling Execute to Win, or E to W. This effort is focused on establishing an owner mindset for all of our employees to drive the cultural reinforcement that will be needed to deliver and sustain our growth and productivity gains long term. We look forward to providing additional detail on this effort and our productivity plans in the coming months. 
And finally, regarding our second quarter performance. Outside of North America, we realized net sales growth of 10% and organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter, demonstrating the balance inherent in our global operating footprint today. Though our results were negatively impacted by the North American market, we capitalized on strong performance outside of North America and realized results that demonstrate our ability to set expectations and deliver what we promised. 
So moving to Chart 5 and a few highlights on our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales decreased 3% versus the same quarter last year. Market disruptions due to the weather in North America significantly delayed planting, resulted in volume declines in both segments from reduced planted acres and missed Crop Protection applications during the quarter. 
Sales were also impacted by ongoing currency headwinds and pricing pressures in Seed. Outside of North America, organic net sales were up 17% versus the same period last year on both volume and price improvement, demonstrating the strength of our new product launches and reflecting significant benefit to the quarter from an early start to the season in Latin America. 
Operating EBITDA decreased 6% for the quarter, largely driven by declines in the North American market. Demand for new Crop Protection products resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the impact of currency, raw material cost increases and declines in North America. 
Selling, administrative and R&D costs declined 9% in the quarter on a net basis. This result highlights the benefit of our cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions our teams are taking to curtail spending in light of the impacts of the market-driven declines in our results. 
Slide 6 shows second quarter highlights by region. I'll start with our results in North America. North American sales declined 8% for the quarter due to the weather-related planting delays that drove reductions in planted area, a significant level of product switching and a loss of Crop Protection applications. Uncertainty remains on the planted acres, and the USDA announced plans to perform a broad resurvey in July that is expected to be released on August 12. 
In Crop Protection in North America, elevated channel inventories are impacting restocking. Additionally, competitive price actions, generic price pressure and large distributor inventory-reduction initiatives are impacting pricing. 
On a positive note, indications are that demand for Corteva Crop Protection products with Pioneer customers is strong, driven by joint offers like TruChoice and Corteva Cash. 
Moving to Latin America, we are seeing strong early demand with net sales up 39% on an organic basis. The trend toward an early season started in December of 2018 with the safrinha season and has continued with a very strong early start to the summer season. We estimate that approximately $80 million in sales that would normally have occurred in the third quarter have moved into the second quarter. 
Sales have also been bolstered by demand for new products, including year-over-year growth for picoxy, Dermacor and herbicides in Crop Protection in PowerCore Ultra and Leptra corn products in Seed. 
In Asia Pacific, with organic net sales up 10%, the clear headline is Crop Protection volume growth due to higher pest pressure and pricing on supply-constrained, high-demand products across. The region is seeing broad-based volume and price growth in Spinosyn insecticides across several markets and crops. Corteva is pleased to have a strong solution to offer customers to address pest pressures evident in the region. Our Spinosyn technology, while supply constrained, remains an important tool in the local market. 
In addition to the Spinosyn growth, the launch of Rinskor rice herbicide in China and pricing growth in both corn and rice seed contributed to results in the quarter in Asia Pacific. 
Finishing with Europe, Middle East and Africa, up 6% on an organic basis. EMEA has had a strong season, particularly in Seed. Share gains in our oil seed portfolio, particularly in sunflower in Eastern Europe and implementation of a direct agency model in Eastern Europe have delivered volume gains. 
The region also delivered organic growth in Crop Protection due to strong penetration of Lumiposa seed treatments. Increased demand for new Crop Production products, like Zorvec fungicide, recently launched in grapes and potatoes. And Arylex cereal herbicides are also contributing to growth in the region. Currency devaluation in the region has impacted overall sales growth by 9%. 
I'll turn now to Slide 7 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA results for the first half and updates to our guidance for the second half and full year operating EBITDA. Looking at the first half, pro forma operating EBITDA is down 13% compared to the same period last year. Our focus on controlling costs and realizing cost synergies delivered about $200 million in the first half, $50 million ahead of where we expected to be. 
In terms of volume and price, there were several drivers that impacted our results. Starting with new products, we generated $50 million of EBITDA improvement in the first half, predominantly in the Crop Protection segment. Price and volume improvements across the rest of our portfolio contributed $120 million in incremental benefit to the first half versus last year before we factor in the impact of the North American market. We estimate that the North American market for the first half represents an approximate $350 million headwind, an estimate that reflects lower-than-expected planted area for corn, soybeans and canola, missed Crop Protection applications and shifts to lower margin products, including shorter-maturity corn products. This estimate also includes the impact of delayed sales, a Seed deliveries shifted into the third quarter as well as early deliveries that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Netting with the seasonal shifts, the full year impact from the challenging market conditions in North America is estimated to be approximately $250 million. 
Looking ahead to the second half, due to the late North American season, we see some Seed revenue shifting into the third quarter, primarily in soybeans. This impact is almost directly offset by the volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early-season in Latin America. Consistent with our statements earlier this year on the second half, we continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply-constrained, high-demand products, primarily in our insecticide portfolio. And we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America in the second half. We will keep up our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, bringing our annual incremental savings to $350 million. On top of this, we are beginning to stage other productivity initiatives related to the additional $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA improvements I mentioned earlier. We'll have more to share on specific actions as we work through them. 
In total, we expect to deliver operating EBITDA that's about breakeven for the second half by using the midpoint of the range provided. This represents an approximate $200 million improvement over prior year, which is in line with the improvement we guided to back in May for the second half. We add it all up, this means we are guiding to an operating EBITDA range of $1.9 billion to $2.05 billion for fiscal 2019, down about 5% versus 2018, using the midpoint. On net sales for full year 2019, we expect declines of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. On an organic basis, we expect sales to be about flat year-over-year. 
Now before I turn the call over to Greg, I will summarize by saying that it is difficult to overstate how challenging this year has been to date. However, our team has waited a long time for the chance to be a standalone company, and we intend to show the market what we can deliver. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg, who will get into the details behind our second quarter and first half results Greg?"

Please note that all the periods, except for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effec",1673,"Thank you, Jim. Turning now to Slide 8 for a summary of our second quarter results. Please note that all the periods, except for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effects of our North America business from unprecedented weather-related events continued to impact our overall results for the second quarter via delayed planting and lower-than-expected planted area in corn, soybeans and canola and missed Crop Protection applications. Net sales of $5.6 billion were down 3% versus prior year on currency headwinds of 2%, a 1% decline in local price and volumes that were essentially flat. Excluding North America, Rest Of the World volumes were up 14%, led by strong early demand in Latin America Crop Protection products, including 73% year-over-year growth in sales from new products worldwide. 
This includes products, such as our Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide. Competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans coupled with higher replant in corn more than offset the price improvements we achieved in Asia Pacific from broad-based demand from new products across several crops and market. For Rest of the World, we recorded organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter versus prior year. 
Turning to operating EBITDA, we reported $1.45 billion or a 6% decline versus the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. Overall, declines were led by lower margins in Seed from the impacts of replanting corn and pricing pressures in soybeans. We delivered $115 million of synergies in the quarter, and currency was a headwind in the quarter. Our operating EBITDA margins were equally pressured by headwinds within Seed, driven by the overall North American market. This more than offset the 150 basis point margin expansion we delivered in Crop Protection in the second quarter. Overall, we delivered an operating EBITDA margin of 26%, down 80 basis points from the prior year on a pro forma basis. This translated into operating earnings per share of $1.42, down 9% from the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. 
Turning now to Slide 9 for a year-over-year comparison on our operating EPS. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.13 to operating EPS in the quarter, while volume and price improvements across the rest of the portfolio of $0.06 were offset by the impact of the North American market. Currency was a $0.05 headwind in the quarter. 
In addition, the impact of changes in our base tax rate on pretax income was a hurt of $0.07. Our base tax rate for the quarter, which excludes exchange gains and losses, was 17.4%, up from the second quarter of 2018 rate of 13.8%. 
And lastly, we generated $0.04 of benefit from foreign exchange gains, related to our hedging program to offset exposures for the foreign-currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet. 
Turning to our segment results, Slide 10 highlights the performance for the quarter and the half in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments. In Crop Protection, net sales were $3.3 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 2% from the prior period. 
The decrease was primarily due to a 5% decline from currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. 
For the quarter, our top line was impacted similarly by currency, offsetting the strong growth that we experienced in Latin America. 
Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $670 million for the first 6 months of 2019, down 10% from the first 6 months of 2018. Unfavorable currency, volume declines in North America and a higher input costs drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment delivered on cost synergies. In the quarter, Crop Protection delivered 150 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. 
In Seed, we reported net sales of $5.7 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 8% from the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to weather-related impacts in North America and the impact of early deliveries of corn seed in the fourth quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by a favorable corn seed demand in EMEA. Currency was a headwind of 3%. In the quarter, we saw similar impacts from the North America market, partially offset by strong early demand in Latin America. 
Seed operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion for the first half of '19 was equally challenged by the impact of the North American market, down 15%. 
Our results reflect pricing pressure and lower volumes from weather, coupled with unfavorable currency and the delivery of cost synergy benefits in the quarter. Our second quarter Seed operating EBITDA was equally impacted by the North American market. 
Turning now to Slide 11 for a closer look at our operating results on a seasonal or first-half basis. Starting with Crop Protection. Reported net sales were down 2%, primarily due to the impact of currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. Organic sales growth was 3%. And outside North America, organic sales growth was 17%. In North America, organic sales were down 17% on lower volumes due to lost spring applications in nitrogen stabilizers and corn and soybean herbicides from the impacts of wet weather. Latin America sales grew substantially with 43% organic growth on 37% higher volumes with strong early demand for the upcoming season. Approximately $80 million of sales were realized in the half which typically occur in the third quarter. Early demand was concentrated in our insect management product portfolio, including Spinosyn insecticide and Seed applied technologies as we worked with growers on providing the best solutions to the current pest challenges that they face in that market. We also delivered a 6% price improvement for the quarter, and currency was a headwind of 7% for the region. 
In Asia Pacific, organic net sales were up 16% on higher volume and price, our results reflect strong demand for insecticides from broad-based growth in several markets, coupled with continued traction in new products, like Rinskor herbicides and Isoclast insecticides. Currency was a headwind of 5%. 
In EMEA, organic sales were up 5%. Sales growth was driven by the strong and balanced season, coupled with continued demand for Zorvec fungicide. Currency was a headwind of 9%. 
Turning to Slide 12, where I'll cover the first half performance for our Seed segment. In Seed, reported net sales were down 8% on 4% lower volume, a 3% decline in currency and 1% lower price. Outside of North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 7%. 
In North America, Seed sales were down 10%. Volume was down 8% on weaker volumes from weather-related delays and reduced plantings, coupled with the early shipments of Seed that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Price was down 2% due to the competitive pricing environment around soybeans as well as higher corn replant. 
In Latin America, organic sales were up 2% driven by 2% higher volumes. We delivered an increased early demand for corn seed in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Currency was a headwind of 5%. 
And in Asia Pacific, organic sales were up 3% driven by higher prices in the Southeast Asia market. Volumes were flat to slightly up as we did see some demand impact on corn due to dry weather in the region. Currency was a headwind of 7%. 
And lastly, in EMEA, we delivered organic sales growth of 9% from volume and price improvements for the half on balanced and increased demand in the local market. Our top line results reflect strong demand for corn in Southern Europe as well as volume and price improvements, together with expected share gains in our sunflower lineup in Eastern Europe. Currency was a headwind of 10%. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update to the modeling guidance that we shared earlier this year for 2019. Just to recap Jim's earlier comment on how we will see the second half of the year playing out, we are expecting about a $200 million improvement in our operating EBITDA for the second half versus prior year. 
In terms of the quarterly split for the second half, we have historically run at a loss in the third quarter and generated a profit in the fourth quarter. In the 8-K we filed this morning, we have provided historical quarterly data for pro forma sales and operating EBITDA. 
For interest expense, given better visibility into our delevering of heritage debt, we have narrowed our range for interest expense to be $140 million to $160 million for 2019. 
The next few items remain unchanged from our prior guidance. Operating tax rate of 19% to 21%, and depreciation and amortization of $1 billion. 
Note that we exclude all amortization expense from our operating EPS, which is estimated at $400 million for 2019. Additionally, in terms of our $1 billion stock repurchase program, I would expect that we will capitalize on some opportunity in 2019 depending on the current market environment, cash levers and operating needs. We expect there will be more opportunity to expand on this in 2020. As it relates to costs and the current market environment, I will emphasize the focus the organization has on delivering on our commitments in light of the current market situation. This includes delivering on the synergy targets we have communicated, executing on the additional $500 million of operational EBITDA improvements over the next 5 years from ongoing productivity actions driven by Execute to Win, and reducing our standalone costs to achieve best-in-class cost structure as a company. 
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that I will host a webcast on August 15 to cover certain topics related to our standalone financials. Here, I will take a deeper dive into the modeling considerations and address some of the questions that we've received. More details to come, and I hope you can join us. I'll now turn the call back over to Megan to open the Q&A."

Clearly, we'll continue to have the synergy programs that we talked to you about flowing through the momentum that we're carrying through from 2019, and we've given guidance on kind of what to expect year-over-year in that area. It comes down to also then the market backdrop, what can be expect around commodity prices on corn and soy, and given the focus on planting intentions. And as we sit here today, we've got a couple of big markets still to clear through. We've got to finalize the North American market that we have in the ground right now. There are obviously going to be questions about the actual harvested quantities of grain versus the acres that got planted. So quality as well as yield is still a big question. 
And then we have a strong Latin American market to work through, both the summer and the safrinha seasons down there. So all in all, it could be shaping up to be a strong season as we see some snapback and a few of the things that I've talked about really start to add to our results in a very positive way.

Your question on what are the big ones that we're waiting on, I'd say the one that would kind of be at the top of my list right now would be Conkesta, which is the protein for above-ground insect control in Brazil. And from like in-country cultivation perspective, that product is ready to go. What we're really waiting on is that really important China as well as European grain import tolerance. And in my conversations with folks that are involved in the trade negotiations with China, we know that these trades are on the list and have been discussed as opportunities once a trade deal gets finalized, as an opportunity for China to go ahead and approve the import of those, and that would really give us the green light. So that's really it.

Thanks for that question. You're right. The early part of this season as we were working to shore up our planting plans and working with key growers across the North American market to kind of nail down acres and get our production -- kind of our production plans up and running. The good news about kind of our approach is, we've been doing this a long time, and we have a pretty broad footprint of production facilities kind of across North America. So as we saw those early rains starting, I can't say enough about our production team and how quickly they were able to relocate acres out of some of the hardest-hit states, Indiana, Illinois, even that Western Ohio area where we're pretty hard hit. And that allowed us to go in favor Seed production markets where we can take some of those extremes out of play. And -- so we've got good footprint in Nebraska, Iowa and other markets. 
So at this point right now, we feel like we've got the right amount of Seed in the ground for production, given where we think the market will turn out to be in 2020. And our early monitoring would suggest that the quality of that production is about where we would expect it to be. And so right now, we're not factoring in any big changes to our cost of goods on the Seed side, going into 2020, except maybe for the commodity price impact that might flow through. And in terms of winter production, right now we don't see any need or any plans to do that. But part of the reason why we don't think we'll need that in corn is we'll have some carryover. We got returns back early enough. We got it into storage to help protect the germination rate. And so that'll allow us to make sure we've got some additional quantities of Seed beyond our production out there. And on soybeans, we were right on top of the season there. So we feel good about where we're sitting."

And as we -- as the season unfolded. And so you had a few dynamics going on there. You did -- we did have the weather effects, replant rates, seed that we were swapping out as we tried to help with maturity ranges. And so you see some of that effect clearly in our corn pricing. 
On soybeans, the key -- one of the key factors there was a really strong competitive environment that unfolded as you had quantities of seed out chasing fewer and fewer acres as that season unfolded. And we feel pretty good about the way we performed but we also felt like we needed to meet some of that competition, some of that demand to essentially hold where we are in the marketplace. The A-Series soybeans performance continues to be kind of at the top of the pack in terms of the comparisons. And we feel really good about the competitive side of that from the product performance. So we weren't going to let a lot of acres walk away from us. 
And then the other thing we talked about in our results is, we actually have a little more of our soybean business left report as we had seed deliveries that occurred into first part of the third quarter and you know from our revenue-recognition approach that we deliver -- when we deliver seed, we report that revenue.

But I'd emphasize that last fall we had really exceptional product performance with our A-Series soybean. So we had strong demand. One thing you've got to remember, when we were actively selling soybeans in the season, farmers were in a really difficult spot. Soybeans were really out of favor and a lot of uncertainty because that was kind of maybe the most severe impact from the trade disruption. So it was a tough environment. We definitely had some aggressive competitive actions. And I think part of that was a result of some of the -- really strong performance that we saw on our product line. 
And I would emphasize one other part is, it was a tough production season for us. And so we ended up selling more, what I would describe as reduced quality soybean. So that we had to make a price concession on that. So we definitely felt competitive pressure. We definitely had a difficult environment in terms of farmers' attitude towards soybeans. But that -- the fact that we did have to sell some lower germination beans and make a price concession impacted our price. The one thing I would emphasize is, from a technology adoption, we didn't see farmers trade down on technology. We saw them sticking with our leader products, and our technology mix actually ended up very close to what we had anticipated. So we didn't see necessarily a behavioral change from farmers, but it was definitely a challenging season on multiple fronts for soybeans."

What was the impact of this change in channel strategy? Did you see an increase in share? And given how big you are in -- with the Pioneer brand in terms of going direct to growers, you must have a pretty good feel for what actual acres are. Some of the fertilizer companies are talking about acreage planted as low as 85 million to 87 million and maybe a snap back to 95 million next year. Would you agree with that assessment?"

I'll start with your -- second part of your question and maybe I'll also toss it over to Tim to talk about the multichannel results here. So on acreage, you're right, with our Pioneer brand, we do get a good sense of what's going on. It's really hard for us to talk about that number, we're still waiting on USDA survey data. They've gone out and decided that they wanted to completely resurvey because some of their information coming in didn't make sense. And a lot of that is caught up between the actual what was planted versus their intentions to plant versus previous year. So we're sort of trying to sort through what is the basis that we're working off of here, is it intention? If I just keep it really simple and I think about what was planted last year versus this year. In corn, we could be down a couple of million acres year-over-year. I think when it all sorted out, there were strong intentions early. But when it actually settled, I think we could be down just a couple of million or so, a few million. 
And in soybeans, again, we still have a little bit of business to finish up here as we closed out the first part of the third quarter. So we're still getting data on that. But we could be down as much maybe as 10% in soybeans, which will be helpful around carryover and other things like that. So but it's still too early to really call it, and we're all waiting to see what USDA says here in a couple of days. And then, Tim, do you want to talk about multichannel a little bit?"

The -- what I would emphasize is, we -- as we went into the season, we were going through a very insignificant reorganization of our regional brands, that multichannel approach. And so we reduced the number of brands, we did some consolidation and that created disruption in the marketplace in terms of existing relationships in terms of dealers and customers. We had anticipated that we would lose some volume through that process. And I would describe what's happened through the process is very consistent or maybe even a little bit better than we had anticipated in terms of retention of our dealer network as well as retention of customers. So I think it's going well. 
On the retail side, this year was really about preparation for the future. So we were actively repositioning the Mycogen brand in retail. Part of that process is kind of turning over the product portfolio, and we're mid-step from that. Last week, I had the opportunity to participate in a kickoff meeting with several of our key channel partners at the western Corn Belt there at Johnston and we were in -- we were kind of reintroducing the Mycogen brand to them, sharing what our plans for the future are for the brand. We introduced 42 new hybrids, so really excited about the products that we're putting on the table for them, and also working on building our business plans for 2020. So 2019 was really a transition year for Mycogen and 2020 is about really going out there and aggressively ramping up in the channel as we build that brand. 
And the thing I would emphasize is, as we think about 2019 and how the Seed year turned out, we've had very good insight, as you say, into kind of our relationship with farmers. We felt very comfortable how our order activity for both corn and soybeans had proceeded throughout the year. And as we went through the changes in the spring, obviously a lot of farmers, they were switching hybrids, potentially switching crops or flat-out going into preventive planting. We feel comfortable with how things have turned out. So we have a good understanding of the numerator when you talk about share, the denominator is a little uncertain right now but we feel like we've fared very well through the transition this spring and all the changes. And I think that direct relationship with farmers really played out in our favor."

And it really was about, kind of tied to that whole Xtend portfolio. So and we feel good about our conversions, we feel good about our product performance. And as we've talked before, we're about 65% or so of our lineup converted over to that. So when I look overall kind of at soybean pricing, we were probably down 0.1% kind of year-over-year and that is a direct response to that competition that was going on in that market. So hard for me to talk about kind of what -- where others were, what motivations were. But I can tell you we have some of the best-performing products in our A-Series lineup. And that really allowed us, I think, to hold our own in a lot of cases when things got really tight. 
So and then on your pricing around Enlist, it's a little early for us to be talking about how we're going to price that product. We've got some great demonstration going on out in the marketplace. We have a lot of really strong pent-up farmer demand that's coming to us about their excitement about the system, and we'll take a fresh look at that here at the year-end and compare that to, okay, what varieties are we going to have available, what are their performance attributes in terms of yield and Seed packages that'll be on board. And then we'll set the price accordingly along with all the benefits that the Enlist system brings in terms of convenience, ease of use, peace of mind, those type of things."

Yes, as we think about the second half of 2019, we've factored in what we believe is an appropriate level of -- we've got some great tailwinds coming from product pipelines. We've still got synergies to deliver it at the end of the year. And that is then tempered by some concerns that as this season will very naturally go long, just because everything got in late and farmers are going to -- they'll keep crops in the ground as long as they possibly can to milk as many degree days right out to the end as possible. And that could close windows that would allow for fall-applied Crop Protection as well as nitrogen product. So but we feel like we called that right, and that's the second half that we've outlooked basically around sales -- about reported sales down about 3% versus previous year. And it puts us on a full year basis of about flat when you look at just price volume. So we think we've got that dialed in. 
In terms of then cost for setup for 2020, and question earlier was about, if you have any issues around winter production, we don't think so, we think we've got the right seed in the right place for what we're going to need for 2020.

It's a standardizing way to talk about our lineup and our products. 
And when it comes to product lineup, maybe I'll start, but I'll ask Rajan or Tim -- maybe Rajan to say a few words. We're clearly in the mode right now of exploring the integration of that trait into the elite Pioneer and Corteva germplasm that we have in house due to the timing of the merge and antitrust windows, we were sort of precluded from having any really good conversations and understanding of that technology until the deal closed last -- in September of 2018, so we -- 2017. So we really have -- now just had this one first good season to take a strong look at that. And so as we begin to ramp in 2020, we'll utilize germplasm that Dow already had, Dow AgroSciences had and had began that work in the Mycogen brand. 
Some of our partners out there are -- the other regional brands have had a look at that and had begun working with it, and we've got some partnerships with others where we can in-license technology for a few years until we can get that breeding engine that everybody really knows and respects out there in the market. So we can get that breeding engine up and running and start those conversions. So we might go through a couple of years where you're going to see a Corteva branded, Pioneer, Mycogen branded lineup in Enlist that won't compete with the elite-est of products that are out there, but it won't take as long to get right back up on that curve.

And there's a little bit of land, I would say, in that Nebraska market where you had the horrific flooding and you had some sandy -- some sand that got up out of the rivers and kind of got into some pretty good farmland and growers are working hard to try to save that. But when you think about that total of all the millions of acres that are out there, you won't really feel that piece nearly as much. So I would say, no, I would believe that this market could come right back to where it has been previously and it's really just a function of how many acres go in the ground and the yield that will able to get out of those acres."

Earlier today, we reported the second quarter results for Corteva, our first quarter reporting as an independent company. Two months ago, on June 1, we completed the separation of Corteva from DowDuPont, a culmination of 3.5 years of journey and a significant milestone for our employees, our customers and now, we are pleased to say, our shareholders. With our spend, we created a new kind of ag company. A global pure play, built on a foundation of industry leadership and focused on bringing new and integrated solutions to farmers, enriching the lives of those who produce and those who consume, and ensuring progress for generations to come. That is our purpose. And our early days as a public company have deepened our resolve on delivering on that purpose. 
The unprecedented market backdrop for the second quarter presented considerable challenges to our customers and, in turn, to us; flooding, planting delays, prevented planting, delayed deliveries, insect pressures, trade-related market disruptions, the list is long and exceptional when viewed from the lens of history. In 150 years of tracking data in our industry, the events that transpired in North America region this season are without precedent. Now amid these historic events, both our spend and market disruptions, we've worked hard to deliver progress this quarter on our priorities for shareholder value creation noted on Slide 4. These priorities continue to guide our actions and underscore the quality of the results that we are targeting. 
First, 2 announcements this quarter reinforced our commitment to return the excess cash to shareholders. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next 3 years. Additionally, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, consistent with our earlier indications. These are proof points regarding our confidence in the strength of our long-term strategy. 
On our priority related to developing innovative solutions, I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter, we began recognizing licensing income related to our Enlist E3 trait, where we already have over 100 executed licenses to date. We also began seeing traction in the market in terms of units sold. Over 150,000 units were sold through our rep network in the quarter. Although this represents a small percentage of our overall units, it highlights our early groundwork toward reaching our target of having this technology on 10% of North America planted acres in 2020. 
Now beyond Enlist E3 soybeans, new product launches overall are driving both sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter with growth from Qrome and PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicides, Zorvec fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. 
We continue to see solid momentum in our Crop Protection product portfolio with geographic label expansions for Arylex, Isoclast, Rinskor and Zorvec. This includes the very recent registration we received in Brazil for Isoclast and Rinskor. 
On cost advantage and our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $115 million in cost synergies in the quarter and approximately $200 million in cost synergies through the first half of this year, exceeding the original target set for this time frame by about $50 million. Overall, when you add up what we have delivered since the merger close, we have realized cumulative cost savings of $700 million through the end of this quarter, which is approximately 60% of our $1.2 billion commitment. 
On top of that, we announced earlier this year that we are targeting an additional $500 million in operating EBITDA improvement over the next 5 years. To further our progress in this regard, we launched a company-wide initiative this quarter that we are calling Execute to Win, or E to W. This effort is focused on establishing an owner mindset for all of our employees to drive the cultural reinforcement that will be needed to deliver and sustain our growth and productivity gains long term. We look forward to providing additional detail on this effort and our productivity plans in the coming months. 
And finally, regarding our second quarter performance. Outside of North America, we realized net sales growth of 10% and organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter, demonstrating the balance inherent in our global operating footprint today. Though our results were negatively impacted by the North American market, we capitalized on strong performance outside of North America and realized results that demonstrate our ability to set expectations and deliver what we promised. 
So moving to Chart 5 and a few highlights on our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales decreased 3% versus the same quarter last year. Market disruptions due to the weather in North America significantly delayed planting, resulted in volume declines in both segments from reduced planted acres and missed Crop Protection applications during the quarter. 
Sales were also impacted by ongoing currency headwinds and pricing pressures in Seed. Outside of North America, organic net sales were up 17% versus the same period last year on both volume and price improvement, demonstrating the strength of our new product launches and reflecting significant benefit to the quarter from an early start to the season in Latin America. 
Operating EBITDA decreased 6% for the quarter, largely driven by declines in the North American market. Demand for new Crop Protection products resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the impact of currency, raw material cost increases and declines in North America. 
Selling, administrative and R&D costs declined 9% in the quarter on a net basis. This result highlights the benefit of our cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions our teams are taking to curtail spending in light of the impacts of the market-driven declines in our results. 
Slide 6 shows second quarter highlights by region. I'll start with our results in North America. North American sales declined 8% for the quarter due to the weather-related planting delays that drove reductions in planted area, a significant level of product switching and a loss of Crop Protection applications. Uncertainty remains on the planted acres, and the USDA announced plans to perform a broad resurvey in July that is expected to be released on August 12. 
In Crop Protection in North America, elevated channel inventories are impacting restocking. Additionally, competitive price actions, generic price pressure and large distributor inventory-reduction initiatives are impacting pricing. 
On a positive note, indications are that demand for Corteva Crop Protection products with Pioneer customers is strong, driven by joint offers like TruChoice and Corteva Cash. 
Moving to Latin America, we are seeing strong early demand with net sales up 39% on an organic basis. The trend toward an early season started in December of 2018 with the safrinha season and has continued with a very strong early start to the summer season. We estimate that approximately $80 million in sales that would normally have occurred in the third quarter have moved into the second quarter. 
Sales have also been bolstered by demand for new products, including year-over-year growth for picoxy, Dermacor and herbicides in Crop Protection in PowerCore Ultra and Leptra corn products in Seed. 
In Asia Pacific, with organic net sales up 10%, the clear headline is Crop Protection volume growth due to higher pest pressure and pricing on supply-constrained, high-demand products across. The region is seeing broad-based volume and price growth in Spinosyn insecticides across several markets and crops. Corteva is pleased to have a strong solution to offer customers to address pest pressures evident in the region. Our Spinosyn technology, while supply constrained, remains an important tool in the local market. 
In addition to the Spinosyn growth, the launch of Rinskor rice herbicide in China and pricing growth in both corn and rice seed contributed to results in the quarter in Asia Pacific. 
Finishing with Europe, Middle East and Africa, up 6% on an organic basis. EMEA has had a strong season, particularly in Seed. Share gains in our oil seed portfolio, particularly in sunflower in Eastern Europe and implementation of a direct agency model in Eastern Europe have delivered volume gains. 
The region also delivered organic growth in Crop Protection due to strong penetration of Lumiposa seed treatments. Increased demand for new Crop Production products, like Zorvec fungicide, recently launched in grapes and potatoes. And Arylex cereal herbicides are also contributing to growth in the region. Currency devaluation in the region has impacted overall sales growth by 9%. 
I'll turn now to Slide 7 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA results for the first half and updates to our guidance for the second half and full year operating EBITDA. Looking at the first half, pro forma operating EBITDA is down 13% compared to the same period last year. Our focus on controlling costs and realizing cost synergies delivered about $200 million in the first half, $50 million ahead of where we expected to be. 
In terms of volume and price, there were several drivers that impacted our results. Starting with new products, we generated $50 million of EBITDA improvement in the first half, predominantly in the Crop Protection segment. Price and volume improvements across the rest of our portfolio contributed $120 million in incremental benefit to the first half versus last year before we factor in the impact of the North American market. We estimate that the North American market for the first half represents an approximate $350 million headwind, an estimate that reflects lower-than-expected planted area for corn, soybeans and canola, missed Crop Protection applications and shifts to lower margin products, including shorter-maturity corn products. This estimate also includes the impact of delayed sales, a Seed deliveries shifted into the third quarter as well as early deliveries that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Netting with the seasonal shifts, the full year impact from the challenging market conditions in North America is estimated to be approximately $250 million. 
Looking ahead to the second half, due to the late North American season, we see some Seed revenue shifting into the third quarter, primarily in soybeans. This impact is almost directly offset by the volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early-season in Latin America. Consistent with our statements earlier this year on the second half, we continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply-constrained, high-demand products, primarily in our insecticide portfolio. And we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America in the second half. We will keep up our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, bringing our annual incremental savings to $350 million. On top of this, we are beginning to stage other productivity initiatives related to the additional $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA improvements I mentioned earlier. We'll have more to share on specific actions as we work through them. 
In total, we expect to deliver operating EBITDA that's about breakeven for the second half by using the midpoint of the range provided. This represents an approximate $200 million improvement over prior year, which is in line with the improvement we guided to back in May for the second half. We add it all up, this means we are guiding to an operating EBITDA range of $1.9 billion to $2.05 billion for fiscal 2019, down about 5% versus 2018, using the midpoint. On net sales for full year 2019, we expect declines of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. On an organic basis, we expect sales to be about flat year-over-year. 
Now before I turn the call over to Greg, I will summarize by saying that it is difficult to overstate how challenging this year has been to date. However, our team has waited a long time for the chance to be a standalone company, and we intend to show the market what we can deliver. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg, who will get into the details behind our second quarter and first half results Greg?"
319130234,630734810,1791995,"Corteva, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Corteva, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Turning now to Slide 8 for a summary of our second quarter results. Please note that all the periods, except for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effec",1673,"Thank you, Jim. Turning now to Slide 8 for a summary of our second quarter results. Please note that all the periods, except for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effects of our North America business from unprecedented weather-related events continued to impact our overall results for the second quarter via delayed planting and lower-than-expected planted area in corn, soybeans and canola and missed Crop Protection applications. Net sales of $5.6 billion were down 3% versus prior year on currency headwinds of 2%, a 1% decline in local price and volumes that were essentially flat. Excluding North America, Rest Of the World volumes were up 14%, led by strong early demand in Latin America Crop Protection products, including 73% year-over-year growth in sales from new products worldwide. 
This includes products, such as our Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide. Competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans coupled with higher replant in corn more than offset the price improvements we achieved in Asia Pacific from broad-based demand from new products across several crops and market. For Rest of the World, we recorded organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter versus prior year. 
Turning to operating EBITDA, we reported $1.45 billion or a 6% decline versus the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. Overall, declines were led by lower margins in Seed from the impacts of replanting corn and pricing pressures in soybeans. We delivered $115 million of synergies in the quarter, and currency was a headwind in the quarter. Our operating EBITDA margins were equally pressured by headwinds within Seed, driven by the overall North American market. This more than offset the 150 basis point margin expansion we delivered in Crop Protection in the second quarter. Overall, we delivered an operating EBITDA margin of 26%, down 80 basis points from the prior year on a pro forma basis. This translated into operating earnings per share of $1.42, down 9% from the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. 
Turning now to Slide 9 for a year-over-year comparison on our operating EPS. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.13 to operating EPS in the quarter, while volume and price improvements across the rest of the portfolio of $0.06 were offset by the impact of the North American market. Currency was a $0.05 headwind in the quarter. 
In addition, the impact of changes in our base tax rate on pretax income was a hurt of $0.07. Our base tax rate for the quarter, which excludes exchange gains and losses, was 17.4%, up from the second quarter of 2018 rate of 13.8%. 
And lastly, we generated $0.04 of benefit from foreign exchange gains, related to our hedging program to offset exposures for the foreign-currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet. 
Turning to our segment results, Slide 10 highlights the performance for the quarter and the half in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments. In Crop Protection, net sales were $3.3 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 2% from the prior period. 
The decrease was primarily due to a 5% decline from currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. 
For the quarter, our top line was impacted similarly by currency, offsetting the strong growth that we experienced in Latin America. 
Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $670 million for the first 6 months of 2019, down 10% from the first 6 months of 2018. Unfavorable currency, volume declines in North America and a higher input costs drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment delivered on cost synergies. In the quarter, Crop Protection delivered 150 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. 
In Seed, we reported net sales of $5.7 billion for the first 6 months of 2019, down 8% from the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to weather-related impacts in North America and the impact of early deliveries of corn seed in the fourth quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by a favorable corn seed demand in EMEA. Currency was a headwind of 3%. In the quarter, we saw similar impacts from the North America market, partially offset by strong early demand in Latin America. 
Seed operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion for the first half of '19 was equally challenged by the impact of the North American market, down 15%. 
Our results reflect pricing pressure and lower volumes from weather, coupled with unfavorable currency and the delivery of cost synergy benefits in the quarter. Our second quarter Seed operating EBITDA was equally impacted by the North American market. 
Turning now to Slide 11 for a closer look at our operating results on a seasonal or first-half basis. Starting with Crop Protection. Reported net sales were down 2%, primarily due to the impact of currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. Organic sales growth was 3%. And outside North America, organic sales growth was 17%. In North America, organic sales were down 17% on lower volumes due to lost spring applications in nitrogen stabilizers and corn and soybean herbicides from the impacts of wet weather. Latin America sales grew substantially with 43% organic growth on 37% higher volumes with strong early demand for the upcoming season. Approximately $80 million of sales were realized in the half which typically occur in the third quarter. Early demand was concentrated in our insect management product portfolio, including Spinosyn insecticide and Seed applied technologies as we worked with growers on providing the best solutions to the current pest challenges that they face in that market. We also delivered a 6% price improvement for the quarter, and currency was a headwind of 7% for the region. 
In Asia Pacific, organic net sales were up 16% on higher volume and price, our results reflect strong demand for insecticides from broad-based growth in several markets, coupled with continued traction in new products, like Rinskor herbicides and Isoclast insecticides. Currency was a headwind of 5%. 
In EMEA, organic sales were up 5%. Sales growth was driven by the strong and balanced season, coupled with continued demand for Zorvec fungicide. Currency was a headwind of 9%. 
Turning to Slide 12, where I'll cover the first half performance for our Seed segment. In Seed, reported net sales were down 8% on 4% lower volume, a 3% decline in currency and 1% lower price. Outside of North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 7%. 
In North America, Seed sales were down 10%. Volume was down 8% on weaker volumes from weather-related delays and reduced plantings, coupled with the early shipments of Seed that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Price was down 2% due to the competitive pricing environment around soybeans as well as higher corn replant. 
In Latin America, organic sales were up 2% driven by 2% higher volumes. We delivered an increased early demand for corn seed in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Currency was a headwind of 5%. 
And in Asia Pacific, organic sales were up 3% driven by higher prices in the Southeast Asia market. Volumes were flat to slightly up as we did see some demand impact on corn due to dry weather in the region. Currency was a headwind of 7%. 
And lastly, in EMEA, we delivered organic sales growth of 9% from volume and price improvements for the half on balanced and increased demand in the local market. Our top line results reflect strong demand for corn in Southern Europe as well as volume and price improvements, together with expected share gains in our sunflower lineup in Eastern Europe. Currency was a headwind of 10%. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update to the modeling guidance that we shared earlier this year for 2019. Just to recap Jim's earlier comment on how we will see the second half of the year playing out, we are expecting about a $200 million improvement in our operating EBITDA for the second half versus prior year. 
In terms of the quarterly split for the second half, we have historically run at a loss in the third quarter and generated a profit in the fourth quarter. In the 8-K we filed this morning, we have provided historical quarterly data for pro forma sales and operating EBITDA. 
For interest expense, given better visibility into our delevering of heritage debt, we have narrowed our range for interest expense to be $140 million to $160 million for 2019. 
The next few items remain unchanged from our prior guidance. Operating tax rate of 19% to 21%, and depreciation and amortization of $1 billion. 
Note that we exclude all amortization expense from our operating EPS, which is estimated at $400 million for 2019. Additionally, in terms of our $1 billion stock repurchase program, I would expect that we will capitalize on some opportunity in 2019 depending on the current market environment, cash levers and operating needs. We expect there will be more opportunity to expand on this in 2020. As it relates to costs and the current market environment, I will emphasize the focus the organization has on delivering on our commitments in light of the current market situation. This includes delivering on the synergy targets we have communicated, executing on the additional $500 million of operational EBITDA improvements over the next 5 years from ongoing productivity actions driven by Execute to Win, and reducing our standalone costs to achieve best-in-class cost structure as a company. 
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that I will host a webcast on August 15 to cover certain topics related to our standalone financials. Here, I will take a deeper dive into the modeling considerations and address some of the questions that we've received. More details to come, and I hope you can join us. I'll now turn the call back over to Megan to open the Q&A."

It comes down to also then the market backdrop, what can be expect around commodity prices on corn and soy, and given the focus on planting intentions. And as we sit here today, we've got a couple of big markets still to clear through. We've got to finalize the North American market that we have in the ground right now. There are obviously going to be questions about the actual harvested quantities of grain versus the acres that got planted. So quality as well as yield is still a big question. 
And then we have a strong Latin American market to work through, both the summer and the safrinha seasons down there. So all in all, it could be shaping up to be a strong season as we see some snapback and a few of the things that I've talked about really start to add to our results in a very positive way.

And in my conversations with folks that are involved in the trade negotiations with China, we know that these trades are on the list and have been discussed as opportunities once a trade deal gets finalized, as an opportunity for China to go ahead and approve the import of those, and that would really give us the green light.

So as we saw those early rains starting, I can't say enough about our production team and how quickly they were able to relocate acres out of some of the hardest-hit states, Indiana, Illinois, even that Western Ohio area where we're pretty hard hit. And that allowed us to go in favor Seed production markets where we can take some of those extremes out of play. And -- so we've got good footprint in Nebraska, Iowa and other markets. 
So at this point right now, we feel like we've got the right amount of Seed in the ground for production, given where we think the market will turn out to be in 2020. And our early monitoring would suggest that the quality of that production is about where we would expect it to be. And so right now, we're not factoring in any big changes to our cost of goods on the Seed side, going into 2020, except maybe for the commodity price impact that might flow through. And in terms of winter production, right now we don't see any need or any plans to do that. But part of the reason why we don't think we'll need that in corn is we'll have some carryover. We got returns back early enough. We got it into storage to help protect the germination rate. And so that'll allow us to make sure we've got some additional quantities of Seed beyond our production out there. And on soybeans, we were right on top of the season there. So we feel good about where we're sitting."

And as we -- as the season unfolded. And so you had a few dynamics going on there. You did -- we did have the weather effects, replant rates, seed that we were swapping out as we tried to help with maturity ranges. And so you see some of that effect clearly in our corn pricing. 
On soybeans, the key -- one of the key factors there was a really strong competitive environment that unfolded as you had quantities of seed out chasing fewer and fewer acres as that season unfolded. And we feel pretty good about the way we performed but we also felt like we needed to meet some of that competition, some of that demand to essentially hold where we are in the marketplace. The A-Series soybeans performance continues to be kind of at the top of the pack in terms of the comparisons. And we feel really good about the competitive side of that from the product performance. So we weren't going to let a lot of acres walk away from us. 
And then the other thing we talked about in our results is, we actually have a little more of our soybean business left report as we had seed deliveries that occurred into first part of the third quarter and you know from our revenue-recognition approach that we deliver -- when we deliver seed, we report that revenue. I've got Tim Glenn here with me obviously, our -- Head of our Commercial Teams, and he was right out there in the middle of all that. Tim, you got anything else us to add?"

But I'd emphasize that last fall we had really exceptional product performance with our A-Series soybean. So we had strong demand. One thing you've got to remember, when we were actively selling soybeans in the season, farmers were in a really difficult spot. Soybeans were really out of favor and a lot of uncertainty because that was kind of maybe the most severe impact from the trade disruption. So it was a tough environment. We definitely had some aggressive competitive actions. And I think part of that was a result of some of the -- really strong performance that we saw on our product line. 
And I would emphasize one other part is, it was a tough production season for us. And so we ended up selling more, what I would describe as reduced quality soybean. So that we had to make a price concession on that. So we definitely felt competitive pressure. We definitely had a difficult environment in terms of farmers' attitude towards soybeans. But that -- the fact that we did have to sell some lower germination beans and make a price concession impacted our price. The one thing I would emphasize is, from a technology adoption, we didn't see farmers trade down on technology. We saw them sticking with our leader products, and our technology mix actually ended up very close to what we had anticipated. So we didn't see necessarily a behavioral change from farmers, but it was definitely a challenging season on multiple fronts for soybeans."

And given how big you are in -- with the Pioneer brand in terms of going direct to growers, you must have a pretty good feel for what actual acres are.

I'll start with your -- second part of your question and maybe I'll also toss it over to Tim to talk about the multichannel results here. So on acreage, you're right, with our Pioneer brand, we do get a good sense of what's going on. It's really hard for us to talk about that number, we're still waiting on USDA survey data. They've gone out and decided that they wanted to completely resurvey because some of their information coming in didn't make sense. And a lot of that is caught up between the actual what was planted versus their intentions to plant versus previous year. So we're sort of trying to sort through what is the basis that we're working off of here, is it intention? If I just keep it really simple and I think about what was planted last year versus this year. In corn, we could be down a couple of million acres year-over-year. I think when it all sorted out, there were strong intentions early. But when it actually settled, I think we could be down just a couple of million or so, a few million. 
And in soybeans, again, we still have a little bit of business to finish up here as we closed out the first part of the third quarter. So we're still getting data on that. But we could be down as much maybe as 10% in soybeans, which will be helpful around carryover and other things like that. So but it's still too early to really call it, and we're all waiting to see what USDA says here in a couple of days. And then, Tim, do you want to talk about multichannel a little bit?"

The -- what I would emphasize is, we -- as we went into the season, we were going through a very insignificant reorganization of our regional brands, that multichannel approach. And so we reduced the number of brands, we did some consolidation and that created disruption in the marketplace in terms of existing relationships in terms of dealers and customers. We had anticipated that we would lose some volume through that process. And I would describe what's happened through the process is very consistent or maybe even a little bit better than we had anticipated in terms of retention of our dealer network as well as retention of customers. So I think it's going well. 
On the retail side, this year was really about preparation for the future. So we were actively repositioning the Mycogen brand in retail. Part of that process is kind of turning over the product portfolio, and we're mid-step from that. Last week, I had the opportunity to participate in a kickoff meeting with several of our key channel partners at the western Corn Belt there at Johnston and we were in -- we were kind of reintroducing the Mycogen brand to them, sharing what our plans for the future are for the brand. We introduced 42 new hybrids, so really excited about the products that we're putting on the table for them, and also working on building our business plans for 2020. So 2019 was really a transition year for Mycogen and 2020 is about really going out there and aggressively ramping up in the channel as we build that brand. 
And the thing I would emphasize is, as we think about 2019 and how the Seed year turned out, we've had very good insight, as you say, into kind of our relationship with farmers. We felt very comfortable how our order activity for both corn and soybeans had proceeded throughout the year. And as we went through the changes in the spring, obviously a lot of farmers, they were switching hybrids, potentially switching crops or flat-out going into preventive planting. We feel comfortable with how things have turned out. So we have a good understanding of the numerator when you talk about share, the denominator is a little uncertain right now but we feel like we've fared very well through the transition this spring and all the changes. And I think that direct relationship with farmers really played out in our favor."

And as we've talked before, we're about 65% or so of our lineup converted over to that. So when I look overall kind of at soybean pricing, we were probably down 0.1% kind of year-over-year and that is a direct response to that competition that was going on in that market. So hard for me to talk about kind of what -- where others were, what motivations were. But I can tell you we have some of the best-performing products in our A-Series lineup. And that really allowed us, I think, to hold our own in a lot of cases when things got really tight. 
So and then on your pricing around Enlist, it's a little early for us to be talking about how we're going to price that product. We've got some great demonstration going on out in the marketplace. We have a lot of really strong pent-up farmer demand that's coming to us about their excitement about the system, and we'll take a fresh look at that here at the year-end and compare that to, okay, what varieties are we going to have available, what are their performance attributes in terms of yield and Seed packages that'll be on board.

We've still got synergies to deliver it at the end of the year. And that is then tempered by some concerns that as this season will very naturally go long, just because everything got in late and farmers are going to -- they'll keep crops in the ground as long as they possibly can to milk as many degree days right out to the end as possible. And that could close windows that would allow for fall-applied Crop Protection as well as nitrogen product.

And when it comes to product lineup, maybe I'll start, but I'll ask Rajan or Tim -- maybe Rajan to say a few words. We're clearly in the mode right now of exploring the integration of that trait into the elite Pioneer and Corteva germplasm that we have in house due to the timing of the merge and antitrust windows, we were sort of precluded from having any really good conversations and understanding of that technology until the deal closed last -- in September of 2018, so we -- 2017. So we really have -- now just had this one first good season to take a strong look at that. And so as we begin to ramp in 2020, we'll utilize germplasm that Dow already had, Dow AgroSciences had and had began that work in the Mycogen brand. 
Some of our partners out there are -- the other regional brands have had a look at that and had begun working with it, and we've got some partnerships with others where we can in-license technology for a few years until we can get that breeding engine that everybody really knows and respects out there in the market. So we can get that breeding engine up and running and start those conversions. So we might go through a couple of years where you're going to see a Corteva branded, Pioneer, Mycogen branded lineup in Enlist that won't compete with the elite-est of products that are out there, but it won't take as long to get right back up on that curve.

And you look at our results in rest of the world, we have some pretty strong overall performance. And when I think about value and pricing and how that business really turned out, pricing Crop Protection was about flat for us globally and kind of up mid-single digits, if you just look at the rest of the world. So overall value there. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?"

I think seed treatment continuing to grow. We are expecting more than a double-digit growth this year. In the first half, we have seen that growth across the globe but definitely pronounced in Latin America. And so very excited about that, P.J. And just building on Jim's point about pricing, where we see the new products being launched, we are able to capture value in all parts of the globe. And North America, given the market dynamics, it was tough but I think there is cautious optimism on Crop Protection pricing across the globe. For example, if you see Asia Pacific, the products of Spinosyn, which we are seeing there, we have seen as much as a 10%, 11% price increase, a double-digit price increase, as a data point. So where there is value for new, differentiated product across Crop Protection, across the globe, we are seeing price increases."

Earlier today, we reported third quarter results for Corteva. Delivering solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year despite the emergence of currency headwinds in Latin America and additional weather-related impacts in several key regions. As we consider the market backdrop for this quarter, uncertainty regarding North America yield, production and ending stock levels for the 2019 season has persisted as an unprecedented planting season has now given away to an extraordinarily late harvest. 
To some extent, large carryover supplies have moderated market reaction to North American production problems, especially as markets expected Latin America to respond to elevated commodity prices with additional production. However, recent planting progress reports from Brazil, where markets were poised for a strong row crop season, indicate lack of rainfall is delaying soybean planting, which may have an impact on the timing and size of the second crop or Safrina. Coupled with production disruptions and delays, recent softening in the Chinese economy, African swine fever and slower growth in other emerging markets are impacting the demand outlook for for commodity grains and oilseeds. On trade, While China has resumed purchases of some U.S. agricultural products, the timing of a full resolution is still unknown. In the face of this considerable market turmoil, our teams have remained focused on the levers in our control, taking self-help actions and driving execution in the marketplace, while setting the stage for a solid 2020 when we expect more normal conditions to arrive in many sectors of the ag markets. 
Now as we did last quarter, we would like to start our update today with some longer-term perspective, where we can look beyond the market uncertainty that has continued to challenge our day-to-day operations to evaluate the progress we are making as a company relative to our priorities for shareholder value creation, noted on Slide 5. 
As I said last quarter, these priorities continue to guide our strategic actions and underscore the quality of results we are working to achieve particularly as we work dynamically to adjust to short-term market disruptions. Starting first on culture. We highlighted the launch of Execute To Win last quarter. With this, we are establishing an owner mindset for all the close to drive the cultural reinforcement that is needed to deliver and sustain our gains long term. So far, we've engaged more than 25% of our employee base in the initiative identification, planning and execution that we expect will ultimately contribute $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA over the next 5 years. 
On capital allocation, we remain committed to delivering cash to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to invest in innovation and growth. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next 3 years. This quarter, we repurchased $25 million in shares. Additionally, Corteva paid its first quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share on September 13 and has declared its second continuous quarterly dividend payable on December 18. In total, our actions so far will return approximately $220 million in cash to shareholders by the end of the year. 
On a priority related to developing innovative solutions, we delivered over $30 million in operating improvements from new products in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to deliver over $100 million in improvement in the second half and greater than $150 million for the full year. Crop Protection and new product sales increased 56% versus the same period last year and are on track to grow to 12% of our overall Crop Protection sales by the end of the year. Products driving net sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter included PowerCore Ultra and seed and Aralex herbicide, Isaria fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. We continue to see momentum in our Crop Protection portfolio, with notable geographic label expansions for RLX and Rincor herbicides, Isoclast Insecticide and Orbanic this quarter. 
On our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $100 million in cost synergies in the quarter and are on track to deliver approximately $150 million in cost synergies for the second half of 2019. Overall, we have now realized cumulative cost savings through the end of this quarter of $800 million out of the $1.2 billion commitment expected by 2021. 
Finally, seasonal shifts during the period and currency obscured several positive signs of operational momentum. Based on the current USDA acres, we are confident that we gained share in Pioneer brand, cooling and soybeans in North America. We also gained share in summer corn in Brazil and insecticides and fungicides globally. Further, in support of our growth in the Spinosad insecticides, we announced today a project approved by the Board of Directors to add manufacturing capacity for key Spinosin insecticide products to release supply constraints and grow our leadership in natural products, aligned with our market growth expectations in insecticides and natural products over the midterm horizon. 
Moving to Slide 6 and a few highlights of our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales on a reported basis decreased 2% versus the prior period primarily due to currency. Organic sales were flat for the quarter as weather drove offsetting shifts at the segment level. As we reported last quarter, market disruptions due to the weather in North America delayed planting and shifted seed sales into the third quarter, while strong early demand moved Crop Protection volume for Latin America into the second quarter. Further pressuring third quarter performance, a lack of seasonal rainfall in Brazil delayed soybean planting and Crop Protection applications, shifting crop protecting volumes into the fourth quarter primarily for Vessarya fungicide. 
Our operating EBITDA improved 18% compared to prior year largely driven by the margin benefit from the shift of seed volumes and the continued realization of cost synergies. Demand for new Crop Protection products also resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the more than $40 million hit to quarter from currency. Margin declines from higher corn and soybean replants and the seasonal shifts of Latin America Crop Protection volumes due to early demand, coupled with the delayed seasonal rains, further pressured operating EBITDA results for the quarter. For North America, when we exclude the impact of replant and despite the mix shift we experienced to shorter maturity products, we held corn price in our Pioneer brand.  We reduced selling, general and administrative and R&D costs 2% in the quarter on a net basis due to cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions taken to curtail spending. 
Now Slide 7 shows third quarter highlights by region. North America sales improved 16% for the third quarter due to weather-related planting delays that shifted seed sales recorded in soybeans into the period. While seed sales were up 102% compared to prior year, Crop Protection sales declined 7% as both delayed planting and delayed harvest impacted the timing of fertilizer and Crop Protection applications. The historically slow 2019 planting season in the U.S. has contributed to delays in harvest, fall field preparation and fall fertilizer applications. The most recent progress report indicated that only 41% of the U.S. corn and 62% of the U.S. soybeans were harvested. For corn, this percent harvested is the fourth slowest in the last 39 years and the soybean percent harvested is the sixth [ lowest ] Delayed planting and now harvest have contributed to elevated channel inventories and Crop Protection, combined with large distributor inventory reduction initiatives, restocking rates have slowed, delaying the timing of fall Crop Protection sales. 
While harvest slowly progresses, momentum is building in North America for the 2020 season. Our seed pricing for the 2020 North America season was released to our sales teams in September and demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our new product performance. We price for the value created by new technology, and we provide growers choice with high-performing seed offerings delivered through our multichannel, multibrand approach. 
We are preparing for an aggressive ramp of chrome corn products, which are expected to be approximately 20% of our lineup in 2020, and the launch of Lumias seed treatment, our new proprietary biobased nematocide, which will be launched in the Pioneer brand. In corn, considering the mix benefit from new technology, we expect to drive low single-digit price gains year-over-year in our Pioneer and multichannel brands. We are also expanding the Enlist E3 soybeans offerings in our commercial product lineup next year and expect the technology will penetrate 10% of the market. On price for soybeans, we expect to be flat due to continued market competitiveness. 
Moving to Latin America. Reported and organic net sales declined for the quarter largely due to the impact of weather-related volume shifts in Crop Protection and currency. As we noted last quarter, the strong early demand shifted approximately $80 million in sales that would normally have occurred in the third quarter into the second quarter. The delay of seasonal rains in Brazil in the third quarter slowed soybean planting progress and resulted in the shift of approximately $50 million in expected Crop Protection sales into the fourth quarter primarily from Vessarya fungicide. 
Seed reported net sales up 7% for the third quarter in Latin America largely due to the year-over-year price improvement. Strong performance of Leptra and PowerCore Ultra Corn products drove a 14% year-over-year increase in seed price. See volumes were down for the quarter due to the lack of seasonal rain delaying summer planting progress and input purchases in preparation for the Supremo season. We are paying close attention to the development of the crop season in Brazil as continued challenges may impact planting, Crop Protection applications, crop input technology selections and the size of the Suprema corn crop. We have also been following the presidential elections in Argentina and the decline of the Argentine peso, which has lost 35% of its value against the dollar as of the quarter end compared to the start of the year. Approximately, 20% of our Latin America net sales come from Argentina, and we are relatively insulated from the currency devaluation as sales are predominantly done in U.S. dollars. However, government policies unfavorable to agriculture, would impact our outlook for 2020 and beyond. 
In Asia Pacific, organic net sales were down 6% due to drought in key countries in the region, which significantly lowered planting and treated acres and drove lower Crop Protection volumes in the region for the quarter. Seed-reported net sales were up 19% year-over-year on strong volume in corn in Philippines and improved pricing in India due to high demand for other crops. 
Finishing up with Europe, Middle East and Africa: Up 3% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis. Continued increased demand for new Crop Protection products like ARLEC cereal herbicide contributed to growth in Crop Protection sales for the region in the quarter. In Seed, declines in canola due to drought conditions in North and Central Europe impacted volumes. Currency devaluation in the region lowered overall sales growth by 5%. Recent regulatory developments in Europe, particularly the announced ban of corporates insecticide in several countries, have not had a meaningful impact on the quarter. We are still quantifying the impact to 2020 but expect the impact for all regulatory challenged products to be only $10 million and offset by expanded registrations for new Crop Protection products, like Arylex and Rinskor Herbicides and Zorvec fungicides. 
So now I'll turn to Slide 8 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA for the second half and full year 2019. Last quarter, we shared our expectation to deliver operating EBITDA about breakeven for the second half. Due to further negative impact from currency, operating EBITDA is now expected to be a loss of $70 million compared to the same period last year, which is the lower end of the previous range. Currency, particularly the devaluation of the Brazilian real, is expected to reduce second half results by about $80 million overall. Other drivers that we outlined last quarter as part of our second half guidance are on track to deliver. Due to the late North America season, we recognized seed revenues in the third quarter, which offset the Crop Protection volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early demand for products in Latin America. 
We continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply constrained, high-demand products primarily in our insect management portfolio, and we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America largely due to the expansion of new products like the Seria fungicide as well as Leptra and PowerCore Ultra corn products. We have also maintained our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, targeted to deliver over $150 million in incremental savings, which will bring our annual incremental savings to $350 million. 
In total,  the second half guidance represents an approximate $130 million or 65% improvement over the prior year. Full year pro forma operating EBITDA is now expected to be about $1.9 billion, the low end of the previous range and down about 8% versus 2018. 
We are affirming the full year indication for net sales as a decline of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. On an organic basis, we still expect sales to be about flat year-over-year. Before I turn the call over to Greg, I'll summarize by commending our teams around the globe for an extraordinary effort in the quarter to support our customers in the face of numerous challenges. Porteva achieved solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year and made ongoing progress on our priorities for shareholder value creation. We remain focused on driving operational discipline and committed to setting the stage for solid net sales and operating earnings growth in 2020. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

Please note that the prior year period is on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating earnings per share. As Jim covered, 2019 continues to be a very dynamic and complex operating environment, particularly in North America and Latin America, which is evident in our third quarter results. Net sales of $1.9 billion were down 2% versus prior year on a 3% increase in volumes, offset by a 3% decline in local price and a 2% headwind from currency. North America volumes were up 31% in the quarter as a result of soybean and corn sales that shifted from the prior quarter due to delayed planting. Offsetting this was the early demand we experienced for Crop Protection products for Latin America in the prior quarter and delays in the Brazil soybean season, which shifted expected Crop Protection sales into the fourth quarter. 
Local price was impacted by competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans, higher replant in soybeans and corn and the impact of grower incentive discounts in North America. 
Turning to operating EBITDA. We reported a loss of $207 million, which was an 18% improvement versus the prior year period on a pro forma basis. Overall, the improvement was driven by favorable timing shifts in North America seed sales and roughly $100 million in cost savings from synergies that we delivered during the period. These were partially offset by shifts in Crop Protection sales in Latin America, and currency was a headwind. We delivered expansion in our overall operating EBITDA margin in the quarter as a result of the timing shifts we discussed earlier and cost synergies recognized during the period. 
All in all, operating EBITDA margins improved by more than 200 basis points, led by our Seeds segment. This translated into a loss of $0.39 for operating earnings per share, up 35% from the third quarter 2018 on a pro forma basis. 
Turning to Slide 10 for a year-over-year comparison of our operating earnings per share. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.14 of operating EPS in the quarter, while volume contributed $0.08 of improvement primarily due to the sales shifts in seed and new product sales we delivered in the quarter, a $0.12 headwind on pricing and costs, with a product of increased replan in soybeans and corn and increased grower incentive discount, coupled with higher commissions and new product launch costs. 
Currency was a $0.06 headwind in the quarter. In addition, tax was a benefit of $0.04. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%, up from the third quarter 2018 rate of 2.4%. Lastly, we generated $0.13 of benefit primarily from foreign exchange gains related to our hedging programs to offset exposures for the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet. 
Turning to our segment results. Slide 11 highlights the performance for the quarter in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments. In Crop Protection, net sales were $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 12% from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to an 11% organic decline, predominantly from volume shifts in Latin America, coupled with a 1% headwind from currency. Crop Protection operated EBITDA was $119 million for the quarter, down 25% from the prior year period. Volume declines in Latin America, grower incentive discounts in North America, new product launch costs and currency drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment continued to deliver on cost synergies. 
In Seed, we reported net sales of $681 million for the quarter, which is up 24% from the same period last year. Higher sales were principally from a 31% increase in volumes as a result of the weather-related delays from North America, which shifted seed sales from the second quarter into the third quarter. Local price was a headwind of 5% in the quarter due to higher replant in soybeans and corn in North America. Currency was a headwind of 2%. 
Seed operating EBITDA was a loss of $295 million, an improvement of almost $80 million over the prior year period. Our results reflect the shift of soybean and corn sales in North America and continued progress on cost savings recognized in the quarter. Unfavorable local price impacted by replant and currency headwinds partially offset the year-over-year volume improvement. Seed operating EBITDA margin improved by almost 25 percentage points. 
Turning now to Slide 12 and an update on our modeling guidance, including a bridge of operating EBITDA to operating earnings per share for the full year 2019. Touching first on net sales, we continue to expect to be down about 3% over prior year unchanged from prior guidance. This is due to unfavorable currency. Organic sales are essentially flat. We now expect depreciation expense to be approximately $575 million and interest expense to be about $100 million for the year based on our current forecast. We have updated our estimate on exchange losses, net of tax, which reflects our full-year estimate for the cost of the program now expect a $70 million to $80 million loss for the year. Based on the $1.9 billion operating EBITDA guidance for the year, this translates into an operating earnings per share range of $1.20 per share to $1.26 per share at a midpoint of $1.23 per share. This represents about a $0.04 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance on operating earnings per share. 
Before I turn the call back to Megan, I want to touch on the directional targets we provided for 2020 operating EBITDA back in August. We remain committed to executing against our cost synergies and productivity programs that we outlined and fully expect to deliver on those targets in 2020. You will recall, in August, that we sized anticipated headwinds of approximately $100 million for the next year, but we continue to monitor market conditions that may alter that estimate. We are evaluating planted acres and costs for the next year. It is too early to provide definitive guidance. Our focus is still on delivering a solid year of growth in both net sales and operating EBITDA for 2020. We will provide more definitive guidance during our fourth quarter call, and I look forward to sharing more at that time. I'll now turn the call back to Megan to open the Q&A."

Well, as we look at 2020 in terms of the planted area in North America, I think the expectation we should have is that we'll return to more of a normal level. And so that would imply something in the neighborhood of about 11 million acres that would come back into production on corn and soy. And from that point, when you determine the next critical thing is the mix between corn and soy. And so we're -- we monitor closely the ratio between soybeans and corn prices, commodity prices. And today, that sits somewhere in the neighborhood of around [ 2.4 ] And at that level, it would imply that somewhere in the neighborhood of about 1/3 of that around 11 million acres would come back into corn with the balance going to soybean. So I know that is very dynamic, and that's changing every day. And over the course of of weeks or months in between now and planting, that can vary quite a lot. And that's one of the real key indicators that we're looking at. So today, that would -- that's the implications we see, we monitor it every day and will continue to do that all the way until farmers make their final decisions."

So yes, when you look at our SG&A line on the income statement, there are some nonoperating costs included in that line item. So those non-operating costs, in fact, are up year-over-year, and those are costs that are specifically related to our discontinued businesses, things like increased litigation costs or increased costs related to remediation -- environmental remediation. So if you take that piece out, we're relatively flat to slightly up, as you said, in SG&A. And the key driver of that in the third quarter is commissions. Commissions are variable based on our revenue. So -- and in particular, to seed. So with our seed revenues going up as significantly as they did in the third quarter, there's a proportional element that increased our commission expense. There's also another component of commissions that did increase as well and that is some competitive rate increases that we implemented earlier at the beginning of this year to bring our commission structure up to market rates. So if you take those increases, yet you also take into account the cost savings that that we executed relative to our synergy and then also some reductions that you see on the corporate line item, net-net SG&A for the quarter was was about flat to slightly up."

And at the end of the day, they're going to evaluate what their best options are. We price for value. Our approach this year is to have roughly flat on soybeans, and that is the combination of some existing products in our lineup that may be flat with year-over-year were possibly adjusted down a little bit and the new varieties that come into our lineup, really driving some upside in pricing opportunity. So it's a highly competitive market, no question. We're very blessed that we've got a strong portfolio of products in both the PiOneer and multichannel brands. We've got the -- I feel very confident that we're setting the pace in terms of product performance on the round of ray to extend segment. We've got extremely strong demand for our Enlist E3 technology, and those Enlist E3 products are priced comparable to our leading varieties. And so it's a combination of many things primarily mix-driven, that's going to allow us to hold price as we move into 2020. But you're exactly right.

As we said earlier, obviously, we're monitoring a number of factors as we head into 2020. The first of those that Greg mentioned, and others asked about, is the, kind of, the way that the recovery in the market in North America. So first and foremost, you have to acknowledge, 2019 was an unprecedented year we have not seen in the industry in a long. So as we more normalize and move into 2020, we'll expect to see a lot of that come back. And that's in our core market. It's in North America. It's where we have our largest lineup. And so obviously, it affected us disproportionately than in our business around the world. If you then strip out North America and look at rest of the world, 2019 has been an extraordinary year. Year-to-date, we've got our different regions are -- like Europe, Asia, Latin America, they're all organically 7%. We've got insecticides growth. Our entire insecticide portfolio year-to-date is up 9%. So you strip out just what happened in North America and you can really see the energy and the momentum in the rest of the world and behind the scenes. On top of that, and as we said, going into 2020, we're going to carry -- continue to carry through on the cost synergy momentum that we've had. We have good line of sight and visibility as well as additional productivity actions that we have taken to really respond to the market conditions that are going on so we can be in a better position to support our customers. And then third on that list is new products, where you've heard Tim talk about Enlist. We're excited about that lineup now, really hitting that hard. We'd expect Enlist to grow to be about 10% of the overall market. We've got chrome coming in, there's been a nice lift on chrome. And then there's a lineup of Crop Protection products like Aerex in Europe, one of the strongest new herbicides being launched in cereals, RINs core for rice, IsoClast and Zorvec in specialty crops that are doing really well, so that pipeline has to be the third marquee element of that. So a recovery in North America, continued great momentum on cost synergies and additional productivity actions and then our new product pipeline. 
As we take a step back from the income statement and really look at where we're going to sit with our balance sheet, obviously, we've got a strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders. And we talked a lot about that in the past around the dividend announcement but also a continued commitment as we go forward around an appropriate amount of share repurchases. So I think that is a pretty compelling story as to why Corteva's a great vote here going forward."

And so coming off a really strong performance in 2018, we carried a lot of momentum on the product side, a lot of energy from our sales team. And so we felt very good about where we were prior to, sort of, the season breaking and chaos ensuing. I think the fact that we were able to be there, our route to model is definitely working in our advantage, our ability to go out there and serve customers as they were dealing with some of the adversity, potentially changing from one maturity to another in corn, evaluating other crop options, that hustle, that execution definitely made a difference. And I think that it helped translate into a strong finish for the year. The -- what we carry into 2020, to me, I think that those actions that we made this spring and into the summer, that strengthens the relationship. But we expect that customers are going to have a very positive experience with our product. Again, coming off that high level of service, we believe it's sustainable. And we have long-standing relationships with farmer customers and this only builds off of that. So it was a tough year at times, it felt like our sales team was was not making a lot of progress just because so many changes and so much uncertainty. But tough years is when you really strengthen those relationships. And given that, with our product performance, really excited about what we carry into 2020."

It was more like 30% above what that 5-year average was. And you look back at the season, and obviously, not surprising considering the weather challenges we had. And I would say, in Latin America, a couple of things that are driving our ability to price. One would be -- we've got very strong performance, and we've been able to effectively establish the robot brand and position the Pioneer brand appropriately so very good overall product performance. And then we're getting a strong benefit from the continued increase in utilization of new technologies like PowerCore Ultra and our Leptra hybrids. So it's a combination of mix.

Clearly, as I think Tim mentioned earlier, we watch that soybean-to-corn price ratio really closely because over the years that we've been watching this, there isn't a difference point where the economics and the value of those 2 crops, sort of, balance. And so as we see pricing differences, we see that ratio swing, and we watch demand swing with that for corn. So right now, the scenario that's out there, it's the best data that we really have, the USDA estimates around yield but also USDA estimates around intended planting for 2020, would say that we will see a little bit more corn, and we'll see a -- maybe the balance, 1/3, 2/3 more of those acres that Tim mentioned coming back into soybeans. So if you saw a big swing in price more towards corn, you'd see growers respond to that. The way our portfolio sits today on a net margin basis, as we've said many times before, our profitability would favor stronger corn acres than soybean acres. But we're really starting to change that equation. You start to think about the penetration that we'll have with Enlist going forward as we've added other products to our portfolio, the A series soybeans and the relative performance that we're having on that portfolio and our ability to price for the value that we deliver, it's starting to moderate that margin slight -- that margin difference slightly. So we're just going to put ourselves in a position to respond to the market with however it turns out, and we'll be ready, depending on those 2 areas."

You really can't just look here at third quarter and really compare what's going on. If I step back from that, our Latin America business overall for the year, organically, is up 8%. So you said it accurately. There was a large portion of our Crop Protection business because of the products we sell and the timing of the market was really accelerated into the second quarter, and we reported out on that very, very specifically. And then on top of that, we've got some of the leading fungicides for soybeans in Brazil, and you're all reading about what's happening with this -- with the planting in Brazil. Due to the lack of rains, we've had a slightly delayed planting. And so the setup for our products has shifted a little bit here into fourth quarter. And we've got good indications that, that flow of products is happening. We've got October essentially behind us here, and we can see good volume growth. So -- and when you step back then and look at insecticides overall, it again, really is not a story year-to-date. Our insecticide business in Latin America is up as much as 30%. And globally, our Insect portfolio is up 9%, and we'd expect the market maybe is more like 5%, mid-5% range. So we're outpacing the market.

But as Jim said, globally, insecticide portfolio continues to grow, and we continue to have high expectations of this portfolio for 2020 and beyond."

Earlier today, we reported third quarter results for Corteva. Delivering solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year despite the emergence of currency headwinds in Latin America and additional weather-related impacts in several key regions. As we consider the market backdrop for this quarter, uncertainty regarding North America yield, production and ending stock levels for the 2019 season has persisted as an unprecedented planting season has now given way to an extraordinarily late harvest. To some extent, large carryover supplies have moderated market reaction to North American production problems, especially as markets expected Latin America to respond to elevated commodity prices with additional production. However, recent planting progress reports from Brazil, where markets were poised for a strong row crop season, indicate lack of rainfall is delaying soybean planting, which may have an impact on the timing and size of the second crop or safrinha. Coupled with production disruptions and delays, recent softening in the Chinese economy, African swine fever and slower growth in other emerging markets are impacting the demand outlook for commodity grains and oilseeds. On trade, while China has resumed purchases of some U.S. agricultural products, the timing of a full resolution is still unknown. In the face of this considerable market turmoil, our teams have remained focused on the levers in our control, taking self-help actions and driving execution in the marketplace, while setting the stage for a solid 2020 when we expect more normal conditions to arrive in many sectors of the ag markets.
Now as we did last quarter, we would like to start our update today with some longer-term perspective, where we can look beyond the market uncertainty that has continued to challenge our day-to-day operations to evaluate the progress we are making as a company relative to our priorities for shareholder value creation, noted on Slide 5. As I said last quarter, these priorities continue to guide our strategic actions and underscore the quality of results we are working to achieve, particularly as we work dynamically to adjust to short-term market disruptions.
Starting first on culture. We highlighted the launch of Execute To Win last quarter. With this, we are establishing an owner mindset for all employees to drive the cultural reinforcement that is needed to deliver and sustain our gains long term. So far, we've engaged more than 25% of our employee base in the initiative identification, planning and execution that we expect will ultimately contribute $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA over the next 5 years. On capital allocation, we remain committed to delivering cash to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to invest in innovation and growth. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next 3 years. This quarter, we repurchased $25 million in shares. Additionally, Corteva paid its first quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share on September 13 and has declared its second continuous quarterly dividend payable on December 18. In total, our actions so far will return approximately $220 million in cash to shareholders by the end of the year. On our priority related to developing innovative solutions, we delivered over $30 million in operating improvement from new products in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to deliver over $100 million in improvement in the second half and greater than $150 million for the full year. Crop Protection and new product sales increased 56% versus the same period last year and are on track to grow to 12% of our overall Crop Protection sales by the end of the year. Products driving net sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter included PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicide, Vessarya fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. We continue to see momentum in our Crop Protection portfolio, with notable geographic label expansions for Arylex and Rinskor herbicides, Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide this quarter.
On our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $100 million in cost synergies in the quarter and are on track to deliver approximately $150 million in cost synergies for the second half of 2019. Overall, we have now realized cumulative cost savings through the end of this quarter of $800 million out of the $1.2 billion commitment expected by 2021. Finally, seasonal shifts during the period and currency obscured several positive signs of operational momentum. Based on the current USDA acres, we are confident that we gained share in Pioneer brand corn and soybeans in North America. We also gained share in summer corn in Brazil, and insecticides and fungicides globally. Further, in support of our growth in the Spinosyn insecticides, we announced today a project approved by the Board of Directors to add manufacturing capacity for key Spinosyn insecticide products to release supply constraints and grow our leadership in natural products, aligned with our market growth expectations in insecticides and natural products over the midterm horizon.
Moving to Slide 6 and a few highlights of our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales on a reported basis decreased 2% versus the prior period primarily due to currency. Organic sales were flat for the quarter as weather drove offsetting shifts at the segment level. As we reported last quarter, market disruptions due to the weather in North America delayed planting and shifted seed sales into the third quarter, while strong early demand moved Crop Protection volume for Latin America into the second quarter. Further pressuring third quarter performance, a lack of seasonal rainfall in Brazil delayed soybean planting and Crop Protection applications, shifting crop protecting volumes into the fourth quarter primarily for Vessarya fungicide.
Our operating EBITDA improved 18% compared to prior year, largely driven by the margin benefit from the shift of seed volumes and the continued realization of cost synergies. Demand for new Crop Protection products also resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the more than $40 million hit to quarter from currency. Margin declines from higher corn and soybean replants and the seasonal shifts of Latin America Crop Protection volumes due to early demand, coupled with the delayed seasonal rains, further pressured operating EBITDA results for the quarter. For North America, when we exclude the impact of replant and despite the mix shift we experienced to shorter maturity products, we held corn price in our Pioneer brand. We reduced selling, general and administrative and R&D cost 2% in the quarter on a net basis due to cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions taken to curtail spending.
Now Slide 7 shows third quarter highlights by region. North America sales improved 16% for the third quarter due to weather-related planting delays that shifted seed sales recorded in soybeans into the period. While seed sales were up 102% compared to prior year, Crop Protection sales declined 7% as both delayed planting and delayed harvest impacted the timing of fertilizer and Crop Protection applications. A historically slow 2019 planting season in the U.S. has contributed to delays in harvest, fall field preparation and fall fertilizer applications. The most recent crop progress report indicated that only 41% of the U.S. corn and 62% of the U.S. soybeans were harvested. For corn, this percent harvested is the fourth slowest in the last 39 years and the soybean percent harvested is the sixth slowest. Delayed planting and now harvest have contributed to elevated channel inventories in Crop Protection, combined with large distributor inventory reduction initiatives, restocking rates have slowed, delaying the timing of fall Crop Protection sales. While harvest slowly progresses, momentum is building in North America for the 2020 season. Our seed pricing for the 2020 North America season was released to our sales teams in September and demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our new product performance. We price for the value created by new technology, and we provide growers choice with high-performing seed offerings delivered through our multichannel, multibrand approach.
We are preparing for an aggressive ramp of chrome corn products, which are expected to be approximately 20% of our lineup in 2020, and the launch of Lumiposa seed treatment, our new proprietary bio-based nematocide, which will be launched in the Pioneer brand. In corn, considering the mix benefit from new technology, we expect to drive low single-digit price gains year-over-year in our Pioneer and multichannel brands. We are also expanding the Enlist E3 soybean offerings in our commercial product lineup next year and expect the technology will penetrate 10% of the market. On price for soybeans, we expect to be flat due to continued market competitiveness.
Moving to Latin America. Reported and organic net sales declined for the quarter, largely due to the impact of weather-related volume shifts in crop protection and currency. As we noted last quarter, the strong early demand shifted approximately $80 million in sales that would normally have occurred in the third quarter into the second quarter. The delay of seasonal rains in Brazil in the third quarter slowed soybean planting progress and resulted in the shift of approximately $50 million in expected Crop Protection sales into the fourth quarter primarily from Vessarya fungicide. Seed reported net sales up 7% for the third quarter in Latin America, largely due to the year-over-year price improvement. Strong performance of Leptra and PowerCore Ultra corn products drove a 14% year-over-year increase in Seed price. Seed volumes were down for the quarter due to the lack of seasonal rain delaying summer planting progress and input purchases in preparation for the safrinha season. We are paying close attention to development of the crop season in Brazil as continued challenges may impact planting, Crop Protection applications, crop input technology selections and the size of the safrinha corn crop. We have also been following the presidential elections in Argentina and the decline of the Argentine peso, which has lost 35% of its value against the dollar as of the quarter end compared to the start of the year. Approximately, 20% of our Latin America net sales come from Argentina, and we are relatively insulated from the currency devaluations as sales are predominantly done in U.S. dollars. However, government policies unfavorable to agriculture would impact our outlook for 2020 and beyond.
In Asia Pacific, organic net sales were down 6% due to drought in key countries in the region, which significantly lowered planting and treated acres and drove lower Crop Protection volumes in the region for the quarter. Seed reported net sales were up 19% year-over-year on strong volume in corn in Philippines and improved pricing in India due to high demand for other crops.
Finishing up with Europe, Middle East and Africa: Up 3% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis. Continued increased demand for new Crop Protection products like Arylex cereal herbicide contributed to growth in Crop Protection sales for the region in the quarter. In Seed, declines in canola due to drought conditions in North and Central Europe impacted volumes. Currency devaluation in the region lowered overall sales growth by 5%. Recent regulatory developments in Europe, particularly the announced ban of Chlorpyrifos insecticide in several countries have not had a meaningful impact on the quarter. We are still quantifying the impact to 2020, but expect the impact for all regulatory challenged products to be only $10 million and offset by expanded registrations for new Crop Protection products, like Arylex and Rinskor herbicides and Zorvec fungicides.
So now I'll turn to Slide 8 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA for the second half and full year 2019. Last quarter, we shared our expectation to deliver operating EBITDA about breakeven for the second half. Due to further negative impact from currency, operating EBITDA is now expected to be a loss of $70 million compared to the same period last year, which is the lower end of the previous range. Currency, particularly the devaluation of the Brazilian real, is expected to reduce second half results by about $80 million overall. Other drivers that we outlined last quarter as part of our second half guidance are on track to deliver. Due to the late North America season, we recognized Seed revenues in the third quarter, which offset the Crop Protection volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early demand for products in Latin America. We continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply constrained, high-demand products primarily in our insect management portfolio, and we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America largely due to the expansion of new products like Vessarya fungicide as well as Leptra and PowerCore Ultra corn products. We have also maintained our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, targeted to deliver over $150 million in incremental savings, which will bring our annual incremental savings to $350 million. In total, the second half guidance represents an approximate $130 million or 65% improvement over the prior year. Full year pro forma operating EBITDA is now expected to be about $1.9 billion, the low end of the previous range and down about 8% versus 2018. We are affirming the full year indication for net sales as a decline of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. On an organic basis, we still expect sales to be about flat year-over-year.
Before I turn the call over to Greg, I'll summarize by commending our teams around the globe for an extraordinary effort in the quarter to support our customers in the face of numerous challenges. Corteva achieved solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year and made ongoing progress on our priorities for shareholder value creation. We remain focused on driving operational discipline and committed to setting the stage for solid net sales and operating earnings growth in 2020.
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

As Jim covered, 2019 continues to be a very dynamic an",1069,"Thank you, Jim. Turning now to Slide 9 for a summary of our third quarter results. Please note that the prior year period is on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating earnings per share. As Jim covered, 2019 continues to be a very dynamic and complex operating environment, particularly in North America and Latin America, which is evident in our third quarter results. Net sales of $1.9 billion were down 2% versus prior year on a 3% increase in volumes, offset by a 3% decline in local price and a 2% headwind from currency. North America volumes were up 31% in the quarter as a result of soybean and corn sales that shifted from the prior quarter due to delayed planting. Offsetting this was the early demand we experienced for Crop Protection products in Latin America in the prior quarter and delays in the Brazil soybean season, which shifted expected Crop Protection sales into the fourth quarter. Local price was impacted by competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans, higher replant in soybeans and corn, and the impact of grower incentive discounts in North America.
Turning to operating EBITDA. We reported a loss of $207 million, which was an 18% improvement versus the prior year period on a pro forma basis. Overall, the improvement was driven by favorable timing shifts in North America seed sales and roughly $100 million in cost savings from synergies that we delivered during the period. These were partially offset by shifts in Crop Protection sales in Latin America, and currency was a headwind. We delivered expansion in our overall operating EBITDA margin in the quarter as a result of the timing shifts we discussed earlier and cost synergies recognized during the period. All in all, operating EBITDA margins improved by more than 200 basis points, led by our Seeds segment. This translated into a loss of $0.39 for operating earnings per share, up 35% from the third quarter 2018 on a pro forma basis.
Turning to Slide 10 for a year-over-year comparison of our operating earnings per share. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.14 of operating EPS in the quarter, while volume contributed $0.08 of improvement primarily due to the sales shifts in Seed and new product sales we delivered in the quarter, a $0.12 headwind on pricing and cost was a product of increased replant in soybeans and corn and increased grower incentive discount, coupled with higher commissions and new product launch cost. Currency was a $0.06 headwind in the quarter. In addition, tax was a benefit of $0.04. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%, up from the third quarter 2018 rate of 2.4%. Lastly, we generated $0.13 of benefit primarily from foreign exchange gains related to our hedging programs to offset exposures for the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet.
Turning to our segment results. Slide 11 highlights the performance for the quarter in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments. In Crop Protection, net sales were $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 12% from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to an 11% organic decline, predominantly from volume shifts in Latin America, coupled with a 1% headwind from currency. Crop Protection operated EBITDA was $119 million for the quarter, down 25% from the prior year period. Volume declines in Latin America, grower incentive discounts in North America, new product launch cost and currency drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment continued to deliver on cost synergies.
In Seed, we reported net sales of $681 million for the quarter, which is up 24% from the same period last year. Higher sales were principally from a 31% increase in volumes as a result of the weather-related delay from North America, which shifted seed sales from the second quarter into the third quarter. Local price was a headwind of 5% in the quarter due to higher replant in soybeans and corn in North America. Currency was a headwind of 2%. Seed operating EBITDA was a loss of $295 million, an improvement of almost $80 million over the prior year period. Our results reflect the shift of soybean and corn sales in North America and continued progress on cost savings recognized in the quarter. Unfavorable local price impacted by replant and currency headwinds partially offset the year-over-year volume improvement. Seed operating EBITDA margin improved by almost 25 percentage points.
Turning now to Slide 12 and an update on our modeling guidance, including a bridge of operating EBITDA to operating earnings per share for the full year 2019. Touching first on net sales, we continue to expect to be down about 3% over prior year unchanged from prior guidance. This is due to unfavorable currency. Organic sales are essentially flat. We now expect depreciation expense to be approximately $575 million and interest expense to be about $100 million for the year based on our current forecast. We have updated our estimate on exchange losses, net of tax, which reflects our full year estimate for the cost of the program, now expect a $70 million to $80 million loss for the year. Based on the $1.9 billion operating EBITDA guidance for the year, this translates into an operating earnings per share range of $1.20 per share to $1.26 per share at a midpoint of $1.23 per share. This represents about a $0.04 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance on operating earnings per share.
Before I turn the call back to Megan, I want to touch on the directional targets we provided for 2020 operating EBITDA back in August. We remain committed to executing against our cost synergies and productivity programs that we outlined and fully expect to deliver on those targets in 2020. You will recall, in August, that we sized anticipated headwinds of approximately $100 million for the next year, and we continue to monitor market conditions that may alter that estimate. We are evaluating planted acres and cost for the next year. It is too early to provide definitive guidance. Our focus is still on delivering a solid year of growth in both net sales and operating EBITDA for 2020. We will provide more definitive guidance during our fourth quarter call, and I look forward to sharing more at that time.
I'll now turn the call back to Megan to open the Q&A."

No, excited about 2020, there is obviously a lot going on here with new product launches, et cetera. But to answer the specific question, Greg, on the seed production, one of the biggest drivers for headwinds for seed production next year is the commodity prices. As we look at the commodity prices have increased over year-over-year and that's being factored in. Harvests are delayed across the Midwest, like we know. And so we are looking at what the yield impact of that could be as we go in. But overall, I would say that we are really excited about 2020 and the delivery of the $250 million that we have discussed in August, like Greg said."

Well, as we look at 2020 in terms of the planted area in North America, I think the expectation we should have is that we'll return to more of a normal level. And so that would imply something in the neighborhood of about 11 million acres that would come back into production on corn and soy. And from that point, when you determine the next critical thing is the mix between corn and soy. And so we're -- we monitor closely the ratio between soybeans and corn prices, commodity prices. And today, that sits somewhere in the neighborhood of around 2.4. And at that level, it would imply that somewhere in the neighborhood of about 1/3 of that, around 11 million acres, would come back into corn with the balance going to soybean. So -- and I know that is very dynamic, and that's changing every day. And over the course of weeks or months in between now and planting, that can vary quite a lot. And that's one of the real key indicators that we're looking at. So today, that would -- the implications we see, we monitor it every day and will continue to do that all the way until farmers make their final decisions."

So if you take that piece out, we're relatively flat to slightly up, as you said, in SG&A. And the key driver of that in the third quarter is commissions. Commissions are variable based on our revenue. So -- and in particular, to Seed. So with our Seed revenues going up as significantly as they did in the third quarter, there's a proportional element that increased our commission expense. There's also another component of commissions that did increase as well and that is some competitive rate increases that we implemented earlier at the beginning of this year to bring our commission structure up to market rates. So if you take those increases, you also take into account the cost savings that we executed relative to our synergy and then also some reductions that you see on the corporate line item, net-net SG&A for the quarter was about flat to slightly up."

And at the end of the day, they're going to evaluate what their best options are. We price for value. Our approach this year is to have roughly flat on soybeans, and that is the combination of some existing products in our lineup that may be flat with year-over-year or possibly adjusted down a little bit, and then new varieties that come into our lineup, really driving some upside in pricing opportunity. So it's a highly competitive market, no question. We're very blessed that we've got a strong portfolio of products in both the Pioneer and multichannel brands. We've got the -- I feel very confident that we're setting the pace in terms of product performance on the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend segment. We got extremely strong demand for our Enlist E3 technology, and those Enlist E3 products are priced comparable to our leading varieties. And so it's a combination of many things, primarily mix-driven, that's going to allow us to hold price as we move into 2020. But you're exactly right.

As we said earlier, obviously, we're monitoring a number of factors as we head into 2020. The first of those that Greg mentioned, and others asked about is the -- kind of the way that the recovery in the market in North America. So first and foremost, you have to acknowledge, 2019 was an unprecedented year we have not seen in the industry in a long. So as we more normalize and move into 2020, we'll expect to see a lot of that come back. And that's in our core market. It's in North America. It's where we have our largest lineup. And so obviously, it affected us disproportionately than in our business around the world.
If you then strip out North America and look at rest of the world, 2019 has been an extraordinary year. Year-to-date, we've got our -- different regions are -- like Europe, Asia, Latin America, they're all up organically 7%. We've got insecticides growth. Our entire insecticide portfolio year-to-date is up 9%. So you strip out just what happened in North America and you can really see the energy and the momentum in the rest of the world and behind the scenes.
On top of that, and as we said, going into 2020 we're going to carry -- continue to carry through on the cost synergy momentum that we've had. We have good line of sight and visibility as well as additional productivity actions that we have taken to really respond to the market conditions that are going on, so we can be in a better position to support our customers. And then third on that list is new products, where you've heard Tim talk about Enlist. We're excited about that lineup now, really hitting that hard. We'd expect Enlist to grow to be about 10% of the overall market. We've got chrome coming in, there's been a nice lift on chrome. And then there's a lineup of Crop Protection products like Arylex in Europe, one of the strongest new herbicides being launched in cereals, Rinskor for rice, Isoclast and Zorvec in specialty crops that are doing really well. So that pipeline has to be the third marquee element of that. So a recovery in North America, continued great momentum on cost synergies and additional productivity actions and then our new product pipeline.
As we take a step back from the income statement and really look at where we're going to sit with our balance sheet, obviously, we've got a strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders. And we talked a lot about that in the past around the dividend announcement, but also a continued commitment as we go forward around an appropriate amount of share repurchases. So I think that is a pretty compelling story as to why Corteva's a great vote here going forward."

And so coming off a really strong performance in 2018, we carried a lot of momentum on the product side, a lot of energy from our sales team. And so we felt very good about where we were prior to sort of the season breaking and chaos ensuing. I think the fact that we were able to be there, our route to model is definitely working in our advantage, our ability to go out there and serve customers as they were dealing with some of the adversity, potentially changing from one maturity to another in corn, evaluating other crop options, that hustle, that execution definitely made a difference. And I think that it helped translate into a strong finish for the year. The -- what we carry into 2020, to me, I think that those actions that we made this spring and into the summer, that strengthens the relationship. We expect that customers are going to have a very positive experience with our product again. Coming off that high level of service, we believe it's sustainable. And we have long-standing relationships with farmer customers and this only builds off of that. So it was a tough year at times, it felt like our sales team was not making a lot of progress just because so many changes and so much uncertainty. But tough years is when you really strengthen those relationships. And given that, with our product performance, I'm really excited about what we carry into 2020."

It was more like 30% above what that 5-year average was. And you look back at the season, and obviously, not surprising considering the weather challenges we had. And I would say, in Latin America, a couple of things that are driving our ability to price. One would be -- we've got very strong performance, and we've been able to effectively establish the Brevant brand and position the Pioneer brand appropriately, so very good overall product performance.

Clearly, as I think Tim mentioned earlier, we watch that soybean-to-corn price ratio really closely because over the years that we've been watching this, there isn't a difference point where the economics and the value of those 2 crops sort of balance. And so as we see pricing differences, we see that ratio swing and we watch demand swing with that for corn. So right now, the scenario that's out there, it's the best data that we really have, the USDA estimates around yield but also USDA estimates around intended planting for 2020 would say that we will see a little bit more corn, and we'll see a -- maybe the balance, 1/3, 2/3 more of those acres that Tim mentioned coming back into soybeans. So if you saw a big swing in price more towards corn, you'd see growers respond to that. The way our portfolio sits today on a net margin basis, as we've said many times before, our profitability would favor stronger corn acres than soybean acres. But we're really starting to change that equation. You start to think about the penetration that we'll have with Enlist going forward as we've added other products to our portfolio, the A series soybeans and the relative performance that we're having on that portfolio and our ability to price for the value that we deliver, it's starting to moderate that margin slight -- that margin difference slightly. So we're just going to put ourselves in a position to respond to the market with however it turns out, and we'll be ready, depending on those 2 areas."

You really can't just look here at third quarter and really compare what's going on. If I step back from that, our Latin America business overall for the year organically is up 8%. So you said it accurately, there was a large portion of our Crop Protection business, because of the products we sell and the timing of the market, was really accelerated into the second quarter and we reported out on that very, very specifically. And then on top of that, we've got some of the leading fungicides for soybeans in Brazil and you're all reading about what's happening with this -- with the planting in Brazil. Due to the lack of rains, we've had a slightly delayed planting. And so the setup for our products has shifted a little bit here into fourth quarter. And we've got good indications that, that flow of products is happening. We've got October essentially behind us here, and we can see good volume growth. So -- and when you step back then and look at insecticides overall, it again, really is not a story year-to-date. Our insecticide business in Latin America is up as much as 30%. And globally, our Insect portfolio is up 9%, and we'd expect the market maybe is more like 5%, mid-5% range. So we're outpacing the market.

I think at the area level, I don't think we're at risk in terms of seeing a reduced area for maybe what the original intentions were, so feel pretty good about that. And in terms of the technology employed, that probably will end up being more of a 2020-type issue because of the fact that, that first planted safrinha seed will still be with our strongest hybrids -- the highest technology. So what we would typically move into customers' hands in December of 20 -- December 2019 will be planted in a window where they should be able to get really good performance, and it's not necessarily a late planted risky crop.

Earlier today, we reported third quarter results for Corteva. Delivering solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year despite the emergence of currency headwinds in Latin America and additional weather-related impacts in several key regions. As we consider the market backdrop for this quarter, uncertainty regarding North America yield, production and ending stock levels for the 2019 season has persisted as an unprecedented planting season has now given way to an extraordinarily late harvest. To some extent, large carryover supplies have moderated market reaction to North American production problems, especially as markets expected Latin America to respond to elevated commodity prices with additional production. However, recent planting progress reports from Brazil, where markets were poised for a strong row crop season, indicate lack of rainfall is delaying soybean planting, which may have an impact on the timing and size of the second crop or safrinha. Coupled with production disruptions and delays, recent softening in the Chinese economy, African swine fever and slower growth in other emerging markets are impacting the demand outlook for commodity grains and oilseeds. On trade, while China has resumed purchases of some U.S. agricultural products, the timing of a full resolution is still unknown. In the face of this considerable market turmoil, our teams have remained focused on the levers in our control, taking self-help actions and driving execution in the marketplace, while setting the stage for a solid 2020 when we expect more normal conditions to arrive in many sectors of the ag markets.
Now as we did last quarter, we would like to start our update today with some longer-term perspective, where we can look beyond the market uncertainty that has continued to challenge our day-to-day operations to evaluate the progress we are making as a company relative to our priorities for shareholder value creation, noted on Slide 5. As I said last quarter, these priorities continue to guide our strategic actions and underscore the quality of results we are working to achieve, particularly as we work dynamically to adjust to short-term market disruptions.
Starting first on culture. We highlighted the launch of Execute To Win last quarter. With this, we are establishing an owner mindset for all employees to drive the cultural reinforcement that is needed to deliver and sustain our gains long term. So far, we've engaged more than 25% of our employee base in the initiative identification, planning and execution that we expect will ultimately contribute $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA over the next 5 years. On capital allocation, we remain committed to delivering cash to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to invest in innovation and growth. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next 3 years. This quarter, we repurchased $25 million in shares. Additionally, Corteva paid its first quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share on September 13 and has declared its second continuous quarterly dividend payable on December 18. In total, our actions so far will return approximately $220 million in cash to shareholders by the end of the year. On our priority related to developing innovative solutions, we delivered over $30 million in operating improvement from new products in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to deliver over $100 million in improvement in the second half and greater than $150 million for the full year. Crop Protection and new product sales increased 56% versus the same period last year and are on track to grow to 12% of our overall Crop Protection sales by the end of the year. Products driving net sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter included PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicide, Vessarya fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. We continue to see momentum in our Crop Protection portfolio, with notable geographic label expansions for Arylex and Rinskor herbicides, Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide this quarter.
On our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $100 million in cost synergies in the quarter and are on track to deliver approximately $150 million in cost synergies for the second half of 2019. Overall, we have now realized cumulative cost savings through the end of this quarter of $800 million out of the $1.2 billion commitment expected by 2021. Finally, seasonal shifts during the period and currency obscured several positive signs of operational momentum. Based on the current USDA acres, we are confident that we gained share in Pioneer brand corn and soybeans in North America. We also gained share in summer corn in Brazil, and insecticides and fungicides globally. Further, in support of our growth in the Spinosyn insecticides, we announced today a project approved by the Board of Directors to add manufacturing capacity for key Spinosyn insecticide products to release supply constraints and grow our leadership in natural products, aligned with our market growth expectations in insecticides and natural products over the midterm horizon.
Moving to Slide 6 and a few highlights of our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales on a reported basis decreased 2% versus the prior period primarily due to currency. Organic sales were flat for the quarter as weather drove offsetting shifts at the segment level. As we reported last quarter, market disruptions due to the weather in North America delayed planting and shifted seed sales into the third quarter, while strong early demand moved Crop Protection volume for Latin America into the second quarter. Further pressuring third quarter performance, a lack of seasonal rainfall in Brazil delayed soybean planting and Crop Protection applications, shifting crop protecting volumes into the fourth quarter primarily for Vessarya fungicide.
Our operating EBITDA improved 18% compared to prior year, largely driven by the margin benefit from the shift of seed volumes and the continued realization of cost synergies. Demand for new Crop Protection products also resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the more than $40 million hit to quarter from currency. Margin declines from higher corn and soybean replants and the seasonal shifts of Latin America Crop Protection volumes due to early demand, coupled with the delayed seasonal rains, further pressured operating EBITDA results for the quarter. For North America, when we exclude the impact of replant and despite the mix shift we experienced to shorter maturity products, we held corn price in our Pioneer brand. We reduced selling, general and administrative and R&D cost 2% in the quarter on a net basis due to cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions taken to curtail spending.
Now Slide 7 shows third quarter highlights by region. North America sales improved 16% for the third quarter due to weather-related planting delays that shifted seed sales recorded in soybeans into the period. While seed sales were up 102% compared to prior year, Crop Protection sales declined 7% as both delayed planting and delayed harvest impacted the timing of fertilizer and Crop Protection applications. A historically slow 2019 planting season in the U.S. has contributed to delays in harvest, fall field preparation and fall fertilizer applications. The most recent crop progress report indicated that only 41% of the U.S. corn and 62% of the U.S. soybeans were harvested. For corn, this percent harvested is the fourth slowest in the last 39 years and the soybean percent harvested is the sixth slowest. Delayed planting and now harvest have contributed to elevated channel inventories in Crop Protection, combined with large distributor inventory reduction initiatives, restocking rates have slowed, delaying the timing of fall Crop Protection sales. While harvest slowly progresses, momentum is building in North America for the 2020 season. Our seed pricing for the 2020 North America season was released to our sales teams in September and demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our new product performance. We price for the value created by new technology, and we provide growers choice with high-performing seed offerings delivered through our multichannel, multibrand approach.
We are preparing for an aggressive ramp of chrome corn products, which are expected to be approximately 20% of our lineup in 2020, and the launch of Lumiposa seed treatment, our new proprietary bio-based nematicide, which will be launched in the Pioneer brand. In corn, considering the mix benefit from new technology, we expect to drive low single-digit price gains year-over-year in our Pioneer and multichannel brands. We are also expanding the Enlist E3 soybean offerings in our commercial product lineup next year and expect the technology will penetrate 10% of the market. On price for soybeans, we expect to be flat due to continued market competitiveness.
Moving to Latin America. Reported and organic net sales declined for the quarter, largely due to the impact of weather-related volume shifts in crop protection and currency. As we noted last quarter, the strong early demand shifted approximately $80 million in sales that would normally have occurred in the third quarter into the second quarter. The delay of seasonal rains in Brazil in the third quarter slowed soybean planting progress and resulted in the shift of approximately $50 million in expected Crop Protection sales into the fourth quarter primarily from Vessarya fungicide. Seed reported net sales up 7% for the third quarter in Latin America, largely due to the year-over-year price improvement. Strong performance of Leptra and PowerCore Ultra corn products drove a 14% year-over-year increase in Seed price. Seed volumes were down for the quarter due to the lack of seasonal rain delaying summer planting progress and input purchases in preparation for the safrinha season. We are paying close attention to development of the crop season in Brazil as continued challenges may impact planting, Crop Protection applications, crop input technology selections and the size of the safrinha corn crop. We have also been following the presidential elections in Argentina and the decline of the Argentine peso, which has lost 35% of its value against the dollar as of the quarter end compared to the start of the year. Approximately, 20% of our Latin America net sales come from Argentina, and we are relatively insulated from the currency devaluations as sales are predominantly done in U.S. dollars. However, government policies unfavorable to agriculture would impact our outlook for 2020 and beyond.
In Asia Pacific, organic net sales were down 6% due to drought in key countries in the region, which significantly lowered planting and treated acres and drove lower Crop Protection volumes in the region for the quarter. Seed reported net sales were up 19% year-over-year on strong volume in corn in Philippines and improved pricing in India due to high demand for other crops.
Finishing up with Europe, Middle East and Africa: Up 3% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis. Continued increased demand for new Crop Protection products like Arylex cereal herbicide contributed to growth in Crop Protection sales for the region in the quarter. In Seed, declines in canola due to drought conditions in North and Central Europe impacted volumes. Currency devaluation in the region lowered overall sales growth by 5%. Recent regulatory developments in Europe, particularly the announced ban of Chlorpyrifos insecticide in several countries have not had a meaningful impact on the quarter. We are still quantifying the impact to 2020, but expect the impact for all regulatory challenged products to be only $10 million and offset by expanded registrations for new Crop Protection products, like Arylex and Rinskor herbicides and Zorvec fungicides.
So now I'll turn to Slide 8 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA for the second half and full year 2019. Last quarter, we shared our expectation to deliver operating EBITDA about breakeven for the second half. Due to further negative impact from currency, operating EBITDA is now expected to be a loss of $70 million compared to the same period last year, which is the lower end of the previous range. Currency, particularly the devaluation of the Brazilian real, is expected to reduce second half results by about $80 million overall. Other drivers that we outlined last quarter as part of our second half guidance are on track to deliver. Due to the late North America season, we recognized Seed revenues in the third quarter, which offset the Crop Protection volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early demand for products in Latin America. We continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply constrained, high-demand products primarily in our insect management portfolio, and we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America largely due to the expansion of new products like Vessarya fungicide as well as Leptra and PowerCore Ultra corn products. We have also maintained our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, targeted to deliver over $150 million in incremental savings, which will bring our annual incremental savings to $350 million. In total, the second half guidance represents an approximate $130 million or 65% improvement over the prior year. Full year pro forma operating EBITDA is now expected to be about $1.9 billion, the low end of the previous range and down about 8% versus 2018. We are affirming the full year indication for net sales as a decline of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. On an organic basis, we still expect sales to be about flat year-over-year.
Before I turn the call over to Greg, I'll summarize by commending our teams around the globe for an extraordinary effort in the quarter to support our customers in the face of numerous challenges. Corteva achieved solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year and made ongoing progress on our priorities for shareholder value creation. We remain focused on driving operational discipline and committed to setting the stage for solid net sales and operating earnings growth in 2020.
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

Please note that the prior year period is on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating earnings per share. As Jim covered, 2019 continues to be a very dynamic and complex operating environment, particularly in North America and Latin America, which is evident in our third quarter results. Net sales of $1.9 billion were down 2% versus prior year on a 3% increase in volumes, offset by a 3% decline in local price and a 2% headwind from currency. North America volumes were up 31% in the quarter as a result of soybean and corn sales that shifted from the prior quarter due to delayed planting. Offsetting this was the early demand we experienced for Crop Protection products in Latin America in the prior quarter and delays in the Brazil soybean season, which shifted expected Crop Protection sales into the fourth quarter. Local price was impacted by competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans, higher replant in soybeans and corn, and the impact of grower incentive discounts in North America.
Turning to operating EBITDA. We reported a loss of $207 million, which was an 18% improvement versus the prior year period on a pro forma basis. Overall, the improvement was driven by favorable timing shifts in North America seed sales and roughly $100 million in cost savings from synergies that we delivered during the period. These were partially offset by shifts in Crop Protection sales in Latin America, and currency was a headwind. We delivered expansion in our overall operating EBITDA margin in the quarter as a result of the timing shifts we discussed earlier and cost synergies recognized during the period. All in all, operating EBITDA margins improved by more than 200 basis points, led by our Seeds segment. This translated into a loss of $0.39 for operating earnings per share, up 35% from the third quarter 2018 on a pro forma basis.
Turning to Slide 10 for a year-over-year comparison of our operating earnings per share. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.14 of operating EPS in the quarter, while volume contributed $0.08 of improvement primarily due to the sales shifts in Seed and new product sales we delivered in the quarter, a $0.12 headwind on pricing and cost was a product of increased replant in soybeans and corn and increased grower incentive discount, coupled with higher commissions and new product launch cost. Currency was a $0.06 headwind in the quarter. In addition, tax was a benefit of $0.04. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%, up from the third quarter 2018 rate of 2.4%. Lastly, we generated $0.13 of benefit primarily from foreign exchange gains related to our hedging programs to offset exposures for the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet.
Turning to our segment results. Slide 11 highlights the performance for the quarter in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments. In Crop Protection, net sales were $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 12% from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to an 11% organic decline, predominantly from volume shifts in Latin America, coupled with a 1% headwind from currency. Crop Protection operated EBITDA was $119 million for the quarter, down 25% from the prior year period. Volume declines in Latin America, grower incentive discounts in North America, new product launch cost and currency drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment continued to deliver on cost synergies.
In Seed, we reported net sales of $681 million for the quarter, which is up 24% from the same period last year. Higher sales were principally from a 31% increase in volumes as a result of the weather-related delay from North America, which shifted seed sales from the second quarter into the third quarter. Local price was a headwind of 5% in the quarter due to higher replant in soybeans and corn in North America. Currency was a headwind of 2%. Seed operating EBITDA was a loss of $295 million, an improvement of almost $80 million over the prior year period. Our results reflect the shift of soybean and corn sales in North America and continued progress on cost savings recognized in the quarter. Unfavorable local price impacted by replant and currency headwinds partially offset the year-over-year volume improvement. Seed operating EBITDA margin improved by almost 25 percentage points.
Turning now to Slide 12 and an update on our modeling guidance, including a bridge of operating EBITDA to operating earnings per share for the full year 2019. Touching first on net sales, we continue to expect to be down about 3% over prior year unchanged from prior guidance. This is due to unfavorable currency. Organic sales are essentially flat. We now expect depreciation expense to be approximately $575 million and interest expense to be about $100 million for the year based on our current forecast. We have updated our estimate on exchange losses, net of tax, which reflects our full year estimate for the cost of the program, now expect a $70 million to $80 million loss for the year. Based on the $1.9 billion operating EBITDA guidance for the year, this translates into an operating earnings per share range of $1.20 per share to $1.26 per share at a midpoint of $1.23 per share. This represents about a $0.04 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance on operating earnings per share.
Before I turn the call back to Megan, I want to touch on the directional targets we provided for 2020 operating EBITDA back in August. We remain committed to executing against our cost synergies and productivity programs that we outlined and fully expect to deliver on those targets in 2020. You will recall, in August, that we sized anticipated headwinds of approximately $100 million for the next year, and we continue to monitor market conditions that may alter that estimate. We are evaluating planted acres and cost for the next year. It is too early to provide definitive guidance. Our focus is still on delivering a solid year of growth in both net sales and operating EBITDA for 2020. We will provide more definitive guidance during our fourth quarter call, and I look forward to sharing more at that time.
I'll now turn the call back to Megan to open the Q&A."

No, excited about 2020, there is obviously a lot going on here with new product launches, et cetera. But to answer the specific question, Greg, on the seed production, one of the biggest drivers for headwinds for seed production next year is the commodity prices. As we look at the commodity prices have increased over year-over-year and that's being factored in. Harvests are delayed across the Midwest, like we know. And so we are looking at what the yield impact of that could be as we go in. But overall, I would say that we are really excited about 2020 and the delivery of the $250 million that we have discussed in August, like Greg said."

Well, as we look at 2020 in terms of the planted area in North America, I think the expectation we should have is that we'll return to more of a normal level.

And from that point, when you determine the next critical thing is the mix between corn and soy. And so we're -- we monitor closely the ratio between soybeans and corn prices, commodity prices. And today, that sits somewhere in the neighborhood of around 2.4. And at that level, it would imply that somewhere in the neighborhood of about 1/3 of that, around 11 million acres, would come back into corn with the balance going to soybean. So -- and I know that is very dynamic, and that's changing every day. And over the course of weeks or months in between now and planting, that can vary quite a lot. And that's one of the real key indicators that we're looking at. So today, that would -- the implications we see, we monitor it every day and will continue to do that all the way until farmers make their final decisions."

So yes, when you look at our SG&A line on the income statement, there are some nonoperating costs included in that line item.

So if you take that piece out, we're relatively flat to slightly up, as you said, in SG&A. And the key driver of that in the third quarter is commissions. Commissions are variable based on our revenue. So -- and in particular, to Seed. So with our Seed revenues going up as significantly as they did in the third quarter, there's a proportional element that increased our commission expense. There's also another component of commissions that did increase as well and that is some competitive rate increases that we implemented earlier at the beginning of this year to bring our commission structure up to market rates. So if you take those increases, you also take into account the cost savings that we executed relative to our synergy and then also some reductions that you see on the corporate line item, net-net SG&A for the quarter was about flat to slightly up."

And at the end of the day, they're going to evaluate what their best options are. We price for value. Our approach this year is to have roughly flat on soybeans, and that is the combination of some existing products in our lineup that may be flat with year-over-year or possibly adjusted down a little bit, and then new varieties that come into our lineup, really driving some upside in pricing opportunity. So it's a highly competitive market, no question. We're very blessed that we've got a strong portfolio of products in both the Pioneer and multichannel brands. We've got the -- I feel very confident that we're setting the pace in terms of product performance on the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend segment. We got extremely strong demand for our Enlist E3 technology, and those Enlist E3 products are priced comparable to our leading varieties. And so it's a combination of many things, primarily mix-driven, that's going to allow us to hold price as we move into 2020. But you're exactly right.

As we said earlier, obviously, we're monitoring a number of factors as we head into 2020. The first of those that Greg mentioned, and others asked about is the -- kind of the way that the recovery in the market in North America. So first and foremost, you have to acknowledge, 2019 was an unprecedented year we have not seen in the industry in a long. So as we more normalize and move into 2020, we'll expect to see a lot of that come back. And that's in our core market. It's in North America. It's where we have our largest lineup. And so obviously, it affected us disproportionately than in our business around the world.
If you then strip out North America and look at rest of the world, 2019 has been an extraordinary year. Year-to-date, we've got our -- different regions are -- like Europe, Asia, Latin America, they're all up organically 7%. We've got insecticides growth. Our entire insecticide portfolio year-to-date is up 9%. So you strip out just what happened in North America and you can really see the energy and the momentum in the rest of the world and behind the scenes.
On top of that, and as we said, going into 2020 we're going to carry -- continue to carry through on the cost synergy momentum that we've had. We have good line of sight and visibility as well as additional productivity actions that we have taken to really respond to the market conditions that are going on, so we can be in a better position to support our customers. And then third on that list is new products, where you've heard Tim talk about Enlist. We're excited about that lineup now, really hitting that hard. We'd expect Enlist to grow to be about 10% of the overall market. We've got chrome coming in, there's been a nice lift on chrome. And then there's a lineup of Crop Protection products like Arylex in Europe, one of the strongest new herbicides being launched in cereals, Rinskor for rice, Isoclast and Zorvec in specialty crops that are doing really well. So that pipeline has to be the third marquee element of that. So a recovery in North America, continued great momentum on cost synergies and additional productivity actions and then our new product pipeline.
As we take a step back from the income statement and really look at where we're going to sit with our balance sheet, obviously, we've got a strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders. And we talked a lot about that in the past around the dividend announcement, but also a continued commitment as we go forward around an appropriate amount of share repurchases. So I think that is a pretty compelling story as to why Corteva's a great vote here going forward."

And so coming off a really strong performance in 2018, we carried a lot of momentum on the product side, a lot of energy from our sales team. And so we felt very good about where we were prior to sort of the season breaking and chaos ensuing. I think the fact that we were able to be there, our route to model is definitely working in our advantage, our ability to go out there and serve customers as they were dealing with some of the adversity, potentially changing from one maturity to another in corn, evaluating other crop options, that hustle, that execution definitely made a difference. And I think that it helped translate into a strong finish for the year. The -- what we carry into 2020, to me, I think that those actions that we made this spring and into the summer, that strengthens the relationship. We expect that customers are going to have a very positive experience with our product again. Coming off that high level of service, we believe it's sustainable. And we have long-standing relationships with farmer customers and this only builds off of that. So it was a tough year at times. It felt like our sales team was not making a lot of progress just because so many changes and so much uncertainty. But tough year is when you really strengthen those relationships.

And what we saw this year more or less on corn was about a 10% increase versus the 5-year average. And then on soybeans, as Jim said, we were -- we saw more replant. It was more like 30% above what that 5-year average was. And you look back at the season, and obviously, not surprising considering the weather challenges we had. And I would say, in Latin America, a couple of things that are driving our ability to price. One would be -- we've got very strong performance, and we've been able to effectively establish the Brevant brand and position the Pioneer brand appropriately, so very good overall product performance. And then we're getting a strong benefit from the continued increase in utilization of new technologies like PowerCore Ultra and our Leptra hybrids. So it's a combination of mix. It's a combination of strong performance. And I think, again, very good momentum that we're carrying in the marketplace in both Brazil and Argentina. So it's really a Latin American story, not strictly a Brazil story."

Clearly, as I think Tim mentioned earlier, we watch that soybean-to-corn price ratio really closely because over the years that we've been watching this, there isn't a difference point where the economics and the value of those 2 crops sort of balance. And so as we see pricing differences, we see that ratio swing and we watch demand swing with that for corn. So right now, the scenario that's out there, it's the best data that we really have, the USDA estimates around yield but also USDA estimates around intended planting for 2020 would say that we will see a little bit more corn, and we'll see a -- maybe the balance, 1/3, 2/3 more of those acres that Tim mentioned coming back into soybeans. So if you saw a big swing in price more towards corn, you'd see growers respond to that. The way our portfolio sits today on a net margin basis, as we've said many times before, our profitability would favor stronger corn acres than soybean acres. But we're really starting to change that equation. You start to think about the penetration that we'll have with Enlist going forward as we've added other products to our portfolio, the A series soybeans and the relative performance that we're having on that portfolio and our ability to price for the value that we deliver, it's starting to moderate that margin slight -- that margin difference slightly. So we're just going to put ourselves in a position to respond to the market with however it turns out, and we'll be ready, depending on those 2 areas."

You really can't just look here at third quarter and really compare what's going on. If I step back from that, our Latin America business overall for the year organically is up 8%. So you said it accurately, there was a large portion of our Crop Protection business, because of the products we sell and the timing of the market, was really accelerated into the second quarter and we reported out on that very, very specifically. And then on top of that, we've got some of the leading fungicides for soybeans in Brazil and you're all reading about what's happening with this -- with the planting in Brazil. Due to the lack of rains, we've had a slightly delayed planting. And so the setup for our products has shifted a little bit here into fourth quarter. And we've got good indications that, that flow of products is happening. We've got October essentially behind us here, and we can see good volume growth. So -- and when you step back then and look at insecticides overall, it again, really is not a story year-to-date. Our insecticide business in Latin America is up as much as 30%. And globally, our Insect portfolio is up 9%, and we'd expect the market maybe is more like 5%, mid-5% range. So we're outpacing the market.

I think at the area level, I don't think we're at risk in terms of seeing a reduced area for maybe what the original intentions were, so feel pretty good about that. And in terms of the technology employed, that probably will end up being more of a 2020-type issue because of the fact that, that first planted safrinha seed will still be with our strongest hybrids -- the highest technology. So what we would typically move into customers' hands in December of 20 -- December 2019 will be planted in a window where they should be able to get really good performance, and it's not necessarily a late-planted risky crop.

Earlier today, we reported third quarter results for Corteva. Delivering solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year despite the emergence of currency headwinds in Latin America and additional weather-related impacts in several key regions. As we consider the market backdrop for this quarter, uncertainty regarding North America yield, production and ending stock levels for the 2019 season has persisted as an unprecedented planting season has now given way to an extraordinarily late harvest. To some extent, large carryover supplies have moderated market reaction to North American production problems, especially as markets expected Latin America to respond to elevated commodity prices with additional production. However, recent planting progress reports from Brazil, where markets were poised for a strong row crop season, indicate lack of rainfall is delaying soybean planting, which may have an impact on the timing and size of the second crop or safrinha. Coupled with production disruptions and delays, recent softening in the Chinese economy, African swine fever and slower growth in other emerging markets are impacting the demand outlook for commodity grains and oilseeds. On trade, while China has resumed purchases of some U.S. agricultural products, the timing of a full resolution is still unknown. In the face of this considerable market turmoil, our teams have remained focused on the levers in our control, taking self-help actions and driving execution in the marketplace, while setting the stage for a solid 2020 when we expect more normal conditions to arrive in many sectors of the ag markets.
Now as we did last quarter, we would like to start our update today with some longer-term perspective, where we can look beyond the market uncertainty that has continued to challenge our day-to-day operations to evaluate the progress we are making as a company relative to our priorities for shareholder value creation, noted on Slide 5. As I said last quarter, these priorities continue to guide our strategic actions and underscore the quality of results we are working to achieve, particularly as we work dynamically to adjust to short-term market disruptions.
Starting first on culture. We highlighted the launch of Execute To Win last quarter. With this, we are establishing an owner mindset for all employees to drive the cultural reinforcement that is needed to deliver and sustain our gains long term. So far, we've engaged more than 25% of our employee base in the initiative identification, planning and execution that we expect will ultimately contribute $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA over the next 5 years. On capital allocation, we remain committed to delivering cash to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to invest in innovation and growth. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next 3 years. This quarter, we repurchased $25 million in shares. Additionally, Corteva paid its first quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share on September 13 and has declared its second continuous quarterly dividend payable on December 18. In total, our actions so far will return approximately $220 million in cash to shareholders by the end of the year. On our priority related to developing innovative solutions, we delivered over $30 million in operating improvement from new products in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to deliver over $100 million in improvement in the second half and greater than $150 million for the full year. Crop Protection and new product sales increased 56% versus the same period last year and are on track to grow to 12% of our overall Crop Protection sales by the end of the year. Products driving net sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter included PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicide, Vessarya fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. We continue to see momentum in our Crop Protection portfolio, with notable geographic label expansions for Arylex and Rinskor herbicides, Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide this quarter.
On our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $100 million in cost synergies in the quarter and are on track to deliver approximately $150 million in cost synergies for the second half of 2019. Overall, we have now realized cumulative cost savings through the end of this quarter of $800 million out of the $1.2 billion commitment expected by 2021. Finally, seasonal shifts during the period and currency obscured several positive signs of operational momentum. Based on the current USDA acres, we are confident that we gained share in Pioneer brand corn and soybeans in North America. We also gained share in summer corn in Brazil, and insecticides and fungicides globally. Further, in support of our growth in the Spinosyn insecticides, we announced today a project approved by the Board of Directors to add manufacturing capacity for key Spinosyn insecticide products to release supply constraints and grow our leadership in natural products, aligned with our market growth expectations in insecticides and natural products over the midterm horizon.
Moving to Slide 6 and a few highlights of our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales on a reported basis decreased 2% versus the prior period primarily due to currency. Organic sales were flat for the quarter as weather drove offsetting shifts at the segment level. As we reported last quarter, market disruptions due to the weather in North America delayed planting and shifted seed sales into the third quarter, while strong early demand moved Crop Protection volume for Latin America into the second quarter. Further pressuring third quarter performance, a lack of seasonal rainfall in Brazil delayed soybean planting and Crop Protection applications, shifting crop protecting volumes into the fourth quarter primarily for Vessarya fungicide.
Our operating EBITDA improved 18% compared to prior year, largely driven by the margin benefit from the shift of seed volumes and the continued realization of cost synergies. Demand for new Crop Protection products also resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the more than $40 million hit to quarter from currency. Margin declines from higher corn and soybean replants and the seasonal shifts of Latin America Crop Protection volumes due to early demand, coupled with the delayed seasonal rains, further pressured operating EBITDA results for the quarter. For North America, when we exclude the impact of replant and despite the mix shift we experienced to shorter maturity products, we held corn price in our Pioneer brand. We reduced selling, general and administrative and R&D cost 2% in the quarter on a net basis due to cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions taken to curtail spending.
Now Slide 7 shows third quarter highlights by region. North America sales improved 16% for the third quarter due to weather-related planting delays that shifted seed sales recorded in soybeans into the period. While seed sales were up 102% compared to prior year, Crop Protection sales declined 7% as both delayed planting and delayed harvest impacted the timing of fertilizer and Crop Protection applications. A historically slow 2019 planting season in the U.S. has contributed to delays in harvest, fall field preparation and fall fertilizer applications. The most recent crop progress report indicated that only 41% of the U.S. corn and 62% of the U.S. soybeans were harvested. For corn, this percent harvested is the fourth slowest in the last 39 years and the soybean percent harvested is the sixth slowest. Delayed planting and now harvest have contributed to elevated channel inventories in Crop Protection, combined with large distributor inventory reduction initiatives, restocking rates have slowed, delaying the timing of fall Crop Protection sales. While harvest slowly progresses, momentum is building in North America for the 2020 season. Our seed pricing for the 2020 North America season was released to our sales teams in September and demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our new product performance. We price for the value created by new technology, and we provide growers choice with high-performing seed offerings delivered through our multichannel, multibrand approach.
We are preparing for an aggressive ramp of chrome corn products, which are expected to be approximately 20% of our lineup in 2020, and the launch of Lumiposa seed treatment, our new proprietary bio-based nematicide, which will be launched in the Pioneer brand. In corn, considering the mix benefit from new technology, we expect to drive low single-digit price gains year-over-year in our Pioneer and multichannel brands. We are also expanding the Enlist E3 soybean offerings in our commercial product lineup next year and expect the technology will penetrate 10% of the market. On price for soybeans, we expect to be flat due to continued market competitiveness.
Moving to Latin America. Reported and organic net sales declined for the quarter, largely due to the impact of weather-related volume shifts in crop protection and currency. As we noted last quarter, the strong early demand shifted approximately $80 million in sales that would normally have occurred in the third quarter into the second quarter. The delay of seasonal rains in Brazil in the third quarter slowed soybean planting progress and resulted in the shift of approximately $50 million in expected Crop Protection sales into the fourth quarter primarily from Vessarya fungicide. Seed reported net sales up 7% for the third quarter in Latin America, largely due to the year-over-year price improvement. Strong performance of Leptra and PowerCore Ultra corn products drove a 14% year-over-year increase in Seed price. Seed volumes were down for the quarter due to the lack of seasonal rain delaying summer planting progress and input purchases in preparation for the safrinha season. We are paying close attention to development of the crop season in Brazil as continued challenges may impact planting, Crop Protection applications, crop input technology selections and the size of the safrinha corn crop. We have also been following the presidential elections in Argentina and the decline of the Argentine peso, which has lost 35% of its value against the dollar as of the quarter end compared to the start of the year. Approximately, 20% of our Latin America net sales come from Argentina, and we are relatively insulated from the currency devaluations as sales are predominantly done in U.S. dollars. However, government policies unfavorable to agriculture would impact our outlook for 2020 and beyond.
In Asia Pacific, organic net sales were down 6% due to drought in key countries in the region, which significantly lowered planting and treated acres and drove lower Crop Protection volumes in the region for the quarter. Seed reported net sales were up 19% year-over-year on strong volume in corn in Philippines and improved pricing in India due to high demand for other crops.
Finishing up with Europe, Middle East and Africa: Up 3% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis. Continued increased demand for new Crop Protection products like Arylex cereal herbicide contributed to growth in Crop Protection sales for the region in the quarter. In Seed, declines in canola due to drought conditions in North and Central Europe impacted volumes. Currency devaluation in the region lowered overall sales growth by 5%. Recent regulatory developments in Europe, particularly the announced ban of Chlorpyrifos insecticide in several countries have not had a meaningful impact on the quarter. We are still quantifying the impact to 2020, but expect the impact for all regulatory challenged products to be only $10 million and offset by expanded registrations for new Crop Protection products, like Arylex and Rinskor herbicides and Zorvec fungicides.
So now I'll turn to Slide 8 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA for the second half and full year 2019. Last quarter, we shared our expectation to deliver operating EBITDA about breakeven for the second half. Due to further negative impact from currency, operating EBITDA is now expected to be a loss of $70 million compared to the same period last year, which is the lower end of the previous range. Currency, particularly the devaluation of the Brazilian real, is expected to reduce second half results by about $80 million overall. Other drivers that we outlined last quarter as part of our second half guidance are on track to deliver. Due to the late North America season, we recognized Seed revenues in the third quarter, which offset the Crop Protection volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early demand for products in Latin America. We continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply constrained, high-demand products primarily in our insect management portfolio, and we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America largely due to the expansion of new products like Vessarya fungicide as well as Leptra and PowerCore Ultra corn products. We have also maintained our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, targeted to deliver over $150 million in incremental savings, which will bring our annual incremental savings to $350 million. In total, the second half guidance represents an approximate $130 million or 65% improvement over the prior year. Full year pro forma operating EBITDA is now expected to be about $1.9 billion, the low end of the previous range and down about 8% versus 2018. We are affirming the full year indication for net sales as a decline of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. On an organic basis, we still expect sales to be about flat year-over-year.
Before I turn the call over to Greg, I'll summarize by commending our teams around the globe for an extraordinary effort in the quarter to support our customers in the face of numerous challenges. Corteva achieved solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year and made ongoing progress on our priorities for shareholder value creation. We remain focused on driving operational discipline and committed to setting the stage for solid net sales and operating earnings growth in 2020.
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

As Jim covered, 2019 continues to be a very dynamic an",1069,"Thank you, Jim. Turning now to Slide 9 for a summary of our third quarter results. Please note that the prior year period is on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating earnings per share. As Jim covered, 2019 continues to be a very dynamic and complex operating environment, particularly in North America and Latin America, which is evident in our third quarter results. Net sales of $1.9 billion were down 2% versus prior year on a 3% increase in volumes, offset by a 3% decline in local price and a 2% headwind from currency. North America volumes were up 31% in the quarter as a result of soybean and corn sales that shifted from the prior quarter due to delayed planting. Offsetting this was the early demand we experienced for Crop Protection products in Latin America in the prior quarter and delays in the Brazil soybean season, which shifted expected Crop Protection sales into the fourth quarter. Local price was impacted by competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans, higher replant in soybeans and corn, and the impact of grower incentive discounts in North America.
Turning to operating EBITDA. We reported a loss of $207 million, which was an 18% improvement versus the prior year period on a pro forma basis. Overall, the improvement was driven by favorable timing shifts in North America seed sales and roughly $100 million in cost savings from synergies that we delivered during the period. These were partially offset by shifts in Crop Protection sales in Latin America, and currency was a headwind. We delivered expansion in our overall operating EBITDA margin in the quarter as a result of the timing shifts we discussed earlier and cost synergies recognized during the period. All in all, operating EBITDA margins improved by more than 200 basis points, led by our Seeds segment. This translated into a loss of $0.39 for operating earnings per share, up 35% from the third quarter 2018 on a pro forma basis.
Turning to Slide 10 for a year-over-year comparison of our operating earnings per share. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.14 of operating EPS in the quarter, while volume contributed $0.08 of improvement primarily due to the sales shifts in Seed and new product sales we delivered in the quarter, a $0.12 headwind on pricing and cost was a product of increased replant in soybeans and corn and increased grower incentive discount, coupled with higher commissions and new product launch cost. Currency was a $0.06 headwind in the quarter. In addition, tax was a benefit of $0.04. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%, up from the third quarter 2018 rate of 2.4%. Lastly, we generated $0.13 of benefit primarily from foreign exchange gains related to our hedging programs to offset exposures for the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet.
Turning to our segment results. Slide 11 highlights the performance for the quarter in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments. In Crop Protection, net sales were $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 12% from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to an 11% organic decline, predominantly from volume shifts in Latin America, coupled with a 1% headwind from currency. Crop Protection operated EBITDA was $119 million for the quarter, down 25% from the prior year period. Volume declines in Latin America, grower incentive discounts in North America, new product launch cost and currency drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment continued to deliver on cost synergies.
In Seed, we reported net sales of $681 million for the quarter, which is up 24% from the same period last year. Higher sales were principally from a 31% increase in volumes as a result of the weather-related delay from North America, which shifted seed sales from the second quarter into the third quarter. Local price was a headwind of 5% in the quarter due to higher replant in soybeans and corn in North America. Currency was a headwind of 2%. Seed operating EBITDA was a loss of $295 million, an improvement of almost $80 million over the prior year period. Our results reflect the shift of soybean and corn sales in North America and continued progress on cost savings recognized in the quarter. Unfavorable local price impacted by replant and currency headwinds partially offset the year-over-year volume improvement. Seed operating EBITDA margin improved by almost 25 percentage points.
Turning now to Slide 12 and an update on our modeling guidance, including a bridge of operating EBITDA to operating earnings per share for the full year 2019. Touching first on net sales, we continue to expect to be down about 3% over prior year unchanged from prior guidance. This is due to unfavorable currency. Organic sales are essentially flat. We now expect depreciation expense to be approximately $575 million and interest expense to be about $100 million for the year based on our current forecast. We have updated our estimate on exchange losses, net of tax, which reflects our full year estimate for the cost of the program, now expect a $70 million to $80 million loss for the year. Based on the $1.9 billion operating EBITDA guidance for the year, this translates into an operating earnings per share range of $1.20 per share to $1.26 per share at a midpoint of $1.23 per share. This represents about a $0.04 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance on operating earnings per share.
Before I turn the call back to Megan, I want to touch on the directional targets we provided for 2020 operating EBITDA back in August. We remain committed to executing against our cost synergies and productivity programs that we outlined and fully expect to deliver on those targets in 2020. You will recall, in August, that we sized anticipated headwinds of approximately $100 million for the next year, and we continue to monitor market conditions that may alter that estimate. We are evaluating planted acres and cost for the next year. It is too early to provide definitive guidance. Our focus is still on delivering a solid year of growth in both net sales and operating EBITDA for 2020. We will provide more definitive guidance during our fourth quarter call, and I look forward to sharing more at that time.
I'll now turn the call back to Megan to open the Q&A."

No, excited about 2020, there is obviously a lot going on here with new product launches, et cetera. But to answer the specific question, Greg, on the seed production, one of the biggest drivers for headwinds for seed production next year is the commodity prices. As we look at the commodity prices have increased over year-over-year and that's being factored in. Harvests are delayed across the Midwest, like we know. And so we are looking at what the yield impact of that could be as we go in. But overall, I would say that we are really excited about 2020 and the delivery of the $250 million that we have discussed in August, like Greg said."

Well, as we look at 2020 in terms of the planted area in North America, I think the expectation we should have is that we'll return to more of a normal level. And so that would imply something in the neighborhood of about 11 million acres that would come back into production on corn and soy. And from that point, when you determine the next critical thing is the mix between corn and soy. And so we're -- we monitor closely the ratio between soybeans and corn prices, commodity prices. And today, that sits somewhere in the neighborhood of around 2.4. And at that level, it would imply that somewhere in the neighborhood of about 1/3 of that, around 11 million acres, would come back into corn with the balance going to soybean. So -- and I know that is very dynamic, and that's changing every day. And over the course of weeks or months in between now and planting, that can vary quite a lot. And that's one of the real key indicators that we're looking at. So today, that would -- the implications we see, we monitor it every day and will continue to do that all the way until farmers make their final decisions."

So yes, when you look at our SG&A line on the income statement, there are some nonoperating costs included in that line item.

So if you take that piece out, we're relatively flat to slightly up, as you said, in SG&A. And the key driver of that in the third quarter is commissions. Commissions are variable based on our revenue. So -- and in particular, to Seed. So with our Seed revenues going up as significantly as they did in the third quarter, there's a proportional element that increased our commission expense. There's also another component of commissions that did increase as well and that is some competitive rate increases that we implemented earlier at the beginning of this year to bring our commission structure up to market rates. So if you take those increases, you also take into account the cost savings that we executed relative to our synergy and then also some reductions that you see on the corporate line item, net-net SG&A for the quarter was about flat to slightly up."

Our approach this year is to have roughly flat on soybeans, and that is the combination of some existing products in our lineup that may be flat with year-over-year or possibly adjusted down a little bit, and then new varieties that come into our lineup, really driving some upside in pricing opportunity. So it's a highly competitive market, no question. We're very blessed that we've got a strong portfolio of products in both the Pioneer and multichannel brands. We've got the -- I feel very confident that we're setting the pace in terms of product performance on the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend segment. We got extremely strong demand for our Enlist E3 technology, and those Enlist E3 products are priced comparable to our leading varieties. And so it's a combination of many things, primarily mix-driven, that's going to allow us to hold price as we move into 2020. But you're exactly right.

As we said earlier, obviously, we're monitoring a number of factors as we head into 2020. The first of those that Greg mentioned, and others asked about is the -- kind of the way that the recovery in the market in North America. So first and foremost, you have to acknowledge, 2019 was an unprecedented year we have not seen in the industry in a long. So as we more normalize and move into 2020, we'll expect to see a lot of that come back. And that's in our core market. It's in North America. It's where we have our largest lineup. And so obviously, it affected us disproportionately than in our business around the world.
If you then strip out North America and look at rest of the world, 2019 has been an extraordinary year. Year-to-date, we've got our -- different regions are -- like Europe, Asia, Latin America, they're all up organically 7%. We've got insecticides growth. Our entire insecticide portfolio year-to-date is up 9%. So you strip out just what happened in North America and you can really see the energy and the momentum in the rest of the world and behind the scenes.
On top of that, and as we said, going into 2020 we're going to carry -- continue to carry through on the cost synergy momentum that we've had. We have good line of sight and visibility as well as additional productivity actions that we have taken to really respond to the market conditions that are going on, so we can be in a better position to support our customers. And then third on that list is new products, where you've heard Tim talk about Enlist. We're excited about that lineup now, really hitting that hard. We'd expect Enlist to grow to be about 10% of the overall market. We've got chrome coming in, there's been a nice lift on chrome. And then there's a lineup of Crop Protection products like Arylex in Europe, one of the strongest new herbicides being launched in cereals, Rinskor for rice, Isoclast and Zorvec in specialty crops that are doing really well. So that pipeline has to be the third marquee element of that. So a recovery in North America, continued great momentum on cost synergies and additional productivity actions and then our new product pipeline.
As we take a step back from the income statement and really look at where we're going to sit with our balance sheet, obviously, we've got a strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders. And we talked a lot about that in the past around the dividend announcement, but also a continued commitment as we go forward around an appropriate amount of share repurchases. So I think that is a pretty compelling story as to why Corteva's a great vote here going forward."

And so coming off a really strong performance in 2018, we carried a lot of momentum on the product side, a lot of energy from our sales team. And so we felt very good about where we were prior to sort of the season breaking and chaos ensuing. I think the fact that we were able to be there, our route to model is definitely working in our advantage, our ability to go out there and serve customers as they were dealing with some of the adversity, potentially changing from one maturity to another in corn, evaluating other crop options, that hustle, that execution definitely made a difference. And I think that it helped translate into a strong finish for the year. The -- what we carry into 2020, to me, I think that those actions that we made this spring and into the summer, that strengthens the relationship. We expect that customers are going to have a very positive experience with our product again. Coming off that high level of service, we believe it's sustainable. And we have long-standing relationships with farmer customers and this only builds off of that. So it was a tough year at times. It felt like our sales team was not making a lot of progress just because so many changes and so much uncertainty. But tough year is when you really strengthen those relationships. And given that, with our product performance, I'm really excited about what we carry into 2020."

I mean, this is a customary program that we would have in place to ensure that our customers are getting the most value out of our products. We ensure that they get a good stand, and I'd say it's -- while there's different variations in the industry, fairly standard across the board. And it can vary quite a lot between year-over-year. And what we saw this year more or less on corn was about a 10% increase versus the 5-year average. And then on soybeans, as Jim said, we were -- we saw more replant. It was more like 30% above what that 5-year average was. And you look back at the season, and obviously, not surprising considering the weather challenges we had. And I would say, in Latin America, a couple of things that are driving our ability to price. One would be -- we've got very strong performance, and we've been able to effectively establish the Brevant brand and position the Pioneer brand appropriately, so very good overall product performance. And then we're getting a strong benefit from the continued increase in utilization of new technologies like PowerCore Ultra and our Leptra hybrids. So it's a combination of mix. It's a combination of strong performance. And I think, again, very good momentum that we're carrying in the marketplace in both Brazil and Argentina. So it's really a Latin American story, not strictly a Brazil story."

Clearly, as I think Tim mentioned earlier, we watch that soybean-to-corn price ratio really closely because over the years that we've been watching this, there isn't a difference point where the economics and the value of those 2 crops sort of balance. And so as we see pricing differences, we see that ratio swing and we watch demand swing with that for corn. So right now, the scenario that's out there, it's the best data that we really have, the USDA estimates around yield but also USDA estimates around intended planting for 2020 would say that we will see a little bit more corn, and we'll see a -- maybe the balance, 1/3, 2/3 more of those acres that Tim mentioned coming back into soybeans. So if you saw a big swing in price more towards corn, you'd see growers respond to that. The way our portfolio sits today on a net margin basis, as we've said many times before, our profitability would favor stronger corn acres than soybean acres. But we're really starting to change that equation. You start to think about the penetration that we'll have with Enlist going forward as we've added other products to our portfolio, the A series soybeans and the relative performance that we're having on that portfolio and our ability to price for the value that we deliver, it's starting to moderate that margin slight -- that margin difference slightly. So we're just going to put ourselves in a position to respond to the market with however it turns out, and we'll be ready, depending on those 2 areas."

You really can't just look here at third quarter and really compare what's going on. If I step back from that, our Latin America business overall for the year organically is up 8%. So you said it accurately, there was a large portion of our Crop Protection business, because of the products we sell and the timing of the market, was really accelerated into the second quarter and we reported out on that very, very specifically. And then on top of that, we've got some of the leading fungicides for soybeans in Brazil and you're all reading about what's happening with this -- with the planting in Brazil. Due to the lack of rains, we've had a slightly delayed planting. And so the setup for our products has shifted a little bit here into fourth quarter. And we've got good indications that, that flow of products is happening. We've got October essentially behind us here, and we can see good volume growth. So -- and when you step back then and look at insecticides overall, it again, really is not a story year-to-date. Our insecticide business in Latin America is up as much as 30%. And globally, our Insect portfolio is up 9%, and we'd expect the market maybe is more like 5%, mid-5% range. So we're outpacing the market.

That's one of the key indicators on how that safrinha season is going to go. And we got to look at 2 elements there: one is the area, what gets planted; and the second element is around technology that they're going to employ. So we're monitoring that closely, and I'd say it's probably too early to call whether there is a major technology shift. I think at the area level, I don't think we're at risk in terms of seeing a reduced area for maybe what the original intentions were, so feel pretty good about that. And in terms of the technology employed, that probably will end up being more of a 2020-type issue because of the fact that, that first planted safrinha seed will still be with our strongest hybrids -- the highest technology. So what we would typically move into customers' hands in December of 20 -- December 2019 will be planted in a window where they should be able to get really good performance, and it's not necessarily a late-planted risky crop.
