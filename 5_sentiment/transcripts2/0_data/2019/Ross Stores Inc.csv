Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn,",632,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2018 performance followed by our outlook for 2019. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
Let me first start discussion of today's financial results by noting that our 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year for 13- and 52-week period, respectively, while our 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year were 14- and 53-week period. 
The 53rd week added approximately $219 million in sales and $0.10 in earnings per share to 2017's fourth quarter and fiscal year. Further, the extra week added about 70 and 20 basis points, respectively, to operating margin in last year's fourth quarter and full year. 
Now let's turn to today's results. As noted in today's press release, sales and earnings for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year outperformed our expectations. As we also mentioned, we achieved these develop despite our own challenging multi-year comparisons and weakness in our Ladies apparel business during the holiday season. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2019, were $1.20 versus $1.19 in the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018. Net earnings for that 2018 fourth quarter was $442 million versus $451 million in the prior year. 
For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2019, earnings per share grew to $4.26 compared to $3.55 in the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018. Fiscal 2018 net earnings were $1.6 billion, up from $1 point billion in fiscal 2017. 
Now let's turn to our recent sales results. For the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2019, total sales were $4.1 billion. Comparable store sales for the period rose 4% over a strong 5% gain in last year's fourth quarter. For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2019, sales increased 6% to $15 billion with comparable store sales up 4% on top of 4% gain in each of the 3 prior years. 
For the fourth quarter, men's was the best-performing area and as a said Ladies underperformed. Geographically, the Southeast and the Midwest were the strongest region. 
Dd's DISCOUNT customers continued to respond positively to its merchandise assortments leading to another quarter and year of solid gains in both sales and operating profit. 
As we ended 2018, total consolidated inventories were up 7% over the prior year with packaway levels at 46% of the total compared to 49% last year. Average in-store inventories were down slightly versus last year. As noted in today's release, our board authorized a new program to repurchase $2.55 billion of common stock over the next 2 fiscal years. 
Our recent stock prices with newer repurchase program represents that 8% of the company's total market share and the 31% increase in over the prior 2-year of $1.95 billion authorization that was completed in January 2019. 
The board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.255 per share, up 13% over the prior year. The increases to our shareholder payouts for 2019 reflects the current strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash to fund and other capital funding growth and other capital needs of the business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our continuing commitment to enhance shareholder value and returns. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2018 results and details on our 2019 full year and first quarter guidance."

As Barbara mentioned earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 year were $1.20 and $4.26, respectively. These results compared to fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.19 and $3.55 for the year. Our earn",801,"Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara mentioned earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 year were $1.20 and $4.26, respectively. These results compared to fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.19 and $3.55 for the year. Our earnings per share results for both 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year reflect a onetime noncash gain of $0.07 related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter as well as a $0.19 benefit from tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter and $0.70 for the year. 
In addition to the $0.10 earnings per share benefit from last year's 53rd week, our 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year EPS results also include a $0.21 benefit from the adoption of tax reform legislation consisting of a onetime $0.14 gain due to a revaluation of deferred taxes and $0.07 from a lower tax rate. 
Now I'll discuss further details on our fourth quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain in the quarter was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. Better-than-expected operating margin of 13.2% for the period was down from last year. 
The 135 basis point decline was primarily due to the approximate 70 basis point benefit in the 2017 fourth quarter from the 53rd week and as expected, higher freight and wage costs. 
For the full year, operating margin declined 85 basis points to 13.6%, due in part to last year's 20 basis point benefit in the 53rd week. 
Costs of goods sold for the year increased 55 basis points, consisting of 40 basis points of higher freight costs, a 15 basis point increase in distribution expenses and a 10 and 5 basis point rise in buying and occupancy cost, respectively. These expense pressures were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin. 
SG&A for the year rose 30 basis points, driven by higher wages. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price at $268 million. For the full year, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $1.075 billion. 
Now let's discuss our outlook for 2019. For the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020, we're forecasting earnings per share to be $4.30 to $4.50, up from $4.26 for fiscal 2018. Our guidance reflects the adoption of annual lease accounting standard, which is not expected to have a significant impact to our earnings results. The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2019 include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020, compared to the 52 weeks ending February 2, 2019. Comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of multiple years of strong gains. We plan to add about 100 new stores this year consisting of approximately 75 Ross and 25 ddâ€™s DISCOUNT locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 other stores. We project that operating margin for 2019 will be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4% compared to 13.6% in 2018. The forecasted decline reflects our plans for relatively flat gross margin and some deleveraging of expenses if same-store sales increase 1% to 2%. 
Net interest income is estimated to be $17.6 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 24%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $362 million. Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately $600 million, which includes the initial investment for our next distribution center and depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $450 million. 
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. Given the recent underperformance in Ladies apparel, our business that becomes more important in the first quarter, we're forecasting comparable store sales to be flat to up 2%. Earnings per share are projected to be $1.05 to $1.11 versus $1.11 for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018. 
Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to increase 3% to 6%. We expect to open 22 new Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNT locations during the quarter. 
First quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.4% to 13.8% versus last year's 15.1%. This forecasted decline includes expectations for a negative impact for the timing of packaway related expenses that benefited last year's first quarter and ongoing headwinds from higher freight and wage costs in the first half of 2019.
Net interest income for the quarter is estimated to be about $4.9 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around $367 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Longer-term though, we remain confident in our ability to achieve ongoing profitable market share gains by consistently offering customers outstanding values throughout our store. As long as we remain focused on the careful execution of our proven off-the-price strategies, we believe we can continue to deliver solid growth in both sales and earnings.

Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn,",635,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2018 performance followed by our outlook for 2019. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
Let me first start the discussion of today's financial results by noting that our 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year were 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, while our 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year were 14- and 53-week period. 
The 53rd week added approximately $219 million in sales and $0.10 in earnings per share to 2017's fourth quarter and fiscal year. Further, the extra week added about 70 and 20 basis points, respectively, to operating margin in last year's fourth quarter and full year. 
Now let's turn to today's results. As noted in today's press release, sales and earnings for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year outperformed our expectation. As we also mentioned, we achieved these results despite our own challenging multiyear comparisons and weakness in our Ladies apparel business during the holiday season. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2019, were $1.20 versus $1.19 in the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018. Net earnings for the 2018 fourth quarter were $442 million versus $451 million in the prior year. 
For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2019, earnings per share grew to $4.26 compared to $3.55 in the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018. Fiscal 2018 net earnings were $1.6 billion, up from $1 point billion in fiscal 2017. 
Now let's turn to our recent sales results. For the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2019, total sales were $4.1 billion. Comparable store sales for the period rose 4% over a strong 5% gain in last year's fourth quarter. For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2019, sales increased 6% to $15 billion with comparable store sales up 4% on top of 4% gains in each of the 3 prior years. 
For the fourth quarter, men's was the best-performing area and as I said, Ladies underperformed. Geographically, the Southeast and the Midwest were the strongest regions. 
ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS customers continued to respond positively to its merchandise assortments leading to another quarter and year of solid gains in both sales and operating profit. 
As we ended 2018, total consolidated inventories were up 7% over the prior year with packaway levels at 46% of the total compared to 49% last year. Average in-store inventories were down slightly versus last year. As noted in today's release, our board authorized a new program to repurchase $2.55 billion of common stock over the next 2 fiscal years. 
Our recent stock prices with new repurchase program represents about 8% of the company's total market share and a 31% increase over the prior 2-year of $1.95 billion authorization that was completed in January 2019. 
The board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.255 per share, up 13% over the prior year. The increases to our shareholder payouts for 2019 reflects the current strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash as to funding and other capital -- funding growth and other capital needs of the business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our continuing commitment to enhance shareholder value and returns. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2018 results and details on our 2019 full year and first quarter guidance."

As Barbara mentioned earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 year were $1.20 and $4.26, respectively. These results compared to fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.19 and $3.55 for the year. Our earn",805,"Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara mentioned earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 year were $1.20 and $4.26, respectively. These results compared to fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.19 and $3.55 for the year. Our earnings per share results for both the 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year reflect a onetime noncash gain of $0.07 related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter as well as a $0.19 benefit from tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter and $0.70 for the year. 
In addition to the $0.10 earnings per share benefit from last year's 53rd week, our 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year EPS results also included a $0.21 benefit from the adoption of tax reform legislation consisting of a onetime $0.14 gain due to a revaluation of deferred taxes and $0.07 from a lower tax rate. 
Now I'll discuss further details on our fourth quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain in the quarter was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. So better-than-expected operating margin of 13.2% for the period was down from last year. 
The 135 basis points decline was primarily due to the approximate 70 basis points benefit in the 2017 fourth quarter from the 53rd week and as expected, higher freight and wage cost. 
For the full year, operating margin declined 85 basis points to 13.6%, due in part to last year's 20 basis points benefit from the 53rd week. 
Cost of goods sold for the year increased 55 basis points, consisting of 40 basis points of higher freight costs, a 15 basis point increase in distribution expenses and a 10 and 5 basis point rise in buying and occupancy cost, respectively. These expense pressures were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin. 
SG&A for the year rose 30 basis points, driven by higher wages. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price at $268 million. For the full year, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $1.075 billion. 
Now let's discuss our outlook for 2019. For the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020, we are forecasting earnings per share to be $4.30 to $4.50, up from $4.26 for fiscal 2018. Our guidance reflects the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, which is not expected to have a significant impact to our earnings results. The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2019 include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020 compared to the 52 weeks ending February 2, 2019. Comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of multiple years of strong gains. We plan to add about 100 new stores this year consisting of approximately 75 Ross and 25 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 other stores. We project that operating margin for 2019 will be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4% compared to 13.6% in 2018. The forecasted decline reflects our plans for relatively flat gross margin and some deleveraging of expenses if same-store sales increase 1% to 2%. 
Net interest income is estimated to be $17.6 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 24%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $362 million. Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately $600 million, which includes the initial investment for our next distribution center. And depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $450 million. 
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. Given the recent underperformance in Ladies apparel, a business that becomes more important in the first quarter, we are forecasting comparable store sales to be flat to up 2%. Earnings per share are projected to be $1.05 to $1.11 versus $1.11 for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018. Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to increase 3% to 6%. We expect to open 22 new Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. 
First quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.4% to 13.8% versus last year's 15.1%. This forecasted decline includes expectations for a negative impact from the timing of packaway-related expenses that benefited last year's first quarter and ongoing headwinds from higher freight and wage cost in the first half of 2019.
Net interest income for the quarter is estimated to be about $4.9 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around $367 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we delivered better-than-expected sales and earnings gains for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Looking ahead, while we hope to do better, we continue to take a prudent approach to forecasting our business for 2019. Although we remain favorably positioned as an off-price retailer, we are facing our own difficult multiyear comparisons to a competitive retail landscape in an uncertain macroeconomic and political environment. 
Longer-term though, we remain confident in our ability to achieve ongoing profitable market share gains by consistently offering customers outstanding values throughout our store. As long as we remain focused on the careful execution of our proven off-price strategies, we believe we can continue to deliver solid growth in both sales and earnings. 
Before we begin the question-and-answer session, I'd like to thank John Call for his leadership and the numerous contributions he has made over more than 2 decades at Ross, including previously serving as CFO for 16 years. John begins his planned transition to an advisory role at the end of this month. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

As we move into Q1, we start obviously transitioning into different products. However, that does take time to change up that assortment. That's not going to be a 1 month, 2 months switch. So it will gradually take time. The other thing is in turn to get the balance -- to balance the way we want to be.

Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn,",635,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2018 performance followed by our outlook for 2019. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
Let me first start the discussion of today's financial results by noting that our 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year were 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, while our 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year were 14- and 53-week period. 
The 53rd week added approximately $219 million in sales and $0.10 in earnings per share to 2017's fourth quarter and fiscal year. Further, the extra week added about 70 and 20 basis points, respectively, to operating margin in last year's fourth quarter and full year. 
Now let's turn to today's results. As noted in today's press release, sales and earnings for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year outperformed our expectation. As we also mentioned, we achieved these results despite our own challenging multiyear comparisons and weakness in our Ladies apparel business during the holiday season. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2019, were $1.20 versus $1.19 in the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018. Net earnings for the 2018 fourth quarter were $442 million versus $451 million in the prior year. 
For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2019, earnings per share grew to $4.26 compared to $3.55 in the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018. Fiscal 2018 net earnings were $1.6 billion, up from $1 point billion in fiscal 2017. 
Now let's turn to our recent sales results. For the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2019, total sales were $4.1 billion. Comparable store sales for the period rose 4% over a strong 5% gain in last year's fourth quarter. For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2019, sales increased 6% to $15 billion with comparable store sales up 4% on top of 4% gains in each of the 3 prior years. 
For the fourth quarter, men's was the best-performing area and as I said, Ladies underperformed. Geographically, the Southeast and the Midwest were the strongest regions. 
ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS customers continued to respond positively to its merchandise assortments leading to another quarter and year of solid gains in both sales and operating profit. 
As we ended 2018, total consolidated inventories were up 7% over the prior year with packaway levels at 46% of the total compared to 49% last year. Average in-store inventories were down slightly versus last year. As noted in today's release, our board authorized a new program to repurchase $2.55 billion of common stock over the next 2 fiscal years. 
Our recent stock prices with new repurchase program represents about 8% of the company's total market share and a 31% increase over the prior 2-year of $1.95 billion authorization that was completed in January 2019. 
The board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.255 per share, up 13% over the prior year. The increases to our shareholder payouts for 2019 reflects the current strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash as to funding and other capital -- funding growth and other capital needs of the business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our continuing commitment to enhance shareholder value and returns. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2018 results and details on our 2019 full year and first quarter guidance."

As Barbara mentioned earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 year were $1.20 and $4.26, respectively. These results compared to fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.19 and $3.55 for the year. Our earn",805,"Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara mentioned earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 year were $1.20 and $4.26, respectively. These results compared to fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.19 and $3.55 for the year. Our earnings per share results for both the 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year reflect a onetime noncash gain of $0.07 related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter as well as a $0.19 benefit from tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter and $0.70 for the year. 
In addition to the $0.10 earnings per share benefit from last year's 53rd week, our 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year EPS results also included a $0.21 benefit from the adoption of tax reform legislation consisting of a onetime $0.14 gain due to a revaluation of deferred taxes and $0.07 from a lower tax rate. 
Now I'll discuss further details on our fourth quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain in the quarter was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. So better-than-expected operating margin of 13.2% for the period was down from last year. 
The 135 basis points decline was primarily due to the approximate 70 basis points benefit in the 2017 fourth quarter from the 53rd week and as expected, higher freight and wage cost. 
For the full year, operating margin declined 85 basis points to 13.6%, due in part to last year's 20 basis points benefit from the 53rd week. 
Cost of goods sold for the year increased 55 basis points, consisting of 40 basis points of higher freight costs, a 15 basis point increase in distribution expenses and a 10 and 5 basis point rise in buying and occupancy cost, respectively. These expense pressures were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin. 
SG&A for the year rose 30 basis points, driven by higher wages. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price at $268 million. For the full year, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $1.075 billion. 
Now let's discuss our outlook for 2019. For the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020, we are forecasting earnings per share to be $4.30 to $4.50, up from $4.26 for fiscal 2018. Our guidance reflects the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, which is not expected to have a significant impact to our earnings results. The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2019 include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020 compared to the 52 weeks ending February 2, 2019. Comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of multiple years of strong gains. We plan to add about 100 new stores this year consisting of approximately 75 Ross and 25 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. We project that operating margin for 2019 will be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4% compared to 13.6% in 2018. The forecasted decline reflects our plans for relatively flat gross margin and some deleveraging of expenses if same-store sales increase 1% to 2%. 
Net interest income is estimated to be $17.6 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 24%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $362 million. Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately $600 million, which includes the initial investment for our next distribution center. And depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $450 million. 
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. Given the recent underperformance in Ladies apparel, a business that becomes more important in the first quarter, we are forecasting comparable store sales to be flat to up 2%. Earnings per share are projected to be $1.05 to $1.11 versus $1.11 for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018. Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to increase 3% to 6%. We expect to open 22 new Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. 
First quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.4% to 13.8% versus last year's 15.1%. This forecasted decline includes expectations for a negative impact from the timing of packaway-related expenses that benefited last year's first quarter and ongoing headwinds from higher freight and wage cost in the first half of 2019.
Net interest income for the quarter is estimated to be about $4.9 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around $367 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we delivered better-than-expected sales and earnings gains for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Looking ahead, while we hope to do better, we continue to take a prudent approach to forecasting our business for 2019. Although we remain favorably positioned as an off-price retailer, we are facing our own difficult multiyear comparisons, a very competitive retail landscape in an uncertain macroeconomic and political environment. 
Longer-term though, we remain confident in our ability to achieve ongoing profitable market share gains by consistently offering customers outstanding values throughout our store. As long as we remain focused on the careful execution of our proven off-price strategies, we believe we can continue to deliver solid growth in both sales and earnings. 
Before we begin the question-and-answer session, I'd like to thank John Call for his leadership and the numerous contributions he has made over more than 2 decades at Ross, including previously serving as CFO for 16 years. John begins his planned transition to an advisory role at the end of this month. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

As we move into Q1, we start obviously transitioning into different products. However, that does take time to change up that assortment. That's not going to be a 1 month, 2 months switch. So it will gradually take time. The other thing is in turn to get the balance -- to balance the way we want to be. The other thing in terms of having any liable inventory issues or bad packaway or anything along those lines, we don't have that. We absolutely cleaned that up, and so we need to take the time to ship the assortment to get it back to where we need it to be."

Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn,",635,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2018 performance followed by our outlook for 2019. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
Let me first start the discussion of today's financial results by noting that our 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year were 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, while our 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year were 14- and 53-week period. 
The 53rd week added approximately $219 million in sales and $0.10 in earnings per share to 2017's fourth quarter and fiscal year. Further, the extra week added about 70 and 20 basis points, respectively, to operating margin in last year's fourth quarter and full year. 
Now let's turn to today's results. As noted in today's press release, sales and earnings for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year outperformed our expectation. As we also mentioned, we achieved these results despite our own challenging multiyear comparisons and weakness in our Ladies apparel business during the holiday season. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2019, were $1.20 versus $1.19 in the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018. Net earnings for the 2018 fourth quarter were $442 million versus $451 million in the prior year. 
For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2019, earnings per share grew to $4.26 compared to $3.55 in the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018. Fiscal 2018 net earnings were $1.6 billion, up from $1 point billion in fiscal 2017. 
Now let's turn to our recent sales results. For the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2019, total sales were $4.1 billion. Comparable store sales for the period rose 4% over a strong 5% gain in last year's fourth quarter. For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2019, sales increased 6% to $15 billion with comparable store sales up 4% on top of 4% gains in each of the 3 prior years. 
For the fourth quarter, men's was the best-performing area and as I said, Ladies underperformed. Geographically, the Southeast and the Midwest were the strongest regions. 
ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS customers continued to respond positively to its merchandise assortments leading to another quarter and year of solid gains in both sales and operating profit. 
As we ended 2018, total consolidated inventories were up 7% over the prior year with packaway levels at 46% of the total compared to 49% last year. Average in-store inventories were down slightly versus last year. As noted in today's release, our board authorized a new program to repurchase $2.55 billion of common stock over the next 2 fiscal years. 
Our recent stock prices with new repurchase program represents about 8% of the company's total market share and a 31% increase over the prior 2-year of $1.95 billion authorization that was completed in January 2019. 
The board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.255 per share, up 13% over the prior year. The increases to our shareholder payouts for 2019 reflects the current strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash as to funding and other capital -- funding growth and other capital needs of the business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our continuing commitment to enhance shareholder value and returns. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2018 results and details on our 2019 full year and first quarter guidance."

As Barbara mentioned earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 year were $1.20 and $4.26, respectively. These results compared to fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.19 and $3.55 for the year. Our earn",805,"Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara mentioned earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 year were $1.20 and $4.26, respectively. These results compared to fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.19 and $3.55 for the year. Our earnings per share results for both the 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year reflect a onetime noncash gain of $0.07 related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter as well as a $0.19 benefit from tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter and $0.70 for the year. 
In addition to the $0.10 earnings per share benefit from last year's 53rd week, our 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year EPS results also included a $0.21 benefit from the adoption of tax reform legislation consisting of a onetime $0.14 gain due to a revaluation of deferred taxes and $0.07 from a lower tax rate. 
Now I'll discuss further details on our fourth quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain in the quarter was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. So better-than-expected operating margin of 13.2% for the period was down from last year. 
The 135 basis points decline was primarily due to the approximate 70 basis points benefit in the 2017 fourth quarter from the 53rd week and as expected, higher freight and wage cost. 
For the full year, operating margin declined 85 basis points to 13.6%, due in part to last year's 20 basis points benefit from the 53rd week. 
Cost of goods sold for the year increased 55 basis points, consisting of 40 basis points of higher freight costs, a 15 basis point increase in distribution expenses and a 10 and 5 basis point rise in buying and occupancy cost, respectively. These expense pressures were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin. 
SG&A for the year rose 30 basis points, driven by higher wages. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price at $268 million. For the full year, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $1.075 billion. 
Now let's discuss our outlook for 2019. For the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020, we are forecasting earnings per share to be $4.30 to $4.50, up from $4.26 for fiscal 2018. Our guidance reflects the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, which is not expected to have a significant impact to our earnings results. The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2019 include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020 compared to the 52 weeks ending February 2, 2019. Comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of multiple years of strong gains. We plan to add about 100 new stores this year consisting of approximately 75 Ross and 25 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. We project that operating margin for 2019 will be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4% compared to 13.6% in 2018. The forecasted decline reflects our plans for relatively flat gross margin and some deleveraging of expenses if same-store sales increase 1% to 2%. 
Net interest income is estimated to be $17.6 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 24%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $362 million. Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately $600 million, which includes the initial investment for our next distribution center. And depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $450 million. 
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. Given the recent underperformance in Ladies apparel, a business that becomes more important in the first quarter, we are forecasting comparable store sales to be flat to up 2%. Earnings per share are projected to be $1.05 to $1.11 versus $1.11 for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018. Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to increase 3% to 6%. We expect to open 22 new Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. 
First quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.4% to 13.8% versus last year's 15.1%. This forecasted decline includes expectations for a negative impact from the timing of packaway-related expenses that benefited last year's first quarter and ongoing headwinds from higher freight and wage cost in the first half of 2019.
Net interest income for the quarter is estimated to be about $4.9 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around $367 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we delivered better-than-expected sales and earnings gains for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Looking ahead, while we hope to do better, we continue to take a prudent approach to forecasting our business for 2019. Although we remain favorably positioned as an off-price retailer, we are facing our own difficult multiyear comparisons, a very competitive retail landscape in an uncertain macroeconomic and political environment. 
Longer-term though, we remain confident in our ability to achieve ongoing profitable market share gains by consistently offering customers outstanding values throughout our store. As long as we remain focused on the careful execution of our proven off-price strategies, we believe we can continue to deliver solid growth in both sales and earnings. 
Before we begin the question-and-answer session, I'd like to thank John Call for his leadership and the numerous contributions he has made over more than 2 decades at Ross, including previously serving as CFO for 16 years. John begins his planned transition to an advisory role at the end of this month.

And then your question, Kimberly, is the game within the game of the assortment within the assortment. Yes, that varies by different business. What we did feel is that we did leave seasonal opportunity on the table because of our imbalance, which would have driven more Q4 business had we been in better shape in those businesses. As we move into Q1, we start obviously transitioning into different products. However, that does take time to change up that assortment. That's not going to be a 1 month, 2 months switch. So it will gradually take time. The other thing is in turn to get the balance -- to balance the way we want to be. The other thing in terms of having any liable inventory issues or bad packaway or anything along those lines, we don't have that. We absolutely cleaned that up, and so we need to take the time to ship the assortment to get it back to where we need it to be."

We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance followed by our outlook for the second quarter in fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, for the first quarter, we delivered sales days at the high-end of our guidance as well as better-than-expected earnings per share growth. Despite continued underperformance in Ladies apparel. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2019, with a $1.15, up from a $1.11 for the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2019 first quarter were $421 million compared to $418 million in the prior year. These results included an approximate $0.02 per share benefit from favorable timing of expenses, but are expected to reverse over the balance of the year. 
Total sales for the period increased 6% to $3.8 billion with comparable store sales up 2%. For the first quarter, the strongest merchandise category at Ross was Men, while the Midwest was the best performing geographic regions. 
As I just mentioned, Ladies apparel remains unchanged. Our execution in this important business remains below our standard, and consequently, we did not offer our customers the compelling values they have come to expect from us. While we are working diligently to improve our merchandise assortments, which were added balance in a number of areas in Ladies, plus strengthen our value proposition it can take some time to correct issues like this in a chain of our size.
That said, we do believe that the actions we are taking will lead to improved results as we move through the year. As we ended the period, total consolidated inventories were down 4% over the prior year. 
Average in-store inventory throughout 1% as planned, while pathway as a percentage of total inventories was 44% compared to 49% last year. As it has the same for time now, ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS posted better than expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter. 
Turning to store growth, our 2019 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 22 new Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019 comprised of 75 Ross and 25 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS discount. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 2% comparable store sales gain was primarily driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. While operating margin of 14.1% was down 95 basis points from last year, there was better-than-expected mainly due to above planned merchandise margin and favorable timing of expenses. Cost of goods sold rose by 85 basis points in the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement in merchandise margin was more than offset by a 60 basis point increase in distribution cost as we were up against last year's benefit from packaway-related expenses. In addition, freight cost grew by 35 basis points and occupancy and buying expenses increased by 10 basis points each.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the period increased 10 basis points as higher rates related costs were partially offset by favorable timing of expenses. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $320 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2019, we are forecasting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% on a top of a 5% gain last year.
Earnings per share for the second quarter are projected to be in the range of $1.06, to and $1.11 up from $1.04 in the prior year period. 
The operating statement assumptions for our second quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period, including the 22 Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations. If same-store sales are in line with our then we the project operating margin to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4%. The forecasted decline from last year's 13.8% mainly reflects headwinds from higher wage and freight cost, partially offset by the and a worsening of last year's negative impact from packaway timing. 
In addition, we would expect some deleveraging on occupancy if comparable sales performed in line with our guidance.
We expect net interest income of about $4 million, our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $363 million. 
Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2019 to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.52. This compares to EPS of $4.26 last year, which included a $0.07 per share benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter in the fourth quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Joining me on our call today are Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; Michael Hartshorn, Group Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance followed by our outlook for the second quarter in fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, for the first quarter, we delivered sales gains at the high end of our guidance as well as better-than-expected earnings per share growth despite continued underperformance in Ladies apparel. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2019 was $1.15, up from $1.11 for the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2019 first quarter were $421 million compared to $418 million in the prior year. These results include an approximate $0.02 per share benefit from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse over the balance of the year. 
Total sales for the period increased 6% to $3.8 billion with comparable store sales up 2%. For the first quarter, the strongest merchandise category at Ross was men's while the Midwest was the best performing geographic region. 
As I just mentioned, Ladies apparel trails a chain. Our execution in this important business remains below our standard and consequently, we did not offer our customers the compelling values they have come to expect from us. While we are working diligently to improve our merchandise assortments, which were out of balance in a number of areas in Ladies, plus strengthen our value propositions, it can take some time to correct issues like this in a chain of our size.
That said, we do believe that the actions we are taking will lead to improved results as we move through the year. As we ended the period, total consolidated inventories were down 4% over the prior year. 
Average in-store inventories were up 1% as planned while packaway, as a percentage of total inventories, was 44% compared to 49% last year. As it has for time now, ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS posted better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter. 
Turning to store growth. Our 2019 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 22 new Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019 comprised of 75 Ross and 25 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plan to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 2% comparable store sales gain was primarily driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. While operating margin of 14.1% was down 95 basis points from last year, it was better-than-expected mainly due to above planned merchandise margin and favorable timing of expenses. Cost of goods sold rose by 85 basis points in the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement in merchandise margin was more than offset by a 60 basis point increase in distribution cost as we were up against last year's benefit from packaway-related expense. In addition, freight costs grew by 35 basis points and occupancy and buying expenses increased by 10 basis points each.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the period increased 10 basis points as higher wage-related costs were partially offset by favorable timing of expenses. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $320 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2019, we're forecasting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% on a top of a 5% gain last year.
Earnings per share for the second quarter are projected to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.11, up from $1.04 in the prior year period. 
The operating statement assumptions for our second quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period including the 22 Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations. If same-store sales are in line with our guidance then we project operating margin to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4%. The forecasted decline from last year's 13.8% mainly reflects headwinds from higher wage and freight cost, partially offset by the anniversarying of last year's negative impact from packaway timing.
In addition, we would expect some deleveraging on occupancy if comparable sales performed in line with our guidance.
We expect net interest income of about $4 million, our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $363 million. 
Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2019 to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.52. This compares to EPS of $4.26 last year, which included a $0.07 per share benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter in the fourth quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara, for closing comments."

Joining me on our call today are Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; Michael Hartshorn, Group Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, for the first quarter, we delivered sales gains at the high end of our guidance as well as better-than-expected earnings per share growth despite continued underperformance in Ladies apparel. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2019 was $1.15, up from $1.11 for the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2019 first quarter were $421 million compared to $418 million in the prior year. These results include an approximate $0.02 per share benefit from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse over the balance of the year. 
Total sales for the period increased 6% to $3.8 billion with comparable store sales up 2%. For the first quarter, the strongest merchandise category at Ross was men's while the Midwest was the best performing geographic region. 
As I just mentioned, Ladies apparel trails a chain. Our execution in this important business remains below our standard and consequently, we did not offer our customers the compelling values they have come to expect from us. While we are working diligently to improve our merchandise assortments, which were out of balance in a number of areas in Ladies, plus strengthen our value propositions, it can take some time to correct issues like this in a chain of our size.
That said, we do believe that the actions we are taking will lead to improved results as we move through the year. As we ended the period, total consolidated inventories were down 4% over the prior year. 
Average in-store inventories were up 1% as planned while packaway, as a percentage of total inventories, was 44% compared to 49% last year. As it has for time now, ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS posted better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter. 
Turning to store growth. Our 2019 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 22 new Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019 comprised of 75 Ross and 25 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 2% comparable store sales gain was primarily driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. While operating margin of 14.1% was down 95 basis points from last year, it was better-than-expected mainly due to above planned merchandise margin and favorable timing of expenses. Cost of goods sold rose by 85 basis points in the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement in merchandise margin was more than offset by a 60 basis point increase in distribution cost as we were up against last year's benefit from packaway-related expense. In addition, freight costs grew by 35 basis points and occupancy and buying expenses increased by 10 basis points each.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the period increased 10 basis points as higher wage-related costs were partially offset by favorable timing of expenses. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $320 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2019, we're forecasting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% on a top of a 5% gain last year.
Earnings per share for the second quarter are projected to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.11, up from $1.04 in the prior year period. 
The operating statement assumptions for our second quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period including the 22 Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations. If same-store sales are in line with our guidance then we project operating margin to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4%. The forecasted decline from last year's 13.8% mainly reflects headwinds from higher wage and freight cost, partially offset by the anniversarying of last year's negative impact from packaway timing.
In addition, we would expect some deleveraging on occupancy if comparable sales performed in line with our guidance.
We expect net interest income of about $4 million, our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $363 million. 
Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2019 to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.52. This compares to EPS of $4.26 last year, which included a $0.07 per share benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter in the fourth quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara, for closing comments."

I would say that the overall merchandise offerings just weren't where they needed to be and really it was execution issues that were really below our standards."

Joining me on our call today are Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; Michael Hartshorn, Group Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, for the first quarter, we delivered sales gains at the high end of our guidance as well as better-than-expected earnings per share growth despite continued underperformance in Ladies apparel. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2019 was $1.15, up from $1.11 for the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2019 first quarter were $421 million compared to $418 million in the prior year. These results include an approximate $0.02 per share benefit from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse over the balance of the year. 
Total sales for the period increased 6% to $3.8 billion with comparable store sales up 2%. For the first quarter, the strongest merchandise category at Ross was men's while the Midwest was the best performing geographic region. 
As I just mentioned, Ladies apparel trails a chain. Our execution in this important business remains below our standard and consequently, we did not offer our customers the compelling values they have come to expect from us. While we are working diligently to improve our merchandise assortments, which were out of balance in a number of areas in Ladies, plus strengthen our value propositions, it can take some time to correct issues like this in a chain of our size.
That said, we do believe that the actions we are taking will lead to improved results as we move through the year. As we ended the period, total consolidated inventories were down 4% over the prior year. 
Average in-store inventories were up 1% as planned while packaway, as a percentage of total inventories, was 44% compared to 49% last year. As it has for time now, ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS posted better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter. 
Turning to store growth. Our 2019 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 22 new Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019 comprised of 75 Ross and 25 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 2% comparable store sales gain was primarily driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. While operating margin of 14.1% was down 95 basis points from last year, it was better-than-expected mainly due to above planned merchandise margin and favorable timing of expenses. Cost of goods sold rose by 85 basis points in the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement in merchandise margin was more than offset by a 60 basis point increase in distribution cost as we were up against last year's benefit from packaway-related expense. In addition, freight costs grew by 35 basis points and occupancy and buying expenses increased by 10 basis points each.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the period increased 10 basis points as higher wage-related costs were partially offset by favorable timing of expenses. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $320 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2019, we're forecasting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% on a top of a 5% gain last year.
Earnings per share for the second quarter are projected to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.11, up from $1.04 in the prior year period. 
The operating statement assumptions for our second quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period including the 22 Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations. If same-store sales are in line with our guidance then we project operating margin to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4%. The forecasted decline from last year's 13.8% mainly reflects headwinds from higher wage and freight cost, partially offset by the anniversarying of last year's negative impact from packaway timing.
In addition, we would expect some deleveraging on occupancy if comparable sales performed in line with our guidance.
We expect net interest income of about $4 million, our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $363 million. 
Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2019 to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.52. This compares to EPS of $4.26 last year, which included a $0.07 per share benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter in the fourth quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara, for closing comments."

Joining me on our call today are Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; Michael Hartshorn, Group Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, for the first quarter, we delivered sales gains at the high end of our guidance as well as better-than-expected earnings per share growth despite continued underperformance in Ladies apparel. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2019 was $1.15, up from $1.11 for the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2019 first quarter were $421 million compared to $418 million in the prior year. These results include an approximate $0.02 per share benefit from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse over the balance of the year. 
Total sales for the period increased 6% to $3.8 billion with comparable store sales up 2%. For the first quarter, the strongest merchandise category at Ross was men's while the Midwest was the best performing geographic region. 
As I just mentioned, Ladies apparel trails a chain. Our execution in this important business remains below our standard and consequently, we did not offer our customers the compelling values they have come to expect from us. While we are working diligently to improve our merchandise assortments, which were out of balance in a number of areas in Ladies, plus strengthen our value propositions, it can take some time to correct issues like this in a chain of our size.
That said, we do believe that the actions we are taking will lead to improved results as we move through the year. As we ended the period, total consolidated inventories were down 4% over the prior year. 
Average in-store inventories were up 1% as planned while packaway, as a percentage of total inventories, was 44% compared to 49% last year. As it has for time now, ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS posted better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter. 
Turning to store growth. Our 2019 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 22 new Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019 comprised of 75 Ross and 25 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 2% comparable store sales gain was primarily driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. While operating margin of 14.1% was down 95 basis points from last year, it was better-than-expected mainly due to above planned merchandise margin and favorable timing of expenses. Cost of goods sold rose by 85 basis points in the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement in merchandise margin was more than offset by a 60 basis point increase in distribution cost as we were up against last year's benefit from packaway-related expense. In addition, freight costs grew by 35 basis points and occupancy and buying expenses increased by 10 basis points each.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the period increased 10 basis points as higher wage-related costs were partially offset by favorable timing of expenses. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $320 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2019, we're forecasting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% on a top of a 5% gain last year.
Earnings per share for the second quarter are projected to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.11, up from $1.04 in the prior year period. 
The operating statement assumptions for our second quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period including the 22 Ross and 6 ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS locations. If same-store sales are in line with our guidance then we project operating margin to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4%. The forecasted decline from last year's 13.8% mainly reflects headwinds from higher wage and freight cost, partially offset by the anniversarying of last year's negative impact from packaway timing.
In addition, we would expect some deleveraging on occupancy if comparable sales performed in line with our guidance.
We expect net interest income of about $4 million, our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $363 million. 
Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2019 to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.52. This compares to EPS of $4.26 last year, which included a $0.07 per share benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter in the fourth quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara, for closing comments."

As noted in today's press release, we delivered respectful gains in both sales and earnings for the second quarter. Earnings per share for the period $1.40, up from $1.04 from last year. Net earnings were $413 million, up from $389 million in the prior year. Total sales for the second quarter increased 6% to $4 billion. 
Comparable store sales rose 3% on top of last year's strongest quarterly comparison of 5%. For the second quarter, the best reporting merchandise Ross was men's, while the Midwest and southeast were the top performing market. While the ladies business continues to where exchange, transcend this important area showed some improvement in the quarter. We continue to believe that the actions we are taking here will lead to additional improvements as we move through the balance of the year.
Operating margin of 13.7% was better than expected mainly due to favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $2.29, up from $2.15 last year. Net earnings were $834 million, up from $808 million in the first half of 2018.
Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $7.8 billion, with comparable store sales up 2% versus a 4% gain for the first half of last year. 
As we enter the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 8% over the prior year. Packaway were 43% of total inventory compared to last year's 44%.
Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 4% as we [indiscernible] receives a little earlier to support the back selling period. DCâ€™s DISCOUNTS had another quarter of strong growth in both sales and operating profits. Turning to our [indiscernible] program, we remained on schedule with the opening of 22 new Ross and 6 DD DISCOUNT locations in the second quarter.

As previously mentioned, our second quarter earnings results benefited from the favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. This benefit was worth approximately $0.02 to earnings per share. 
Now turning to the details of our Q2 results. As noted in today's press release, we've updated our earnings guidance for the second have given the recent announcement of 10% tariffs on goods sourced from China, including apparel and footwear. Our project impact is based on our present understanding of the timing of and the merchandise categories included in these additional tariffs.
Our sales forecast for the second half remains unchanged. We continue to forecast same-store sales for the balance of the year to grow by 1% to 2%. The sales performed in line with this projection earnings per share for the third quarter were forecasted to be in the range of $0.92 and $0.96 compared to $0.91 a year ago.
For the fourth quarter, earnings per shares are projected to be $1.20 to $1.25 versus $1.20 in the prior year, which included a one-time per share benefit of $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter. 
Now, I will provide some operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS.
Projected sales, total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 22 new stores during the period, including 30 Ross and 12 ddâ€™s locations. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 11.8% to 12.0% compared to last year's 12.4%. This forecast reflects our expectations for some pressure on the merchandise gross margins from tariffs along with deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses if comparable sales performed in line with our guidance. 
We expect net interest income income of about $3.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, and weighted average diluted shares turning our likely to be about 360 million. 
Based on our first half results and second half guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.41 to $4.50 compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018, which included the previously mentioned one-time per share benefit of $0.07. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group's President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook to the second half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we delivered respectable gains in both sales and earnings for the second quarter. Earnings per share for the period $1.14, up from $1.04 last year. Net earnings were $413 million, up from $389 million in the prior year. Total sales for the second quarter increased 6% to $4 billion.
Comparable store sales rose 3% on top of last year's strongest quarterly comparison of 5%. For the second quarter, the best performing merchandise category at Ross was men, while the Midwest and Southeast were the top performing markets. 
While the Ladies business continue to trail the chain, trends in this important area showed some improvement during the quarter. We continue to believe that the actions we are taking here will lead to additional improvements as we move through the balance of the year.
Operating margin of 13.7% was better than expected mainly due to favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $2.29, up from $2.15 last year. Net earnings were $834 million, up from $808 million in the first half of 2018. Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $7.8 billion, with comparable store sales up 2% versus a 4% gain for the first half of last year. As we enter the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 8% over the prior year. Packaway was 43% of total inventory compared to last year's 44%.
Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 4% as we flowed receipts a little earlier to support the back-to-school selling period. Ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS had another quarter of strong growth in both sales and operating profits. 
Turning to our store expansion program. We remained on schedule with the opening of 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNT locations in the second quarter. We continue to project adding a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019 comprised of 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. 
Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our second quarter result and details on our second half guidance."

As previously mentioned, our second quarter earnings results benefited from the favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. This benefit was worth approximately $0.02 to earnings per share.
Now turning to the details of our Q2 results. As noted in today's press release, we have updated our earnings guidance for the second half given the recent announcement of 10% tariffs on goods sourced from China, including apparel and footwear. Our projected impact is based on our present understanding of the timing of and the merchandise categories included in these additional tariffs.
Our sales forecast for the second half remains unchanged. We continue to forecast same-store sales for the balance of the year to grow by 1% to 2%. The sales performed in line with this projection, earnings per share for the third quarter were forecasted to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.96 compared to $0.91 a year ago.
For the fourth quarter, earnings per share was projected to be $1.20 to $1.25 versus $1.20 in the prior year, which included a onetime per share benefit of $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.
Now, I will provide some operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS. Projected sales, total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 42 new stores during the period, including 30 Ross and 12 ddâ€™s locations. 
Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 11.8% to 12.0% compared to last year's 12.4%. This forecast reflects our expectations for some pressure on merchandise gross margin from tariffs along with deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses if comparable sales perform in line with our guidance.
We expect net interest income of about $3.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 360 million.
Based on our first half results and second half guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.41 to $4.50 compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018, which included the previously mentioned onetime per share benefit of $0.07.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To sum up, as I mentioned earlier, we delivered respectful sales and earnings growth for the second quarter on top of our strongest quarterly comparable sales comparison from last year. While we've made progress in strengthening of the Ladies apparel business, we still have a way to go until we're satisfied with our assortments in this important area. 
As we move into the fall season, we'll work on our merchandising initiatives in Ladies and also throughout the entire store, so that we are delivering the right products and brands, priced as sharply as our customers have come to expect. 
We believe the additional tariffs may result in increased uncertainty in the apparel and footwear markets. Historically, disruptions like this have benefited off-price. As always, our focus will continue to be offering our customers the most compelling value as possible throughout our stores.

So we're going to have to wait and see how retailers react to the higher cost, their approach on pricing, and then really the customers' reaction to potential price inflation. So in the near term, it's a wait and see. We have to kind of watch what they are doing and then see where that puts us because we're clearly not the leader on pricing. 
In the intermediary -- intermediate, never get that word out, I think it will -- it historically would have given us an opportunity for supply in some changing markets. But I think until we understand, in near term, and intermediate being defined as, I guess, part of '20, until we understand what the price -- what the pricing is going to mean to the customer, I think there's going to be some challenges ahead, particularly as department store business is difficult. And so with that, we're willing to wait and see. And again, as I said, we're going to hold on our pricing. And see where we sit in the order because the most important thing while all of this is going on is that we offer our customers the best value as possible.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group's President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook to the second half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we delivered respectable gains in both sales and earnings for the second quarter. Earnings per share for the period $1.14, up from $1.04 last year. Net earnings were $413 million, up from $389 million in the prior year. Total sales for the second quarter increased 6% to $4 billion.
Comparable store sales rose 3% on top of last year's strongest quarterly comparison of 5%. For the second quarter, the best performing merchandise department at Ross was men, while the Midwest and Southeast were the top performing markets.
While the Ladies business continued to trail the chain, trends in this important area showed some improvement during the quarter. We continue to believe that the actions we are taking here will lead to additional improvements as we move through the balance of the year.
Operating margin of 13.7% was better than expected mainly due to favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $2.29, up from $2.15 last year. Net earnings were $834 million, up from $808 million in the first half of 2018. Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $7.8 billion, with comparable store sales up 2% versus a 4% gain for the first half of last year. As we enter the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 8% over the prior year. Packaway was 43% of total inventory compared to last year's 44%.
Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 4% as we flowed receipts a little earlier to support the back-to-school selling period. Ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS had another quarter of strong growth in both sales and operating profits.
Turning to our store expansion program. We remained on schedule with the opening of 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNT locations in the second quarter. We continue to project adding a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019 comprised of 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.
Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

As previously mentioned, our second quarter earnings results benefited from the favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. This benefit was worth approximately $0.02 to earnings per share.
Now turning to the details of our Q2 results. As noted in today's press release, we have updated our earnings guidance for the second half given the recent announcement of 10% tariffs on goods sourced from China, including apparel and footwear. Our projected impact is based on our present understanding of the timing of and the merchandise categories included in these additional tariffs.
Our sales forecast for the second half remains unchanged. We continue to forecast same-store sales for the balance of the year to grow by 1% to 2%. Sales performed in line with this projection, earnings per share for the third quarter were forecasted to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.96 compared to $0.91 a year ago.
For the fourth quarter, earnings per share are projected to be $1.20 to $1.25 versus $1.20 in the prior year, which included a onetime per share benefit of $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.
Now I will provide some operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS. Projected sales -- total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 42 new stores during the period, including 30 Ross and 12 ddâ€™s locations.
Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 11.8% to 12.0% compared to last year's 12.4%. This forecast reflects our expectations for some pressure on merchandise gross margin from tariffs along with deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses if comparable sales perform in line with our guidance.
We expect net interest income of about $3.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 360 million.
Based on our first half results and second half guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.41 to $4.50 compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018, which included the previously mentioned onetime per share benefit of $0.07.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

So we're going to have to wait and see how retailers react to the higher cost, their approach on pricing, and then really the customers' reaction to potential price inflation. So in the near term, it's a wait and see. We have to kind of watch what they are doing and then see where that puts us because we're clearly not the leader on pricing. 
In the intermediary -- intermediate, get that word out, I think it will -- it historically would have given us an opportunity for supply in some changing markets. But I think until we understand, near term and intermediate being defined as, I guess, part of '20, until we understand what the price -- what the pricing is going to mean to the customer, I think there's going to be some challenges ahead, particularly as department store business is difficult. And so with that, we're willing to wait and see. And again, as I said, we're going to hold on our pricing.

How does the customer experience change if they're coming in to buy apparel, if they're also kind of looking at auto parts and pet supplies and toys and food and other things that maybe they're not used to seeing in the store?"

Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group's President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook to the second half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we delivered respectable gains in both sales and earnings for the second quarter. Earnings per share for the period $1.14, up from $1.04 last year. Net earnings were $413 million, up from $389 million in the prior year. Total sales for the second quarter increased 6% to $4 billion.
Comparable store sales rose 3% on top of last year's strongest quarterly comparison of 5%. For the second quarter, the best performing merchandise department at Ross was men, while the Midwest and Southeast were the top performing markets.
While the Ladies business continued to trail the chain, trends in this important area showed some improvement during the quarter. We continue to believe that the actions we are taking here will lead to additional improvements as we move through the balance of the year.
Operating margin of 13.7% was better than expected mainly due to favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $2.29, up from $2.15 last year. Net earnings were $834 million, up from $808 million in the first half of 2018. Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $7.8 billion, with comparable store sales up 2% versus a 4% gain for the first half of last year. As we enter the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 8% over the prior year. Packaway was 43% of total inventory compared to last year's 44%.
Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 4% as we flowed receipts a little earlier to support the back-to-school selling period. Ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS had another quarter of strong growth in both sales and operating profits.
Turning to our store expansion program. We remained on schedule with the opening of 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNT locations in the second quarter. We continue to project adding a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019 comprised of 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.
Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

As previously mentioned, our second quarter earnings results benefited from the favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. This benefit was worth approximately $0.02 to earnings per share.
Now turning to the details of our Q2 results. As noted in today's press release, we have updated our earnings guidance for the second half given the recent announcement of 10% tariffs on goods sourced from China, including apparel and footwear. Our projected impact is based on our present understanding of the timing of and the merchandise categories included in these additional tariffs.
Our sales forecast for the second half remains unchanged. We continue to forecast same-store sales for the balance of the year to grow by 1% to 2%. Sales performed in line with this projection, earnings per share for the third quarter were forecasted to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.96 compared to $0.91 a year ago.
For the fourth quarter, earnings per share are projected to be $1.20 to $1.25 versus $1.20 in the prior year, which included a onetime per share benefit of $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.
Now I will provide some operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS. Projected sales -- total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 42 new stores during the period, including 30 Ross and 12 ddâ€™s locations.
Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 11.8% to 12.0% compared to last year's 12.4%. This forecast reflects our expectations for some pressure on merchandise gross margin from tariffs along with deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses if comparable sales perform in line with our guidance.
We expect net interest income of about $3.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 360 million.
Based on our first half results and second half guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.41 to $4.50 compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018, which included the previously mentioned onetime per share benefit of $0.07.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

So we're not going to be the leader in terms of raising prices.

So we're studying that business. So we're going to have to wait and see how retailers react to the higher cost, their approach on pricing, and then really the customers' reaction to potential price inflation. So in the near term, it's a wait and see. We have to kind of watch what they are doing and then see where that puts us because we're clearly not the leader on pricing. 
In the intermediary -- intermediate, get that word out, I think it will -- it historically would have given us an opportunity for supply in some changing markets. But I think until we understand, near term and intermediate being defined as, I guess, part of '20, until we understand what the price -- what the pricing is going to mean to the customer, I think there's going to be some challenges ahead, particularly as department store business is difficult. And so with that, we're willing to wait and see. And again, as I said, we're going to hold on our pricing. And see where we sit in the order because the most important thing while all of this is going on is that we offer our customers the best value as possible.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call",405,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased that our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations. Earnings per share for the period were $1.03, up from $0.91 last year. Net earnings grew to $371 million from $338 million in the prior year. Total sales for the third quarter increased 8% to $3.8 billion, with comparable store sales up a strong 5% on top of last year's 3% gain. 
For the third quarter, we saw broad-based strength across both merchandise departments and geographic regions with Children's and the Midwest performing the best. We also continue to see improving sales trends in our Ladies apparel business. While this area becomes less important as we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the actions we are taking here will lead to ongoing improvement during the holiday selling season and into 2020. 
Operating margin of 12.4% and was above plan, mainly due to better-than-expected sales and merchandise margins. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $3.32, up from $3.06 last year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion versus $1.1 billion in the first 9 months of 2018. Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $11.6 billion, with comparable stores up 3% on top of a 3% gain last year. 
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 10% over the prior year, while packaway was 39% of the total compared to 41% last year. Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 3%. Dd's discounts continue to perform well, with robust above-planned growth in both sales and operating profit. 
Turning to our store expansion program. We opened 30 new Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNT locations in the third quarter, completing our 2019 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,546 Ross and 259 dd's locations for a net increase of 89 for fiscal 2019. Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. Third quarter operating margin of 12.4% was above planned and similar to last year. Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the period. Merchandise margin grew by 20 basis points, while occupancy and buying levered by 10 and 5, respectively. These favorable items were more than offset by distribution expenses that increased 45 basis points, mainly due to the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher wages. Freight was flat for the quarter. 
Selling and general and administrative expenses for the period decreased 10 basis points. During the third quarter and first 9 months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 3.0 million and 9.6 million shares, respectively, of common stock for a total purchase price of $326 million and $966 million, respectively. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As noted in today's press release, we continue to project fourth quarter comparable store sales to increase 1% to 2% versus a 4% gain last year. In addition, our guidance for fourth quarter earnings per share remains unchanged at $1.20 to $1.25, which now includes a onetime noncash benefit of $0.02 per share primarily due to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, offset by slightly higher pretax expenses. This forecasted guidance compares to $1.20 per share in the prior period, which also included a one-time per share benefit of $0.07 related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter. Excluding both of these onetime items and if comparable sales only performed in line with our guidance, earnings per share are forecasted to grow 4% to 9% over last year. 
The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 13% to 13.2% compared to last year's 13.2%. We expect net interest income of about $2.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% to 23%, which includes the aforementioned onetime tax benefit. And weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $357 million. Based on our year-to-date results and updated fourth quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.57 compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018, which included the previously mentioned one-time per share benefit of $0.07. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

As we mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our solid sales and earnings performance in the third quarter. We believe these above-planned results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete effectively in today's volatile retail environment given consumers continued focus on value and convenience. However, as we look ahead, we expect another highly competitive fourth quarter. In addition, we are up against strong multiyear sales and earnings comparisons, a shortened calendar between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and political landscape. Therefore, although we hope to do better, we believe it best to maintain a cautious posture heading into the holiday selling season.

In terms of the distribution cost expenses, as we said, they were related to a couple of things. One, unfavorable timing of packaway and then also wages. With respect to wages, there were a couple of things that have impacted that, as you all are aware. Last year, we raised our national minimum wage to $11 across the country. We did anniversary that after the second quarter of this year. Beyond that, there are ongoing state and municipal wage increases, particularly in California. California wages went up in January by $1, and they'll continue to do so for the next couple of years. The wage increases do impact both stores and distribution centers. But as we manage the business this year, more of our cost mitigation efforts ended up in the SG&A line. In terms of guidance going forward, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we have.

And so I don't necessarily -- I think she bought other products in the store, however, I think she probably would have bought those products even if ladies apparel has been good or better, I should say than what it was because those businesses are growing exponentially, and there's lots of products and things for her to choose so. So I think in the end, it all just becomes about the assortments that we deliver. If we deliver compelling bargains and compelling assortments and we do that in ladies apparel and we do it all the other things that satisfy her personally, all businesses and all ships will rise.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased that our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations. Earnings per share for the period were $1.03, up from $0.91 last year. Net earnings grew to $371 million from $338 million in the prior year. Total sales for the third quarter increased 8% to $3.8 billion, with comparable store sales up a strong 5% on top of last year's 3% gain. 
For the third quarter, we saw broad-based strength across both merchandise departments and geographic regions with Children's and the Midwest performing the best. We also continue to see improving sales trends in our Ladies apparel business. While this area becomes less important as we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the actions we are taking here will lead to ongoing improvement during the holiday selling season and into 2020. 
Operating margin of 12.4% and was above plan, mainly due to better-than-expected sales and merchandise margins. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $3.32, up from $3.06 last year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion versus $1.1 billion in the first 9 months of 2018. Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $11.6 billion, with comparable stores up 3% on top of a 3% gain last year. 
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 10% over the prior year, while packaway was 39% of the total compared to 41% last year. Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 3%. Dd's DISCOUNTS continue to perform well, with robust above-planned growth in both sales and operating profit. 
Turning to our store expansion program. We opened 30 new Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter, completing our 2019 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,546 Ross and 259 dd's locations for a net increase of 89 for fiscal 2019. Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. Third quarter operating margin of 12.4% was above planned and similar to last year. Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the period. Merchandise margin grew by 20 basis points, while occupancy and buying levered by 10 and 5, respectively. These favorable items were more than offset by distribution expenses that increased 45 basis points, mainly due to the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher wages. Freight was flat for the quarter. 
Selling and general and administrative expenses for the period decreased 10 basis points. During the third quarter and first 9 months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 3.0 million and 9.6 million shares, respectively, of common stock for a total purchase price of $326 million and $966 million, respectively. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As noted in today's press release, we continue to project fourth quarter comparable store sales to increase 1% to 2% versus a 4% gain last year. In addition, our guidance for fourth quarter earnings per share remains unchanged at $1.20 to $1.25, which now includes a onetime noncash benefit of $0.02 per share, primarily due to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, offset by slightly higher pretax expenses. This forecasted guidance compares to $1.20 per share in the prior period, which also included a onetime per share benefit of $0.07 related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter. 
Excluding both of these onetime items and if comparable sales only perform in line with our guidance, earnings per share are forecasted to grow 4% to 9% over last year. 
The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 13.0% to 13.2% compared to last year's 13.2%. We expect net interest income of about $2.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% to 23%, which includes the aforementioned onetime tax benefit. And weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $357 million. Based on our year-to-date results and updated fourth quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.57 compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018, which included the previously mentioned one-time per share benefit of $0.07. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

With respect to wages, there were a couple of things that have impacted that, as you all are aware. Last year, we raised our national minimum wage to $11 across the country. We did anniversary that after the second quarter of this year. Beyond that, there were ongoing state and municipal wage increases, particularly, in California. California wages went up in January by $1, and they'll continue to do so for the next couple of years. The wage increases do impact both stores and distribution centers, but as we manage the business this year, more of our cost mitigation efforts ended up in the SG&A line.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased that our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations. Earnings per share for the period were $1.03, up from $0.91 last year. Net earnings grew to $371 million from $338 million in the prior year. Total sales for the third quarter increased 8% to $3.8 billion, with comparable store sales up a strong 5% on top of last year's 3% gain. 
For the third quarter, we saw broad-based strength across both merchandise departments and geographic regions with Children's and the Midwest performing the best. We also continue to see improving sales trends in our Ladies Apparel business. While this area becomes less important as we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the actions we are taking here will lead to ongoing improvement during the holiday selling season and into 2020. 
Operating margin of 12.4% was above plan, mainly due to better-than-expected sales and merchandise margins. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $3.32, up from $3.06 last year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion versus $1.1 billion in the first 9 months of 2018. Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $11.6 billion, with comparable stores up 3% on top of a 3% gain last year. 
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 10% over the prior year, while packaway was 39% of the total compared to 41% last year. Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 3%. Dd's DISCOUNTS continue to perform well, with robust above-plan growth in both sales and operating profit. 
Turning to our store expansion program. We opened 30 new Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter, completing our 2019 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,546 Ross and 259 dd's locations for a net increase of 89 for fiscal 2019.
Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. Third quarter operating margin of 12.4% was above plan and similar to last year. Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the period. Merchandise margin grew by 20 basis points, while occupancy and buying levered by 10 and 5, respectively. These favorable items were more than offset by distribution expenses that increased 45 basis points, mainly due to the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher wages. Freight was flat for the quarter. 
Selling and general and administrative expenses for the period decreased 10 basis points. During the third quarter and first 9 months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 3.0 million and 9.6 million shares, respectively, of common stock for a total purchase price of $326 million and $966 million, respectively. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As noted in today's press release, we continue to project fourth quarter comparable store sales to increase 1% to 2% versus a 4% gain last year. In addition, our guidance for fourth quarter earnings per share remains unchanged at $1.20 to $1.25, which now includes a onetime noncash benefit of $0.02 per share, primarily due to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, offset by slightly higher pretax expenses. This forecasted guidance compares to $1.20 per share in the prior period, which also included a onetime per share benefit of $0.07 related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter. 
Excluding both of these onetime items and if comparable sales only perform in line with our guidance, earnings per share are forecasted to grow 4% to 9% over last year. 
The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following: total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 13.0% to 13.2% compared to last year's 13.2%. We expect net interest income of about $2.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% to 23%, which includes the aforementioned onetime tax benefit. And weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $357 million. Based on our year-to-date results and updated fourth quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.57 compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018, which included the previously mentioned onetime per share benefit of $0.07. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

As we mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our solid sales and earnings performance in the third quarter. We believe these above-plan results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete effectively in today's volatile retail environment, given consumers' continued focus on value and convenience. However, as we look ahead, we expect another highly competitive fourth quarter. In addition, we are up against strong multiyear sales and earnings comparison, a shortened calendar between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and political landscape. Therefore, although we hope to do better, we believe it best to maintain a cautious posture heading into the holiday selling season.

In terms of the distribution cost expenses, as we said, they were related to a couple of things: one, unfavorable timing of packaway, and then also wages. With respect to wages, there were a couple of things that have impacted that, as you all are aware. Last year, we raised our national minimum wage to $11 across the country. We did anniversary that after the second quarter of this year. Beyond that, there were ongoing state and municipal wage increases, particularly in California. California wages went up in January by $1, and they'll continue to do so for the next couple of years. The wage increases do impact both stores and distribution centers. But as we manage the business this year, more of our cost mitigation efforts ended up in the SG&A line. In terms of guidance, going forward, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we have.

So we think of her as apparel and shoes and cosmetics, all these handbags, all the things that satisfy her. So when -- this is all anecdotal. So this isn't going to be anything from any fact other than -- the other businesses that were healthy, like beauty, were healthy. They're healthy and continued to grow, while Ladies was difficult. And so I don't necessarily -- I think she bought other products in the store. However, I think she probably would have bought those products even if Ladies apparel had been good or better, I should say, than what it was because those businesses are growing exponentially and there's lots of products and things for her to choose from. So I think in the end, it all just becomes about the assortments that we deliver. If we deliver compelling bargains and compelling assortments and we do that in Ladies Apparel and we do it in all the other things that satisfy her personally, all businesses and all ships will arrive. But I think also when we don't do that in an area as big as Ladies, there's potentially some total impact, I think, to the total store, but I think that's very difficult to quantify. But if you think that she is our core customer, it would be logical."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased that our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations. Earnings per share for the period were $1.03, up from $0.91 last year. Net earnings grew to $371 million from $338 million in the prior year. Total sales for the third quarter increased 8% to $3.8 billion, with comparable store sales up a strong 5% on top of last year's 3% gain. 
For the third quarter, we saw broad-based strength across both merchandise departments and geographic regions with Children's and the Midwest performing the best. We also continue to see improving sales trends in our Ladies Apparel business. While this area becomes less important as we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the actions we are taking here will lead to ongoing improvement during the holiday selling season and into 2020. 
Operating margin of 12.4% was above plan, mainly due to better-than-expected sales and merchandise margins. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $3.32, up from $3.06 last year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion versus $1.1 billion in the first 9 months of 2018. Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $11.6 billion, with comparable stores up 3% on top of a 3% gain last year. 
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 10% over the prior year, while packaway was 39% of the total compared to 41% last year. Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 3%. Dd's DISCOUNTS continue to perform well, with robust above-plan growth in both sales and operating profit. 
Turning to our store expansion program. We opened 30 new Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter, completing our 2019 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,546 Ross and 259 dd's locations for a net increase of 89 for fiscal 2019.
Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. Third quarter operating margin of 12.4% was above plan and similar to last year. Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the period. Merchandise margin grew by 20 basis points, while occupancy and buying levered by 10 and 5, respectively. These favorable items were more than offset by distribution expenses that increased 45 basis points, mainly due to the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher wages. Freight was flat for the quarter. 
Selling and general and administrative expenses for the period decreased 10 basis points. During the third quarter and first 9 months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 3.0 million and 9.6 million shares, respectively, of common stock for a total purchase price of $326 million and $966 million, respectively. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As noted in today's press release, we continue to project fourth quarter comparable store sales to increase 1% to 2% versus a 4% gain last year. In addition, our guidance for fourth quarter earnings per share remains unchanged at $1.20 to $1.25, which now includes a onetime noncash benefit of $0.02 per share, primarily due to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, offset by slightly higher pretax expenses. This forecasted guidance compares to $1.20 per share in the prior period, which also included a onetime per share benefit of $0.07 related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter. 
Excluding both of these onetime items and if comparable sales only perform in line with our guidance, earnings per share are forecasted to grow 4% to 9% over last year. 
The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following: total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 13.0% to 13.2% compared to last year's 13.2%. We expect net interest income of about $2.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% to 23%, which includes the aforementioned onetime tax benefit. And weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $357 million. Based on our year-to-date results and updated fourth quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.57 compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018, which included the previously mentioned onetime per share benefit of $0.07. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

With respect to wages, there were a couple of things that have impacted that, as you all are aware. Last year, we raised our national minimum wage to $11 across the country. We did anniversary that after the second quarter of this year. Beyond that, there were ongoing state and municipal wage increases, particularly in California. California wages went up in January by $1, and they'll continue to do so for the next couple of years. The wage increases do impact both stores and distribution centers. But as we manage the business this year, more of our cost mitigation efforts ended up in the SG&A line. In terms of guidance, going forward, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we have.

And although we're never fully satisfied with any part of our business, we're happy that at least it's moved in the right direction, and we feel like we have a strategy in place as we go throughout 2020."

And so I don't necessarily -- I think she bought other products in the store. However, I think she probably would have bought those products even if Ladies apparel had been good or better, I should say, than what it was because those businesses are growing exponentially and there's lots of products and things for her to choose from. So I think in the end, it all just becomes about the assortments that we deliver. If we deliver compelling bargains and compelling assortments and we do that in Ladies Apparel and we do it in all the other things that satisfy her personally, all businesses and all ships will arrive.
