Our hold separate order was lifted on March 1, so the first quarter contains only 1 month of combined operations. Good start to the year, 12% EPS growth, some positive leverage from sales and operating profit as a result pricing and cost synergies. We paid $477 million in dividends and purchased $700 million overstock net of issuances in addition to the $600 million purchased in December of last year.
The backlog remains healthy at $3.5 billion. This excludes a project that many of you have heard about, which is a project with ExxonMobil in Singapore that value to us will be about $1.4 billion of capital investment.
Jurong Island in Singapore is ExxonMobil's largest manufacturing complex and is anchored by 600,000-barrel per day refinery. They are investing $5 billion in their largest downstream project, which goes by the acronym of CRISP. We are building 4 gasifiers to tie into 2 existing classifiers that Linde operates today. We will be taking pitch from ExxonMobil and returning hydrogen, oxo gas and nitrogen to ExxonMobil as well as hydrogen and carbon monoxide to multiple customers by our pipeline system. You can see our project is very much integrated into ExxonMobil's new project. This project will be executed by Linde engineering. We see a solid return anchored by a base facility structure, and we expect contract signing to be in the next 30 to 60 days.
Regarding key milestones. We completed the squeeze out of our minority Linde AG shareholders on April 8. We announced the divestiture of our South Korea assets on April 30, which represents about 75% of the expected value from our required divestitures in Asia.
All our employees are excited about the merger. We see a strong pool for application technology that we begin to appreciate each other's capabilities, a strong pool for plant capabilities and best practices in every aspect of our business. We are currently working through a very detailed cost or very detailed cost and restructuring initiatives. We held our first 0 days budget review for all corporate functions a few weeks ago, and I have to say that I am pleased's with the progress we're making.
Key priorities going forward: A successful integration, obviously; price management, to make sure that we're covering cost inflation all around the room; delivering on our cost, CapEx and growth synergies; and building a high-performance culture in every sense of the word.
Regarding guidance, I'll let Matt elaborate further, but we may be a bit conservative at this point. Just keep in mind, we're only 1 month into this merger. And I'll turn it over to Matt."

As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in 2 ways. First, the pro forma, which means all periods are recast to reflect the merger, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures. Second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and one-time measure and restructuring related costs. Going forward, we'll continue to present numbers in this format since they best represent the trends on the combined business.
Sales of $6.9 billion are even with prior year driven by a negative 5% foreign currency headwind. Virtually every foreign currency has devalued against the U.S. dollar with most losing 5% to 10%. You may recall that the first half of 2018 had a weaker U.S. dollar than the second half, so I expect this trend to continue for the second quarter.
Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales grew 5% comprised of 3% volume and 2% [indiscernible] we achieved mid-to high single-digit growth rates across every segment with the exception of EMEA, which only grew 1% due to a slowing economy evidenced by weaker industrial production levels.
Global price at 2% was in line with inflation, although we are actively working to further increase prices to recover higher input costs.
The combination of price improvements and volume contribution enable 6% growth or 40 basis point improvement to underlying gross margins. Note that the late start to the merger hampered our ability to achieve variable cost savings this quarter. However, since March 1, we've been actively integrating procurement, productivity and logistical resources to enable further improvement in gross margin as existing supply contracts are renegotiated.
Operating profit was faster than gross profit, resulting in a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin to 17.7%. Overall, fixed cost synergies are tracking to expectations, although we are making faster progress in corporate then in the segments due to the restrictive commercial and operational interfaces prior to March 1. We fully anticipate synergies to continue to ramp throughout the year as we have more time to integrate the 2 organizations.
Diluted EPS of $1.69 was 17% above the prior year when excluding foreign exchange impact. The improved leverage from operating profit was due to lower net interest, lower tax rate and a lower share count. Net interest was favorable to prior year primarily from higher cash balances and lower debt levels. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% and is anticipated to remain around that level for the rest of this year.
The global treasury and tax teams are actively working to find further capital structure synergies above the stated $1.1 billion target, and I believe they're off to a solid start.
Finally, net share count is lower due to the stock repurchase program. Through April, the company has repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares and will continue to buy more throughout the year.
At the end of March, net debt was $8.1 billion when excluding purchase price accounting effects. This does not include the Linde AG squeeze-out cash payment of $3.2 billion or the Korean divestiture proceeds of $1.2 billion, both of which occurred in April of this year.
The sale gas project backlog remains at $3.5 billion as a start up in South Korea was replaced with the new project win in the Netherlands. In addition, our engineering business is off to a good start with a healthy project backlog of $5 billion. Both backlogs will provide future contractually secured growth over the next 3 years.
Please turn to Slide 4, which provides an update of the 2019 outlook. We are increasing the full year EPS growth rate to a range of 9% to 13% or 12% to 16% excluding anticipated currency headwinds. We expect positive contribution from cost synergies to continue to ramp each quarter as integration efforts are implemented. Furthermore, the projected FX headwind of negative 3% is primarily front-end loaded with a negative 4% to negative 5% recurring in the first half of this year and negative 1% to negative 2% headwind for the second half. Although we are not providing second quarter EPS guidance at this time, we anticipate moderate Q1 to Q2 sequential improvement from ramping synergies. We expect further improvement into the third quarter, so second half EPS levels should be higher than the first half.
Overall, this outlook incorporates improving cost synergies but some softening of industrial production growth rates. If current volume trends and economic conditions maintain or improve, we would be at the upper end of this range or possibly better. However, at this time, we believe it's prudent to guide to these levels while we integrate the combined organization in an uncertain economy.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And Australia, unfortunately, has a long period of, I'll call it, the industrialization more of a secular trend, and so that's something that we have to address. And you can see in the comments that Asia said -- we take out Australia and take out effective divestitures. The rest of it, plus 10%. So those numbers are pretty good, and that's without the benefit of really much of the large project contribution. So clearly, we have some opportunities here. We had more integration from a regional business standpoint. There's more integration in Asia than anywhere else. So we have some cost synergy opportunities there. Clearly, inflation has been something that's been very apparent in that region for many years, and we need to make sure that we focus on that. But clearly, the objective is to steadily increase the quality of our business there as measured by our operating margins."

So the direct effect is minimal, but there is a potential for indirect effect as our customers start to see the effects on their business. So I don't have a number to put on this. I'll say it's something that we'll continue to observe to work to make sure that we position ourselves as well as possible, but it also kind of leads me to not point you're making but another point, which is we have a very stable business model. And again, product is produced globally; it's sold globally. That's the focus of our organizational structure. We generate high cash flow pretty much throughout the cycle. When the CapEx opportunities start to limit themselves, we have more free cash flow to redeploy, to share buybacks and potential increasing dividends.

So that really set focus going forward. If you were to say that maybe historically, Linde engineering will be 20% internal over the fence and 80% external, if we can get that more balanced, something closer to 50-50, I think that's a much better place to be. If I look at the Singapore project, which Linde engineering will be executing, I'll take a lot of comfort in the fact that they really have all the capabilities, the experiences, the disciplines, the know-how to execute very complex projects like that.

As you can imagine, it's not cash. It's not what we repay. It was just a mark to market. So, look, excluding that, we're about $8.1 billion. As discussed in April, we had a $3.2 billion out on the squeeze out and the $1.2 billion in on the proceeds. So that would raise net debt holding all else equal to a little bit over $10 billion. 
Going forward, clearly, as you've probably seen, we're on a path of buybacks. We continue to work on that path back when the $6 billion was approved. You may recall that had a 2-year limit on it, so we're working within those confines. So I would see net debt rising throughout the year as we continue to execute the buyback throughout our program. So end of year remains to be seen. It should be something definitely higher than $10 billion, but we're always working to stay within our Aa2 rating, which I think we have a lot of room right now. So I would expect net debt to keep rising throughout this year and then into next year to get closer to the Aa2 rating for our final capital structure."

If you are looking at some statistics here that say that the beginning of the year, the forecast for industrial production growth in Germany was 1.6%. Now they're saying negative 1.2% for the year. And Western Europe looks to be flat in terms of industrial production growth. So that is the largest in the environment that we have to work inside of.

If I come back to the Americas, if I look at the U.S., I think March with a stronger month than what we had perhaps anticipated, which was a positive sign. However, when I look within the numbers, liquid volume seems to be, I think, at a fairly decent level. We're growing in March, okay coming into April. But then again I look at our cylinder gas business, what we call PDI. And those volumes have flattened  year-over-year. In fact, month -- look at the month of March, year-over-year, -- to slightly negative. So I' look at that as indicative of what's going on in the overall manufacturing space in the U.S. and I can't look at that and say it's a positive sign. Having said all of that, if the economy performs better, we'll certainly -- we'll participate in that and we'll be in good shape, as Matt said earlier, but I think there are enough signs out there primarily made but there are other signs that say we shouldn't be overly optimistic."

And quite frankly, as we have looked at this and study this, most of the major companies, and for those who are not familiar to IMO 2020, this is the [indiscernible] diesel requirement to reduce sulfur particulates to 0.5%. Most of the major oil companies are going to be investing in cohorts. That's what they did in the U.S. There's a lot of coker capacity. That's what ExxonMobil announced and -- so I think most of IMO 2020 will be addressed by coker capacity. It's a type of asset they're very familiar with, they're comparable operating. You'll also see certain refiners look to bring a more lighter crude feedstocks. That's the way they can address IMO 2020. You'll have some refiners who won't do anything. They kind of wait and see, expecting ships to put on the scrubbers and so forth and they'll wait until the end.

So on the guidance, as mentioned, we -- as Stephen mentioned, we have already assumed on what we're going to achieve and how we will achieve the synergies, so we feel pretty confident about that. And then on top of that, we are assuming some either slowing growth rates or even reductions especially in EMEA. As you know today, you are seeing some negative industrial production rates across a lot of key geographies. So the combination of those 2 are assuming slowing demand but with a rising improvement in our cost management and the self-help. And so at that stage, that has led to this outlook. As Steve mentioned, we feel pretty confident that on the bottom end and almost any type scenario at this point, but we also have to be cognizant FX rates can shift and they have been getting worse. So the combination of all this is why we laid it out, but we feel very good about this range. Obviously, at levels maintained, we could be at the upper end or better, as mentioned. And if we see any improvement, that could be highly accretive. So that's how we look at the guidance. On the free cash flow, just on the high-level first maybe. So as you probably saw the operating cash flow number, about $1.68 billion, that's something that we are working on. We expect to do better than this. I think when you think about operating cash flow, on average, both predecessor companies in the full year basis had operating cash flow to EBITDA ratios around mid- to high-70s. That's both companies consistently demonstrated. And when you look at the first quarter -- so that's full year, mid- to high 70s. First quarter, the average has been about mid-60s. You had some ups and downs, but over the last 4 or 5 years, both companies averaged about mid-60s being operating cash flow divided by the adjusted EBITDA. This quarter, we're mid-50s. Now you may have noticed in the notes that we had about $256 million of merger-related cash flow. About $100 million is the onetime payment on the acceleration that we talked about last quarter for the retirement benefits. That's a change in control of onetime item. Another $100 million were cost incurred to divest the assets. Again, the carryover, the benefit is in investing which are the proceeds. Unfortunately, the way the accounting work, we had to put the $100 million in operating. And then the other $56 million relates mostly to either some merger costs and a little bit other bit of restructuring. So that number, when added back, we're about mid-60s. So right now, I feel good about the track but we do have a lot of onetime costs. And to your specific question on engineering, the line called contract assets and liabilities, that was a value of about $84 million. That isolates what the prepayment trend has been in engineering. So obviously, that prepayments are down. There was a lot last year, so that was a bit of a headwind related to the cash flow there. But this is something that we're working on a lot, and I expect to get these numbers back to the historical levels. But we will have, over this first 6 months of this year, a lot of onetime cash merger costs that are still carried over, especially in the second quarter, we'll have some large tax payments. As you may recall, there will be $700 million of cash taxes we have to pay for the European divestiture. And Steve can handle, I think, the tonnage update on..."

Because keep in mind, we just started migrating our systems and some of this takes a little time. But let me just kind of give you my view. If you talk about capacity, I would say we have capacity in Europe because we have been growing at a pace that would absorb that capacity. So that's not in tight supply. Same thing would be true in South America. I think if you look at the U.S., it's been around 80%, 82% kind of utilization that walks in Linde and our -- has been much tighter and, of course, -- and is in hot demand all over the world. There's shortages of -- If I look at pipeline demands, I would say that hydrogen, if I look at just the base business in the U.S. Gulf Coast was a little later in first quarter. We didn't see them out hydrogen that we saw last year, that driven by Venezuela crude, and the shortage of Venezuela crude drives up costs, shrinks the margins they didn't want -- hard. But I think that will probably saw itself out and get a little stronger as they sort out the tissue. With respect to metals pipelines, we operate a lot of -- our on-site business is very strong in the steel pipeline area. And those volumes seem to be doing fine but it's not end market demand-driven. It seems to be more based on import substitution based on the tariffs and on the fact that inventory levels were still quite low, so that needs to be replenished. So that's the story. If I go to Asia, I'll just really make a comment about China. The last numbers I looked at said that capacity utilization for merchant liquid was tightening up. This was a good thing. Obviously, a lot of capacity come on over the years so that's a positive. And I think the fact that the pricing you're hearing a lot more positive regarding price realization in China and it has historically been some prices in the world, I think would also support the fact that capacity utilization has been fairly high there."

We're just closing the second month. So things like the monthly rhythm, we're getting better and better. Forecasting is a big part of that, and we want to improve the forecasting to a more monthly type of rhythm. As we get better at that and we get more confidence on what I'll call short-term outlooks, those are things that will incorporate the top of the house and then make decisions how we communicate those. So I think you hopefully just be patient each quarter, we expect to get better. I mean, obviously, we have more information here than we had in March 1. Sequentials will be an area we'll add next quarter. We'll start doing sequentials within '19. And so that is something that will become another element of this. So with each step, I expect to get better and better, more transparency. Obviously, be added the new segments.

Helium, I mentioned earlier, is a very tight supply around the world so it is a piece of the 2%. I can't tell you exactly how many basis points, but price increases in the helium are higher, certainly higher than 2% and need to be just based on the cost inflation as a result of the shortage of helium and the fact that all sourcing contracts have moved up in terms of cost around the world. But we want to make sure -- you're asking me, did we cover inflation in every parts of the world, and the answer is no. I mean there are going to be parts of the world certain product markets that our pricing just like helium is higher than 2%. There are some areas that it's lower and we need to work on that. So generally speaking, you want to add a minimum as the company makes sure that you're covering your cost of inflation and that's a target that we always had. There's certainly not a limitation of what the price realization could be. And in terms of driving up operating margins or let's just say variable margins, you really have 2 ways to do that. It's increasing pricing and it's driving productivity, and we work both of those levers quite hard. But it's going to be something that is going to take some time as we -- obviously, it's something we spent a lot of time on Praxair for many, many years. And it's going to take a little bit more time to get everyone accustomed to what we are trying to do, the initiatives that we're rolling out.

Secondly, on helium. The helium pricing will appear purely across all segments because in the other we have the bulk helium or the wholesale helium. So it sells intercompany and then also sells to large global distributors from that other category. So any intercompany transfer pricing increases would show up another and then end market price increases would show up in the segment.

Our hold separate order was lifted on March 1, so the first quarter contains only 1 month of combined operations. Good start to the year, 12% EPS growth, some positive leverage from sales and operating profit as a result pricing and cost synergies. We paid $477 million in dividends and purchased $700 million of stock net of issuances in addition to the $600 million purchased in December of last year.
The backlog remains healthy at $3.5 billion. This excludes a project that many of you have heard about, which is a project with ExxonMobil in Singapore that value to us will be about $1.4 billion of capital investment.
Jurong Island in Singapore is ExxonMobil's largest manufacturing complex and is anchored by a 600,000-barrel per day refinery. They are investing $5 billion in their largest downstream project, which goes by the acronym of CRISP. We are building 4 gasifiers to tie into 2 existing gasifiers that Linde operates today. We will be taking pitch from ExxonMobil and returning hydrogen, oxo gas and nitrogen to ExxonMobil as well as hydrogen and carbon monoxide to multiple customers via by our pipeline system. You can see our project is very much integrated into ExxonMobil's new project. This project will be executed by Linde Engineering. We see a solid return anchored by a base facility fee structure, and we expect contract signing to be in the next 30 to 60 days.
Regarding key milestones. We completed the squeeze out of our minority Linde AG shareholders on April 8. We announced the divestiture of our South Korea assets on April 30, which represents about 75% of the expected value from our required divestitures in Asia.
All our employees are excited about the merger. We see a strong pool for application technology that we begin to appreciate each other's capabilities, a strong pool for plant capabilities and best practices in every aspect of our business. We are currently working through a very detailed cost -- or very detailed cost and restructuring initiatives. We held our first 0 based budget review for all corporate functions a few weeks ago, and I have to say that I'm pleased with the progress we're making.
Key priorities going forward: A successful integration, obviously; price management, to make sure that we're covering cost inflation all around the world; delivering on our cost, CapEx and growth synergies; and building a high-performance culture in every sense of the word.
Regarding guidance, I'll let Matt elaborate further, but we may be a bit conservative at this point. Just keep in mind, we're only 1 month into this merger. And now I'll turn it over to Matt."

As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in 2 ways. First, they're pro forma, which means all periods are recast to reflect the merger, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures. Second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and onetime merger and restructuring related costs. Going forward, we'll continue to present numbers in this format since they best represent the trends on the combined business.
Sales of $6.9 billion are even with prior year driven by a negative 5% foreign currency headwind. Virtually every foreign currency has devalued against the U.S. dollar, with most losing 5% to 10%. You may recall that the first half of 2018 had a weaker U.S. dollar than the second half, so I expect this trend to continue for the second quarter.
Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales grew 5%, comprised of 3% volume and 2% [indiscernible].  We achieved mid-to high single-digit growth rates across every segment with the exception of EMEA, which only grew 1% due to a slowing economy evidenced by weaker industrial production levels.
Global price of 2% was in line with inflation, although we are actively working to further increase prices to recover higher input costs.
The combination of price improvements and volume contribution enabled 6% growth or 40 basis point improvement to underlying gross margins. Note that the late start to the merger hampered our ability to achieve variable cost savings this quarter. However, since March 1, we've been actively integrating procurement, productivity and logistical resources to enable further improvement in gross margin as existing supply contracts are renegotiated.
Operating profit grew faster than gross profit, resulting in a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin to 17.7%. Overall, fixed cost synergies are tracking to expectations, although we are making faster progress in corporate than the segments due to the restrictive commercial and operational interfaces prior to March 1. We fully anticipate synergies to continue to ramp throughout the year as we have more time to integrate the 2 organizations.
Diluted EPS of $1.69 was 17% above the prior year when excluding foreign exchange impact. The improved leverage from operating profit was due to lower net interest, lower tax rate and a lower share count. Net interest was favorable to prior year primarily from higher cash balances and lower debt levels. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% and is anticipated to remain around that level for the rest of this year.
The global treasury and tax teams are actively working to find further capital structure synergies above the stated $1.1 billion target, and I believe they're off to a solid start.
Finally, net share count is lower due to the stock repurchase program. Through April, the company has repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares and will continue to buy more throughout the year.
At the end of March, net debt was $8.1 billion when excluding purchase price accounting effects. This does not include the Linde AG squeeze-out cash payment of $3.2 billion or the Korean divestiture proceeds of $1.2 billion, both of which occurred in April of this year.
The sale gas project backlog remains at $3.5 billion as a startup in South Korea was replaced with the new project win in the Netherlands. In addition, our engineering business is off to a good start with a healthy project backlog of $5 billion. Both backlogs will provide future contractually secured growth over the next 3 years.
Please turn to Slide 4, which provides an update of the 2019 outlook. We are increasing the full year EPS growth rate to a range of 9% to 13% or 12% to 16% excluding anticipated currency headwinds. We expect positive contribution from cost synergies to continue to ramp each quarter as integration efforts are implemented. Furthermore, the projected FX headwind of negative 3% is primarily front-end loaded with a negative 4% to negative 5% occurring in the first half of this year and negative 1% to negative 2% headwind for the second half. Although we are not providing second quarter EPS guidance at this time, we anticipate moderate Q1 to Q2 sequential improvement from ramping synergies. We expect further improvement into the third quarter, so second half EPS levels should be higher than the first half.
Overall, this outlook incorporates improving cost synergies but some softening of industrial production growth rates. If current volume trends and economic conditions maintain or improve, we would be at the upper end of this range or possibly better. However, at this time, we believe it's prudent to guide to these levels while we integrate the combined organization in an uncertain economy.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And Australia, unfortunately, has had a long period of, I'll call it the industrialization, more of a secular trend, and so that's something that we have to address. And you can see in the comments that Asia sales, if we had -- take out Australia and take out the effective divestitures, the rest of it's plus 10%. So those numbers are pretty good, and that's without the benefit of really much in the way of large project contribution. So clearly, we have some opportunities here. We had more integration from a regional business standpoint. There's more integration in Asia than anywhere else. So we have some cost synergy opportunities there. Clearly, inflation has been something that's been very apparent in that region for many years, and we need to make sure that we focus on that. But clearly, the objective is to steadily increase the quality of our business there as measured by operating margins."

So the direct effect is minimal, but there is a potential for indirect effect as our customers start to see the effects on their business. So I don't have a number to put on this. I'll say it's something that we'll continue to observe, to work to make sure that we position ourselves as well as possible.  But it also kind of leads me to not the point you were making, but another point, which is we have a very stable business model. And again, product is produced locally, it's sold locally, that's the focus of our organizational structure. We generate high cash flow pretty much throughout the cycle. When the CapEx opportunities start to limit themselves, we have more free cash flow to redeploy to share buybacks and potentially increasing dividends.

So that really is the focus going forward.  So if you were to say that maybe historically, Linde Engineering would be 20% internal over-the-fence and 80% external, if we can get that more balanced, something closer to 50-50, I think that's a much better place to be. If I look at the Singapore project, which Linde Engineering will be executing, I take a lot of comfort in the fact that they really have all the capabilities, the experiences, the disciplines, the know-how to execute very complex projects like that.

So on net debt, yes, as stated, we ended the quarter at just about $8.1 billion. And what we're doing is adjusting out, it's about $230 million, $240 million of [ BPA ] step up. As you can imagine, it's not cash. It's not what we repay. It was just a mark to market. So look, excluding that, we're about $8.1 billion. As discussed in April, we had a $3.2 billion out on the squeeze out and the $1.2 billion in on the proceeds. So that would raise net debt holding all else equal to a little bit over $10 billion. 
Going forward, clearly, as you've probably seen, we're on a path of buybacks. We continue to work on that path back.  When the $6 billion was approved, you may recall it had a 2-year limit on it, so we're working within those confines. So I would see net debt rising throughout the year as we continue to execute the buyback throughout our program. So end of year remains to be seen. It should be something definitely higher than $10 billion, but we're always working to stay within our Aa2 rating, which I think we have a lot of room right now. So I would expect net debt to keep rising throughout this year and then into next year to get closer to the Aa2 rating for our final capital structure."

You can include me on that. I don't really have a crystal ball into what's going to happen. I mean just based on what's happened in the last 24 hours, you have to be, I think cautious with any kind of optimistic forecast in China. I do believe the Chinese government will do whatever they can to try to mitigate the effect of tariffs. But that's pretty much going to be just trying to hold, stay in place. If I come back to the Americas, if I look at the U.S., I think March was a stronger month than what we had perhaps anticipated, which was a positive sign. However, when I look within the numbers, merchant liquid volumes seem to be, I think, at a fairly decent level. We're growing in March, okay coming into April. But then again I look at our cylinder gas business, what we call PDI, and those volumes have flattened  year-over-year. In fact, month -- look at the month of March year-over-year, hardgoods was slightly negative. So I look at that as indicative of what's going on in the overall manufacturing space in the U.S. and I can't look at that and say it's a positive sign. Having said all of that, if the economy performs better, we'll certainly -- we'll participate in that and we'll be in good shape, as Matt said earlier.  But I think there are enough signs out there, primarily in May, but there are other signs that say we shouldn't be overly optimistic."

Most of the major oil companies are going to be investing in cokers. That's what they did in the U.S. There's a lot of coker capacity. That's what ExxonMobil announced in Antwerp.  So I think most of IMO 2020 will be addressed by coker capacity. It's a type of asset they're very familiar with, they're comfortable operating. You'll also see certain refiners look to bring a more lighter crude feedstocks. That's the way that they can address IMO 2020. You'll have some refiners who won't do anything. They'll kind of wait and see, expecting ships to put on scrubbers and so forth and they'll wait until the end.

With respect to Australia, I would say that it is a business that's of significant size. Part of the problem, too, is also currency. The Aussie dollar was very weak versus the dollar.

So on the guidance, as mentioned, we -- as Stephen mentioned, we have a rhythm assumed on what we're going to achieve and how we'll achieve the synergies, so we feel pretty confident about that. And then",617,"Yes, I can take the first 2. This is Matt, Markus.  So on the guidance, as mentioned, we -- as Stephen mentioned, we have a rhythm assumed on what we're going to achieve and how we'll achieve the synergies, so we feel pretty confident about that. And then on top of that, we are assuming some either slowing growth rates or even reductions, especially in EMEA. As you know, today, you are seeing some negative industrial production rates across a lot of key geographies. So the combination of those 2 are assuming slowing demand but with a rising improvement in our cost management and the self-help. And so at that stage, that has led to this outlook. As Steve mentioned, we feel pretty confident that on the bottom end in almost any type scenario at this point, but we also have to be cognizant FX rates can shift and they have been getting worse. So the combination of all this is why we laid it out, but we feel very good about this range. Obviously, if levels maintained, we could be at the upper end or better, as mentioned. And if we see any improvement, that could be highly accretive. So that's how we look at the guidance. On the free cash flow, just on a high level first maybe. So as you probably saw the operating cash flow number, about $1.068 billion, that's something that we are working on. We expect to do better than this. I think when you think about operating cash flow, on average, both predecessor companies in a full year basis had operating cash flow to EBITDA ratios around mid- to high-70s. That's what both companies have consistently demonstrated. And when you look at the first quarter -- so that's full year, mid- to high 70s. First quarter, the average has been about mid-60s. You've had some ups and downs, but over the last 4 or 5 years, both companies averaged about mid-60s being operating cash flow divided by the adjusted EBITDA. This quarter, we're mid-50s. Now you may have noticed in the notes that we had about $256 million of merger-related cash flow. About $100 million is the onetime payment on the acceleration that we talked about last quarter for the retirement benefits. That's a change in control onetime item. Another $100 million were costs incurred to divest the assets. Again, the carryover, the benefit is in investing which are the proceeds. Unfortunately, the way the accounting worked, we had to put the $100 million in operating. And then the other $56 million relates mostly to either some merger costs and a little bit of restructuring. So that number, when added back, we're about mid-60s. So right now, I feel good about the track but we do have a lot of onetime costs. And to your specific question on engineering, the line called contract asset and liabilities, that was a hurt of about $84 million. That isolates what the prepayment trend has been in engineering. So obviously, that prepayments are down. There was a lot last year, so that was a bit of a headwind related to the cash flow there. But this is something that we're working on a lot, and I expect to get these numbers back to the historical levels. But we will have, over this first 6 months of this year, a lot of onetime cash merger costs that are still carrying over.  Especially in the second quarter, we'll have some large tax out payments. As you may recall, it'll be several hundred million dollars of cash taxes we have to pay for the European divestiture. And Steve can handle, I think the tonnage update on [indiscernible]."

Because keep in mind, we just started migrating our systems and some of this takes a little time. But let me just kind of give you my view. If you talk about merchant liquid capacity, I would say we have capacity in Europe because we have been growing at a pace that would absorb that capacity. So that's not in tight supply. Same thing would be true in South America. I think if you look at the U.S., it's been around 80%, 82% kind of merchant liquid capacity utilization that's LOX and LIN, and argon has been much tighter, and of course helium is in hot demand all over the world. There's shortages of helium.  If I look at pipeline demands, I would say that hydrogen, if I look at just the base business in the U.S. Gulf Coast, was a little lighter in first quarter. We didn't see the amount of spot hydrogen that we saw last year.  That's really driven by Venezuela crude, and the shortage of Venezuela crude drives up costs, shrinks refinery margins, they didn't run as hard. But I think that will probably sort itself out and get a little stronger as they sort out the crude feedstock issue. With respect to metals pipelines, we operate a lot of -- our on-site business is very strong in the steel pipeline area. And those volumes seem to be doing fine but it's not end market demand-driven. It seems to be more based on import substitution based on the tariffs and on the fact that inventory levels for steel were quite low, so that needed to be replenished. So that's that story. If I go to Asia, I'm just going to really just make a comment about China. The last numbers I looked at said that capacity utilization for merchant liquid was tightening up, which was a good thing. Obviously, a lot of capacity come on over the years, so that's a positive. And I think the fact that the pricing you're hearing a lot more positive regarding price realization in China and it has historically been some of the lowest prices in the world, I think would also support the fact that capacity utilization is fairly high there."

And I can't say exactly with respect to specialty gas because I haven't seen that number. But clearly helium prices are higher. Helium, I mentioned earlier, is a very tight supply around the world so it is a piece of the 2%. I can't tell you exactly how many basis points, but price increases in the helium are higher, certainly higher than 2% and need to be just based on the cost inflation as a result of the shortage of helium and the fact that all sourcing contracts have moved up in terms of cost around the world. But we want to make sure -- you're asking me, did we cover inflation in every parts of the world, and the answer is no. I mean there are going to be parts of the world, certain product, markets that our pricing, just like helium, is higher than 2%. There are some areas that it's lower and we need to work on that. So generally speaking, you want to, at a minimum as the company make sure that you're covering your cost of inflation and that's a target that we have always had. There's certainly not a limitation of what the price realization could be. And in terms of driving up operating margins or let's just say variable margins, you really have 2 ways to do that. It's increasing pricing and it's driving productivity, and we work both of those levers quite hard. But it's going to be something that it's going to take some time as we -- obviously, it's something we spent a lot of time on in Praxair, have for many, many years.

Secondly, on helium. The helium pricing will appear really across all segments because in the other we have the bulk helium or the wholesale helium. So it sells intercompany and then also sells to large global distributors from that other category. So any intercompany transfer pricing increases would show up in other and then end market price increases would show up in the segment.

Our hold separate order was lifted on March 1, so the first quarter contains only 1 month of combined operations. Good start to the year, 12% EPS growth, some positive leverage from sales and operating profit as a result pricing and cost synergies. We paid $477 million in dividends and purchased $700 million of stock net of issuances in addition to the $600 million purchased in December of last year.
The backlog remains healthy at $3.5 billion. This excludes a project that many of you have heard about, which is a project with ExxonMobil in Singapore that's value to us will be about $1.4 billion of capital investment.
Jurong Island in Singapore is ExxonMobil's largest manufacturing complex and is anchored by a 600,000-barrel per day refinery. They are investing $5 billion in their largest downstream project, which goes by the acronym of CRISP. We are building 4 gasifiers to tie into 2 existing gasifiers that Linde operates today. We will be taking pitch from ExxonMobil and returning hydrogen, oxo gas and nitrogen to ExxonMobil as well as hydrogen and carbon monoxide to multiple customers via by our pipeline system. You can see our project is very much integrated into ExxonMobil's new project. This project will be executed by Linde Engineering. We see a solid return anchored by a base facility fee structure, and we expect contract signing to be in the next 30 to 60 days.
Regarding key milestones. We completed the squeeze-out of our minority Linde AG shareholders on April 8. We announced the divestiture of our South Korea assets on April 30, which represents about 75% of the expected value from our required divestitures in Asia.
All our employees are excited about the merger. We see a strong pool for application technologies as we begin to appreciate each other's capabilities, a strong pool for plant capabilities and best practices in every aspect of our business. We are currently working through a very detailed cost -- or very detailed cost and restructuring initiatives. We held our first zero-based budget review for all corporate functions a few weeks ago, and I have to say that I'm pleased with the progress we're making.
Key priorities going forward: A successful integration, obviously; price management, to make sure that we're covering cost inflation all around the world; delivering on our cost, CapEx and growth synergies; and building a high-performance culture in every sense of the word.
Regarding guidance, I'll let Matt elaborate further, but we may be a bit conservative at this point. Just keep in mind, we're only 1 month into this merger. And now I'll turn it over to Matt."

As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in 2 ways. First, they're pro forma, which means all periods are recast to reflect the merger, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures. Second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and onetime merger and restructuring related costs. Going forward, we'll continue to present numbers in this format since they best represent the trends on the combined business.
Sales of $6.9 billion are even with prior year driven by a negative 5% foreign currency headwind. Virtually every foreign currency has devalued against the U.S. dollar, with most losing 5% to 10%. You may recall that the first half of 2018 had a weaker U.S. dollar than the second half, so I expect this trend to continue for the second quarter.
Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales grew 5%, comprised of 3% volume and 2% price/mix.  We achieved mid-to high single-digit growth rates across every segment with the exception of EMEA, which only grew 1% due to a slowing economy evidenced by weaker industrial production levels.
Global price of 2% was in line with inflation, although we are actively working to further increase prices to recover higher input costs.
The combination of price improvements and volume contribution enabled 6% growth or 40 basis point improvement to underlying gross margins. Note that the late start to the merger hampered our ability to achieve variable cost savings this quarter. However, since March 1, we've been actively integrating procurement, productivity and logistical resources to enable further improvement in gross margin as existing supply contracts are renegotiated.
Operating profit grew faster than gross profit, resulting in a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin to 17.7%. Overall, fixed cost synergies are tracking to expectations, although we are making faster progress in corporate than the segments due to the restricted commercial and operational interfaces prior to March 1. We fully anticipate synergies to continue to ramp throughout the year as we have more time to integrate the 2 organizations.
Diluted EPS of $1.69 was 17% above the prior year when excluding foreign exchange impact. The improved leverage from operating profit was due to lower net interest, lower tax rate and a lower share count. Net interest was favorable to prior year primarily from higher cash balances and lower debt levels. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% and is anticipated to remain around that level for the rest of this year.
The global treasury and tax teams are actively working to find further capital structure synergies above the stated $1.1 billion target, and I believe they're off to a solid start.
Finally, net share count is lower due to the stock repurchase program. Through April, the company has repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares and will continue to buy more throughout the year.
At the end of March, net debt was $8.1 billion when excluding purchase price accounting effects. This does not include the Linde AG squeeze-out cash payment of $3.2 billion or the Korean divestiture proceeds of $1.2 billion, both of which occurred in April of this year.
The sale of gas project backlog remains at $3.5 billion as a startup in South Korea was replaced with the new project win in the Netherlands. In addition, our engineering business is off to a good start with a healthy project backlog of $5 billion. Both backlogs will provide future contractually secured growth over the next 3 years.
Please turn to Slide 4, which provides an update of the 2019 outlook. We are increasing the full year EPS growth rate to a range of 9% to 13% or 12% to 16% excluding anticipated currency headwinds. We expect positive contribution from cost synergies to continue to ramp each quarter as integration efforts are implemented. Furthermore, the projected FX headwind of negative 3% is primarily front-end loaded with a negative 4% to negative 5% occurring in the first half of this year and negative 1% to negative 2% headwind for the second half. Although we are not providing second quarter EPS guidance at this time, we anticipate moderate Q1 to Q2 sequential improvement from ramping synergies. We expect further improvement into the third quarter, so second half EPS levels should be higher than the first half.
Overall, this outlook incorporates improving cost synergies but some softening of industrial production growth rates. If current volume trends and economic conditions maintain or improve, we would be at the upper end of this range or possibly better. However, at this time, we believe it's prudent to guide to these levels while we integrate the combined organization in an uncertain economy.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And Australia, unfortunately, has had a long period of, I'll call it deindustrialization, more of a secular trend, and so that's something that we have to address. And you can see in the comments that Asia sales, if we had -- take out Australia and take out the effect of the divestitures, the rest of it's plus 10%. So those numbers are pretty good, and that's without the benefit of really much in the way of large project contribution. So clearly, we have some opportunities here. We had more integration from a regional business standpoint. There's more integration in Asia than anywhere else. So we have some cost synergy opportunities there. Clearly, inflation has been something that's been very apparent in that region for many years, and we need to make sure that we focus on that. But clearly, the objective is to steadily increase the quality of our business there as measured by operating margins."

As you know, our business is very local, so the product is produced and sold locally. So the direct effect is minimal, but there is a potential for indirect effect as our customers start to see the effects on their business. So I don't have a number to put on this. I'll say it's something that we'll continue to observe, to work to make sure that we position ourselves as well as possible.  But it also kind of leads me to not the point you were making, but another point, which is we have a very stable business model. And again, product is produced locally, it's sold locally, that's the focus of our organizational structure. We generate high cash flow pretty much throughout the cycle. When the CapEx opportunities start to limit themselves, we have more free cash flow to redeploy to share buybacks and potentially increasing dividends. So we view ourselves as a very safe port in the storm.

But even beyond that, we all know that the sweet spot of our industry is the over-the-fence business model, and we want to make sure that we are as competitive as we can possibly be in driving sale of gas business opportunities. So that really is the focus going forward.  So if you were to say that maybe historically, Linde Engineering would be 20% internal over-the-fence and 80% external, if we can get that more balanced, something closer to 50-50, I think that's a much better place to be. If I look at the Singapore project, which Linde Engineering will be executing, I take a lot of comfort in the fact that they really have all the capabilities, the experiences, the disciplines, the know-how to execute very complex projects like that. And if they couldn't, believe me, ExxonMobil would not have selected us. So that's something I'm beginning to appreciate more and more as I get into this."

As discussed in April, we had a $3.2 billion out on the squeeze out and the $1.2 billion in on the proceeds. So that would raise net debt holding all else equal to a little bit over $10 billion. 
Going forward, clearly, as you've probably seen, we're on a path of buybacks. We continue to work on that path.  When the $6 billion was approved, you may recall it had a 2-year limit on it, so we're working within those confines. So I would see net debt rising throughout the year as we continue to execute the buyback throughout our program. So end of year remains to be seen. It should be something definitely higher than $10 billion, but we're always working to stay within our Aa2 rating, which I think we have a lot of room right now. So I would expect net debt to keep rising throughout this year and then into next year to get closer to the Aa2 rating for our final capital structure."

As we look at results and really look at the forecast, I would say within those results, Western Europe is weaker. U.K., as you would imagine, is fairly weak. Eastern Europe would be the bright spot, I would say, on the continent. The growth there is more positive. Going forward, we're really preparing for, I would say, overall weakness. If you -- I'm looking at some statistics here that say that the beginning of the year the forecast for industrial production growth in Germany was 1.6%. Now they're saying negative 1.2% for the year. And Western Europe looks to be flat in terms of industrial production growth. So that is the, largely speaking, the environment that we have to work inside of. Clearly, we're going to be focused on the things we can control, as I alluded to earlier, which is making sure our pricing is commensurate with the cost inflation that we're seeing, the synergies that we can attain and really a focus on continuous improvement going forward."

If I look at Asia, I made a comment about Australia, so I think based on my comment, you wouldn't expect anything positive to take place in the second half. Everybody wants to know about China. You can include me on that. I don't really have a crystal ball into what's going to happen. I mean just based on what's happened in the last 24 hours, you have to be, I think cautious with any kind of optimistic forecast in China. I do believe the Chinese government will do whatever they can to try to mitigate the effect of tariffs. But that's pretty much going to be just trying to hold, stay in place. If I come back to the Americas, if I look at the U.S., I think March was a stronger month than what we had perhaps anticipated, which was a positive sign. However, when I look within the numbers, merchant liquid volumes seem to be, I think, at a fairly decent level. We're growing in March, look okay coming into April. But then again I look at our cylinder gas business, what we call PDI, and those volumes have flattened  year-over-year. In fact, month -- look at the month of March year-over-year, hardgoods was slightly negative. So I look at that as indicative of what's going on in the overall manufacturing space in the U.S. and I can't look at that and say it's a positive sign. Having said all of that, if the economy performs better, we'll certainly -- we'll participate in that and we'll be in good shape, as Matt said earlier.  But I think there are enough signs out there, primarily in May, but there are other signs that say we shouldn't be overly optimistic."

And quite frankly, as we have looked at this and studied this, most of the major companies, and for those who are not familiar with IMO 2020, this is the marine diesel requirement to reduce sulfur particulates to, I think it's 0.5%. Most of the major oil companies are going to be investing in cokers. That's what they did in the U.S. There's a lot of coker capacity. That's what ExxonMobil announced in Antwerp.  So I think most of IMO 2020 will be addressed by coker capacity. It's a type of asset they're very familiar with, they're comfortable operating. You'll also see certain refiners look to bring in more lighter crude feedstocks. That's the way that they can address IMO 2020. You'll have some refiners who won't do anything. They'll kind of wait and see, expecting ships to put on scrubbers and so forth and they'll wait until the end.

So on the guidance, as mentioned, we -- as Stephen mentioned, we have a rhythm assumed on what we're going to achieve and how we'll achieve the synergies, so we feel pretty confident about that. And then on top of that, we are assuming some either slowing growth rates or even reductions, especially in EMEA. As you know, today, you are seeing some negative industrial production rates across a lot of key geographies. So the combination of those 2 are assuming slowing demand but with a rising improvement in our cost management and the self-help. And so at that stage, that has led to this outlook. As Steve mentioned, we feel pretty confident that on the bottom end in almost any type scenario at this point, but we also have to be cognizant FX rates can shift and they have been getting worse. So the combination of all this is why we laid it out, but we feel very good about this range. Obviously, if levels maintained, we could be at the upper end or better, as mentioned. And if we see any improvement, that could be highly accretive. So that's how we look at the guidance. 
On the free cash flow, just on a high level first maybe. So as you probably saw the operating cash flow number, about $1.068 billion, that's something that we are working on. We expect to do better than this. I think when you think about operating cash flow, on average, both predecessor companies in a full year basis had operating cash flow to EBITDA ratios around mid- to high-70s. That's what both companies have consistently demonstrated. And when you look at the first quarter -- so that's full year, mid- to high 70s. First quarter, the average has been about mid-60s. You've had some ups and downs, but over the last 4 or 5 years, both companies averaged about mid-60s being operating cash flow divided by the adjusted EBITDA. This quarter, we're mid-50s. Now you may have noticed in the notes that we had about $256 million of merger-related cash flow. About $100 million is the onetime payment on the acceleration that we talked about last quarter for the retirement benefits. That's a change in control onetime item. Another $100 million were costs incurred to divest the assets. Again, the carryover, the benefit is in investing which are the proceeds. Unfortunately, the way the accounting worked, we had to put the $100 million in operating. And then the other $56 million relates mostly to either some merger costs and a little bit of restructuring. So that number, when added back, we're about mid-60s. So right now, I feel good about the track but we do have a lot of onetime costs. 
And to your specific question on engineering, the line called contract asset and liabilities, that was a hurt of about $84 million. That isolates what the prepayment trend has been in engineering. So obviously, that prepayments are down. There was a lot last year, so that was a bit of a headwind related to the cash flow there. But this is something that we're working on a lot, and I expect to get these numbers back to the historical levels. But we will have, over this first 6 months of this year, a lot of onetime cash merger costs that are still carrying over.  Especially in the second quarter, we'll have some large tax out payments. As you may recall, it'll be several hundred million dollars of cash taxes we have to pay for the European divestiture. 
And Steve can handle, I think the tonnage update on utilization rates."

Because keep in mind, we just started migrating our systems and some of this takes a little time. But let me just kind of give you my view. If you talk about merchant liquid capacity, I would say we have capacity in Europe because we have been growing at a pace that would absorb that capacity. So that's not in tight supply. Same thing would be true in South America. I think if you look at the U.S., it's been around 80%, 82% kind of merchant liquid capacity utilization that's LOX and LIN, and argon has been much tighter, and of course helium is in hot demand all over the world. There's shortages of helium.  If I look at pipeline demands, I would say that hydrogen, if I look at just the base business in the U.S. Gulf Coast, was a little lighter in first quarter. We didn't see the amount of spot hydrogen that we saw last year.  That's really driven by Venezuela crude, and the shortage of Venezuela crude drives up costs, shrinks refinery margins, they didn't run as hard. But I think that will probably sort itself out and get a little stronger as they sort out the crude feedstock issue. 
With respect to metals pipelines, we operate a lot of -- our on-site business is very strong in the steel pipeline area. And those volumes seem to be doing fine but it's not end market demand-driven. It seems to be more based on import substitution based on the tariffs and on the fact that inventory levels for steel were quite low, so that needed to be replenished. So that's that story. If I go to Asia, I'm just going to really just make a comment about China. The last numbers I looked at said that capacity utilization for merchant liquid was tightening up, which was a good thing. Obviously, a lot of capacity come on over the years, so that's a positive. And I think the fact that the pricing you're hearing a lot more positive regarding price realization in China and it has historically been some of the lowest prices in the world, I think would also support the fact that capacity utilization is fairly high there."

And of course if you look at our gas backlog at $3.5 billion, that has 2 large projects in there today where Linde Engineering is building hydrogen plants for our operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast with 2 major refineries. So that's part of the internal backlog today. And then if you go back to the Singapore project that I've mentioned, there's $1.4 billion, that will be added to the [ Selma ] gas backlog but then Linde Engineering would be building that."

We're just closing the second month. So things like the monthly rhythm, we're getting better and better. Forecasting is a big part of that, and we want to improve the forecasting to a more monthly type of rhythm. As we get better at that and we get more confidence on what I'll call short-term outlooks, those are things that we'll incorporate at the top of the house and then make decisions how we communicate those.

Sequentials will be an area we'll add next quarter. We'll start doing sequentials within '19. And so that is something that will become another element of this.

And I can't say exactly with respect to specialty gas because I haven't seen that number. But clearly helium prices are higher. Helium, I mentioned earlier, is a very tight supply around the world so it is a piece of the 2%. I can't tell you exactly how many basis points, but price increases in the helium are higher, certainly higher than 2% and need to be just based on the cost inflation as a result of the shortage of helium and the fact that all sourcing contracts have moved up in terms of cost around the world. But we want to make sure -- you're asking me, did we cover inflation in every parts of the world, and the answer is no. I mean there are going to be parts of the world, certain product, markets that our pricing, just like helium, is higher than 2%. There are some areas that it's lower and we need to work on that. So generally speaking, you want to, at a minimum as the company make sure that you're covering your cost of inflation and that's a target that we have always had. There's certainly not a limitation of what the price realization could be. And in terms of driving up operating margins or let's just say variable margins, you really have 2 ways to do that. It's increasing pricing and it's driving productivity, and we work both of those levers quite hard. But it's going to be something that it's going to take some time as we -- obviously, it's something we spent a lot of time on in Praxair, have for many, many years. And it's going to take a little bit more time to get everyone accustomed to what we are trying to do, the initiatives that we're rolling out.

Secondly, on helium. The helium pricing will appear really across all segments because in the other we have the bulk helium or the wholesale helium. So it sells intercompany and then also sells to large global distributors from that other category. So any intercompany transfer pricing increases would show up in other and then end market price increases would show up in the segment.

Our hold separate order was lifted on March 1, so the first quarter contains only 1 month of combined operations. Good start to the year, 12% EPS growth, some positive leverage from sales and operating profit as a result pricing and cost synergies. We paid $477 million in dividends and purchased $700 million of stock net of issuances in addition to the $600 million purchased in December of last year.
The backlog remains healthy at $3.5 billion. This excludes a project that many of you have heard about, which is a project with ExxonMobil in Singapore that's value to us will be about $1.4 billion of capital investment.
Jurong Island in Singapore is ExxonMobil's largest manufacturing complex and is anchored by a 600,000-barrel per day refinery. They are investing $5 billion in their largest downstream project, which goes by the acronym of CRISP. We are building 4 gasifiers to tie into 2 existing gasifiers that Linde operates today. We will be taking pitch from ExxonMobil and returning hydrogen, oxo gas and nitrogen to ExxonMobil as well as hydrogen and carbon monoxide to multiple customers via by our pipeline system. You can see our project is very much integrated into ExxonMobil's new project. This project will be executed by Linde Engineering. We see a solid return anchored by a base facility fee structure, and we expect contract signing to be in the next 30 to 60 days.
Regarding key milestones. We completed the squeeze-out of our minority Linde AG shareholders on April 8. We announced the divestiture of our South Korea assets on April 30, which represents about 75% of the expected value from our required divestitures in Asia.
All our employees are excited about the merger. We see a strong pool for application technologies as we begin to appreciate each other's capabilities, a strong pool for plant capabilities and best practices in every aspect of our business. We are currently working through a very detailed cost -- or very detailed cost and restructuring initiatives. We held our first zero-based budget review for all corporate functions a few weeks ago, and I have to say that I'm pleased with the progress we're making.
Key priorities going forward: A successful integration, obviously; price management, to make sure that we're covering cost inflation all around the world; delivering on our cost, CapEx and growth synergies; and building a high-performance culture in every sense of the word.
Regarding guidance, I'll let Matt elaborate further, but we may be a bit conservative at this point. Just keep in mind, we're only 1 month into this merger. And now I'll turn it over to Matt."

As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in 2 ways. First, they're pro forma, which means all periods are recast to reflect the merger, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures. Second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and onetime merger and restructuring related costs. Going forward, we'll continue to present numbers in this format since they best represent the trends on the combined business.
Sales of $6.9 billion are even with prior year driven by a negative 5% foreign currency headwind. Virtually every foreign currency has devalued against the U.S. dollar, with most losing 5% to 10%. You may recall that the first half of 2018 had a weaker U.S. dollar than the second half, so I expect this trend to continue for the second quarter.
Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales grew 5%, comprised of 3% volume and 2% price/mix.  We achieved mid- to high single-digit growth rates across every segment with the exception of EMEA, which only grew 1% due to a slowing economy evidenced by weaker industrial production levels.
Global price of 2% was in line with inflation, although we are actively working to further increase prices to recover higher input costs.
The combination of price improvements and volume contribution enabled 6% growth or 40 basis point improvement to underlying gross margins. Note that the late start to the merger hampered our ability to achieve variable cost savings this quarter. However, since March 1, we've been actively integrating procurement, productivity and logistical resources to enable further improvement in gross margin as existing supply contracts are renegotiated.
Operating profit grew faster than gross profit, resulting in a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin to 17.7%. Overall, fixed cost synergies are tracking to expectations, although we are making faster progress in corporate than the segments due to the restricted commercial and operational interfaces prior to March 1. We fully anticipate synergies to continue to ramp throughout the year as we have more time to integrate the 2 organizations.
Diluted EPS of $1.69 was 17% above the prior year when excluding foreign exchange impact. The improved leverage from operating profit was due to lower net interest, lower tax rate and a lower share count. Net interest was favorable to prior year primarily from higher cash balances and lower debt levels. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% and is anticipated to remain around that level for the rest of this year.
The global treasury and tax teams are actively working to find further capital structure synergies above the stated $1.1 billion target, and I believe they're off to a solid start.
Finally, net share count is lower due to the stock repurchase program. Through April, the company has repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares and will continue to buy more throughout the year.
At the end of March, net debt was $8.1 billion when excluding purchase price accounting effects. This does not include the Linde AG squeeze-out cash payment of $3.2 billion or the Korean divestiture proceeds of $1.2 billion, both of which occurred in April of this year.
The sale of gas project backlog remains at $3.5 billion as a startup in South Korea was replaced with the new project win in the Netherlands. In addition, our engineering business is off to a good start with a healthy project backlog of $5 billion. Both backlogs will provide future contractually secured growth over the next 3 years.
Please turn to Slide 4, which provides an update of the 2019 outlook. We are increasing the full year EPS growth rate to a range of 9% to 13% or 12% to 16% excluding anticipated currency headwinds. We expect positive contribution from cost synergies to continue to ramp each quarter as integration efforts are implemented. Furthermore, the projected FX headwind of negative 3% is primarily front-end loaded with a negative 4% to negative 5% occurring in the first half of this year and negative 1% to negative 2% headwind for the second half. Although we are not providing second quarter EPS guidance at this time, we anticipate moderate Q1 to Q2 sequential improvement from ramping synergies. We expect further improvement into the third quarter, so second half EPS levels should be higher than the first half.
Overall, this outlook incorporates improving cost synergies but some softening of industrial production growth rates. If current volume trends and economic conditions maintain or improve, we would be at the upper end of this range or possibly better. However, at this time, we believe it's prudent to guide to these levels while we integrate the combined organization in an uncertain economy.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

But as discussed, if sequentially this kind of trends hold, we would definitely believe we'd be at the upper end.

So those numbers are pretty good, and that's without the benefit of really much in the way of large project contribution. So clearly, we have some opportunities here. We had more integration from a regional business standpoint. There's more integration in Asia than anywhere else. So we have some cost synergy opportunities there.

So the direct effect is minimal, but there is a potential for indirect effect as our customers start to see the effects on their business. So I don't have a number to put on this. I'll say it's something that we'll continue to observe, to work to make sure that we position ourselves as well as possible.  But it also kind of leads me to not the point you were making, but another point, which is we have a very stable business model. And again, product is produced locally, it's sold locally, that's the focus of our organizational structure. We generate high cash flow pretty much throughout the cycle. When the CapEx opportunities start to limit themselves, we have more free cash flow to redeploy to share buybacks and potentially increasing dividends.

But even beyond that, we all know that the sweet spot of our industry is the over-the-fence business model, and we want to make sure that we are as competitive as we can possibly be in driving sale of gas business opportunities. So that really is the focus going forward.  So if you were to say that maybe historically, Linde Engineering would be 20% internal over-the-fence and 80% external, if we can get that more balanced, something closer to 50-50, I think that's a much better place to be. If I look at the Singapore project, which Linde Engineering will be executing, I take a lot of comfort in the fact that they really have all the capabilities, the experiences, the disciplines, the know-how to execute very complex projects like that. And if they couldn't, believe me, ExxonMobil would not have selected us. So that's something I'm beginning to appreciate more and more as I get into this."

So on net debt, yes, as stated, we ended the quarter at just about $8.1 billion. And what we're doing is adjusting out, it's about $230 million, $240 million of PPA step up. As you can imagine, it's not cash. It's not what we repay. It was just a mark to market. So look, excluding that, we're about $8.1 billion. As discussed in April, we had a $3.2 billion out on the squeeze out and the $1.2 billion in on the proceeds. So that would raise net debt holding all else equal to a little bit over $10 billion. 
Going forward, clearly, as you've probably seen, we're on a path of buybacks. We continue to work on that path.  When the $6 billion was approved, you may recall it had a 2-year limit on it, so we're working within those confines. So I would see net debt rising throughout the year as we continue to execute the buyback throughout our program. So end of year remains to be seen. It should be something definitely higher than $10 billion, but we're always working to stay within our Aa2 rating, which I think we have a lot of room right now. So I would expect net debt to keep rising throughout this year and then into next year to get closer to the Aa2 rating for our final capital structure."

You can include me on that. I don't really have a crystal ball into what's going to happen. I mean just based on what's happened in the last 24 hours, you have to be, I think cautious with any kind of optimistic forecast in China. I do believe the Chinese government will do whatever they can to try to mitigate the effect of tariffs. But that's pretty much going to be just trying to hold, stay in place. If I come back to the Americas, if I look at the U.S., I think March was a stronger month than what we had perhaps anticipated, which was a positive sign. However, when I look within the numbers, merchant liquid volumes seem to be, I think, at a fairly decent level. We're growing in March, look okay coming into April. But then again I look at our cylinder gas business, what we call PDI, and those volumes have flattened year-over-year. In fact, month -- look at the month of March year-over-year, hardgoods was slightly negative. So I look at that as indicative of what's going on in the overall manufacturing space in the U.S. and I can't look at that and say it's a positive sign. Having said all of that, if the economy performs better, we'll certainly -- we'll participate in that and we'll be in good shape, as Matt said earlier.  But I think there are enough signs out there, primarily in May, but there are other signs that say we shouldn't be overly optimistic."

And quite frankly, as we have looked at this and studied this, most of the major companies, and for those who are not familiar with IMO 2020, this is the marine diesel requirement to reduce sulfur particulates to, I think it's 0.5%. Most of the major oil companies are going to be investing in cokers. That's what they did in the U.S. There's a lot of coker capacity. That's what ExxonMobil announced in Antwerp.  So I think most of IMO 2020 will be addressed by coker capacity. It's a type of asset they're very familiar with, they're comfortable operating. You'll also see certain refiners look to bring in more lighter crude feedstocks. That's the way that they can address IMO 2020. You'll have some refiners who won't do anything. They'll kind of wait and see, expecting ships to put on scrubbers and so forth and they'll wait until the end.

I think the margins of the business are not bad at all, but we have to look at what we can do to get in front of that.

So on the guidance, as mentioned, we -- as Stephen mentioned, we have a rhythm assumed on what we're going to achieve and how we'll achieve the synergies, so we feel pretty confident about that. And then on top of that, we are assuming some either slowing growth rates or even reductions, especially in EMEA. As you know, today, you are seeing some negative industrial production rates across a lot of key geographies. So the combination of those 2 are assuming slowing demand but with a rising improvement in our cost management and the self-help. And so at that stage, that has led to this outlook. As Steve mentioned, we feel pretty confident that on the bottom end in almost any type scenario at this point, but we also have to be cognizant FX rates can shift and they have been getting worse. So the combination of all this is why we laid it out, but we feel very good about this range. Obviously, if levels maintained, we could be at the upper end or better, as mentioned. And if we see any improvement, that could be highly accretive. So that's how we look at the guidance. 
On the free cash flow, just on a high level first maybe. So as you probably saw the operating cash flow number, about $1.068 billion, that's something that we are working on. We expect to do better than this. I think when you think about operating cash flow, on average, both predecessor companies in a full year basis had operating cash flow to EBITDA ratios around mid- to high-70s. That's what both companies have consistently demonstrated. And when you look at the first quarter -- so that's full year, mid- to high 70s. First quarter, the average has been about mid-60s. You've had some ups and downs, but over the last 4 or 5 years, both companies averaged about mid-60s being operating cash flow divided by the adjusted EBITDA. This quarter, we're mid-50s. Now you may have noticed in the notes that we had about $256 million of merger-related cash flow. About $100 million is the onetime payment on the acceleration that we talked about last quarter for the retirement benefits. That's a change in control onetime item. Another $100 million were costs incurred to divest the assets. Again, the carryover, the benefit is in investing which are the proceeds. Unfortunately, the way the accounting worked, we had to put the $100 million in operating. And then the other $56 million relates mostly to either some merger costs and a little bit of restructuring. So that number, when added back, we're about mid-60s. So right now, I feel good about the track but we do have a lot of onetime costs. 
And to your specific question on engineering, the line called contract asset and liabilities, that was a hurt of about $84 million. That isolates what the prepayment trend has been in engineering. So obviously, that prepayments are down. There was a lot last year, so that was a bit of a headwind related to the cash flow there. But this is something that we're working on a lot, and I expect to get these numbers back to the historical levels. But we will have, over this first 6 months of this year, a lot of onetime cash merger costs that are still carrying over.  Especially in the second quarter, we'll have some large tax out payments. As you may recall, it'll be several hundred million dollars of cash taxes we have to pay for the European divestiture. 
And Steve can handle, I think the tonnage update on utilization rates."

Because keep in mind, we just started migrating our systems and some of this takes a little time. But let me just kind of give you my view. If you talk about merchant liquid capacity, I would say we have capacity in Europe because we have been growing at a pace that would absorb that capacity. So that's not in tight supply. Same thing would be true in South America. I think if you look at the U.S., it's been around 80%, 82% kind of merchant liquid capacity utilization that's LOX and LIN, and argon has been much tighter, and of course helium is in hot demand all over the world. There's shortages of helium.  If I look at pipeline demands, I would say that hydrogen, if I look at just the base business in the U.S. Gulf Coast, was a little lighter in first quarter. We didn't see the amount of spot hydrogen that we saw last year.  That's really driven by Venezuela crude, and the shortage of Venezuela crude drives up costs, shrinks refinery margins, they didn't run as hard. But I think that will probably sort itself out and get a little stronger as they sort out the crude feedstock issue. 
With respect to metals pipelines, we operate a lot of -- our on-site business is very strong in the steel pipeline area. And those volumes seem to be doing fine but it's not end market demand-driven. It seems to be more based on import substitution based on the tariffs and on the fact that inventory levels for steel were quite low, so that needed to be replenished. So that's that story. If I go to Asia, I'm just going to really just make a comment about China. The last numbers I looked at said that capacity utilization for merchant liquid was tightening up, which was a good thing. Obviously, a lot of capacity come on over the years, so that's a positive. And I think the fact that the pricing you're hearing a lot more positive regarding price realization in China and it has historically been some of the lowest prices in the world, I think would also support the fact that capacity utilization is fairly high there."

And I can't say exactly with respect to specialty gas because I haven't seen that number. But clearly helium prices are higher. Helium, I mentioned earlier, is a very tight supply around the world so it is a piece of the 2%. I can't tell you exactly how many basis points, but price increases in the helium are higher, certainly higher than 2% and need to be just based on the cost inflation as a result of the shortage of helium and the fact that all sourcing contracts have moved up in terms of cost around the world. But we want to make sure -- you're asking me, did we cover inflation in every parts of the world, and the answer is no. I mean there are going to be parts of the world, certain product, markets that our pricing, just like helium, is higher than 2%. There are some areas that it's lower and we need to work on that. So generally speaking, you want to, at a minimum as the company make sure that you're covering your cost of inflation and that's a target that we have always had. There's certainly not a limitation of what the price realization could be. And in terms of driving up operating margins or let's just say variable margins, you really have 2 ways to do that. It's increasing pricing and it's driving productivity, and we work both of those levers quite hard. But it's going to be something that it's going to take some time as we -- obviously, it's something we spent a lot of time on in Praxair, have for many, many years. And it's going to take a little bit more time to get everyone accustomed to what we are trying to do, the initiatives that we're rolling out. I think cylinder gas business is something that can be addressed sooner because these are short-term contracts, then you have merchant liquid where we have various abilities to address cost pressures and also as those contracts renew and then of course, on-site is a longer-term situation."

Secondly, on helium. The helium pricing will appear really across all segments because in the other we have the bulk helium or the wholesale helium. So it sells intercompany and then also sells to large global distributors from that other category. So any intercompany transfer pricing increases would show up in other and then end market price increases would show up in the segment.

As you can see, we posted strong financials and raised guidance again for the full year. I'll come back to our expectations for the second half later.
The seller gas backlog of $4.7 billion has increased considerably as a result of the Exxon Mobil Summer Port project added this quarter. The Linde Engineering [ foreparty ] backlog also remained strong at $5 billion, bringing the total amount of project work to nearly $10 billion. We think a 50-50 relationship between seller gas and third-party is a nice balance. Our focus continues to be on solid gas, but we certainly want to take advantage of all the good third-party business available to us.  The [ sale of gas ] project proposal pipeline still has some momentum driven primarily by petrochemical activity in the U.S. but also in Asia. 
Some milestones during the quarter. We deployed $1 billion to shareholders between dividends and share buybacks. We completed our squeeze out of the remaining shareholders of Linde AG. We closed on our South Korea divestiture and have reached agreement on one of the Indian divestitures. We now expect the value of our Asia divestitures to be in excess of $1.7 billion, which is higher than originally anticipated. 
We are making good progress on our cost synergies and restructuring initiatives. As expected, the time line is more extended in regions like Europe, where we need to engage the works councils on our restructuring plans. Having said that, discussions continue to be constructive. Integration is going well. The organization is set, voluntary turnover remains at low levels, there is a high degree of energy and collaboration. The organization is adapting well to an accelerated, operating rhythm, we have early wins we can point to in practically every area. There is a strong pool for best practices, technology and client capabilities. In short, the organization is excited about the potential for our new company. 
Regarding the macro going forward, I'm sure you're going to think I'm too cautious, too pessimistic. Maybe I am but this is a scenario that can easily play out. Let's start with Asia. There were good result in Q2. I see more tepid volume growth going forward. China growth is slower. The key PMI indicators are sliding. IP has been trending down and key metrics, such as electricity consumed for investor of production was only 0.5% higher in May. And for the entire economy, electrical consumption was barely over [indiscernible]. China's slowing and so is the rest of Asia. The good news is project startups will provide some nice lift for us beginning next year. 
Europe. I see weakness across the Eurozone. Industrial production for June was negative 1.3% year-over-year. The fact we serve the gross end markets mitigates against this impact, and we had a good self-help story. But the macro headwinds are clear. 
The Americas. Solid quarter in Q2 as pricing and merchant volume growth buoyed results. However,  cylinder gases volumes, which primarily serve metal fabrication markets flatlined in Q2 as harvest turned negative. However, pricing continues to be a good story here. After sluggish start on the year due to a shortage of Venezuela crude, and volumes are improving and as refiners take advantage of favorable margin spreads. Overall, we expect slowing growth with solid price attainment for the remainder of the year. 
Obviously, if the underlying global economy does well, we will do well. If it falters, we still have a resilient business model and a strong self-help story to sustain performance. My priorities going forward: best-in-class safety; compliance; sustainability and diversity; driving a successful integration and building a high-performance culture; synergy attainment; cost; CapEx and growth; and implementing best-in-class price management systems and a robust productivity initiative. 
And now, I will turn it over to Matt."

Slide 3 provides the second quarter adjusted pro forma results. As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in 2 ways: first, they are pro forma, which means periods are restated to assume an effective merger date of January 1, 2018, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures; second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and merger and restructuring-related costs. We believe this format best represents the underlying trends and performance of the combined business. 
Sales of $7.2 billion are flat with prior year but up 4% sequentially from the first quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced sales by 4% from 2018 and 1% from the first quarter. While the U.S. dollar has strengthened to almost every global currency, the major contributors of the Chinese renminbi, euro, British pound and Australian dollar. Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales increased 4% from the prior year and 5% from Q1. 
Versus the prior year, we continue to see positive pricing, which is in line with globally weighted inflation of 2.5%. Volumes are also up 2% as project contributions and growth in Asia and U.S. are partially offset by softer conditions across EMEA and South Pacific. Sequentially, volumes are up 4%, primarily due to seasonal effects and higher project buildings and engineering. And price increased 1%. As Steve mentioned, price management continues to be an area of intense focus throughout the organization. 
Operating profit of $1.3 billion improved 6% over prior year and 8% from Q1, and when excluding FX, up 10% and 9%, respectively. Operating margin expanded to 18.4% versus 17.4% in 2018 and 17.7% in the first quarter. Sequentially, we expanded operating margin by 70 basis points as we made good progress toward achieving the stated cost synergies. At this point, we are on track to reach the full annual run rate of $300 million by the end of this quarter, consistent with our merger commitment. 
Aside from the cost synergies, initiatives continue toward identifying and executing further value-creating opportunities in revenue and cost efficiencies. EPS of $1.83 improved 12% from last year or 16% when excluding impacts from foreign currency. The leverage improvement offer operating margin is primarily due to lower interest expense, lower tax rate and less shares outstanding. I anticipate net interest to steadily increase each quarter as we deploy the divestiture proceeds and thus, increase our debt levels. However, effective tax rate should remain around 24% for the full year and share count should steadily decline with the repurchase program activity. 
When comparing to the first quarter, you can see that net income growth of 8% is consistent with the operating profit growth, as interest and tax levels were stable with the moderate decline in share count. Note that EBITDA sequential growth of 3% is slightly less as we further align the presentation format, resulting in a minor reclass between cost lines with no effect to operating profit. 
On top of delivering solid financial results this quarter, the Linde team secured additional future growth by expanding the sale of gas project backlog to $4.7 billion. As a reminder, this backlog represents an estimated CapEx spend for customer projects under construction and secured by long-term contracts that lead to incremental sales and earnings growth. The increase from last quarter is due to the inclusion of a recently signed contract in Singapore, partially offset by smaller startups in Asia Pacific. 
In this quarter, we are also introducing a CapEx break down and return on capital metric. We intend to report these prospectively, so investors gain a better understanding of capital deployment and returns, two very critical metrics for this industry. The capital investments are broken into two categories: project CapEx, which represents spending for the sale of gas project backlog; and base CapEx, which represents everything else, such as replacement, maintenance, cost reduction or smaller growth CapEx that does not qualify for the project backlog. It's important to differentiate between these two categories since project CapEx is lumpy, with a high degree of certainty in returns, more akin to acquisitions; whereas base CapEx defines traditional uses, such as asset replacement and organic growth. Sequentially, you can see that project CapEx is up 21%, primarily from project timing and a rising backlog. Note that the $200 million CapEx synergy target will be achieved through better base CapEx efficiency and asset utilization and improved procurement for all capital spending.  The return on capital metric represents a rolling average of after-tax profit divided by a capital base represented as net debt plus equity. The full reconciliation can be found in the appendix. Note that the initial 10.4% figure is fairly consistent with the average of the two predecessor companies prior to the merger. 
Second quarter ROCE of 10.6% is up 20 basis points in the first quarter, primarily due to higher profit on a stable capital base. Net debt of $11 billion increased about $3 billion from last quarter as expected, primarily due to the $3.2 billion squeeze out payment. Net debt should continue to rise over the next several quarters as we recapitalize the balance sheet to meet our A target credit rating. 
Please turn to Slide 4 for an update on the full year guidance. Full year 2019 EPS estimate is in the range of $6.95 to $7.18, an increase of 12% to 16% from prior year or 15% to 19% when excluding 3% currency headwind. This range is 3% higher than last quarter due to faster synergy achievement in Q2 and more confidence in our self-help actions looking forward. However, we still anticipate softer volumes in the second half of the year as we are seeing more planned customer outages, with demand softening in certain end markets, such as manufacturing.  Furthermore, global industrial production levels are leveling out or declining across mulch countries, which could have negative effects on packaged and merchant volumes. Of course, this is just an assumption at this time, and actual conditions will likely vary. Rest assured, if conditions are better than anticipated, we will not miss any volume growth opportunities, given our breadth of coverage and contractual nature of this business.  Also note that while we aren't providing quarterly guidance at this time, I would anticipate Q4 EPS to be slightly better than Q3, given synergy timing. 
In summary, if current volume levels remain stable or slightly improve, we would anticipate reaching the upper end or possibly above this guidance range. However, given the current economic environment, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious and manage the business accordingly. Despite these economic uncertainties, we have a unique foundation of synergy and efficiency opportunities, coupled with a secured, industry-leading project backlog to improve the business performance and quality. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

So regarding this pricing equal inflation, I would say in certain parts of the world, the answer is yes. You can see we averaged 2%. Our land in the Americas was 3%, we had certain businesses higher than that and if you go around the world, there's kind of a plus/minus around that number. I would say we still have some work to do in terms of making sure that all of our pricing actions at least offset the cost inflation that we've been seeing, and we'll see going forward. So that work is not done. I said in my comments, it was one of my key priorities going forward to have a best-in-class price management system. That entails much more than just a price versus a cost inflation number is how you manage pricing, contracts, product management, all of that. Matt?"

Just to add one thing to Steve's, Nicola, that while we showed 2% that was a fairly strong 2%. It just happened the way the rounding and footing work that shows us 2% so as per the comments, that's pretty much right in line with the 2.5% globally weighted inflation. 
Regarding the cash flow, I think as you may have alluded to, I think the best way to probably look at this is what is the conversion rate of our adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow. And we talked a little bit about this in the first quarter as well. And I'll talk to the operating cash flow on a half basis, first half because as you can imagine, there's some parts that move between quarters. So when you look at historically the last 5 years of both predecessor companies, the first half of the year, you tended to see operating cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA at around 70%. For the full year, that number was closer to maybe 77% so as you could imagine, the back half is usually stronger, almost the mid-80s and the front half is usually around 70%. So I think that's the benchmark we want to look at from a cash conversion ratio, if you want to refer to it that way. 
So looking at our particular numbers, as you know, our adjusted EBITDA for the first half is about $4 billion and our current operating cash flow year-to-date is about $2.1 billion. So applying that 70%, that would mean we're looking for more like $2.8 billion versus the $2.1 billion, so about $0.7 billion short of where we'd want to be. So why aren't we, right? I think that's the question. $0.5 billion or $0.5 billion is all these one-off merger costs. We've got almost $400 million are related to either taxes on gains, cost to do the divestitures, merger cash cost that carried over and some change in control cost that triggered acceleration of retirement benefits. There's another $100 million of restructuring severance-related. So those $0.5 billion are really one-off in nature, and that's something that will subside here in the next couple of quarters, especially the merger related and we'll have a little bit more restructuring in the next probably 18 to 24 months. 
There's about $100 million what's called contract liabilities and what that really relates to is last year, our engineering business had significant prepayments from their customer base, which is a good thing. That's them managing the working capital quite well, but we lapped that. Now they are executing and building some of those projects so that's about $100 million of some unfavorable timing but that is the nature an EPC-type business. And the remaining $100 million is some working capital that frankly, we got to get after. That something we've got to do better on. We've got a lot of initiatives internally we're working towards that, so that last $100 million is something that I'm personally focused on, Steve's focused on to kind of get back to the right levels, but I fully expect the second half numbers to start stepping up, especially as we lap a lot of these merger cash payments. And at this point, I see no reason why we're not going to demonstrate the legacy company average of the cash conversion rate from OCF to adjusted EBITDA."

I'm going to say 1% sales and EPS. Going forward, certainly the timing of startups as we're going to have a stronger 2020 over 2019, so here again, regardless of the macro environment, we do have a stronger backlog contribution in 2020. I would -- I'm looking at something more like a 2% contribution over '19 top and bottom. And then based on the strength of what we have going forward, I'd say probably, through a 2023 kind of time frame because I'm looking at a very big project start up there, I would look for 2% kind of as an average annual growth rate, top and bottom going forward, I think that's certainly in the cards. And I again, that's compared to 1% this year. 
So if you think about kind of sales operation going forward, we have the macro, the underlying macro very much driven by investor production. I think that is kind of a more of a questionable number by the day. But on top of that, we expect price management contributions. On top of that, we expect backlog contributions. And at some point, we're going to start to see more noticeable effects from growth synergies. So that's the way we look at it."

But in terms of what we see refiners do to get prepared for this, it looks to me like it's more a case of they have coker capacity or they're adding coker capacity. They're very comfortable operating cokers. They've been doing this for many, many years quite well. Some of them are looking towards more sweet crude feedstocks, some of them aren't going to do anything, they're going to wait and see how it all plays out, so that's how I'd answer that."

I guess there's not a tremendous amount you can do about a do or die Brexit. It's more about the customers but what can you prepare for that because obviously, it impacts U.K. and continental Europe, pretty significantly. And the third point probably for Matt, the base CapEx, Matt, is running about 7% of sales. Now Linde always had a much higher maintenance CapEx for various reasons, one of which was mix and all the cylinder army and all that said, do they have any way they said that was one of the reasons they had much higher maintenance CapEx.

Peter so I -- with respect to, say, markets that were unaffected by the merger in [indiscernible] Australia, clearly there are others, we found, if I go back in my Praxair days that we had certain geographies that did a good job at price management, and you can spend a day with them and see they really understood what was going on in the marketplace, what was going on, on cost, what was going on with supply and demand and things that needed -- they needed to do to address that. 
And so the whole idea is to make sure that we bring that same rigor, that same discipline, that same competency, that same organizational approach to every corner of the globe. And we have had those reviews with Australia, you mentioned Australia and this is something they have been working on ever since the merger. I expect to see positive results, not only out of Australia but out of many other countries around the world as we continue to build that muscle. 
With respect to Brexit, the deindustrialization of the U.K. has been going on for a long time so Brexit is not the point where that starts to happen. So clearly that's an effect that we have been feeling for a long time in the U.K. But what I think the team has done a great job of and will continue to do a great job of is building out resilient markets, more growth and resilient markets. And I'm thinking of health care, thinking of food and beverage, I'm thinking of a myriad of applications that they have been bringing to the marketplace. So that very much has dampened the effect of the deindustrialization trend. And so I don't expect a big change coming out of Brexit. I certainly don't expect positive growth going forward as a result, but I certainly don't expect a big change.

Just a couple of things, as you probably know, but just to make clear. Obviously, our base CapEx as we defined it here does include small growth and that can also mean EECO varus or VPSA's standard plans as legacy Praxair called them. So to have an apples-to-apples comparison may not be the same across the industry but to your point when I look at legacy Praxair that had reported this now, we were on a $750 million to $800 million-type year run rate. So thinking that in simple terms if you double that, that would be around $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion a year, if you felt the company size doubled. Right now, the run rate on Q2 is about $1.8 billion. Of the $200 million of CapEx synergies, a large portion of that would be dedicated to this area. This is an area that's getting a lot of focus. You saw sequentially, we had a little bit of a decline but this is something we're going to keep working at. We tend not to look as a percentage of sales more. Really it's a detailed bottoms-up how we look at that internally, what projects we need, but I can tell you reliability, as you know, is critical in this industry. That's not something we're going to compromise. But when we look at the other growth or small growth initiatives on things like cylinders, trailers, tanks, given the economic outlook we laid out, that's an area I would see probably less spending going forward. those spend tend to correlate more to IP. So this is kind of how we look at it but clearly, the CapEx synergies of $200 million, this base CapEx is going to be an area of intense focus."

So if you go back over a period of time, you would see our price gains have been there year-over-year. We also have to take into consideration that we have every competitor a different mix, if I look at Europe, we're half packaged gases. So the ability to move through pricing very much is through I don't know how many transactions, probably a million transactions or so to those small welders. So that is the mix that we have there. 
If we look at Asia, obviously, our mix is a bit different than some of our competitors. We have Australia, which is a very large piece. Australia and China are the 2 largest countries that we have, that represent Asia. If I look down beneath the covers, which I think is always important because you've got to keep in mind what we're reporting is an aggregated number, but I can look at China merchant price, and it's 5% year-over-year. So that number is very strong. Again, we've got some work to do across the board to bring everything up to an expectation that we would have. If I were to look at the Americas for example, 3% but U.S. merchant is 6%, South America is 5%, Package is 3%. And then if I were to look at Europe, I'd say it's pretty much -- a pretty strong 2% kind of price increase number. But again, it's very much affected by what's going on in mix, and I'll give you another small example of that. If I look at the small business called refrigerants, that number is off quite a bit, and so -- year-over-year. So that all kind of fits into the calculation that it's quite -- it's driven by mix.

And then the [indiscernible] the gamut of ASUs and Haikou and also some other small projects that would be part of that backlog number, I think having capabilities around the olefin crackers, there's certain examples that has led to pull-through of a ASUs and other industrial gas products as a result of having that upfront project. 
Clearly, when you're talking about ethane crackers and natural gas plants, the level of -- the level at which you engage the customer is higher, because clearly there is an interest at the highest levels of the organization with our customers in terms of talking to us about those kinds of projects because they're very critical to their processes. So those are certainly positive that I can point to. I can also look at natural gas processing capability and point to where that is a good source of helium, which has been in short supply, continues to be in short supply, so having that upstream capability puts us in a very positive position with respect to capturing helium off of that process. So that's how I would address that."

I think this is going to be something that we have to look at geography by geography, product by product, market-by-market in terms of understanding negative volumes and the impact that it can have on pricing. I think it's clear that if you had a substantial drop in volumes and that contributed to a high level of supply versus demand in the marketplace, that could put some downward pressure on pricing so I think I'd have to look at that in term of where it's going to actually materialize with respect to what it will do. My view is we would still deliver some positive pricing even, if it's to a level like that. I think I'm going to let Matt answer the currency -- how we handle currency and projects we have in the future."

And to account for that, we always embed in our financial analyses a sovereign in currency risk in every country we operate in. So we essentially mandate that the return can recover the known risks within those contracts. And obviously, if you can get upwards of 100% inflation coverage in your escalation, that has a natural balance on the evaluation speak because that usually after devaluation, inflation follows. So these are the mechanisms that we do to recover compound inflation on the local basis can often exceed the effects of the foreign currency translation over that same time period. So these are all mechanisms you doing contracting to make sure you get an appropriate return inflation coverage to mitigate against that. As far as actually execution itself in procuring equipment whether it's turbomachinery in Europe or coal boxes in China, et cetera, we may or may not use derivatives on that 1-year, 2-year invoicing exposure that would be translational or transactional, I'm sorry, to your point. So that's more of a derivative decision. But long range, we feel we have very strong contractual and return requirements to offset that."

So when hardgoods turns negative and in this case, you see less large equipment, large welding equipment being ordered and so forth, it just says that your customers are becoming more cautious about the outlook going forward. And typically, that would be the first sign, then you start to see the consumables slow along with the gas volumes. So it's not like it's 30% so if you go back in 2009, that's what we saw in the United States, hardgoods fell 30% but it did fell to negative territory, which says that it's certainly not a positive indication with respect to growth rates going forward. Not falling off the cliff but it does signal a weakening trend. 
Again, I think about cylinder gases as very much tied to industrial production, and I made mention of the fact that in Europe, half of our business is packaged gases, so those very much tie to the manufacturing economy, and you can look at the trend with respect to the Eurozone, with respect to more negative trends on industrial production. 
And I anticipate the same thing as I look across Asia that the trend for industrial production has been walking down the PMI indicators, the metals, chemicals has been walking down and therefore, that just signifies to me that there's going to be some weakness ahead, manufacturing certainly is weaker in China than it has been, and so, therefore, that has a good effect on cylinder gas, not just cylinder gas, there's other products as well."

If I look at the types of projects that we're working on today, it tells me that there's still a lot of room to grow in places like the U.S. Gulf Coast, a lot of chemical activity, but also refinery activity still continues to be very positive. 
So the outlook certainly with respect to the U.S. Gulf Coast I think is going to be positive and again, more driven by natural gas than anything else. We talked a little bit about the impact of IMO 2020 and there is some impact clearly, that's the big Singapore project that we talked about. And there are some other projects that we're working on, in Asia, both on the refinery side and also on the chemicals side, not massive, but I think could be significant as we go forward overall in the backlog. So I think it's still pretty positive environment particularly if you look at the U.S. Gulf Coast."

As you can see, we posted strong financials and raised guidance again for the full year. I'll come back to our expectations for the second half later.
The sale of gas backlog of $4.7 billion has increased considerably as a result of the ExxonMobil Singapore project added this quarter. The Linde Engineering third-party backlog also remained strong at $5 billion, bringing the total amount of project work to nearly $10 billion. We think a 50-50 relationship between sale of gas and third party is a nice balance. Our focus continues to be on sale of gas, but we certainly want to take advantage of all the good third-party business available to us. The sale of gas project proposal pipeline still has some momentum driven primarily by petrochemical activity in the U.S. but also in Asia. 
Some milestones during the quarter. We deployed $1 billion to shareholders between dividends and share buybacks. We completed our squeeze out of the remaining shareholders of Linde AG. We closed on our South Korea divestiture and have reached agreement on one of the Indian divestitures. We now expect the value of our Asia divestitures to be in excess of $1.7 billion, which is higher than originally anticipated. 
We are making good progress on our cost synergies and restructuring initiatives. As expected, the time line is more extended in regions like Europe, where we need to engage the works councils on our restructuring plans. Having said that, discussions continue to be constructive. 
Integration is going well: The organization is set. Voluntary turnover remains at low levels. There is a high degree of energy and collaboration. The organization is adapting well to an accelerated, operating rhythm. We have early wins we can point to in practically every area. There is a strong pool for best practices, technology and client capabilities. In short, the organization is excited about the potential for our new company. 
Regarding the macro going forward, I'm sure you're going to think I'm too cautious, too pessimistic. Maybe I am but this is a scenario that can easily play out. Let's start with Asia. Though a good result in Q2, I see more tepid volume growth going forward. China growth is slowing. The key PMI indicators are sliding. IP has been trending down, and key metrics, such as electricity consumed for industrial of production was only 0.5% higher in May. And for the entire economy, electrical consumption was barely over 2%. China is slowing and so is the rest of Asia. The good news is project start-ups will provide some nice lift for us beginning next year. 
Europe. I see weakness across the Eurozone. Industrial production for June was negative 1.3% year-over-year. The fact we serve diverse end markets mitigates against this impact, and we had a good self-help story. But the macro headwinds are clear. 
The Americas. Solid quarter in Q2 as pricing and merchant volume growth buoyed results. However, cylinder gases volumes, which primarily serve metal fabrication markets, flatlined in Q2 as hardgoods turned negative. However, pricing continues to be a good story here. After a sluggish start on the year due to a shortage of Venezuela crude, hydrogen volumes are improving as refiners take advantage of favorable margin spreads. Overall, we expect slowing growth with solid price attainment for the remainder of the year. 
Obviously, if the underlying global economy does well, we will do well. If it falters, we still have a resilient business model and a strong self-help story to sustain performance. My priorities going forward: best-in-class safety, compliance, sustainability and diversity, driving a successful integration and building a high-performance culture, synergy attainment, cost, CapEx and growth, and implementing best-in-class price management systems and a robust productivity initiative. 
And now I will turn it over to Matt."

Slide 3 provides the second quarter adjusted pro forma results. As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in 2 ways: First, they are pro forma, which means periods are restated to assume an effective merger date of January 1, 2018, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures. Second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and merger and restructuring-related costs. We believe this format best represents the underlying trends and performance of the combined business. Sales of $7.2 billion are flat with prior year but up 4% sequentially from the first quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced sales by 4% from 2018 and 1% from the first quarter. While the U.S. dollar has strengthened to almost every global currency, the major contributors are the Chinese RMB, euro, British pound and Australian dollar. Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales increased 4% from the prior year and 5% from Q1. 
Versus the prior year, we continue to see positive pricing, which is in line with globally weighted inflation of 2.5%. Volumes are also up 2% as project contributions and growth in Asia and U.S. are partially offset by softer conditions across EMEA and South Pacific. Sequentially, volumes are up 4%, primarily due to seasonal effects and higher project billings in engineering. And price increased 1%. As Steve mentioned, price management continues to be an area of intense focus throughout the organization. 
Operating profit of $1.3 billion improved 6% over prior year and 8% from Q1, and when excluding FX, up 10% and 9%, respectively. Operating margin expanded to 18.4% versus 17.4% in 2018 and 17.7% in the first quarter. Sequentially, we expanded operating margin by 70 basis points as we made good progress toward achieving the stated cost synergies. At this point, we are on track to reach the full annual run rate of $300 million by the end of this quarter, consistent with our merger commitment. 
Aside from the cost synergies, initiatives continue toward identifying and executing further value-creating opportunities in revenue and cost efficiencies. EPS of $1.83 improved 12% from last year or 16% when excluding impacts from foreign currency. The leverage improvement over operating margin is primarily due to lower interest expense, lower tax rate and less shares outstanding. I anticipate net interest to steadily increase each quarter as we deploy the divestiture proceeds and, thus, increase our debt levels. However, effective tax rate should remain around 24% for the full year and share count should steadily decline with the repurchase program activity. 
When comparing to the first quarter, you can see that net income growth of 8% is consistent with the operating profit growth, as interest and tax levels were stable with a moderate decline in share count. Note that EBITDA sequential growth of 3% is slightly less as we further align the presentation format, resulting in a minor reclass between cost lines with no effect to operating profit. 
On top of delivering solid financial results this quarter, the Linde team secured additional future growth by expanding the sale of gas project backlog to $4.7 billion. As a reminder, this backlog represents estimated CapEx spend for customer projects under construction and secured by long-term contracts that lead to incremental sales and earnings growth. The increase from last quarter is due to the inclusion of a recently signed contract in Singapore, partially offset by smaller start-ups in Asia Pacific. 
In this quarter, we are also introducing a CapEx break down and return on capital metric. We intend to report these prospectively, so investors gain a better understanding of capital deployment and returns, 2 very critical metrics for this industry. The capital investments are broken into 2 categories: project CapEx, which represents spending for the sale of gas project backlog; and base CapEx, which represents everything else, such as replacement, maintenance, cost reduction or smaller growth CapEx that does not qualify for the project backlog. It's important to differentiate between these 2 categories since project CapEx is lumpy, with a high degree of certainty in returns, more akin to acquisitions; whereas base CapEx defines traditional uses, such as asset replacement and organic growth. Sequentially, you can see that project CapEx is up 21%, primarily from project timing and a rising backlog. Note that the $200 million CapEx synergy target will be achieved through better base CapEx efficiency and asset utilization and improved procurement for all capital spending. 
The return on capital metric represents a rolling average of after-tax profit divided by a capital base represented as net debt plus equity. The full reconciliation can be found in the appendix. Note that the initial 10.4% figure is fairly consistent with the average of the 2 predecessor companies prior to the merger. 
Second quarter ROC of 10.6% is up 20 basis points in the first quarter, primarily due to higher profit on a stable capital base. Net debt of $11 billion increased about $3 billion from last quarter as expected, primarily due to the $3.2 billion squeeze-out payment. Net debt should continue to rise over the next several quarters as we recapitalize the balance sheet to meet our single A target credit rating. 
Please turn to Slide 4 for an update on the full year guidance. Full year 2019 EPS estimate is in the range of $6.95 to $7.18, an increase of 12% to 16% from prior year or 15% to 19% when excluding 3% currency headwind. This range is 3% higher than last quarter due to faster synergy achievement in Q2 and more confidence in our self-help actions looking forward. However, we still anticipate softer volumes in the second half of the year as we are seeing more planned customer outages with demand softening in certain end markets, such as manufacturing. Furthermore, global industrial production levels are leveling out or declining across most countries,which could have negative effects on packaged and merchant volumes. Of course, this is just an assumption at this time, and actual conditions will likely vary. Rest assured, if conditions are better than anticipated, we will not miss any volume growth opportunities, given our breadth of coverage and contractual nature of this business. Also note that while we aren't providing quarterly guidance at this time, I would anticipate Q4 EPS to be slightly better than Q3, given synergy timing. 
In summary, if current volume levels remain stable or slightly improve, we would anticipate reaching the upper end or possibly above this guidance range. However, given the current economic environment, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious and manage the business accordingly. Despite these economic uncertainties, we have a unique foundation of synergy and efficiency opportunities, coupled with a secured, industry-leading project backlog to improve the business performance and quality. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And also remind us of phasing of other sort of exceptional items on cash flow this year."

I'm going to take the pricing question, then I'm going to flip it over to Matt to answer the cash flow question.

I'm going to take the pricing question, then I'm going to flip it over to Matt to answer the cash flow question. So regarding does pricing equal inflation, I would say in certain parts of the world, the answer is yes. You can see we averaged 2%. I don't know if our land in the Americas was 3%. We had certain businesses higher than that. And if you go around the world, there's kind of plus/minus around that number. I would say we still have some work to do in terms of making sure that all of our pricing actions at least offset the cost inflation that we've been seeing and will see going forward. 
So that work is not done. I said in my comments, it was one of my key priorities going forward to have a best-in-class price management system. That entails much more than just a price versus a cost inflation number. It's how you manage pricing, contracts, product management, all of that. Matt?"

And just to add one thing to Steve's, Nicola, that while we showed 2%, that was a fairly strong 2%. It just happened the way the rounding and footing work that shows us 2%, so as per the comments, that's pretty much right in line with",571,"Yes. Thanks, Steve. And just to add one thing to Steve's, Nicola, that while we showed 2%, that was a fairly strong 2%. It just happened the way the rounding and footing work that shows us 2%, so as per the comments, that's pretty much right in line with the 2.5% globally weighted inflation. 
Regarding the cash flow, I think as you may have alluded to, I think the best way to probably look at this is what is the conversion rate of our adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow. And we talked a little bit about this in the first quarter as well. And I'll talk to the operating cash flow on a half basis, first half because as you can imagine, there's some parts that move between quarters. So when you look at historically the last 5 years of both predecessor companies, the first half of the year, you tended to see operating cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA at around 70%, 7-0. For the full year, that number was closer to maybe 77%. So as you could imagine, the back half is usually stronger, almost the mid-80s, and the front half is usually around 70%. So I think that's the benchmark we want to look at from a cash conversion ratio, if you want to refer to it that way. 
So looking at our particular numbers, as you know, our adjusted EBITDA for the first half is about $4 billion, and our current operating cash flow year-to-date is about $2.1 billion. So applying that 70%, that would mean we're looking for more like $2.8 billion versus the $2.1 billion, so about $0.7 billion short of where we'd want to be. 
So why are we, right? I think that's the question. $0.5 billion or $0.5 billion is all these one-off merger costs. We've got almost $400 million are related to either taxes on gains, costs to do the divestitures, merger cash costs that carried over and some change in control costs that triggered acceleration of retirement benefits. There's another $100 million of restructuring severance related. So those $0.5 billion are really one-off in nature, and that's something that will subside here in the next couple of quarters, especially the merger related, and we'll have a little bit more restructuring in the next probably 18 to 24 months. 
We've got $100 million what's called contract liabilities, and what that really relates to is last year, our engineering business had significant prepayments from their customer base, which is a good thing. That's them managing the working capital quite well, but we've lapped that. Now they are executing and building some of those projects so that's about $100 million of some unfavorable timing, but that is the nature an EPC-type business. 
 And the remaining $100 million is some working capital that, frankly, we got to get after. That's something we've got to do better on. We've got a lot of initiatives internally. We're working towards that. So that last $100 million is something that I'm personally focused on, Steve's focused on to kind of get back to the right levels. But I fully expect the second half numbers to start stepping up, especially as we lap a lot of these merger cash payments. And at this point, I see no reason why we're not going to demonstrate the legacy company average of the cash conversion rate from OCF to adjusted EBITDA."

Going forward, certainly the timing of start-ups says we're going to have a stronger 2020 over 2019, so here again, regardless of the macro environment, we do have a stronger backlog contribution in 2020. I would -- I'm looking at something more like a 2% contribution over '19 top and bottom. And then based on the strength of what we have going forward, I'd say probably, through a 2023 kind of time frame because I'm looking at a very big project start-up there, I would look for 2% kind of as an average annual growth rate, top and bottom, going forward. I think that's certainly in the cards. And again, that's compared to 1% this year. 
So if you think about kind of the sales algorithm going forward, we have the macro, the underlying macro very much driven by industrial production. I think that is kind of a more of a questionable number by the day. But on top of that, we expect price management contributions. On top of that, we expect backlog contributions. And at some point, we're going to start to see more noticeable effects from growth synergies. So that's the way we look at it."

They're very comfortable operating cokers. They've been doing this for many, many years quite well. Some of them are looking towards more sweet crude feedstocks. Some of them aren't going to do anything. They're going to wait and see how it all plays out, so that's how I'd answer that."

And so the whole idea is to make sure that we bring that same rigor, that same discipline, that same competency, that same organizational approach to every corner of the globe. And we have had -- I've had those reviews with Australia. You mentioned Australia, and this is something they have been working on ever since the merger. I expect to see positive results, not only out of Australia but out of many other countries around the world as we continue to build that muscle. 
With respect to Brexit, the deindustrialization of the U.K. has been going on for a long time, so Brexit is not the point where that starts to happen. So clearly, that's an effect that we have been feeling for a long time in the U.K. What I think the team has done a great job of and will continue to do a great job of is building out resilient markets, more growth in resilient markets. And I'm thinking of health care, I'm thinking of food and beverage, I'm thinking of a myriad of applications that they have been bringing to the marketplace.

But to your point when I look at legacy Praxair that had reported this now, we were on a $750 million to $800 million-type year run rate.

You saw sequentially, we had a little bit of a decline, but this is something we're going to keep working at. We tend not to look it as a percentage of sales. More really, it's a detailed bottoms-up how we look at that internally, what projects we need. 
But I can tell you reliability, as you know, is critical in this industry. That's not something we're going to compromise. But when we look at the other growth or small growth initiatives on things like cylinders, trailers, tanks, given the economic outlook we laid out, that's an area I would see probably less spending going forward. Those spend tend to correlate more to IP. So this is kind of how we'll look at it. But clearly, the CapEx synergies of $200 million, this base CapEx is going to be an area of intense focus."

So if you go back over a period of time, you would see our price gains have been there year-over-year. You also have to take into consideration that we have -- every competitor has a bit of a different mix. If I look at Europe, we're half packaged gases. So the ability to move through pricing very much is through I don't know how many -- probably a million transactions or so through those small welders. So that is the mix that we have there. 
If we look at Asia, obviously, our mix is a bit different than some of our competitors. We have Australia, which is a very large piece. Australia and China are the 2 largest countries that we have that represent Asia. If I look down beneath the covers, which I think is always important because you've got to keep in mind what we're reporting is an aggregated number. But I can look at China merchant price, and it's 5% year-over-year. So that number is very strong. Again, we've got some work to do across the board to bring everything up to an expectation that we would have. If I were to look at the Americas for example, 3% number, but U.S. merchant is 6%, South America is 5%, packaged is 3%. And then if I were to look at Europe, I'd say it's pretty much -- a pretty strong 2% kind of price increase number. 
But again, it's very much affected by what's going on in mix. And I'll give you another small example of that. If I look at our small business called refrigerants, that number is off quite a bit, and so -- year-over-year. So that all kind of fits into the calculation, but it's quite -- quite a bit's driven by mix. But we certainly have a focus on working on every aspect, every channel, every product, every market across the globe."

Many people think that it's all large project-driven, but a good 40% or so is very small projects that they execute, day in and day out. So the capabilities, the strengths within that business certainly are obvious. 
As I look at application capabilities, it's a story of where I would say that we've been very strong in things like oxygen, combustion. Linde's been very strong in areas like clean fuels, health care. We both have worked on food and beverage. We both have worked on digitalization. The combined capability is very positive. I would say that certainly, some technologies like cylinder tracking is something that legacy Linde was very much out front with. Specialty gas capability, legacy Praxair had good capabilities, Linde has excellent capabilities. Together, we have a much stronger portfolio. You get into productivity tools, we each develop productivity tools. Praxair, obviously, was very proud of the productivity track record but Linde has excellent capabilities, too. You just put them all together.

And then the rest runs the gamut of ASUs and HyCO and also some other small projects that would be part of that backlog number. I think having capabilities around the olefin crackers, there's certain examples that has led to pull-through of ASUs and other industrial gas products as a result of having that upfront project. 
Clearly, when you're talking about ethane crackers and natural gas plants, the level of -- the level at which you engage the customer is higher, because clearly, there is an interest at the highest levels of the organization with our customers in terms of talking to us about those kinds of projects, because they're very critical to their processes. 
So those are certainly positives that I can point to. I can also look at natural gas processing capability and point to where that is a good source of helium, which has been in short supply, continues to be in short supply. So having that upstream capability puts us in a very positive position with respect to capturing helium off of that process. So that's how I would address that."

I think it's clear that if you had a substantial drop in volumes and that contributed to a high level of supply versus demand in the marketplace, that could put some downward pressure on pricing. So I think I'd have to look at that in term of where it's going to actually materialize with respect to what it would do. My view is we would still deliver some positive pricing even if it fell to a level like that.

So throughout that time frame, currencies go up and down. And to account for that, we always embed in our financial analyses a sovereign and currency risk in every country we operate in. So we essentially mandate that the return can recover the known risks within those contracts. And obviously, if you can get upwards of 100% inflation coverage in your escalation, that has a natural balance on devaluations. Because usually, after a devaluation, inflation follows. So these are the mechanisms that we do to recover. Compound inflation on a local basis can often exceed the effects of the foreign currency translation over that same time period. So these are all mechanisms you do when contracting to ensure you get an appropriate return inflation coverage to mitigate against that. 
As far as the actual execution itself in procuring equipment, whether it's turbomachinery in Europe or coal boxes in China, et cetera, we may or may not use derivatives on that 1-year, 2-year invoicing exposure. That would be translational -- or transactional, I'm sorry, to your point. So that's more of a derivative decision. But long range, we feel we have very strong contractual and return requirements to offset that.

So when hardgoods turns negative, and in this case, you see less large equipment, large welding equipment being ordered and so forth, it just says that your customers are becoming more cautious about the outlook going forward. And typically, that would be the first sign. Then you start to see the consumables slow along with the gas volumes. So it's not like it fell 30%. So if you go back in 2009, that's what we saw in the United States. Hardgoods fell 30%. But it did fell to negative territory, which says that it's certainly not a positive indication with respect to growth rates going forward. Not falling off a cliff but it does signal a weakening trend. 
Again, I think about cylinder gases as very much tied to industrial production, and I made mention the fact that in Europe, half of our business is packaged gases, so that's very much tied to the manufacturing economy, and you can look at the trends with respect to the Eurozone, with respect to more negative trends on industrial production. 
And I anticipate the same thing as I look across Asia, that the trend for industrial production has been walking down. The PMI indicators for metals, chemicals has been walking down and, therefore, that just signifies to me that there's going to be some weakness ahead. Manufacturing certainly is weaker in China than it has been. And so therefore, that has a big effect on cylinder gases. But not just cylinder gases. Other products as well."

If I look at the types of projects that we're working on today, it tells me that there's still a lot of room to go in places like the U.S. Gulf Coast, a lot of chemical activity, but also refinery activity still continues to be very positive. 
So the outlook, certainly with respect to the U.S. Gulf Coast, I think is going to be positive and again, more driven by natural gas than anything else. We talked a little bit about the impact of IMO 2020, and there is some impact. Clearly, that's the big Singapore project that we talked about. And there are some other projects that we're working on in Asia, both on the refinery side and also on the chemicals side, not massive, but I think could be significant as we go forward overall in the backlog.

As you can see, we posted strong financials and raised guidance again for the full year. I'll come back to our expectations for the second half later.
The sale of gas backlog of $4.7 billion has increased considerably as a result of the ExxonMobil Singapore project added this quarter. The Linde Engineering third-party backlog also remained strong at $5 billion, bringing the total amount of project work to nearly $10 billion. We think a 50-50 relationship between sale of gas and third party is a nice balance. Our focus continues to be on sale of gas, but we certainly want to take advantage of all the good third-party business available to us. The sale of gas project proposal pipeline still has some momentum driven primarily by petrochemical activity in the U.S. but also in Asia. 
Some milestones during the quarter. We deployed $1 billion to shareholders between dividends and share buybacks. We completed our squeeze out of the remaining shareholders of Linde AG. We closed on our South Korea divestiture and have reached agreement on one of the Indian divestitures. We now expect the value of our Asia divestitures to be in excess of $1.7 billion, which is higher than originally anticipated. 
We are making good progress on our cost synergies and restructuring initiatives. As expected, the time line is more extended in regions like Europe, where we need to engage the works councils on our restructuring plans. Having said that, discussions continue to be constructive. 
Integration is going well: The organization is set. Voluntary turnover remains at low levels. There is a high degree of energy and collaboration. The organization is adapting well to an accelerated, operating rhythm. We have early wins we can point to in practically every area. There is a strong pool for best practices, technology and client capabilities. In short, the organization is excited about the potential for our new company. 
Regarding the macro going forward, I'm sure you're going to think I'm too cautious, too pessimistic. Maybe I am but this is a scenario that can easily play out. Let's start with Asia. Though a good result in Q2, I see more tepid volume growth going forward. China growth is slowing. The key PMI indicators are sliding. IP has been trending down, and key metrics, such as electricity consumed for industrial of production was only 0.5% higher in May. And for the entire economy, electrical consumption was barely over 2%. China is slowing and so is the rest of Asia. The good news is project start-ups will provide some nice lift for us beginning next year. 
Europe. I see weakness across the Eurozone. Industrial production for June was negative 1.3% year-over-year. The fact we serve diverse end markets mitigates against this impact, and we had a good self-help story. But the macro headwinds are clear. 
The Americas. Solid quarter in Q2 as pricing and merchant volume growth buoyed results. However, cylinder gases volumes, which primarily serve metal fabrication markets, flatlined in Q2 as hardgoods turned negative. However, pricing continues to be a good story here. After a sluggish start on the year due to a shortage of Venezuela crude, hydrogen volumes are improving as refiners take advantage of favorable margin spreads. Overall, we expect slowing growth with solid price attainment for the remainder of the year. 
Obviously, if the underlying global economy does well, we will do well. If it falters, we still have a resilient business model and a strong self-help story to sustain performance. My priorities going forward: best-in-class safety, compliance, sustainability and diversity, driving a successful integration and building a high-performance culture, synergy attainment, cost, CapEx and growth, and implementing best-in-class price management systems and a robust productivity initiative. 
And now I will turn it over to Matt."

Slide 3 provides the second quarter adjusted pro forma results. As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in 2 ways: First, they are pro forma, which means periods are restated to assume an effective merger date of January 1, 2018, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures. Second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and merger and restructuring-related costs. We believe this format best represents the underlying trends and performance of the combined business. Sales of $7.2 billion are flat with prior year but up 4% sequentially from the first quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced sales by 4% from 2018 and 1% from the first quarter. While the U.S. dollar has strengthened to almost every global currency, the major contributors are the Chinese RMB, euro, British pound and Australian dollar. Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales increased 4% from the prior year and 5% from Q1. 
Versus the prior year, we continue to see positive pricing, which is in line with globally weighted inflation of 2.5%. Volumes are also up 2% as project contributions and growth in Asia and U.S. are partially offset by softer conditions across EMEA and South Pacific. Sequentially, volumes are up 4%, primarily due to seasonal effects and higher project billings in engineering. And price increased 1%. As Steve mentioned, price management continues to be an area of intense focus throughout the organization. 
Operating profit of $1.3 billion improved 6% over prior year and 8% from Q1, and when excluding FX, up 10% and 9%, respectively. Operating margin expanded to 18.4% versus 17.4% in 2018 and 17.7% in the first quarter. Sequentially, we expanded operating margin by 70 basis points as we made good progress toward achieving the stated cost synergies. At this point, we are on track to reach the full annual run rate of $300 million by the end of this quarter, consistent with our merger commitment. 
Aside from the cost synergies, initiatives continue toward identifying and executing further value-creating opportunities in revenue and cost efficiencies. EPS of $1.83 improved 12% from last year or 16% when excluding impacts from foreign currency. The leverage improvement over operating margin is primarily due to lower interest expense, lower tax rate and less shares outstanding. I anticipate net interest to steadily increase each quarter as we deploy the divestiture proceeds and, thus, increase our debt levels. However, effective tax rate should remain around 24% for the full year and share count should steadily decline with the repurchase program activity. 
When comparing to the first quarter, you can see that net income growth of 8% is consistent with the operating profit growth, as interest and tax levels were stable with a moderate decline in share count. Note that EBITDA sequential growth of 3% is slightly less as we further align the presentation format, resulting in a minor reclass between cost lines with no effect to operating profit. 
On top of delivering solid financial results this quarter, the Linde team secured additional future growth by expanding the sale of gas project backlog to $4.7 billion. As a reminder, this backlog represents estimated CapEx spend for customer projects under construction and secured by long-term contracts that lead to incremental sales and earnings growth. The increase from last quarter is due to the inclusion of a recently signed contract in Singapore partially offset by smaller start-ups in Asia Pacific. 
In this quarter, we are also introducing a CapEx break down and return on capital metric. We intend to report these prospectively, so investors gain a better understanding of capital deployment and returns, 2 very critical metrics for this industry. The capital investments are broken into 2 categories: project CapEx, which represents spending for the sale of gas project backlog; and base CapEx, which represents everything else, such as replacement, maintenance, cost reduction or smaller growth CapEx that does not qualify for the project backlog. It's important to differentiate between these 2 categories since project CapEx is lumpy, with a high degree of certainty in returns, more akin to acquisitions; whereas base CapEx defines traditional uses, such as asset replacement and organic growth. Sequentially, you can see that project CapEx is up 21%, primarily from project timing and a rising backlog. Note that the $200 million CapEx synergy target will be achieved through better base CapEx efficiency and asset utilization and improved procurement for all capital spending. 
The return on capital metric represents a rolling average of after-tax profit divided by a capital base represented as net debt plus equity. The full reconciliation can be found in the appendix. Note that the initial 10.4% figure is fairly consistent with the average of the 2 predecessor companies prior to the merger. 
Second quarter ROC of 10.6% is up 20 basis points in the first quarter, primarily due to higher profit on a stable capital base. Net debt of $11 billion increased about $3 billion from last quarter as expected, primarily due to the $3.2 billion squeeze-out payment. Net debt should continue to rise over the next several quarters as we recapitalize the balance sheet to meet our single A target credit rating. 
Please turn to Slide 4 for an update on the full year guidance. Full year 2019 EPS estimate is in the range of $6.95 to $7.18, an increase of 12% to 16% from prior year or 15% to 19% when excluding 3% currency headwind. This range is 3% higher than last quarter due to faster synergy achievement in Q2 and more confidence in our self-help actions looking forward. However, we still anticipate softer volumes in the second half of the year as we are seeing more planned customer outages with demand softening in certain end markets, such as manufacturing. Furthermore, global industrial production levels are leveling out or declining across most countries,which could have negative effects on packaged and merchant volumes. Of course, this is just an assumption at this time, and actual conditions will likely vary. Rest assured, if conditions are better than anticipated, we will not miss any volume growth opportunities, given our breadth of coverage and contractual nature of this business. Also note that while we aren't providing quarterly guidance at this time, I would anticipate Q4 EPS to be slightly better than Q3, given synergy timing. 
In summary, if current volume levels remain stable or slightly improve, we would anticipate reaching the upper end or possibly above this guidance range. However, given the current economic environment, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious and manage the business accordingly. Despite these economic uncertainties, we have a unique foundation of synergy and efficiency opportunities, coupled with a secured, industry-leading project backlog to improve the business performance and quality. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And then the second question was on cash flow. I was wondering whether you could talk a little bit about the moving parts on the operating cash flow because it looks like the conversion worsened a little bit quarter-on-quarter, and I was wondering if you could explain what's driving that and also call off -- call out any one-offs or anything related to restructuring and other.

I'm going to take the pricing question, then I'm going to flip it over to Matt to answer the cash flow question. So regarding does pricing equal inflation, I would say in certain parts of the world, the answer is yes. You can see we averaged 2%. I don't know if our land in the Americas was 3%. We had certain businesses higher than that. And if you go around the world, there's kind of plus/minus around that number. I would say we still have some work to do in terms of making sure that all of our pricing actions at least offset the cost inflation that we've been seeing and will see going forward. 
So that work is not done. I said in my comments, it was one of my key priorities going forward to have a best-in-class price management system. That entails much more than just a price versus a cost inflation number. It's how you manage pricing, contracts, product management, all of that. Matt?"

And just to add one thing to Steve's, Nicola, that while we showed 2%, that was a fairly strong 2%. It just happened the way the rounding and footing work that shows us 2%, so as per the comments, that's pretty much right in line with",571,"Yes. Thanks, Steve. And just to add one thing to Steve's, Nicola, that while we showed 2%, that was a fairly strong 2%. It just happened the way the rounding and footing work that shows us 2%, so as per the comments, that's pretty much right in line with the 2.5% globally weighted inflation. 
Regarding the cash flow, I think as you may have alluded to, I think the best way to probably look at this is what is the conversion rate of our adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow. And we talked a little bit about this in the first quarter as well. And I'll talk to the operating cash flow on a half basis, first half because as you can imagine, there's some parts that move between quarters. So when you look at historically the last 5 years of both predecessor companies, the first half of the year, you tended to see operating cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA at around 70%, 7-0. For the full year, that number was closer to maybe 77%. So as you could imagine, the back half is usually stronger, almost the mid-80s, and the front half is usually around 70%. So I think that's the benchmark we want to look at from a cash conversion ratio, if you want to refer to it that way. 
So looking at our particular numbers, as you know, our adjusted EBITDA for the first half is about $4 billion, and our current operating cash flow year-to-date is about $2.1 billion. So applying that 70%, that would mean we're looking for more like $2.8 billion versus the $2.1 billion, so about $0.7 billion short of where we'd want to be. 
So why are we, right? I think that's the question. $0.5 billion or $0.5 billion is all these one-off merger costs. We've got almost $400 million are related to either taxes on gains, costs to do the divestitures, merger cash costs that carried over and some change in control costs that triggered acceleration of retirement benefits. There's another $100 million of restructuring severance related. So those $0.5 billion are really one-off in nature, and that's something that will subside here in the next couple of quarters, especially the merger related, and we'll have a little bit more restructuring in the next probably 18 to 24 months. 
We've got $100 million what's called contract liabilities, and what that really relates to is last year, our engineering business had significant prepayments from their customer base, which is a good thing. That's them managing the working capital quite well, but we've lapped that. Now they are executing and building some of those projects so that's about $100 million of some unfavorable timing, but that is the nature an EPC-type business. 
 And the remaining $100 million is some working capital that, frankly, we got to get after. That's something we've got to do better on. We've got a lot of initiatives internally. We're working towards that. So that last $100 million is something that I'm personally focused on, Steve's focused on to kind of get back to the right levels. But I fully expect the second half numbers to start stepping up, especially as we lap a lot of these merger cash payments. And at this point, I see no reason why we're not going to demonstrate the legacy company average of the cash conversion rate from OCF to adjusted EBITDA."

Going forward, certainly the timing of start-ups says we're going to have a stronger 2020 over 2019, so here again, regardless of the macro environment, we do have a stronger backlog contribution in 2020. I would -- I'm looking at something more like a 2% contribution over '19 top and bottom. And then based on the strength of what we have going forward, I'd say probably, through a 2023 kind of time frame because I'm looking at a very big project start-up there, I would look for 2% kind of as an average annual growth rate, top and bottom, going forward. I think that's certainly in the cards. And again, that's compared to 1% this year. 
So if you think about kind of the sales algorithm going forward, we have the macro, the underlying macro very much driven by industrial production. I think that is kind of a more of a questionable number by the day. But on top of that, we expect price management contributions. On top of that, we expect backlog contributions. And at some point, we're going to start to see more noticeable effects from growth synergies. So that's the way we look at it."

But aside from that, I've looked at this before, we may have a few projects over a number years, principally in Southeast Asia. But in terms of what we see refiners do to get prepared for this, it looks to me like it's more a case of they have coker capacity or they're adding coker capacity. They're very comfortable operating cokers. They've been doing this for many, many years quite well. Some of them are looking towards more sweet crude feedstocks. Some of them aren't going to do anything. They're going to wait and see how it all plays out, so that's how I'd answer that."

Price management, you talked about price up in all regions. Would that be all key territories?

You mentioned Brexit. I guess there's not a tremendous amount you can do about a do-or-die Brexit. It's more about the customers. But what can you prepare for that? Because obviously, it impacts U.K. and continental Europe, pretty significantly. 
And the third point, probably for Matt. The base CapEx, Matt, is running about 7% of sales. Now Linde always had a much higher maintenance CapEx for various reasons, but one of which was mix and an almost cylinder army or all the cylinders they had. Anyway, they said that was one of the reasons they had much higher maintenance CapEx. Just wondering if there's a structural issue that means that you won't get a base CapEx to where you were but clearly, you will improve on where in the world."

Peter, so I -- with respect to, let's say, markets that were unaffected by the merger, and you brought up Australia. Clearly there are others. We found, if I go back in my Praxair days, that we had certain geographies that did a good job with price management, and you can spend a day with them and see they really understood what was going on in the marketplace, what was going on with cost, what was going on with supply and demand and things that needed -- they needed to do to address that. 
And so the whole idea is to make sure that we bring that same rigor, that same discipline, that same competency, that same organizational approach to every corner of the globe. And we have had -- I've had those reviews with Australia. You mentioned Australia, and this is something they have been working on ever since the merger. I expect to see positive results, not only out of Australia but out of many other countries around the world as we continue to build that muscle. 
With respect to Brexit, the deindustrialization of the U.K. has been going on for a long time, so Brexit is not the point where that starts to happen. So clearly, that's an effect that we have been feeling for a long time in the U.K. What I think the team has done a great job of and will continue to do a great job of is building out resilient markets, more growth in resilient markets. And I'm thinking of health care, I'm thinking of food and beverage, I'm thinking of a myriad of applications that they have been bringing to the marketplace. So that very much has dampened the effect of the deindustrialization trend. And so I don't expect a big change coming out of Brexit. I certainly don't expect positive growth going forward as a result, but I certainly don't expect a big change. 
And Matt, do you want to answer the base -- or I can answer, and you can answer."

Obviously, our base CapEx, as we defined it here, does include small growth. And that can also mean ECOVAR or VPSAs standard plants, as legacy Praxair called them. So to have an apples-to-apples comparison may not be the same across the industry. 
But to your point when I look at legacy Praxair that had reported this now, we were on a $750 million to $800 million-type year run rate. So just thinking of that in simple terms, if you double that, that would be around $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion a year, if you felt the company size doubled. Right now, the run rate on Q2 is about $1.8 billion. Of the $200 million of CapEx synergies, a large portion of that would be dedicated to this area. This is an area that's getting a lot of focus. You saw sequentially, we had a little bit of a decline, but this is something we're going to keep working at. We tend not to look it as a percentage of sales. More really, it's a detailed bottoms-up how we look at that internally, what projects we need. 
But I can tell you reliability, as you know, is critical in this industry. That's not something we're going to compromise. But when we look at the other growth or small growth initiatives on things like cylinders, trailers, tanks, given the economic outlook we laid out, that's an area I would see probably less spending going forward. Those spend tend to correlate more to IP. So this is kind of how we'll look at it. But clearly, the CapEx synergies of $200 million, this base CapEx is going to be an area of intense focus."

So if you go back over a period of time, you would see our price gains have been there year-over-year. You also have to take into consideration that we have -- every competitor has a bit of a different mix. If I look at Europe, we're half packaged gases. So the ability to move through pricing very much is through I don't know how many -- probably a million transactions or so through those small welders. So that is the mix that we have there. 
If we look at Asia, obviously, our mix is a bit different than some of our competitors. We have Australia, which is a very large piece. Australia and China are the 2 largest countries that we have that represent Asia. If I look down beneath the covers, which I think is always important because you've got to keep in mind what we're reporting is an aggregated number. But I can look at China merchant price, and it's 5% year-over-year. So that number is very strong. Again, we've got some work to do across the board to bring everything up to an expectation that we would have. If I were to look at the Americas for example, 3% number, but U.S. merchant is 6%, South America is 5%, packaged is 3%. And then if I were to look at Europe, I'd say it's pretty much -- a pretty strong 2% kind of price increase number. 
But again, it's very much affected by what's going on in mix. And I'll give you another small example of that. If I look at our small business called refrigerants, that number is off quite a bit, and so -- year-over-year. So that all kind of fits into the calculation, but it's quite -- quite a bit's driven by mix. But we certainly have a focus on working on every aspect, every channel, every product, every market across the globe."

Linde's been very strong in areas like clean fuels, health care. We both have worked on food and beverage. We both have worked on digitalization. The combined capability is very positive. I would say that certainly, some technologies like cylinder tracking is something that legacy Linde was very much out front with.

And then the rest runs the gamut of ASUs and HyCO and also some other small projects that would be part of that backlog number. I think having capabilities around the olefin crackers, there's certain examples that has led to pull-through of ASUs and other industrial gas products as a result of having that upfront project. 
Clearly, when you're talking about ethane crackers and natural gas plants, the level of -- the level at which you engage the customer is higher, because clearly, there is an interest at the highest levels of the organization with our customers in terms of talking to us about those kinds of projects, because they're very critical to their processes. 
So those are certainly positives that I can point to. I can also look at natural gas processing capability and point to where that is a good source of helium, which has been in short supply, continues to be in short supply. So having that upstream capability puts us in a very positive position with respect to capturing helium off of that process. So that's how I would address that."

So throughout that time frame, currencies go up and down. And to account for that, we always embed in our financial analyses a sovereign and currency risk in every country we operate in. So we essentially mandate that the return can recover the known risks within those contracts. And obviously, if you can get upwards of 100% inflation coverage in your escalation, that has a natural balance on devaluations. Because usually, after a devaluation, inflation follows. So these are the mechanisms that we do to recover. Compound inflation on a local basis can often exceed the effects of the foreign currency translation over that same time period. So these are all mechanisms you do when contracting to ensure you get an appropriate return inflation coverage to mitigate against that. 
As far as the actual execution itself in procuring equipment, whether it's turbomachinery in Europe or coal boxes in China, et cetera, we may or may not use derivatives on that 1-year, 2-year invoicing exposure.

So when hardgoods turns negative, and in this case, you see less large equipment, large welding equipment being ordered and so forth, it just says that your customers are becoming more cautious about the outlook going forward. And typically, that would be the first sign. Then you start to see the consumables slow along with the gas volumes. So it's not like it fell 30%. So if you go back in 2009, that's what we saw in the United States. Hardgoods fell 30%. But it did fell to negative territory, which says that it's certainly not a positive indication with respect to growth rates going forward. Not falling off a cliff but it does signal a weakening trend. 
Again, I think about cylinder gases as very much tied to industrial production, and I made mention the fact that in Europe, half of our business is packaged gases, so that's very much tied to the manufacturing economy, and you can look at the trends with respect to the Eurozone, with respect to more negative trends on industrial production. 
And I anticipate the same thing as I look across Asia, that the trend for industrial production has been walking down. The PMI indicators for metals, chemicals has been walking down and, therefore, that just signifies to me that there's going to be some weakness ahead. Manufacturing certainly is weaker in China than it has been. And so therefore, that has a big effect on cylinder gases. But not just cylinder gases. Other products as well."

If I look at the types of projects that we're working on today, it tells me that there's still a lot of room to go in places like the U.S. Gulf Coast, a lot of chemical activity, but also refinery activity still continues to be very positive. 
So the outlook, certainly with respect to the U.S. Gulf Coast, I think is going to be positive and again, more driven by natural gas than anything else. We talked a little bit about the impact of IMO 2020, and there is some impact. Clearly, that's the big Singapore project that we talked about. And there are some other projects that we're working on in Asia, both on the refinery side and also on the chemicals side, not massive, but I think could be significant as we go forward overall in the backlog. So I think it's still pretty positive environment, particularly if you look at the U.S. Gulf Coast."

As you can see, we posted strong financials and raised guidance again for the full year. I'll come back to our expectations for the second half later.
The sale of gas backlog of $4.7 billion has increased considerably as a result of the ExxonMobil Singapore project added this quarter. The Linde Engineering third-party backlog also remained strong at $5 billion, bringing the total amount of project work to nearly $10 billion. We think a 50-50 relationship between sale of gas and third party is a nice balance. Our focus continues to be on sale of gas, but we certainly want to take advantage of all the good third-party business available to us. The sale of gas project proposal pipeline still has some momentum driven primarily by petrochemical activity in the U.S. but also in Asia. 
Some milestones during the quarter. We deployed $1 billion to shareholders between dividends and share buybacks. We completed our squeeze out of the remaining shareholders of Linde AG. We closed on our South Korea divestiture and have reached agreement on one of the Indian divestitures. We now expect the value of our Asia divestitures to be in excess of $1.7 billion, which is higher than originally anticipated. 
We are making good progress on our cost synergies and restructuring initiatives. As expected, the time line is more extended in regions like Europe, where we need to engage the works councils on our restructuring plans. Having said that, discussions continue to be constructive. 
Integration is going well: The organization is set. Voluntary turnover remains at low levels. There is a high degree of energy and collaboration. The organization is adapting well to an accelerated, operating rhythm. We have early wins we can point to in practically every area. There is a strong pool for best practices, technology and client capabilities. In short, the organization is excited about the potential for our new company. 
Regarding the macro going forward, I'm sure you're going to think I'm too cautious, too pessimistic. Maybe I am but this is a scenario that can easily play out. Let's start with Asia. Though a good result in Q2, I see more tepid volume growth going forward. China growth is slowing. The key PMI indicators are sliding. IP has been trending down, and key metrics, such as electricity consumed for industrial of production was only 0.5% higher in May. And for the entire economy, electrical consumption was barely over 2%. China is slowing and so is the rest of Asia. The good news is project start-ups will provide some nice lift for us beginning next year. 
Europe. I see weakness across the Eurozone. Industrial production for June was negative 1.3% year-over-year. The fact we serve diverse end markets mitigates against this impact, and we had a good self-help story. But the macro headwinds are clear. 
The Americas. Solid quarter in Q2 as pricing and merchant volume growth buoyed results. However, cylinder gases volumes, which primarily serve metal fabrication markets, flatlined in Q2 as hardgoods turned negative. However, pricing continues to be a good story here. After a sluggish start on the year due to a shortage of Venezuela crude, hydrogen volumes are improving as refiners take advantage of favorable margin spreads. Overall, we expect slowing growth with solid price attainment for the remainder of the year. 
Obviously, if the underlying global economy does well, we will do well. If it falters, we still have a resilient business model and a strong self-help story to sustain performance. My priorities going forward: best-in-class safety, compliance, sustainability and diversity, driving a successful integration and building a high-performance culture, synergy attainment, cost, CapEx and growth, and implementing best-in-class price management systems and a robust productivity initiative. 
And now I will turn it over to Matt."

Slide 3 provides the second quarter adjusted pro forma results.

Slide 3 provides the second quarter adjusted pro forma results. As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in 2 ways: First, they are pro forma, which means periods are restated to assume an effective merger date of January 1, 2018, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures. Second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and merger and restructuring-related costs. We believe this format best represents the underlying trends and performance of the combined business. Sales of $7.2 billion are flat with prior year but up 4% sequentially from the first quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced sales by 4% from 2018 and 1% from the first quarter. While the U.S. dollar has strengthened to almost every global currency, the major contributors are the Chinese RMB, euro, British pound and Australian dollar. Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales increased 4% from the prior year and 5% from Q1. 
Versus the prior year, we continue to see positive pricing, which is in line with globally weighted inflation of 2.5%. Volumes are also up 2% as project contributions and growth in Asia and U.S. are partially offset by softer conditions across EMEA and South Pacific. Sequentially, volumes are up 4%, primarily due to seasonal effects and higher project billings in engineering. And price increased 1%. As Steve mentioned, price management continues to be an area of intense focus throughout the organization. 
Operating profit of $1.3 billion improved 6% over prior year and 8% from Q1, and when excluding FX, up 10% and 9%, respectively. Operating margin expanded to 18.4% versus 17.4% in 2018 and 17.7% in the first quarter. Sequentially, we expanded operating margin by 70 basis points as we made good progress toward achieving the stated cost synergies. At this point, we are on track to reach the full annual run rate of $300 million by the end of this quarter, consistent with our merger commitment. 
Aside from the cost synergies, initiatives continue toward identifying and executing further value-creating opportunities in revenue and cost efficiencies. EPS of $1.83 improved 12% from last year or 16% when excluding impacts from foreign currency. The leverage improvement over operating margin is primarily due to lower interest expense, lower tax rate and less shares outstanding. I anticipate net interest to steadily increase each quarter as we deploy the divestiture proceeds and, thus, increase our debt levels. However, effective tax rate should remain around 24% for the full year and share count should steadily decline with the repurchase program activity. 
When comparing to the first quarter, you can see that net income growth of 8% is consistent with the operating profit growth, as interest and tax levels were stable with a moderate decline in share count. Note that EBITDA sequential growth of 3% is slightly less as we further align the presentation format, resulting in a minor reclass between cost lines with no effect to operating profit. 
On top of delivering solid financial results this quarter, the Linde team secured additional future growth by expanding the sale of gas project backlog to $4.7 billion. As a reminder, this backlog represents estimated CapEx spend for customer projects under construction and secured by long-term contracts that lead to incremental sales and earnings growth. The increase from last quarter is due to the inclusion of a recently signed contract in Singapore partially offset by smaller start-ups in Asia Pacific. 
In this quarter, we are also introducing a CapEx break down and return on capital metric. We intend to report these prospectively, so investors gain a better understanding of capital deployment and returns, 2 very critical metrics for this industry. The capital investments are broken into 2 categories: project CapEx, which represents spending for the sale of gas project backlog; and base CapEx, which represents everything else, such as replacement, maintenance, cost reduction or smaller growth CapEx that does not qualify for the project backlog. It's important to differentiate between these 2 categories since project CapEx is lumpy, with a high degree of certainty in returns, more akin to acquisitions; whereas base CapEx defines traditional uses, such as asset replacement and organic growth. Sequentially, you can see that project CapEx is up 21%, primarily from project timing and a rising backlog. Note that the $200 million CapEx synergy target will be achieved through better base CapEx efficiency and asset utilization and improved procurement for all capital spending. 
The return on capital metric represents a rolling average of after-tax profit divided by a capital base represented as net debt plus equity. The full reconciliation can be found in the appendix. Note that the initial 10.4% figure is fairly consistent with the average of the 2 predecessor companies prior to the merger. 
Second quarter ROC of 10.6% is up 20 basis points in the first quarter, primarily due to higher profit on a stable capital base. Net debt of $11 billion increased about $3 billion from last quarter as expected, primarily due to the $3.2 billion squeeze-out payment. Net debt should continue to rise over the next several quarters as we recapitalize the balance sheet to meet our single A target credit rating. 
Please turn to Slide 4 for an update on the full year guidance. Full year 2019 EPS estimate is in the range of $6.95 to $7.18, an increase of 12% to 16% from prior year or 15% to 19% when excluding 3% currency headwind. This range is 3% higher than last quarter due to faster synergy achievement in Q2 and more confidence in our self-help actions looking forward. However, we still anticipate softer volumes in the second half of the year as we are seeing more planned customer outages with demand softening in certain end markets, such as manufacturing. Furthermore, global industrial production levels are leveling out or declining across most countries,which could have negative effects on packaged and merchant volumes. Of course, this is just an assumption at this time, and actual conditions will likely vary. Rest assured, if conditions are better than anticipated, we will not miss any volume growth opportunities, given our breadth of coverage and contractual nature of this business. Also note that while we aren't providing quarterly guidance at this time, I would anticipate Q4 EPS to be slightly better than Q3, given synergy timing. 
In summary, if current volume levels remain stable or slightly improve, we would anticipate reaching the upper end or possibly above this guidance range. However, given the current economic environment, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious and manage the business accordingly. Despite these economic uncertainties, we have a unique foundation of synergy and efficiency opportunities, coupled with a secured, industry-leading project backlog to improve the business performance and quality. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And then the second question was on cash flow. I was wondering whether you could talk a little bit about the moving parts on the operating cash flow because it looks like the conversion worsened a little bit quarter-on-quarter, and I was wondering if you could explain what's driving that and also call off -- call out any one-offs or anything related to restructuring and other.

I'm going to take the pricing question, then I'm going to flip it over to Matt to answer the cash flow question. So regarding does pricing equal inflation, I would say in certain parts of the world, the answer is yes. You can see we averaged 2%. I don't know if our land in the Americas was 3%. We had certain businesses higher than that. And if you go around the world, there's kind of plus/minus around that number. I would say we still have some work to do in terms of making sure that all of our pricing actions at least offset the cost inflation that we've been seeing and will see going forward. 
So that work is not done. I said in my comments, it was one of my key priorities going forward to have a best-in-class price management system. That entails much more than just a price versus a cost inflation number. It's how you manage pricing, contracts, product management, all of that. Matt?"

And just to add one thing to Steve's, Nicola, that while we showed 2%, that was a fairly strong 2%.

And just to add one thing to Steve's, Nicola, that while we showed 2%, that was a fairly strong 2%. It just happened the way the rounding and footing work that shows us 2%, so as per the comments, that's pretty much right in line with the 2.5% globally weighted inflation. 
Regarding the cash flow, I think as you may have alluded to, I think the best way to probably look at this is what is the conversion rate of our adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow. And we talked a little bit about this in the first quarter as well. And I'll talk to the operating cash flow on a half basis, first half because as you can imagine, there's some parts that move between quarters. So when you look at historically the last 5 years of both predecessor companies, the first half of the year, you tended to see operating cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA at around 70%, 7-0. For the full year, that number was closer to maybe 77%. So as you could imagine, the back half is usually stronger, almost the mid-80s, and the front half is usually around 70%. So I think that's the benchmark we want to look at from a cash conversion ratio, if you want to refer to it that way. 
So looking at our particular numbers, as you know, our adjusted EBITDA for the first half is about $4 billion, and our current operating cash flow year-to-date is about $2.1 billion. So applying that 70%, that would mean we're looking for more like $2.8 billion versus the $2.1 billion, so about $0.7 billion short of where we'd want to be. 
So why are we, right? I think that's the question. $0.5 billion or $0.5 billion is all these one-off merger costs. We've got almost $400 million are related to either taxes on gains, costs to do the divestitures, merger cash costs that carried over and some change in control costs that triggered acceleration of retirement benefits. There's another $100 million of restructuring severance related. So those $0.5 billion are really one-off in nature, and that's something that will subside here in the next couple of quarters, especially the merger related, and we'll have a little bit more restructuring in the next probably 18 to 24 months. 
We've got $100 million what's called contract liabilities, and what that really relates to is last year, our engineering business had significant prepayments from their customer base, which is a good thing. That's them managing the working capital quite well, but we've lapped that. Now they are executing and building some of those projects so that's about $100 million of some unfavorable timing, but that is the nature an EPC-type business. 
 And the remaining $100 million is some working capital that, frankly, we got to get after. That's something we've got to do better on. We've got a lot of initiatives internally. We're working towards that. So that last $100 million is something that I'm personally focused on, Steve's focused on to kind of get back to the right levels. But I fully expect the second half numbers to start stepping up, especially as we lap a lot of these merger cash payments. And at this point, I see no reason why we're not going to demonstrate the legacy company average of the cash conversion rate from OCF to adjusted EBITDA."

Going forward, certainly the timing of start-ups says we're going to have a stronger 2020 over 2019, so here again, regardless of the macro environment, we do have a stronger backlog contribution in 2020. I would -- I'm looking at something more like a 2% contribution over '19 top and bottom. And then based on the strength of what we have going forward, I'd say probably, through a 2023 kind of time frame because I'm looking at a very big project start-up there, I would look for 2% kind of as an average annual growth rate, top and bottom, going forward. I think that's certainly in the cards. And again, that's compared to 1% this year. 
So if you think about kind of the sales algorithm going forward, we have the macro, the underlying macro very much driven by industrial production. I think that is kind of a more of a questionable number by the day. But on top of that, we expect price management contributions. On top of that, we expect backlog contributions. And at some point, we're going to start to see more noticeable effects from growth synergies. So that's the way we look at it."

But aside from that, I've looked at this before, we may have a few projects over a number years, principally in Southeast Asia. But in terms of what we see refiners do to get prepared for this, it looks to me like it's more a case of they have coker capacity or they're adding coker capacity. They're very comfortable operating cokers. They've been doing this for many, many years quite well. Some of them are looking towards more sweet crude feedstocks. Some of them aren't going to do anything. They're going to wait and see how it all plays out, so that's how I'd answer that."

The Americas with respect to industrial production, manufacturing has been trending down as well. And so I -- it's not like it's falling off a cliff but it certainly has been a noticeable trend.

Price management, you talked about price up in all regions. Would that be all key territories?

You mentioned Brexit. I guess there's not a tremendous amount you can do about a do-or-die Brexit. It's more about the customers. But what can you prepare for that? Because obviously, it impacts U.K. and continental Europe, pretty significantly. 
And the third point, probably for Matt. The base CapEx, Matt, is running about 7% of sales. Now Linde always had a much higher maintenance CapEx for various reasons, but one of which was mix and an almost cylinder army or all the cylinders they had. Anyway, they said that was one of the reasons they had much higher maintenance CapEx.

Peter, so I -- with respect to, let's say, markets that were unaffected by the merger, and you brought up Australia. Clearly there are others. We found, if I go back in my Praxair days, that we had certain geographies that did a good job with price management, and you can spend a day with them and see they really understood what was going on in the marketplace, what was going on with cost, what was going on with supply and demand and things that needed -- they needed to do to address that. 
And so the whole idea is to make sure that we bring that same rigor, that same discipline, that same competency, that same organizational approach to every corner of the globe. And we have had -- I've had those reviews with Australia. You mentioned Australia, and this is something they have been working on ever since the merger. I expect to see positive results, not only out of Australia but out of many other countries around the world as we continue to build that muscle. 
With respect to Brexit, the deindustrialization of the U.K. has been going on for a long time, so Brexit is not the point where that starts to happen. So clearly, that's an effect that we have been feeling for a long time in the U.K. What I think the team has done a great job of and will continue to do a great job of is building out resilient markets, more growth in resilient markets. And I'm thinking of health care, I'm thinking of food and beverage, I'm thinking of a myriad of applications that they have been bringing to the marketplace. So that very much has dampened the effect of the deindustrialization trend. And so I don't expect a big change coming out of Brexit. I certainly don't expect positive growth going forward as a result, but I certainly don't expect a big change.

Obviously, our base CapEx, as we defined it here, does include small growth. And that can also mean ECOVAR or VPSAs standard plants, as legacy Praxair called them. So to have an apples-to-apples comparison may not be the same across the industry. 
But to your point when I look at legacy Praxair that had reported this now, we were on a $750 million to $800 million-type year run rate. So just thinking of that in simple terms, if you double that, that would be around $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion a year, if you felt the company size doubled. Right now, the run rate on Q2 is about $1.8 billion. Of the $200 million of CapEx synergies, a large portion of that would be dedicated to this area. This is an area that's getting a lot of focus. You saw sequentially, we had a little bit of a decline, but this is something we're going to keep working at. We tend not to look it as a percentage of sales. More really, it's a detailed bottoms-up how we look at that internally, what projects we need. 
But I can tell you reliability, as you know, is critical in this industry. That's not something we're going to compromise. But when we look at the other growth or small growth initiatives on things like cylinders, trailers, tanks, given the economic outlook we laid out, that's an area I would see probably less spending going forward. Those spend tend to correlate more to IP. So this is kind of how we'll look at it. But clearly, the CapEx synergies of $200 million, this base CapEx is going to be an area of intense focus."

So if you go back over a period of time, you would see our price gains have been there year-over-year. You also have to take into consideration that we have -- every competitor has a bit of a different mix. If I look at Europe, we're half packaged gases. So the ability to move through pricing very much is through I don't know how many -- probably a million transactions or so through those small welders. So that is the mix that we have there. 
If we look at Asia, obviously, our mix is a bit different than some of our competitors. We have Australia, which is a very large piece. Australia and China are the 2 largest countries that we have that represent Asia. If I look down beneath the covers, which I think is always important because you've got to keep in mind what we're reporting is an aggregated number. But I can look at China merchant price, and it's 5% year-over-year. So that number is very strong. Again, we've got some work to do across the board to bring everything up to an expectation that we would have. If I were to look at the Americas for example, 3% number, but U.S. merchant is 6%, South America is 5%, packaged is 3%. And then if I were to look at Europe, I'd say it's pretty much -- a pretty strong 2% kind of price increase number. 
But again, it's very much affected by what's going on in mix. And I'll give you another small example of that. If I look at our small business called refrigerants, that number is off quite a bit, and so -- year-over-year. So that all kind of fits into the calculation, but it's quite -- quite a bit's driven by mix.

I think having capabilities around the olefin crackers, there's certain examples that has led to pull-through of ASUs and other industrial gas products as a result of having that upfront project. 
Clearly, when you're talking about ethane crackers and natural gas plants, the level of -- the level at which you engage the customer is higher, because clearly, there is an interest at the highest levels of the organization with our customers in terms of talking to us about those kinds of projects, because they're very critical to their processes. 
So those are certainly positives that I can point to. I can also look at natural gas processing capability and point to where that is a good source of helium, which has been in short supply, continues to be in short supply. So having that upstream capability puts us in a very positive position with respect to capturing helium off of that process. So that's how I would address that."

So I think I'd have to look at that in term of where it's going to actually materialize with respect to what it would do. My view is we would still deliver some positive pricing even if it fell to a level like that.

So throughout that time frame, currencies go up and down. And to account for that, we always embed in our financial analyses a sovereign and currency risk in every country we operate in. So we essentially mandate that the return can recover the known risks within those contracts. And obviously, if you can get upwards of 100% inflation coverage in your escalation, that has a natural balance on devaluations. Because usually, after a devaluation, inflation follows. So these are the mechanisms that we do to recover. Compound inflation on a local basis can often exceed the effects of the foreign currency translation over that same time period. So these are all mechanisms you do when contracting to ensure you get an appropriate return inflation coverage to mitigate against that. 
As far as the actual execution itself in procuring equipment, whether it's turbomachinery in Europe or coal boxes in China, et cetera, we may or may not use derivatives on that 1-year, 2-year invoicing exposure. That would be translational -- or transactional, I'm sorry, to your point. So that's more of a derivative decision. But long range, we feel we have very strong contractual and return requirements to offset that.

So when hardgoods turns negative, and in this case, you see less large equipment, large welding equipment being ordered and so forth, it just says that your customers are becoming more cautious about the outlook going forward. And typically, that would be the first sign. Then you start to see the consumables slow along with the gas volumes. So it's not like it fell 30%. So if you go back in 2009, that's what we saw in the United States. Hardgoods fell 30%. But it did fell to negative territory, which says that it's certainly not a positive indication with respect to growth rates going forward. Not falling off a cliff but it does signal a weakening trend. 
Again, I think about cylinder gases as very much tied to industrial production, and I made mention the fact that in Europe, half of our business is packaged gases, so that's very much tied to the manufacturing economy, and you can look at the trends with respect to the Eurozone, with respect to more negative trends on industrial production. 
And I anticipate the same thing as I look across Asia, that the trend for industrial production has been walking down. The PMI indicators for metals, chemicals has been walking down and, therefore, that just signifies to me that there's going to be some weakness ahead. Manufacturing certainly is weaker in China than it has been. And so therefore, that has a big effect on cylinder gases. But not just cylinder gases. Other products as well."

If I look at the types of projects that we're working on today, it tells me that there's still a lot of room to go in places like the U.S. Gulf Coast, a lot of chemical activity, but also refinery activity still continues to be very positive. 
So the outlook, certainly with respect to the U.S. Gulf Coast, I think is going to be positive and again, more driven by natural gas than anything else. We talked a little bit about the impact of IMO 2020, and there is some impact. Clearly, that's the big Singapore project that we talked about. And there are some other projects that we're working on in Asia, both on the refinery side and also on the chemicals side, not massive, but I think could be significant as we go forward overall in the backlog. So I think it's still pretty positive environment, particularly if you look at the U.S. Gulf Coast."

We saw operating profit and operating profit margins improve both sequentially and year-over-year in every segment. EPS improved substantially year-over-year and sequentially. Cash flow came through nicely as we had expected. Project CapEx grew while base CapEx shrank, which reflects spend against our large project backlog and CapEx efficiencies. ROC percent, the single most important metric in a capital-intensive business, continue to improve. The cell gas backlog remained strong at $5 billion, which gives us a nice foundation for future growth. 
We raised our guidance again, which reflects our positive momentum the opportunities we see to continue to improve the quality of our business and the resiliency of our business model. And of course, this is against a backdrop of softening worldwide demand. 
A few comments on the segments. In the Americas, which represents nearly 40% of our total sales and nearly half of our overall operating profit, we saw good organic sales year-over-year, driven by price, but flat sales sequentially. Strength in food and beverage and health care is offsetting weakness in metals and manufacturing. 
Operating margins continued to improve as we drive efficiencies across the region. In Europe, we saw evidence of better execution as operating margins reached 20.5% despite a weaker macro. The weakness we saw in the quarter continued through September and October. 
In APAC, operating margins are climbing nicely, up 450 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially as the team continues to do an excellent job delivering on merger efficiencies. Volumes are impacted by a slowing China, Australia and turnarounds in Southeast Asia. 
In Linde Engineering, we saw record margins, driven by excellent execution, cost absorption and timing as we're able to close out key projects during the quarter. Though backlogs remained strong, I don't see this level of operating margin as sustainable. This is a business that should trend closer to low double-digit percent through the cycle. 
The Global -- the Global Other segment reflects ongoing merger efficiencies, as you would expect. Our focus, successful integration improved the quality of each and every business, optimized our portfolio around core sale of gas regions and businesses, and then drive network density, facilitate growth synergies and drive operational excellence in everything we do. 
Final comment before I turn it over to Matt. We have a resilient business model, which generates strong cash flow through the economic cycle. In periods of expansion, we invest for growth. And when the macro weakens, we return that cash to shareholders. You add to that the value created by our merger, and you can see why we are an investment for all seasons and why I wouldn't trade places with anyone. Matt?"
318049,639938793,1862243,"Linde plc, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2019",2019-11-12,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted pro forma results are shown on Slide 3. Consistent with prior quarters, these figures have been adjusted to best demonstrate underlying trends and performance of the combined business. Yo",1120,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted pro forma results are shown on Slide 3. 
Consistent with prior quarters, these figures have been adjusted to best demonstrate underlying trends and performance of the combined business. You'll find the required reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the appendix. 
Sales of $7 billion are 1% higher than prior year but 3% below the second quarter of this year. Foreign currency translation continues to be a headwind as the U.S. dollar strengthened across the board. Excluding FX and cost pass-through, underlying sales increased 4% from 2018, but decreased 1% sequentially. Versus prior year, prices rose 2%, and the 2% volume increase was split between organic growth and project contribution. While the more resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continue to grow, we are seeing declining to negative growth rates across most industrial markets, especially metals and manufacturing. 
The slowing industrial activity is primarily driven by North America, China and Australia, which is consistent with our expectations. Versus the second quarter of this year, price increased 1% from broad-based actions, but volume declined 2% from engineering project timing and some seasonality and weaker industrial activity in EMEA. 
Despite the softening economic conditions, operating profit grew 16% versus prior year and 5% sequentially, or 19% and 6% when excluding currency translation. The combination of price attainment and cost efficiencies across all segments enabling operating margins to expand 270 basis points versus 2018 and 140 basis points versus Q2. 
The company reached 19.8% operating margin this quarter as employees around the world continue to coordinate efforts to improve productivity and operational excellence. 
Net income increased 24% from prior year or 27% when excluding FX translation. The reason for greater profit leverage is due to lower net interest expense from a combination of excess cash flow and FX impact. 
As stated before, we are recapitalizing the balance sheet to better align with our target single A credit rating, but this will take a little more time as we refine our cash forecasting. Until then, we are actively deploying excess cash and managing the capital structure to deliver value to the shareholders. 
EPS of $1.94 was 26% higher than prior year and 6% higher sequentially. Excluding FX, those figures improved to 29% and 7%, respectively. This result is somewhat higher than anticipated since favorable impact from cost management actions more than offset worse-than-expected FX rates. 
In addition to delivering strong profit leverage this quarter, a large majority of earnings pulled through to cash as operating cash flow increased 86% sequentially to $1.9 billion. While we would normally expect some seasonal improvement, most of this sequential increase is driven by better working capital management along with higher EBITDA and less merger-related outflows. 
CapEx increased 11% from Q2. But you can see that was driven by project CapEx, which represents customer projects under construction and secured by long-term contracts that lead to incremental growth. The sale of gas backlog associated with project CapEx remains strong at $4.7 billion and will be executed over the next 3 years, although that spend pattern will be somewhat lumpy. 
Base CapEx, which represents all other capital spend not associated with our project backlog, such as small growth, cost reduction and maintenance, declined 7% sequentially as we continue to find more opportunities for cash synergies. Rolling this all together results in a return on capital of 11.2% or a 60 basis point sequential increase. This improvement is driven by higher after-tax profit over a capital base that declined due to prudent cash management across the organization. 
We firmly believe that return on capital is one of the most important metrics for this industry in light of the capital intensity and long-term contractual structure. Given this cash and capital trends felt it may be helpful to provide a little more detail, which you can find on Slide 4. 
The left side shows operating cash flow trends by quarter. The first 2 quarters were each around $1 billion, but subsequently increased to almost $1.9 billion in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the key drivers include declining merger-related outflows, higher earnings and better working capital performance. 
In addition, the first half tends to be seasonally lower from timing of cash incentives and taxes. The year-to-date figure of $3.9 billion includes $0.7 billion of onetime merger-related outflows. This $0.7 billion primarily relates to taxes and fees, which supported $11 billion of divestiture proceeds, in addition to legal and adviser payments. These merger outflows will be significantly lower in 2020. 
The pie chart in the lower right represents how the year-to-date operating cash flow has been allocated. 
Overall, it's a balanced approach, with roughly half invested in the business and half returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Of the half invested in the business, it's evenly split between investments in secured growth and base CapEx. 
Secured growth represents accretive acquisitions and project CapEx for the backlog. Base CapEx is important to support nonbacklog growth, achieve cost reduction targets and maintain high levels of plant safety, reliability and efficiency. 
Overall, the priority is to invest in high quality projects, growth projects that meet our investment criteria while continuously generating excess free cash flow to distribute back to shareholders. Please turn to Slide 5 for an update on full year guidance. 
We are raising full year EPS guidance to $7.25 to $7.30, which represents an increase of 17% to 18% from prior year or 21% to 22% when excluding 4% currency headwind. The guidance is above last quarter due to favorable Q3 results and continued confidence and opportunities to improve the cost structure. However, this range also implies that Q4 EPS will be below the $1.94 from Q3. Part of the sequential decline relates to the timing of project completions for the engineering business. 
Engineering is a long-cycle business with projects that take several years. So the quarter-to-quarter results can vary, but we fully expect to maintain high levels of execution. 
Another driver of the anticipated Q3 to Q4 decline relates to projections of a weaker macro. Lower manufacturing levels and longer customer outages continue to point to decreasing industrial activity. 
In summary, despite the macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to improve the quality of the business and grow earnings double-digit percent over last year. This is only possible from the collective efforts of all 80,000 employees executing as one team. And while geopolitical forces will likely result in more uncertainty 2020 and beyond, we maintain a high degree of confidence in our ability to leverage opportunities that not only overcome these challenges, but will also create substantial value for our owners. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

I think from a share buyback perspective, I'd say little to no effect. That's not really having any effect. In fact, I would say we were probably a little bit behind on our program in the last quarter. So that's really not having much of an effect. 
But the offset to that will be slightly better interest. So I would think about interest and buyback really is kind of offsetting each other as I have favorable interest, I'll be behind in a buyback program. But as I work towards a single A, then I'll probably have a lower share count. 
FX definitely had a negative effect. When we looked and gave guidance a quarter ago, I would say the FX got worse by 1% to almost 2% than what we had anticipated. We'll have to see what it means going forward. But that is something that got a little worse as the dollar strengthened pretty much across the board. 
As far as the grove, I think the easier way to probably think about it is sequentially. As we mentioned, thinking about Q3 to Q4. At this stage, this guidance implies probably about 1% kind of erosion on base volumes. We'll have to see if that occurs or not. Obviously, anything better than that should be upside.

I think the challenge on looking solely at pro forma, not pro forma adjusted is that all of the effects of purchase accounting are going to be in those results. And as you can imagine, we had to step up the inventory as part of purchase accounting, which will have a disproportionate effect on COGS in the beginning, and then that would rapidly decline. So there are lots of different lives of assets that had to be stepped up that are anywhere from month to infinite life. 
So pro forma, as you know, under Article 11 SEC, still has all purchase price accounting effects in it. So that's why we think looking solely at pro forma is going to be a bit tricky because of the purchase price accounting effects. And what I still firmly believe is the numbers that we represented here on a pro forma adjusted best represent. And as we stated in the last call, we fully believe we're on full track now. 
Obviously, as you can see in the results, we did do a little better than expected on costing. I think timing was a little more favorable than we anticipated.

But Jeff, when you look at where we are today, there's very little contribution from large projects in those numbers. And it so happens, if you go look at the sell of gas backlog, Asia represents nearly 3 billion of that backlog. So we have some very large projects and some large contributions ahead. And I think if you look at the industry, whenever one of us reports that there's a big number, usually, it has something to do with a large project or projects. And as the case is today, we just don't have that contribution. It's just a question of timing. Again, the backlog is ahead of us. 
If I look at the long-term trends of a place like Asia Pacific, clearly, electronics is going to be strong going forward. I've already talked about the backlog. I think as these emerging markets develop, the applications that both legacy companies have brought to the combined company are going to have a positive effect. The pricing equation is something that we look at very carefully and continue to work regarding other parts of the world, we look at many things. But then again, it all has to pass the screen of is this a strategic geography? Is this a geography that we think we can build the density COGS? Our strategy is all about focusing on core geographies that we can build network density. 
And then as we look at individual projects, there's a risk versus return assessment that we go through very thoroughly, and it has to pass that screen as well. So that's all answer to that question."

I think it's a bit of a consistent with what I'd mentioned to Jeff. So as you can imagine, in purchase price accounting, you are required to assign valuations across a whole spread of different assets that have various lives. So there are a significant portion that is assigned to shorter live inventory. And as those fall off, you have a significant amortization and then they obviously are go through your cost of goods and then they're sold. So any inventory would have fallen off in the first to second quarter and you would have a larger amount of recognition and amortization. As the years go on and you start losing more of the shorter lives, the amortization number will continue to decline. So that is a normal pattern in any type of GAAP purchase price accounted effect that your amortization is at its peak at the beginning and then it rapidly declines on short-lived assets, such as inventory, software, things that might be 3-year life, 5-year life vehicles and then over time, you get into machinery buildings that get to 10, 20 years. So this is a normal pattern of any kind of amortization. 
But again, back to my earlier point, this is why we wanted to focus on adjusted figures because this amortization can create a lot of confusion and it's really noncash. And given our scenario was a merger of equals, there really was no capital component of this merger. So that's why we really are focusing on the adjusted figures. 
As far as the operating cash flow, just to make sure you understand. Any disposable proceeds gains are part of divestitures, which relates to investing cash flow, not operating cash flow. So there would be none of those gains related. In fact, it's the opposite what happens the gain is in your P&L. It is completely wiped out in your operating cash flow to make it a 0 effect, and then the full proceeds are put in investing cash flow. That's how GAAP accounting works. 
Our cash flow statements are per GAAP accounting. So hopefully, that answer makes sense."

I think from my perspective, right now, probably the best way to think about is on a year-to-date basis, we're at 3.9. And within that, are these $700 million of merger-related costs.

And within that, are these $700 million of merger-related costs. And as I mentioned in the transcript, that's going to drastically fall off in 2020. It will be quite small. There'll be a little bit of hangover of our final divestitures, which will be pretty minimal. And then there'll just be some ongoing cash restructuring, which should be fairly small to achieve the synergies. 
So the way I would think about it is if you take that 3.9 and add back almost all of that 0.7, you could say 0.6, somewhere in that neighborhood, you're looking at mid-4s is where we probably should be on a normal ongoing basis through 3 quarters. I do think the seasonality was a little overly skewed in this first half, partly because of the merger outflows, partly also because of the 2 legacy companies having independent compensation schemes that paid out in the beginning of the quarter. Going forward, we'll have one compensation scheme, so that should also help reduce some of that component. 
But I would still think about it, as I've mentioned in earlier calls, just to think about EBITDA kind of an OCF as a relationship, so what is your OCF as a percent of EBITDA. And as you may recall, we've said in prior calls that you look at the 5-year average, the 2 legacy companies and it's high 70s, and that's something we absolutely expect to continue to deliver on. 
And when you look at year-to-date, if you adjust for the merger outflows through 3 quarters, we're a little bit ahead of that. We're probably a couple of percent ahead of that number right now. So that's how we think about it. But I still think we should be continuously, on a full year basis, converting at least 3 quarters or more of our EBITDA into operating cash flow. And then obviously, any areas where we could enhance that through working capital management, dividends from nonconsolidated affiliates or other areas above and beyond EBITDA, we're going to continue to work towards that."

And there's a list of things that I'm looking at, and a couple of them do pertain to the cost of carbon, CO2 capture. And I think those are going to be opportunities that are going to grow going forward. It really has to be a function of legislation. You've heard about this 45 Q, which is an IRS ruling that provides a credit. For CO2, the credit grows over time. I think that's certainly a step in the right direction, is creating some interest. But if you look around the world, those are the types of things that we're seeing, and I think it's going to be an opportunity for growth going forward."

So the first question, I mean, clearly, we've had a focus on improving operating margins across the board, not just EMEA, but everywhere. And again, it's a country by country, it's a business by business look, it's a product-by-product look. Pricing clearly is a piece of that. We have been taking the appropriate cost actions in Europe. We will continue to do that because, quite frankly, the macro environment is not that favorable today. And so it's something that we need to do. 
And as it relates to people, this is a discussion that we have to have and want to have at a European works council level and also at the local works councils. And so those discussions are sort of ongoing, and they will continue. But we clearly look at Europe as an opportunity to continue to expand operating margins, and that is our intention. Part of that is looking at certain businesses that really don't belong in the portfolio. 
And if you go back to my earlier comment about optimizing the portfolio, and that gets to your  second question. We have gone through that. We just did -- concluded a bottoms-up review that we happen to review with our Board of Directors as well in October. And we have a list of, I'll call it, countries and also businesses that we think we need to take action on, how do we come to that conclusion. We look at the risk of being in some of these businesses and countries. We look at the quality of the business. We look at opportunities to scale it up and build density, and then that really drives our evaluation. But we do have a list that we're working on, as we speak. And then there's another list that we are monitoring, evaluating, watching and may lead to some action later on. 
But we are clearly -- that's clearly something that we're focused on."

If you look at in terms of, let's say, let's start with conventional production of hydrogen through steam methane reforming, CO2 is a byproduct of that. When we structure our contracts with our customers who want that hydrogen, if there is a cost of CO2 that is passed through contractually to the customer. So I don't see that, particularly as a risk for us. Now having said that, we do look at means and technologies to reduce the CO2 emissions. And there are technologies that exist that we will be implementing that will allow us to do that. 
In terms of the opportunity aspect of that, we are seeing examples where people are asking us to look at CO2 capture products. And that provides an additional opportunity for us. So that's the opportunity side of it. 
With respect to syngas, clearly, syngas has a certain composition of Hydrogen & Co. Syngas opportunities are more driven by the chemical tempale industry downstream chemical products. And there are some CO2 emissions as part of that process, but there's an opportunity to bring the CO2 back into the feed and produce more CO and emit less emissions. So that is a technology that we have and something that we're looking to deploy more and more."

Well I think about what I -- what we have said is that we want to do all good third-party projects that are out there. And it so happens that Linde Engineering has a very strong track record of executing very complex projects. And that is the reason why we were as successful as we were with a project like ExxonMobil, where ExxonMobil had confidence in line engineers capabilities to execute a project like that. So we want to do all the good third-party business that's out there, and there certainly are some opportunities that are in front of us today we want to capitalize on. By the same token, we want to do all the good sell of gas projects that we can find. And we truly believe that between our product line capability, Linde legacy's product line capability. We have a full complement of every plant product line that we could ever want. And we want to utilize the engineering and technology skills when the engineering brings to be more competitive and over the fence projects, more traditional over the fence projects. And also look at opportunities to kind of broaden our sell of gas footprint as the opportunities arise. 
So I think probably something on the order of 50-50 is a good place to be with respect to third party sales and sell a gas. Again, it will be kind of a function of the opportunities in front of us. But everybody understands in the company that the sell of gas is the sweet spot of the industry. It's where we want to focus and we're making good progress with that objective."

So it just so happened there were quite a few group together. They're all now pretty much out of turnaround. So they're all running and refining capacity utilization is quite high, and the 3 2 1 crack spreads are favorable. So they want to run at this point. I think, generally speaking, though, whenever you have weakening demand, a weakening macro, what we tend to see are more shutdowns. And you can call them planned, unplanned, I don't really know how you want to characterize it, but we tend to see more companies start to take shutdowns, and that's demand related, for sure. Sometimes it's pricing related, their pricing. So I think that's just kind of something you should expect when you're in a really a weaker environment overall globally. 
And I would like to be able to say, we're in all these turnarounds in Q3. They're all back up and running. Therefore, that's additive going forward.

IP and GDP have been trending down over time. Automotive has not returned anywhere near its levels. Steel, PMI index has been in the mid-40s. The only thing keeping that going is infrastructure spend. Chemicals are probably -- it's probably one of the more stable parts of the market that's got in the low 50s from a PMI standpoint.

We saw operating profit and operating profit margins improve both sequentially and year-over-year in every segment. EPS improved substantially year-over-year and sequentially. Cash flow came through nicely as we had expected. Project CapEx grew while base CapEx shrank, which reflects spend against our large project backlog and CapEx efficiencies. ROC percent, the single most important metric in a capital-intensive business, continue to improve. The sale of gas backlog remained strong at $5 billion, which gives us a nice foundation for future growth. 
We raised our guidance again, which reflects our positive momentum, the opportunities we see to continue to improve the quality of our business and the resiliency of our business model. And of course, this is against a backdrop of softening worldwide demand. 
A few comments on the segments. In the Americas, which represents nearly 40% of our total sales and nearly half of our overall operating profit, we saw good organic sales year-over-year, driven by price, but flat sales sequentially. Strength in food and beverage and health care is offsetting weakness in metals and manufacturing. 
Operating margins continued to improve as we drive efficiencies across the region. In Europe, we saw evidence of better execution as operating margins reached 20.5% despite a weaker macro. The weakness we saw in the quarter continued through September and October. 
In APAC, operating margins are climbing nicely, up 450 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially as the team continues to do an excellent job delivering on merger efficiencies. Volumes are impacted by a slowing China, Australia and turnarounds in Southeast Asia. 
In Linde Engineering, we saw record margins, driven by excellent execution, cost absorption and timing as we're able to close out key projects during the quarter. Though backlogs remained strong, I don't see this level of operating margin as sustainable. This is a business that should trend closer to low double-digit percents through the cycle. 
The global other segment reflects ongoing merger efficiencies, as you would expect. Our focus, successful integration, improve the quality of each and every business, optimize our portfolio around core sale of gas regions and businesses, and then drive network density, facilitate growth synergies and drive operational excellence in everything we do. 
Final comment before I turn it over to Matt. We have a resilient business model, which generates strong cash flow through the economic cycle. In periods of expansion, we invest for growth. And when the macro weakens, we return that cash to shareholders. You add to that the value created by our merger and you can see why we are an investment for all seasons and why I wouldn't trade places with anyone. Matt?"
318049,639938793,1862617,"Linde plc, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2019",2019-11-12,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted pro forma results are shown on Slide 3. Consistent with prior quarters, these figures have been adjusted to best demonstrate underlying trends and performance of the combined business. Yo",1119,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted pro forma results are shown on Slide 3. 
Consistent with prior quarters, these figures have been adjusted to best demonstrate underlying trends and performance of the combined business. You'll find the required reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the appendix. 
Sales of $7 billion are 1% higher than prior year but 3% below the second quarter of this year. Foreign currency translation continues to be a headwind as the U.S. dollar strengthened across the board. Excluding FX and cost pass-through, underlying sales increased 4% from 2018, but decreased 1% sequentially. Versus prior year, prices rose 2%, and the 2% volume increase was split between organic growth and project contribution. While the more resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continue to grow, we are seeing declining to negative growth rates across most industrial markets, especially metals and manufacturing. 
The slowing industrial activity is primarily driven by North America, China and Australia, which is consistent with our expectations. Versus the second quarter of this year, price increased 1% from broad-based actions, but volume declined 2% from engineering project timing and some seasonality and weaker industrial activity in EMEA. 
Despite the softening economic conditions, operating profit grew 16% versus prior year and 5% sequentially, or 19% and 6% when excluding currency translation. The combination of price attainment and cost efficiencies across all segments enabling operating margins to expand 270 basis points versus 2018 and 140 basis points versus Q2. 
The company reached 19.8% operating margin this quarter as employees around the world continue to coordinate efforts to improve productivity and operational excellence. 
Net income increased 24% from prior year or 27% when excluding FX translation. The reason for greater profit leverage is due to lower net interest expense from a combination of excess cash flow and FX impact. 
As stated before, we are recapitalizing the balance sheet to better align with our target single A credit rating, but this will take a little more time as we refine our cash forecasting. Until then, we are actively deploying excess cash and managing the capital structure to deliver value to the shareholders. 
EPS of $1.94 was 26% higher than prior year and 6% higher sequentially. Excluding FX, those figures improved to 29% and 7%, respectively. This result is somewhat higher than anticipated since favorable impact from cost management actions more than offset worse-than-expected FX rates. 
In addition to delivering strong profit leverage this quarter, a large majority of earnings pulled through to cash as operating cash flow increased 86% sequentially to $1.9 billion. While we would normally expect some seasonal improvement, most of this sequential increase is driven by better working capital management along with higher EBITDA and less merger-related outflows. 
CapEx increased 11% from Q2. But you can see that was driven by project CapEx, which represents customer projects under construction and secured by long-term contracts that lead to incremental growth. The sale of gas backlog associated with project CapEx remains strong at $4.7 billion and will be executed over the next 3 years, although that spend pattern will be somewhat lumpy. 
Base CapEx, which represents all other capital spend not associated with our project backlog, such as small growth, cost reduction and maintenance, declined 7% sequentially as we continue to find more opportunities for cash synergies. Rolling this all together results in a return on capital of 11.2% or a 60 basis point sequential increase. This improvement is driven by higher after-tax profit over a capital base that declined due to prudent cash management across the organization. 
We firmly believe that return on capital is one of the most important metrics for this industry in light of the capital intensity and long-term contractual structure. Given this cash and capital trends felt it may be helpful to provide a little more detail, which you can find on Slide 4. 
The left side shows operating cash flow trends by quarter. The first 2 quarters were each around $1 billion, but subsequently increased to almost $1.9 billion in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the key drivers include declining merger-related outflows, higher earnings and better working capital performance. 
In addition, the first half tends to be seasonally lower from timing of cash incentives and taxes. The year-to-date figure of $3.9 billion includes $0.7 billion of onetime merger-related outflows. This $0.7 billion primarily relates to taxes and fees, which supported $11 billion of divestiture proceeds, in addition to legal and adviser payments. These merger outflows will be significantly lower in 2020. 
The pie chart in the lower right represents how the year-to-date operating cash flow has been allocated. 
Overall, it's a balanced approach, with roughly half invested in the business and half returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Of the half invested in the business, it's evenly split between investments in secured growth and base CapEx. 
Secured growth represents accretive acquisitions and project CapEx for the backlog. Base CapEx is important to support nonbacklog growth, achieve cost reduction targets and maintain high levels of plant safety, reliability and efficiency. 
Overall, the priority is to invest in high-quality projects, growth projects that meet our investment criteria while continuously generating excess free cash flow to distribute back to shareholders. Please turn to Slide 5 for an update on full year guidance. 
We are raising full year EPS guidance to $7.25 to $7.30, which represents an increase of 17% to 18% from prior year or 21% to 22% when excluding 4% currency headwind. The guidance is above last quarter due to favorable Q3 results and continued confidence and opportunities to improve the cost structure. However, this range also implies that Q4 EPS will be below the $1.94 from Q3. Part of the sequential decline relates to the timing of project completions for the engineering business. 
Engineering is a long-cycle business with projects that take several years. So the quarter-to-quarter results can vary, but we fully expect to maintain high levels of execution. 
Another driver of the anticipated Q3 to Q4 decline relates to projections of a weaker macro. Lower manufacturing levels and longer customer outages continue to point to decreasing industrial activity. 
In summary, despite the macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to improve the quality of the business and grow earnings double-digit percent over last year. This is only possible from the collective efforts of all 80,000 employees executing as one team. And while geopolitical forces will likely result in more uncertainty 2020 and beyond, we maintain a high degree of confidence in our ability to leverage opportunities that not only overcome these challenges, but will also create substantial value for our owners. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

We have ongoing cost efficiencies. We have the impact of share buybacks, et cetera. So anything that happens on the volume line would be additive to that. 
But I think we have to be realistic based on the trends we're seeing, which are not particularly positive around the world. So that's why we frame -- or why I frame my view of going forward because I'm looking at trends that just aren't that positive."

And the strong backlog just gives us confidence that going forward into the next year, we're going to have that to work against and certainly into part of the following year. 
It will come a point where we're going to need to add new projects to sustain that level of profitability going forward."

I think from a share buyback perspective, I'd say little to no effect. That's not really having any effect. In fact, I would say we were probably a little bit behind on our program in the last quarter. So that's really not having much of an effect. 
But the offset to that will be slightly better interest. So I would think about interest and buyback really is kind of offsetting each other. As I have favorable interest, I'll be behind in a buyback program. But as I work towards a single A, then I'll probably have a lower share count. 
FX definitely had a negative effect. When we looked and gave guidance a quarter ago, I would say the FX got worse by 1% to almost 2% than what we had anticipated. We'll have to see what it means going forward. But that is something that got a little worse as the dollar strengthened pretty much across the board. 
As far as the growth, I think the easier way to probably think about it is sequentially, as we mentioned, thinking about Q3 to Q4. At this stage, this guidance implies probably about 1% kind of erosion on base volumes. We'll have to see if that occurs or not. Obviously, anything better than that should be upside. But right now, that's our assumption and we'll see what ultimately comes out."

I think the challenge on looking solely at pro forma, not pro forma adjusted, is that all of the effects of purchase accounting are going to be in those results. And as you can imagine, we had to step up the inventory as part of purchase accounting, which will have a disproportionate effect on COGS in the beginning, and then that would rapidly decline. So there are lots of different lives of assets that had to be stepped up that are anywhere from month to infinite life. 
So pro forma, as you know, under Article 11 SEC, still has all purchase price accounting effects in it. So that's why we think looking solely at pro forma is going to be a bit tricky because of the purchase price accounting effects. And what I still firmly believe is the numbers that we represented here on a pro forma adjusted best represent. And as we stated in the last call, we fully believe we're on full track now. 
Obviously, as you can see in the results, we did do a little better than expected on costing. I think timing was a little more favorable than we anticipated. But we are fully in line with the $900 million target that was given and the promise that was given at the $300 million per year. So we feel quite confident on that. And from here on out, everything we're looking for, just overall efficiencies and opportunities as one operating company."

China, certainly slowing growth, some turnarounds during the quarter that had some effect. But Jeff, when you look at where we are today, there's very little contribution from large projects in those numbers. And it so happens, if you go look at the sell of gas backlog, Asia represents nearly $3 billion of that backlog. So we have some very large projects and some large contributions ahead. And I think if you look at the industry, whenever one of us reports that there's a big number, usually, it has something to do with a large project or projects. And as the case is today, we just don't have that contribution. It's just a question of timing. Again, the backlog is ahead of us. 
If I look at the long-term trends of a place like Asia Pacific, clearly, electronics is going to be strong going forward. I've already talked about the backlog. I think as these emerging markets develop, the applications that both legacy companies have brought to the combined company are going to have a positive effect. The pricing equation is something that we look at very carefully and continue to work. Regarding other parts of the world, we look at many things. But then again, it all has to pass the screen of is this a strategic geography? Is this a geography that we think we can build the density? Because our strategy is all about focusing on core geographies that we can build network density. 
And then as we look at individual projects, there's a risk versus return assessment that we go through very thoroughly, and it has to pass that screen as well. So that's how I'd answer that question."

The PPA-related amortization charges dropped by 18% sequentially compared to Q2, while the euro has softened 5% only. Moreover, the other intangible assets in your balance sheet have been sequentially stable. Can you explain that massive change in the PPA amortization charges? 
And secondly, coming back to the operating cash flow. You mentioned higher EBITDA, better working capital and less merger-related outflows. But I see that you also had some disposal proceeds of $271 million. Are there any other funny items included in that cash flow figure?"

I think it's a bit of a -- consistent with what I'd mentioned to Jeff. So as you can imagine, in purchase price accounting, you are required to assign valuations across a whole spread of different assets that have various lives. S",360,"So we'll start with PPA. I think it's a bit of a -- consistent with what I'd mentioned to Jeff. So as you can imagine, in purchase price accounting, you are required to assign valuations across a whole spread of different assets that have various lives. So there are a significant portion that is assigned to shorter live inventory. And as those fall off, you have a significant amortization and then they obviously are go through your cost of goods and then they're sold. So any inventory would have fallen off in the first to second quarter and you would have a larger amount of recognition and amortization. As the years go on and you start losing more of the shorter lives, the amortization number will continue to decline. So that is a normal pattern in any type of GAAP purchase price accounted effect that your amortization is at its peak at the beginning and then it rapidly declines on short-lived assets such as inventory, software, things that might be 3-year life, 5-year life vehicles. And then over time, you get into machinery buildings that get to 10, 20 years. So this is a normal pattern of any kind of amortization. 
But again, back to my earlier point, this is why we wanted to focus on adjusted figures because this amortization can create a lot of confusion and it's really noncash. And given our scenario was a merger of equals, there really was no capital component of this merger. So that's why we really are focusing on the adjusted figures. 
As far as the operating cash flow, just to make sure you understand. Any disposable proceed gains are part of divestitures, which relates to investing cash flow, not operating cash flow. So there would be none of those gains related. In fact, it's the opposite. What happens, the gain is in your P&L. It is completely wiped out in your operating cash flow to make it a 0 effect, and then the full proceeds are put in investing cash flow. That's how GAAP accounting works. 
Our cash flow statements are per GAAP accounting. So hopefully, that answer makes sense."

I think from my perspective, right now, probably the best way to think about is on a year-to-date basis, we're at 3.9. And within that, are these $700 million of merger-related costs. And as I mentioned in the transcript, that's going to drast",368,"Yes, Duffy. I think from my perspective, right now, probably the best way to think about is on a year-to-date basis, we're at 3.9. And within that, are these $700 million of merger-related costs. And as I mentioned in the transcript, that's going to drastically fall off in 2020. It will be quite small. There'll be a little bit of hangover of our final divestitures, which will be pretty minimal. And then there'll just be some ongoing cash restructuring, which should be fairly small to achieve the synergies. 
So the way I would think about it is if you take that 3.9 and add back almost all of that 0.7, you could say 0.6, somewhere in that neighborhood, you're looking at mid-4s is where we probably should be on a normal ongoing basis through 3 quarters. I do think the seasonality was a little overly skewed in this first half, partly because of the merger outflows, partly also because of the 2 legacy companies having independent compensation schemes that paid out in the beginning of the quarter. Going forward, we'll have one compensation scheme, so that should also help reduce some of that component. 
But I would still think about it, as I've mentioned in earlier calls, just to think about EBITDA kind of an OCF as a relationship, so what is your OCF as a percent of EBITDA. And as you may recall, we've said in prior calls that you look at the 5-year average of the 2 legacy companies and it's high 70s, and that's something we absolutely expect to continue to deliver on. 
And when you look at year-to-date, if you adjust for the merger outflows through 3 quarters, we're a little bit ahead of that. We're probably a couple of percent ahead of that number right now. So that's how we think about it. But I still think we should be continuously, on a full year basis, converting at least 3 quarters or more of our EBITDA into operating cash flow. And then obviously, any areas where we could enhance that through working capital management, dividends from nonconsolidated affiliates or other areas above and beyond EBITDA, we're going to continue to work towards that."

With respect to the cost synergies, certainly, with the operating margin quality improving across the board, you could surmise that the synergies are taking hold. To be very honest, as I look at these numbers, I pay less attention to what's called a synergy cost savings and I'm just looking for improving the quality of our businesses across the board, which means better operating performance, cost productivity programs, efficiency programs, all the things that improve the overall quality of the business.

First of all, we've had a big focus on building out our CO2 infrastructure. We had seen over the years that that's a very important product to have for carbonated products for food freezing, for other applications. And so that's a focus we've had for several years, and I could look at the growth of our CO2 products in places like the United States, and it's growing very nicely, which would be consistent with our comments about growth in food and beverage. If I think about the price of carbon, that is -- we are seeing more projects today than we have seen in the last several years. And there's a list of things that I'm looking at and a couple of them do pertain to the cost of carbon, CO2 capture. And I think those are going to be opportunities that are going to grow going forward. It really has to be a function of legislation. You've heard about this 45Q, which is an IRS ruling that provides a credit. For CO2, the credit grows over time. I think that's certainly a step in the right direction, is creating some interest. But if you look around the world, those are the types of things that we're seeing, then I think it's going to be an opportunity for growth going forward."

We will continue to do that because, quite frankly, the macro environment is not that favorable today. And so it's something that we need to do. 
And as it relates to people, this is a discussion that we have to have and want to have at a European works council level and also at the local works councils. And so those discussions are sort of ongoing, and they will continue. But we clearly look at Europe as an opportunity to continue to expand operating margins, and that is our intention. Part of that is looking at certain businesses that really don't belong in the portfolio. 
And if you go back to my earlier comment about optimizing the portfolio, and that gets to your second question. We have gone through that. We just did -- concluded a bottoms-up review that we happen to review with our Board of Directors as well in October. And we have a list of, I'll call it, countries and also businesses that we think we need to take action on. How do we come to that conclusion? We look at the risk of being in some of these businesses and countries. We look at the quality of the business. We look at opportunities to scale it up and build density, and then that really drives our evaluation. But we do have a list that we're working on, as we speak.

So I don't see that, particularly as a risk for us. Now having said that, we do look at means and technologies to reduce the CO2 emissions. And there are technologies that exist that we will be implementing that will allow us to do that. 
In terms of the opportunity aspect of that, we are seeing examples where people are asking us to look at CO2 capture products. And that provides an additional opportunity for us. So that's the opportunity side of it. 
With respect to syngas, clearly, syngas has a certain composition of hydrogen and CO. Syngas opportunities are more driven by the chemical industry downstream chemical products. And there are some CO2 emissions as part of that process, but there's an opportunity to bring the CO2 back into the feed and produce more CO and emit less emissions.

And we want to utilize the engineering and technology skills when the engineering brings to be more competitive in over-the-fence projects, more traditional over-the-fence projects and also look at opportunities to kind of broaden our sale of gas footprint as the opportunities arise.

So they're all running and refining capacity utilization is quite high, and the 3:2:1 crack spreads are favorable. So they want to run at this point.

And you can call them planned, unplanned, I don't really know how you want to characterize it, but we tend to see more companies start to take shutdowns and that's demand related, for sure.

So ex those items, volumes were relatively flat year-over-year. And as you can imagine, it's a combination of some of the factors we talked about with China, Australia and some puts and takes with some positive contribution from our project backlog. But I think going forward, some of those turnarounds are complete, and we expect things to be better in the fourth quarter. We are pretty confident in the customers we have. They run hard. They are the low-cost producers. So we feel good about that. But we just had a little blip here in the third quarter that we're thrilled."

So some progress has been made there by just look at those pure product lines.

IP and GDP have been trending down over time. Automotive has not returned anywhere near its levels. The steel PMI index has been in the mid-40s. The only thing keeping that going is infrastructure spend. Chemicals are probably -- it's probably one of the more stable parts of the market that's got in the low 50s from a PMI standpoint. And we do look forward to a wave of relocations that we think will be coming as a result of environmental issues and cleanup, driven by Beijing. Electronics is probably a bright spot because the Chinese government is focusing so heavily on that. 
But clearly, China has been on a weakening trend. And again, we're not starting up large projects, as we speak, that can move that number fairly significantly. That will come later on."

We saw operating profit and operating profit margins improve both sequentially and year-over-year in every segment. EPS improved substantially year-over-year and sequentially. Cash flow came through nicely as we had expected. Project CapEx grew while base CapEx shrank, which reflects spend against our large project backlog and CapEx efficiencies. ROC percent, the single most important metric in a capital-intensive business, continued to improve. The sale of gas backlog remained strong at $5 billion, which gives us a nice foundation for future growth. 
We raised our guidance again, which reflects our positive momentum, the opportunities we see to continue to improve the quality of our business and the resiliency of our business model. And of course, this is against a backdrop of softening worldwide demand. 
A few comments on the segments. In the Americas, which represents nearly 40% of our total sales and nearly half of our overall operating profit, we saw good organic sales year-over-year, driven by price, but flat sales sequentially. Strength in food and beverage and health care is offsetting weakness in metals and manufacturing. 
Operating margins continued to improve as we drive efficiencies across the region. In Europe, we saw evidence of better execution as operating margins reached 20.5% despite a weaker macro. The weakness we saw in the quarter continued through September and October. 
In APAC, operating margins are climbing nicely, up 450 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially as the team continues to do an excellent job delivering on merger efficiencies. Volumes are impacted by a slowing China, Australia and turnarounds in Southeast Asia. 
In Linde Engineering, we saw record margins, driven by excellent execution, cost absorption and timing as we're able to close out key projects during the quarter. Though backlogs remained strong, I don't see this level of operating margin as sustainable. This is a business that should trend closer to low double-digit percents through the cycle. 
The global other segment reflects ongoing merger efficiencies, as you would expect. Our focus, successful integration, improve the quality of each and every business, optimize our portfolio around core sale of gas regions and businesses, and then drive network density. Facilitate growth synergies and drive operational excellence in everything we do. 
Final comment before I turn it over to Matt. We have a resilient business model, which generates strong cash flow through the economic cycle. In periods of expansion, we invest for growth. And when the macro weakens, we return that cash to shareholders. You add to that the value created by our merger and you can see why we are an investment for all seasons and why I wouldn't trade places with anyone. Matt?"

Third quarter adjusted pro forma results are shown on Slide 3. Consistent with prior quarters, these figures have been adjusted to best demonstrate underlying trends and performance of the combined business. Yo",1122,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted pro forma results are shown on Slide 3. 
Consistent with prior quarters, these figures have been adjusted to best demonstrate underlying trends and performance of the combined business. You'll find the required reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the appendix. 
Sales of $7 billion are 1% higher than prior year but 3% below the second quarter of this year. Foreign currency translation continues to be a headwind as the U.S. dollar strengthened across the board. Excluding FX and cost pass-through, underlying sales increased 4% from 2018, but decreased 1% sequentially. Versus prior year, prices rose 2%, and the 2% volume increase was split between organic growth and project contribution. While the more resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continue to grow, we are seeing declining to negative growth rates across most industrial markets, especially metals and manufacturing. 
The slowing industrial activity is primarily driven by North America, China and Australia, which is consistent with our expectations. Versus the second quarter of this year, price increased 1% from broad-based actions, but volume declined 2% from engineering project timing and some seasonality and weaker industrial activity in EMEA. 
Despite the softening economic conditions, operating profit grew 16% versus prior year and 5% sequentially, or 19% and 6% when excluding currency translation. The combination of price attainment and cost efficiencies across all segments enabling operating margins to expand 270 basis points versus 2018 and 140 basis points versus Q2. 
The company reached 19.8% operating margin this quarter as employees around the world continue to coordinate efforts to improve productivity and operational excellence. 
Net income increased 24% from prior year or 27% when excluding FX translation. The reason for greater profit leverage is due to lower net interest expense from a combination of excess cash flow and FX impact. 
As stated before, we are recapitalizing the balance sheet to better align with our target single A credit rating, but this will take a little more time as we refine our cash forecasting. Until then, we are actively deploying excess cash and managing the capital structure to deliver value to the shareholders. 
EPS of $1.94 was 26% higher than prior year and 6% higher sequentially. Excluding FX, those figures improved to 29% and 7%, respectively. This result is somewhat higher than anticipated since favorable impact from cost management actions more than offset worse-than-expected FX rates. 
In addition to delivering strong profit leverage this quarter, a large majority of earnings pulled through to cash as operating cash flow increased 86% sequentially to $1.9 billion. While we would normally expect some seasonal improvement, most of this sequential increase is driven by better working capital management along with higher EBITDA and less merger-related outflows. 
CapEx increased 11% from Q2. But you can see that was driven by project CapEx, which represents customer projects under construction and secured by long-term contracts that lead to incremental growth. The sale of gas backlog associated with project CapEx remains strong at $4.7 billion and will be executed over the next 3 years, although that spend pattern will be somewhat lumpy. 
Base CapEx, which represents all other capital spend not associated with our project backlog, such as small growth, cost reduction and maintenance, declined 7% sequentially as we continue to find more opportunities for cash synergies. Rolling this all together results in a return on capital of 11.2% or a 60 basis point sequential increase. This improvement is driven by higher after-tax profit over a capital base that declined due to prudent cash management across the organization. 
We firmly believe that return on capital is one of the most important metrics for this industry in light of the capital intensity and long-term contractual structure. Given this cash and capital trends, I felt it may be helpful to provide a little more detail, which you can find on Slide 4. 
The left side shows operating cash flow trends by quarter. The first 2 quarters were each around $1 billion, but subsequently increased to almost $1.9 billion in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the key drivers include declining merger-related outflows, higher earnings and better working capital performance. 
In addition, the first half tends to be seasonally lower from timing of cash incentives and taxes. The year-to-date figure of $3.9 billion includes $0.7 billion of onetime merger-related outflows. This $0.7 billion primarily relates to taxes and fees, which supported $11 billion of divestiture proceeds, in addition to legal and adviser payments. These merger outflows will be significantly lower in 2020. 
The pie chart in the lower right represents how the year-to-date operating cash flow has been allocated. 
Overall, it's a balanced approach, with roughly half invested in the business and half returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Of the half invested in the business, it's evenly split between investments in secured growth and base CapEx. 
Secured growth represents accretive acquisitions and project CapEx for the backlog. Base CapEx is important to support nonbacklog growth, achieve cost reduction targets and maintain high levels of plant safety, reliability and efficiency. 
Overall, the priority is to invest in high-quality projects -- growth projects that meet our investment criteria while continuously generating excess free cash flow to distribute back to shareholders. Please turn to Slide 5 for an update on full year guidance. 
We are raising full year EPS guidance to $7.25 to $7.30, which represents an increase of 17% to 18% from prior year or 21% to 22% when excluding 4% currency headwind. The guidance is above last quarter due to favorable Q3 results and continued confidence in opportunities to improve the cost structure. However, this range also implies that Q4 EPS will be below the $1.94 from Q3. Part of this sequential decline relates to the timing of project completions for the engineering business. 
Engineering is a long-cycle business with projects that take several years. So the quarter-to-quarter results can vary, but we fully expect to maintain high levels of execution. 
Another driver of the anticipated Q3 to Q4 decline relates to projections of a weaker macro. Lower manufacturing levels and longer customer outages continue to point to decreasing industrial activity. 
In summary, despite the macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to improve the quality of the business and grow earnings double-digit percent over last year. This is only possible from the collective efforts of all 80,000 employees executing as one team. And while geopolitical forces will likely result in more uncertainty, for 2020 and beyond, we maintain a high degree of confidence in our ability to leverage opportunities that not only overcome these challenges, but will also create substantial value for our owners. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

But the offset to that will be slightly better interest. So I would think about interest and buyback really as kind of offsetting each other. As I have favorable interest, I'll be behind in a buyback program. But as I work towards a single A, then I'll probably have a lower share count. 
FX definitely had a negative effect. When we looked and gave guidance a quarter ago, I would say the FX got worse by 1% to almost 2% than what we had anticipated. We'll have to see what it means going forward. But that is something that got a little worse as the dollar strengthened pretty much across the board. 
As far as the growth, I think the easier way to probably think about it is sequentially, as we mentioned, thinking about Q3 to Q4. At this stage, this guidance implies probably about 1% kind of erosion on base volumes. We'll have to see if that occurs or not. Obviously, anything better than that should be upside. But right now, that's our assumption and we'll see what ultimately comes out."

I think the challenge on looking solely at pro forma, and not pro forma adjusted, is that all of the effects of purchase accounting are going to be in those results. And as you can imagine, we had to step up the inventory as part of purchase accounting, which would have a disproportionate effect on COGS in the beginning, and then that would rapidly decline. So there are lots of different lives of assets that had to be stepped up that are anywhere from month to infinite life. 
So pro forma, as you know, under Article 11 SEC, still has all purchase price accounting effects in it. So that's why we think looking solely at pro forma is going to be a bit tricky because of the purchase price accounting effects. And what I still firmly believe is the numbers that we represented here on a pro forma adjusted best represent. And as we stated in the last call, we fully believe we're on full track now. 
Obviously, as you can see in the results, we did do a little better than expected on costing. And I think timing was a little more favorable than we anticipated. But we are fully in line with the $900 million target that was given and the promise that was given at the $300 million per year. So we feel quite confident on that.

China, certainly slowing growth, some turnarounds during the quarter that had some effect. But Jeff, when you look at where we are today, there's very little contribution from large projects in those numbers. And it so happens, if you go look at the sale of gas backlog, Asia represents nearly $3 billion of that backlog. So we have some very large projects and some large contributions ahead. And I think if you look at the industry, whenever one of us reports if there's a big number, usually, it has something to do with a large project or projects. And as the case is today, we just don't have that contribution. It's just a question of timing. Again, the backlog is ahead of us. 
If I look at the long-term trends of a place like Asia Pacific, clearly, electronics is going to be strong going forward. I've already talked about the backlog. I think as these emerging markets develop, the applications that both legacy companies have brought to the combined company are going to have a positive effect. The pricing equation is something that we look at very carefully and continue to work. Regarding other parts of the world, we look at many things. But then again, it all has to pass the screen of, is this a strategic geography? Is this a geography that we think we can build the density? Because our strategy is all about focusing on core geographies that we can build network density. 
And then as we look at individual projects, there's a risk versus return assessment that we go through very thoroughly, and it has to pass that screen as well. So that's how I'd answer that question."

Moreover, the other intangible assets in your balance sheet have been sequentially stable. Can you explain that massive change in the PPA amortization charges? 
And secondly, coming back to the operating cash flow. You mentioned higher EBITDA, better working capital and less merger-related outflows. But I see that you also had some disposal proceeds of $271 million. Are there any other funny items included in that cash flow figure?"

I think it's a bit of a -- consistent with what I'd mentioned to Jeff. So as you can imagine, in purchase price accounting, you are required to assign valuations across a whole spread of different assets that have various lives. So there are a significant portion that is assigned to shorter lived inventory. And as those fall off, you have a significant amortization and then they obviously are go through your cost of goods and then they're sold. So any inventory would have fallen off in the first to second quarter and you would have a larger amount of recognition and amortization. As the years go on and you start losing more of the shorter lives, the amortization number will continue to decline. So that is a normal pattern in any type of GAAP purchase price accounted effect that your amortization is at its peak at the beginning and then it rapidly declines on short-lived assets such as inventory, software, things that might be 3-year life, 5-year life vehicles. And then over time, you get into machinery buildings that get to 10, 20 years. So this is a normal pattern of any kind of amortization. 
But again, back to my earlier point, this is why we wanted to focus on adjusted figures because this amortization can create a lot of confusion and it's really noncash. And given our scenario was a merger of equals, there really was no capital component of this merger. So that's why we really are focusing on the adjusted figures. 
As far as the operating cash flow, just to make sure you understand. Any disposable proceed gains are part of divestitures, which relates to investing cash flow, not operating cash flow. So there would be none of those gains related. In fact, it's the opposite. What happens, the gain is in your P&L. It is completely wiped out in your operating cash flow to make it a 0 effect, and then the full proceeds are put in investing cash flow. That's how GAAP accounting works. 
Our cash flow statements are per GAAP accounting. So hopefully, that answer makes sense."

I think from my perspective, right now, probably the best way to think about is on a year-to-date basis, we're at 3.9. And within that, are these $700 million of merger-related costs.

And within that, are these $700 million of merger-related costs. And as I mentioned in the transcript, that's going to drastically fall off in 2020. It will be quite small. There'll be a little bit of hangover of our final divestitures, which will be pretty minimal. And then there'll just be some ongoing cash restructuring, which should be fairly small to achieve the synergies. 
So the way I would think about it is if you take that 3.9 and add back almost all of that 0.7, or you could say 0.6, somewhere in that neighborhood, you're looking at mid-4s is where we probably should be on a normal ongoing basis through 3 quarters. I do think the seasonality was a little overly skewed in this first half, partly because of the merger outflows, partly also because of the 2 legacy companies having independent compensation schemes that paid out in the beginning of the quarter. Going forward, we'll have one compensation scheme, so that should also help reduce some of that component. 
But I would still think about it, as I've mentioned in earlier calls, just to think about EBITDA kind of an OCF as a relationship, so what is your OCF as a percent of EBITDA. And as you may recall, we've said in prior calls that you look at the 5-year average of the 2 legacy companies and it's high 70s, and that's something we absolutely expect to continue to deliver on. 
And when you look at year-to-date, if you adjust for the merger outflows through 3 quarters, we're a little bit ahead of that. We're probably a couple of percent ahead of that number right now. So that's how we think about it. But I still think we should be continuously, on a full year basis, converting at least 3 quarters or more of our EBITDA into operating cash flow. And then obviously, any areas where we can enhance that through working capital management, dividends from nonconsolidated affiliates or other areas above and beyond EBITDA, we're going to continue to work towards that."

First of all, we've had a big focus on building out our CO2 infrastructure.

And so that's a focus we've had for several years, and I could look at the growth of our CO2 products in places like the United States, and it's growing very nicely, which would be consistent with our comments about growth in food and beverage. If I think about the price of carbon, that is -- we are seeing more projects today than we have seen in the last several years. And there's a list of things that I'm looking at and a couple of them do pertain to the cost of carbon, CO2 capture. And I think those are going to be opportunities that are going to grow going forward. It really has to be a function of legislation. You've heard about this 45Q, which is an IRS ruling that provides a credit. For CO2, the credit grows over time. I think that's certainly a step in the right direction, it's creating some interest.

So the first question, I mean, clearly, we've had a focus on improving operating margins across the board, not just EMEA, but everywhere. And again, it's a country-by-country, it's a business-by-business look, it's a product-by-product look. Pricing clearly is a piece of that. We have been taking the appropriate cost actions in Europe. We will continue to do that because, quite frankly, the macro environment is not that favorable today. And so it's something that we need to do. 
And as it relates to people, this is a discussion that we have to have and want to have at a European Works Council level and also at the local works councils. And so those discussions are sort of ongoing, and they will continue. But we clearly look at Europe as an opportunity to continue to expand operating margins, and that is our intention. Part of that is looking at certain businesses that really don't belong in the portfolio. 
And if you go back to my earlier comment about optimizing the portfolio, and that gets to your second question. We have gone through that. We just did a -- concluded a bottoms-up review that we happened to review with our Board of Directors as well in October. And we have a list of, I'll call it, countries and also businesses that we think we need to take action on. How do we come to that conclusion? We look at the risk of being in some of these businesses and countries. We look at the quality of the business. We look at opportunities to scale it up and build density, and then that really drives our evaluation. But we do have a list that we're working on, as we speak. And then there's another list that we are monitoring, evaluating, watching and may lead to some action later on. But we are clearly -- that's clearly something that we're focused on."

If you look at in terms of, let's say, let's start with conventional production of hydrogen through steam methane reforming, CO2 is a byproduct of that. When we structure our contracts with our customers who want that hydrogen, if there is a cost of CO2 that is passed through contractually to the customer. So I don't see that, particularly as a risk for us. Now having said that, we do look at means and technologies to reduce the CO2 emissions. And there are technologies that exist that we will be implementing that will allow us to do that. 
In terms of the opportunity aspect of that, we are seeing examples where people are asking us to look at CO2 capture products. And that provides an additional opportunity for us. So that's the opportunity side of it. 
With respect to syngas, clearly, syngas has a certain composition of hydrogen and CO. Syngas opportunities are more driven by the chemical industry downstream chemical products. And there are some CO2 emissions as part of that process, but there's an opportunity to bring that CO2 back into the feed and produce more CO and emit less emissions. So that is a technology that we have and something that we're looking to deploy more and more."

Well I think about what I -- what we have said is that we want to do all the good third-party projects that are out there. And it so happens that Linde Engineering has a very strong track record of executing very complex projects. And that is the reason why we were as successful as we were with a project like ExxonMobil, where ExxonMobil had confidence in Linde Engineering's capabilities to execute a project like that. So we want to do all the good third-party business that's out there, and there certainly are some opportunities that are in front of us today we want to capitalize on. By the same token, we want to do all the good sale of gas projects that we can find. And we truly believe that between our product line capability, Linde legacy's product line capability, we have a full complement of every plant product line that we could ever want. And we want to utilize the engineering and technology skills Linde Engineering brings to be more competitive in over-the-fence projects, more traditional over-the-fence projects and also look at opportunities to kind of broaden our sale of gas footprint as the opportunities arise. 
So I think probably something on the order of 50-50 is a good place to be with respect to third-party sales and sale of gas. Again, it will be kind of a function of the opportunities in front of us. But everybody understands in the company that the sale of gas is the sweet spot of the industry. It's where we want to focus. And we're making good progress with that objective."

So it just so happened there were quite a few grouped together. They're all now pretty much out of turnaround. So they're all running and refining capacity utilization is quite high, and the 3:2:1 crack spreads are favorable. So they want to run at this point. I think, generally speaking, though, whenever you have weakening demand, a weakening macro, what we tend to see are more shutdowns. And you can call them planned, unplanned, I don't really know how you want to characterize it, but we tend to see more companies start to take shutdowns and that's demand related, for sure. Sometimes it's pricing related, their pricing. So I think that's just kind of something you should expect when you're in a really a weaker environment overall globally. 
And I would like to be able to say we're in all these turnarounds in Q3. They're all back up and running. Therefore, that's additive going forward.

So ex those items, volumes were relatively flat year-over-year.

So some progress has been made there if I just look at those pure product lines.

The only thing keeping that going is infrastructure spend. Chemicals are probably one -- is probably one of the more stable parts of the market, that's got in the low 50s from a PMI standpoint.

We saw operating profit and operating profit margins improve both sequentially and year-over-year in every segment. EPS improved substantially year-over-year and sequentially. Cash flow came through nicely as we had expected. Project CapEx grew while base CapEx shrank, which reflects spend against our large project backlog and CapEx efficiencies. ROC percent, the single most important metric in a capital-intensive business, continued to improve. The sale of gas backlog remained strong at $5 billion, which gives us a nice foundation for future growth. 
We raised our guidance again, which reflects our positive momentum, the opportunities we see to continue to improve the quality of our business and the resiliency of our business model. And of course, this is against a backdrop of softening worldwide demand. 
A few comments on the segments. In the Americas, which represents nearly 40% of our total sales and nearly half of our overall operating profit, we saw good organic sales year-over-year driven by price but flat sales sequentially. Strength in food and beverage and health care is offsetting weakness in metals and manufacturing. 
Operating margins continued to improve as we drive efficiencies across the region. In Europe, we saw evidence of better execution as operating margins reached 20.5% despite a weaker macro. The weakness we saw in the quarter continued through September and October. 
In APAC, operating margins are climbing nicely, up 450 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially as the team continues to do an excellent job delivering on merger efficiencies. Volumes are impacted by a slowing China, Australia and turnarounds in Southeast Asia. 
In Linde Engineering, we saw record margins driven by excellent execution, cost absorption and timing as we're able to close out key projects during the quarter. Though backlogs remained strong, I don't see this level of operating margin as sustainable. This is a business that should trend closer to low double-digit percents through the cycle. 
The global other segment reflects ongoing merger efficiencies, as you would expect. Our focus, successful integration, improve the quality of each and every business, optimize our portfolio around core sale of gas regions and businesses, and then drive network density. Facilitate growth synergies and drive operational excellence in everything we do. 
Final comment before I turn it over to Matt. We have a resilient business model, which generates strong cash flow through the economic cycle. In periods of expansion, we invest for growth. And when the macro weakens, we return that cash to shareholders. You add to that the value created by our merger and you can see why we are an investment for all seasons and why I wouldn't trade places with anyone. Matt?"

Third quarter adjusted pro forma results are shown on Slide 3. Consistent with prior quarters, these figures have been adjusted to best demonstrate underlying trends and performance of the combined business. Yo",1122,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted pro forma results are shown on Slide 3. 
Consistent with prior quarters, these figures have been adjusted to best demonstrate underlying trends and performance of the combined business. You'll find the required reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the appendix. 
Sales of $7 billion are 1% higher than prior year but 3% below the second quarter of this year. Foreign currency translation continues to be a headwind as the U.S. dollar strengthened across the board. Excluding FX and cost pass-through, underlying sales increased 4% from 2018, but decreased 1% sequentially. Versus prior year, prices rose 2%, and the 2% volume increase was split between organic growth and project contribution. While the more resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continue to grow, we are seeing declining to negative growth rates across most industrial markets, especially metals and manufacturing. 
The slowing industrial activity is primarily driven by North America, China and Australia, which is consistent with our expectations. Versus the second quarter of this year, price increased 1% from broad-based actions, but volume declined 2% from engineering project timing and some seasonality and weaker industrial activity in EMEA. 
Despite the softening economic conditions, operating profit grew 16% versus prior year and 5% sequentially, or 19% and 6% when excluding currency translation. The combination of price attainment and cost efficiencies across all segments enabling operating margins to expand 270 basis points versus 2018 and 140 basis points versus Q2. 
The company reached 19.8% operating margin this quarter as employees around the world continue to coordinate efforts to improve productivity and operational excellence. 
Net income increased 24% from prior year or 27% when excluding FX translation. The reason for greater profit leverage is due to lower net interest expense from a combination of excess cash flow and FX impact. 
As stated before, we are recapitalizing the balance sheet to better align with our target single A credit rating, but this will take a little more time as we refine our cash forecasting. Until then, we are actively deploying excess cash and managing the capital structure to deliver value to the shareholders. 
EPS of $1.94 was 26% higher than prior year and 6% higher sequentially. Excluding FX, those figures improved to 29% and 7%, respectively. This result is somewhat higher than anticipated since favorable impact from cost management actions more than offset worse-than-expected FX rates. 
In addition to delivering strong profit leverage this quarter, a large majority of earnings pulled through to cash as operating cash flow increased 86% sequentially to $1.9 billion. While we would normally expect some seasonal improvement, most of this sequential increase is driven by better working capital management along with higher EBITDA and less merger-related outflows. 
CapEx increased 11% from Q2. But you can see that was driven by project CapEx, which represents customer projects under construction and secured by long-term contracts that lead to incremental growth. The sale of gas backlog associated with project CapEx remains strong at $4.7 billion and will be executed over the next 3 years, although that spend pattern will be somewhat lumpy. 
Base CapEx, which represents all other capital spend not associated with our project backlog, such as small growth, cost reduction and maintenance, declined 7% sequentially as we continue to find more opportunities for cash synergies. Rolling this all together results in a return on capital of 11.2% or a 60 basis point sequential increase. This improvement is driven by higher after-tax profit over a capital base that declined due to prudent cash management across the organization. 
We firmly believe that return on capital is one of the most important metrics for this industry in light of the capital intensity and long-term contractual structure. Given this cash and capital trends, I felt it may be helpful to provide a little more detail, which you can find on Slide 4. 
The left side shows operating cash flow trends by quarter. The first 2 quarters were each around $1 billion, but subsequently increased to almost $1.9 billion in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the key drivers include declining merger-related outflows, higher earnings and better working capital performance. 
In addition, the first half tends to be seasonally lower from timing of cash incentives and taxes. The year-to-date figure of $3.9 billion includes $0.7 billion of onetime merger-related outflows. This $0.7 billion primarily relates to taxes and fees, which supported $11 billion of divestiture proceeds, in addition to legal and adviser payments. These merger outflows will be significantly lower in 2020. 
The pie chart in the lower right represents how the year-to-date operating cash flow has been allocated. 
Overall, it's a balanced approach, with roughly half invested in the business and half returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Of the half invested in the business, it's evenly split between investments in secured growth and base CapEx. 
Secured growth represents accretive acquisitions and project CapEx for the backlog. Base CapEx is important to support nonbacklog growth, achieve cost reduction targets and maintain high levels of plant safety, reliability and efficiency. 
Overall, the priority is to invest in high-quality projects -- growth projects that meet our investment criteria while continuously generating excess free cash flow to distribute back to shareholders. Please turn to Slide 5 for an update on full year guidance. 
We are raising full year EPS guidance to $7.25 to $7.30, which represents an increase of 17% to 18% from prior year or 21% to 22% when excluding 4% currency headwind. The guidance is above last quarter due to favorable Q3 results and continued confidence in opportunities to improve the cost structure. However, this range also implies that Q4 EPS will be below the $1.94 from Q3. Part of this sequential decline relates to the timing of project completions for the engineering business. 
Engineering is a long-cycle business with projects that take several years. So the quarter-to-quarter results can vary, but we fully expect to maintain high levels of execution. 
Another driver of the anticipated Q3 to Q4 decline relates to projections of a weaker macro. Lower manufacturing levels and longer customer outages continue to point to decreasing industrial activity. 
In summary, despite the macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to improve the quality of the business and grow earnings double-digit percent over last year. This is only possible from the collective efforts of all 80,000 employees executing as one team. And while geopolitical forces will likely result in more uncertainty, for 2020 and beyond, we maintain a high degree of confidence in our ability to leverage opportunities that not only overcome these challenges, but will also create substantial value for our owners. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

In fact, I would say we were probably a little bit behind on our program in the last quarter. So that's really not having much of an effect. 
But the offset to that will be slightly better interest. So I would think about interest and buyback really as kind of offsetting each other. As I have favorable interest, I'll be behind in a buyback program. But as I work towards a single A, then I'll probably have a lower share count. 
FX definitely had a negative effect. When we looked and gave guidance a quarter ago, I would say the FX got worse by 1% to almost 2% than what we had anticipated. We'll have to see what it means going forward. But that is something that got a little worse as the dollar strengthened pretty much across the board. 
As far as the growth, I think the easier way to probably think about it is sequentially, as we mentioned, thinking about Q3 to Q4. At this stage, this guidance implies probably about 1% kind of erosion on base volumes. We'll have to see if that occurs or not. Obviously, anything better than that should be upside.

I think the challenge on looking solely at pro forma, and not pro forma adjusted, is that all of the effects of purchase accounting are going to be in those results. And as you can imagine, we had to step up the inventory as part of purchase accounting, which would have a disproportionate effect on COGS in the beginning, and then that would rapidly decline. So there are lots of different lives of assets that had to be stepped up that are anywhere from month to infinite life. 
So pro forma, as you know, under Article 11 SEC, still has all purchase price accounting effects in it. So that's why we think looking solely at pro forma is going to be a bit tricky because of the purchase price accounting effects.

China, certainly slowing growth, some turnarounds during the quarter that had some effect. But Jeff, when you look at where we are today, there's very little contribution from large projects in those numbers. And it so happens, if you go look at the sale of gas backlog, Asia represents nearly $3 billion of that backlog. So we have some very large projects and some large contributions ahead. And I think if you look at the industry, whenever one of us reports if there's a big number, usually, it has something to do with a large project or projects. And as the case is today, we just don't have that contribution. It's just a question of timing. Again, the backlog is ahead of us. 
If I look at the long-term trends of a place like Asia Pacific, clearly, electronics is going to be strong going forward. I've already talked about the backlog. I think as these emerging markets develop, the applications that both legacy companies have brought to the combined company are going to have a positive effect. The pricing equation is something that we look at very carefully and continue to work. Regarding other parts of the world, we look at many things. But then again, it all has to pass the screen of, is this a strategic geography? Is this a geography that we think we can build the density? Because our strategy is all about focusing on core geographies that we can build network density. 
And then as we look at individual projects, there's a risk versus return assessment that we go through very thoroughly, and it has to pass that screen as well. So that's how I'd answer that question."

I think it's a bit of a -- consistent with what I'd mentioned to Jeff. So as you can imagine, in purchase price accounting, you are required to assign valuations across a whole spread of different assets that have various lives. So there are a significant portion that is assigned to shorter lived inventory. And as those fall off, you have a significant amortization and then they obviously are go through your cost of goods and then they're sold. So any inventory would have fallen off in the first to second quarter and you would have a larger amount of recognition and amortization. As the years go on and you start losing more of the shorter lives, the amortization number will continue to decline. So that is a normal pattern in any type of GAAP purchase price accounted effect that your amortization is at its peak at the beginning and then it rapidly declines on short-lived assets such as inventory, software, things that might be 3-year life, 5-year life vehicles. And then over time, you get into machinery buildings that get to 10, 20 years. So this is a normal pattern of any kind of amortization. 
But again, back to my earlier point, this is why we wanted to focus on adjusted figures because this amortization can create a lot of confusion and it's really noncash. And given our scenario was a merger of equals, there really was no capital component of this merger. So that's why we really are focusing on the adjusted figures. 
As far as the operating cash flow, just to make sure you understand. Any disposable proceed gains are part of divestitures, which relates to investing cash flow, not operating cash flow. So there would be none of those gains related. In fact, it's the opposite. What happens, the gain is in your P&L. It is completely wiped out in your operating cash flow to make it a 0 effect, and then the full proceeds are put in investing cash flow. That's how GAAP accounting works. 
Our cash flow statements are per GAAP accounting. So hopefully, that answer makes sense."

I think from my perspective, right now, probably the best way to think about is on a year-to-date basis, we're at 3.9. And within that, are these $700 million of merger-related costs.

And within that, are these $700 million of merger-related costs. And as I mentioned in the transcript, that's going to drastically fall off in 2020. It will be quite small. There'll be a little bit of hangover of our final divestitures, which will be pretty minimal. And then there'll just be some ongoing cash restructuring, which should be fairly small to achieve the synergies. 
So the way I would think about it is if you take that 3.9 and add back almost all of that 0.7, or you could say 0.6, somewhere in that neighborhood, you're looking at mid-4s is where we probably should be on a normal ongoing basis through 3 quarters. I do think the seasonality was a little overly skewed in this first half, partly because of the merger outflows, partly also because of the 2 legacy companies having independent compensation schemes that paid out in the beginning of the quarter. Going forward, we'll have one compensation scheme, so that should also help reduce some of that component. 
But I would still think about it, as I've mentioned in earlier calls, just to think about EBITDA kind of an OCF as a relationship, so what is your OCF as a percent of EBITDA. And as you may recall, we've said in prior calls that you look at the 5-year average of the 2 legacy companies and it's high 70s, and that's something we absolutely expect to continue to deliver on. 
And when you look at year-to-date, if you adjust for the merger outflows through 3 quarters, we're a little bit ahead of that. We're probably a couple of percent ahead of that number right now. So that's how we think about it. But I still think we should be continuously, on a full year basis, converting at least 3 quarters or more of our EBITDA into operating cash flow. And then obviously, any areas where we can enhance that through working capital management, dividends from nonconsolidated affiliates or other areas above and beyond EBITDA, we're going to continue to work towards that."

With respect to the cost synergies, certainly, with the operating margin quality improving across the board, you could surmise that the synergies are taking hold. To be very honest, as I look at these numbers, I pay less attention to what's called a synergy cost savings and I'm just looking for improving the quality of our businesses across the board, which means better operating performance, cost productivity programs, efficiency programs, all the things that improve the overall quality of the business.

First of all, we've had a big focus on building out our CO2 infrastructure. We had seen over the years that that's a very important product to have for carbonated products, for food freezing, for other applications. And so that's a focus we've had for several years, and I could look at the growth of our CO2 products in places like the United States, and it's growing very nicely, which would be consistent with our comments about growth in food and beverage. If I think about the price of carbon, that is -- we are seeing more projects today than we have seen in the last several years. And there's a list of things that I'm looking at and a couple of them do pertain to the cost of carbon, CO2 capture. And I think those are going to be opportunities that are going to grow going forward. It really has to be a function of legislation. You've heard about this 45Q, which is an IRS ruling that provides a credit. For CO2, the credit grows over time. I think that's certainly a step in the right direction, it's creating some interest. But if you look around the world, those are the types of things that we're seeing, and I think it's going to be an opportunity for growth going forward."

We will continue to do that because, quite frankly, the macro environment is not that favorable today. And so it's something that we need to do. 
And as it relates to people, this is a discussion that we have to have and want to have at a European Works Council level and also at the local works councils. And so those discussions are sort of ongoing, and they will continue. But we clearly look at Europe as an opportunity to continue to expand operating margins, and that is our intention. Part of that is looking at certain businesses that really don't belong in the portfolio. 
And if you go back to my earlier comment about optimizing the portfolio, and that gets to your second question. We have gone through that. We just did a -- concluded a bottoms-up review that we happened to review with our Board of Directors as well in October. And we have a list of, I'll call it, countries and also businesses that we think we need to take action on. How do we come to that conclusion? We look at the risk of being in some of these businesses and countries. We look at the quality of the business. We look at opportunities to scale it up and build density, and then that really drives our evaluation. But we do have a list that we're working on, as we speak.

So I don't see that, particularly as a risk for us. Now having said that, we do look at means and technologies to reduce the CO2 emissions. And there are technologies that exist that we will be implementing that will allow us to do that. 
In terms of the opportunity aspect of that, we are seeing examples where people are asking us to look at CO2 capture products. And that provides an additional opportunity for us. So that's the opportunity side of it. 
With respect to syngas, clearly, syngas has a certain composition of hydrogen and CO. Syngas opportunities are more driven by the chemical industry downstream chemical products. And there are some CO2 emissions as part of that process, but there's an opportunity to bring that CO2 back into the feed and produce more CO and emit less emissions.

By the same token, we want to do all the good sale of gas projects that we can find. And we truly believe that between our product line capability, Linde legacy's product line capability, we have a full complement of every plant product line that we could ever want. And we want to utilize the engineering and technology skills Linde Engineering brings to be more competitive in over-the-fence projects, more traditional over-the-fence projects and also look at opportunities to kind of broaden our sale of gas footprint as the opportunities arise. 
So I think probably something on the order of 50-50 is a good place to be with respect to third-party sales and sale of gas. Again, it will be kind of a function of the opportunities in front of us.

So they're all running and refining capacity utilization is quite high, and the 3:2:1 crack spreads are favorable. So they want to run at this point.

And you can call them planned, unplanned, I don't really know how you want to characterize it, but we tend to see more companies start to take shutdowns and that's demand related, for sure. Sometimes it's pricing related, their pricing. So I think that's just kind of something you should expect when you're in a really a weaker environment overall globally.

I mean first step is to be able to calculate what your pricing is and to be able to do a variance analysis. So you separate out pricing. And then you have to -- and then start looking at the reports and then start to take appropriate actions. 
So I think a lot of those building blocks have been put in place. As I look around the world, clearly, we have very strong pricing in the Americas. I'm looking at areas that were up 6%, 7%, some areas are lower. I can look across Europe and see that packaged and merchant combined is up around 4% or so. So some progress has been made there if I just look at those pure product lines. 
And then I look at Asia, we have a situation currently today in China where the year-over-year comparison is unfavorable because pricing was very high in the prior year period, and that's something that we're working on. But overall, I think we clearly have some opportunity to do more, and that would be my expectation rolling into 2020 as well."

And if you want to kind of step back and look at what's going on in China, generally speaking, Matt talked about the trends Q3 to Q4. It just so happens, Golden Week was the first week of October. And no pun intended, the Golden Week was very weak. And again, that's the type of thing you expect when the overall economy is not very strong.
IP and GDP have been trending down over time. Automotive has not returned anywhere near its levels. The steel PMI index has been in the mid-40s. The only thing keeping that going is infrastructure spend. Chemicals are probably one -- is probably one of the more stable parts of the market, that's got in the low 50s from a PMI standpoint. And we do look forward to a wave of relocations that we think will be coming as a result of environmental issues and cleanup, driven by Beijing. Electronics is probably a bright spot because the Chinese government is focusing so heavily on that. 
But clearly, China has been on a weakening trend. And again, we're not starting up large projects, as we speak, that can move that number fairly significantly. That will come later on."
