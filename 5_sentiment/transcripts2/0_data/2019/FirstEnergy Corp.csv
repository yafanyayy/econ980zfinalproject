Through a series of careful coordinated actions, we met our commitment to fully transform FirstEnergy into a premier high-performance pure play regulated utility. I'll spend just a few moments recapping the year, then move to our opportunities for 2019 and beyond.
We ended 2018 by announcing a $2.5 billion equity investment from several prominent investors. Among other things, these new investment enabled us to holding company debt by $1.45 billion, eliminate the need to issue additional issue outside of our employee benefit and stock purchase plans through 2021 and contributed a total of $1.25 billion to our pension plan in 2018.
That investment also helped us accelerate our regulated growth and infrastructure improvement plans. And for the first time ever, introduced a long-term growth rate projection for our regulated operating earnings. In April, we reached an agreement in principle to address our obligations in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of FirstEnergy Solutions and all of its subsidiaries and FirstEnergy Nuclear operating company. Our final definitive agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court in September. Reaching a fair settlement with the debtors, Unsecured Creditors Committee and key care creditor groups within months of the bankruptcy filing helped to deliver on our commitment to quickly and thoughtfully exit cooperative generation allowing us to turn our attention to FirstEnergy future as a fully regulated utility.
The settlement and our improved risk profile as a utility was stable and predictable earnings and cash flow cleared the way for an across-the-board upgraded S&P, including an upgrade issue a credit rating at FE Corp. and a positive credit outlook with Fitch.
In turn, we have lower liquidity requirements and took several steps in October  to reduce our financing cost. We reduced the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facilities to $3.5 billion from $5 billion and extended the maturity dates to December of 2022. 
At the same time, we refinanced our revolver borrowings through 2 new term loans totaling $1.75 billion. To effectively and efficiently support the growth of our regulated transmission and distribution businesses, we completed our FirstEnergy Tomorrow initiative to realign our shared service organization and cost structure. Through our voluntary enhanced retirement package and the elimination of the open positions, we reduced headcount in our corporate support functions by 40% and expenses by 43% without any involuntary employee layoffs, which is an accomplishment I'm very proud of.
At the same time, we created the latter leaner management team by reducing layers and increasing spans of control. We identified and eliminated $300 million in cost associated with our previous support of comparative operations.
And we expect to realize an incremental $85 million in savings due to additional reductions in capital, interest and O&M expenses.
As a Capstone to our transmission, our board approved new dividend policy, along with the initial 6% dividend increase in November that reflects confidence in our regulated long-term sustainable growth plans with the targeted payout ratio of 55% to 65% of operating earnings, the new policy supports increased shareholder returns and continued investments in our strategic initiatives. 
Our stock ended the year with a total shareholder return of 27.7%, making FirstEnergy the top performer in the EEI Index. I know, many of you have been long-term investors in FirstEnergy, and we thank you for both your confidence and patience.
With all of this going on, I couldn't be prouder of the way our employees stayed focused and executed on our growth initiatives. 
Last night, we reported full year 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.59 per share. Operating earnings exceeded our initial 2018 guidance and were at the top end of the range we provided in October. This makes 4 consecutive years of consistently meeting or exceeding our guidance to the financial community.
Our 2018 results benefited from weather, solid execution of our growth strategy in transmission and distribution businesses, and modest load growth in all 3 of our distribution customer classes. 
We remain encouraged with the overall trends in our distribution business. Industrial sales have increased steadily for 2.5 years, while most of the growth has been driven by the shale gas industry, we're also seeing sustained improvement in the steel sector. 
Our weather adjusted sales to residential and commercial customers were modestly positive across the full year, and we're pleased to see continued gains in the number of new customers in these segments. 
In our transmission business, we are entering our sixth year of Energizing the Future program. We continue to efficiently execute our long-term customer focused strategy to modernize their transmission grid across our service area. Our transmission rate base at 30% of our total regulated assets ranks among the largest in the nation and our transmission spend as a percentage of market capitalization is at the top of our industry.
We are excited about the future and I believe we are poised for a strong year ahead.
Let's shift gears to recap some of our ongoing initiatives and expectations starting with our regulatory activities. 
First, our Ohio utilities have a supplemental settlement pending with the Public Utilities Commission in a matter of tax reform and grid modernization. The original settlement filed last November was signed by the PUCO staff representatives of industrial and commercial customers, environmental advocates, hospitals, cooperative generation suppliers and other parties.
The supplemental settlement added the support of residential customers and low income advocates. This settlement addresses how all the tax savings associated with federal tax reform would be returned to customers and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid modernization program with investments of $516 million.
Earlier this month, our Ohio Utilities also made a filing with the PUCO to request approval for a 2-year extension to the Distribution Modernization Rider. Writer DMR was first authorized by the PUCO in 2016 to provide additional revenues to ensure Ohio Utilities have access to lower cost capital to promote the faster and more economical path to modernizing the distribution system for the benefit of our Ohio customers.
While we believe we have a strong case to continue this rider, I will remind you that it's not factored into our earnings growth projections.
In Maryland, hearing took place in January, and we expect the final order by late March in our first Potomac Edison base rate case nearly 25 years. As we've discussed, our request of $17.6 million will address recovery of investments to provide safe and reliable service to our Maryland customers, and it is net of $7.3 million in customer savings related to federal tax reform.
And in New Jersey, the procedural schedule for our full year $400 million JCP&L Reliability Plus infrastructure investment plan was suspended due to settlement discussions. JCP&L Reliability Plus will enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system. Throughout this year, we expect our newly formed emerging technologies group to continue identifying opportunity for future investments that will allow us to better serve our customers by analyzing and implementing advanced technologies and working with state and federal policies designed to improve grid performance and energy security.
We are affirming our 2019 full year guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share as well as our long-term operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2021. 
Now let's turn to Steve for a review of our results for the fourth quarter and other financial developments."

It's great to speak with you today. First, a reminder, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter and the year are posted on our website and our consolidated reports to the financial community. 
Also, consistent with our practice over the past year, we present operating earnings and projections on a fully diluted basis, this allows us to show preferred shares as fully converted and eliminates the impact of conversion timing. 
About 87% of the preferred shares had been converted as of January 31. We expect the majority of the remaining preferred shares to be included by the end of July. 
In accordance with the terms of the equity issuance. With that said, let's get started at a look at the fourth quarter. 
GAAP earnings were $0.25 per share. This includes a pension mark-to-market adjustment and other special items. Operating earnings were $0.50 per share in line with the top end of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results benefited from higher deliveries, lower financing costs and stronger regulated commodity margin in West Virginia. These factors offset higher depreciation and O&M, and which was primarily related to additional vegetation management work in Pennsylvania.
Total distribution deliveries across all customer segments increased 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Residential sales increased 1/2 of 1%, while commercial deliveries were up 1.7%. Weather had a modest impact on sales with heating degree days about 7% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017.
On a weather adjusted basis, commercial deliveries increased 1.8% and residential deliveries were essentially flat. 
In our industrial sector, the trends of steady growth now has stretched into 10 consecutive quarters. Fourth quarter deliveries increased 1.4% compared to the same period of 2017. This was led by gains in the shale gas, steel and electrical equipment manufacturing industries.
In our transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings at our formula rate companies were $0.02 favorable due to higher rate case at MAIT and ATSI. This was offset by higher O&M in our stated rate transition companies. 
And in our corporate segment, we've been slightly lower operating earnings offset by higher income taxes and the nondeductible portion of interest compared to the same period in 2017.
Now I'd like to take a moment on this month's $500 million pension contribution. First, a quick history. Beginning in 2011, we adopted the mark-to-market method for our pension and our other post employment benefit accounting. Each year, typically, in the fourth quarter, we remeasure our pension assets and liabilities to recognize changes in discount rates, actual return on planned assets and other differences to the actuarial assumptions.
The loss or gain is recognized in our GAAP results. This is a preferred method of accounting under GAAP because it recognizes the actuarial gain or loss in the year it occurs instead of amortizing it over a longer period. 
We exclude this adjustment from our non-GAAP operating earnings to provide greater transparency to our ongoing operational performance.
In 2018, our mark-to-market adjustment with a noncash charge of $0.19 per share, lower-than-expected returns were partially offset by a higher discount rate, which was on the high side of the estimate we provided in our third quarter materials.
So we ended 2018 with approximately $3.9 billion of liquidity, of which $367 million was cash. We expected this favorable cash position to remain through 2020 so we decided to put the cash to workforce now by making the $500 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan on February 1 of this year. This contribution improves our pension plans funded status to 82% and eliminates any projected minimum funding requirements through 2021.
As Chuck noted earlier, we are making great progress with the rating agencies. We're now investment grade across the board by S&P, Moody's and Fitch, and we expect further ratings improvement over time as we execute the regulated growth plan that we've outlined. 
As many of you know, S&P tax and FFO to total debt metrics with a minimum threshold of 9%. Moody's tracks our CFO working capital to total debt metrics, which has a current minimum threshold of 12%. And Fitch tracks an FFO adjusted leverage metric with the maximum threshold multiple of 6.5%. We expect to be compliant with all 3 rating agencies and their respective thresholds through our 2021 planning period. 
Our actions during 2018 redefined FirstEnergy. We're excited about our future as a premier fully regulated utility. Today, more than ever we're focused on 3 things: Implementing our strategies; delivering on our commitments; and building a brighter future for our shareholders, customers and employees. And now, before we turn it over for your questions, Chuck would like to share a few additional comments."

What I mentioned is that the procedural schedule has been suspended to allow the settlement settlement discussions to continue. Obviously, we don't have a settlement to announce. I would have announced it today. So but we're hopeful that we can get to a settlement, but to your second question, I think, it's an important one and that is we are laying the spend just shy of $3 billion of CapEx per year for the next several years. And our footprint, so when I think about the New Jersey spend, obviously, we file that plan because that's where we would like to spend $400 million over the next 4 years. But in the event, we don't get to a settlement, and then we get back on to the procedural schedule and that doesn't work out either. We have plenty of opportunity around FirstEnergy and 4 other states in transmission to make these investments in order to support the 6% to 8% growth that we're committing too. As far as the Emerging Technologies piece, I think, that's one of the most exciting things about where we're at as a company that we actually now have the time and the resources to start thinking about what do we want FirstEnergy to be in the future. We've committed to kind of what we're going to do over the next 3 years as far as capital deployment, but we're really looking state by state, utility by utility, and transmission what are those new Emerging Technologies that makes sense for us to invest in on behalf of our customers, what are the regulatory and legislative impediments to being able to do that and then we've got 3 years to start working on how we deal with those impediments. And as I said, it's just, I think, an exciting time because I have just finished -- or just started my 41st year, I guess, I would say with this company, the first 40 years, we've been working in 1 form or another I always put some of the past behind us.

So one, that's the method we're using right now. At some point in time, if we bump up against the maximum amount of investment we can make another desk, then we'll be required to have another base rate case around the base rate case in Pennsylvania in order to roll that in and then be able to use the desk going forward. But we have a ways away from that at that point. I would not anticipate any rate case filings in Pennsylvania this year for sure, even though our stay out is expiring this year. In Ohio, we're in the rate freeze through 2024. In Maryland, we're just wrapping up our rate case with new rates to go on effect March 23. It's not been that long since we had a rate case in New Jersey. So the investments we're making this year and really for the next several years, it just shy of $3 billion over 50% of that is being made in transmission formula rates and real-time riders and our distribution companies., and so the 6% to 8% growth we're talking about does not depend on any rate cases, in order for us to achieve that growth.

Through a series of careful coordinated actions, we met our commitment to fully transform FirstEnergy into a premier high-performance pure-play regulated utility. I will spend just a few moments recapping the year, then move to our opportunities for 2019 and beyond.
We began 2018 by announcing a $2.5 billion equity investment from several prominent investors. Among other things, this new investment enabled us to reduce our holding company debt by $1.45 billion, eliminate the need to issue additional issue additional equity outside of our employee benefit and stock purchase plans through 2021, and contributed a total of $1.25 billion to our pension plan in 2018. That investment also helped us accelerate our regulated growth in infrastructure improvement plans. And for the first time ever, introduced a long-term growth rate projection for our regulated operating earnings.
In April, we reached an agreement in principle to address our obligations in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of FirstEnergy Solutions and all of its subsidiaries and FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company. Our final definitive agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court in September. Reaching a fair settlement with the debtors, Unsecured Creditor Committee and key creditor groups within months of the bankruptcy filing helped us deliver on our commitment to quickly and thoughtfully exit competitive generation, allowing us to turn our attention to FirstEnergy's future as a fully regulated utility.
The settlement and our improved risk profile as a utility was stable, predictable earnings and cash flow cleared the way for an across-the-board upgraded S&P, including an upgraded issue or credit rating at FE Corp. and a positive credit outlook with Fitch.
In turn, we had lower liquidity requirements and took several steps in October to reduce our financing costs. We reduced the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facilities to $3.5 billion from $5 billion and extended the maturity dates to December of 2022. At the same time, we refinanced our revolver borrowings through 2 new term loans totaling $1.75 billion. To effectively and efficiently support the growth of our regulated transmission and distribution businesses, we completed our FirstEnergy Tomorrow initiative to realign our shared service organization and cost structure.
Through a voluntary enhanced retirement package and the elimination of open positions, we reduced headcount in our corporate support functions by 40% and expenses by 43% without any involuntary employee layoffs, which is an accomplishment I'm very proud of.
At the same time, we created a flatter, leaner management team by reducing layers and increasing spans of control. We identified and eliminated $300 million in costs associated with our previous support of competitive operations. And we expect to realize an incremental $85 million in savings due to additional reductions in capital, interest and O&M expenses.
As a capstone to our transmission, our board approved a new dividend policy along with an initial 6% dividend increase in November that reflects confidence in our regulated long-term sustainable growth plans. With a targeted payout ratio of 55% to 65% of operating earnings, the new policy supports increased shareholder returns and continued investments in our strategic initiatives.
Our stock ended the year with a total shareholder return of 27.7%, making FirstEnergy the top performer in the EEI Index. I know many of you have been long-term investors in FirstEnergy, and we thank you for both your confidence and patience.
With all of this going on, I couldn't be prouder of the way our employees stayed focused and executed on our growth initiatives.
Last night, we reported full year 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.59 per share. Operating earnings exceeded our initial 2018 guidance and were at the top end of the range we provided in October. This makes 4 consecutive years of consistently meeting or exceeding our guidance to the financial community.
Our 2018 results benefited from weather, solid execution of our growth strategy in the transmission and distribution businesses, and modest load growth in all 3 of our distribution customer classes.
We remain encouraged with the overall trends in our distribution business. Industrial sales have increased steadily for 2.5 years, while most of that growth is driven by the shale gas industry, we're also seeing sustained improvement in the steel sector.
Our weather-adjusted sales to residential and commercial customers were modestly positive across the full year, and we're pleased to see continued gains in the number of new customers in these segments.
In our transmission business, we are entering our sixth year of Energizing the Future program. We continue to efficiently execute our long-term customer-focused strategy to modernize the transmission grid across our service area. Our transmission rate base at 30% of our total regulated assets ranks among the largest in the nation, and our transmission spend as a percentage of market capitalization is at the top of our industry.
We are excited about the future, and I believe we are poised for a strong year ahead.
Let's shift gears to recap some of our ongoing initiatives and expectations, starting with our regulatory activities. 
First, our Ohio utilities have a supplemental settlement pending with the Public Utilities Commission in a matter of tax reform and grid modernization. The original settlement filed last November was signed by the PUCO staff, representatives of industrial and commercial customers, environmental advocates, hospitals, competitive generation suppliers and other parties. The supplemental settlement added the support of residential customer and low-income advocates. This settlement addresses how all of the tax savings associated with federal tax reform would be returned to customers and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid modernization program with investments of $516 million.
Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities also made a filing with the PUCO to request approval for a 2-year extension to the Distribution Modernization Rider. Rider DMR was first authorized by the PUCO in 2016 to provide additional revenues to ensure our Ohio utilities have access to lower-cost capital that promotes a faster and more economical path to modernizing the distribution system for the benefit of our Ohio customers. While we believe we have a strong case to continue this rider, I will remind you that it is not factored into our earnings growth projections.
In Maryland, hearings took place in January, and we expect a final order by late March in our first Potomac Edison base rate case in nearly 25 years. As we have discussed, our request of $17.6 million will address recovery of investments to provide safe and reliable service to our Maryland customers, and it is net of $7.3 million in customer savings related to federal tax reform.
And in New Jersey, the procedural schedule for our 4-year $400 million JCP&L Reliability Plus infrastructure investment plan was suspended due to settlement discussions. JCP&L Reliability Plus will enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system.
Throughout this year, we expect our newly formed Emerging Technologies group to continue identifying opportunity for future investments that will allow us to better serve our customers by analyzing and implementing advanced technologies and working with state and federal policies designed to improve grid performance and energy security.
We are affirming our 2019 full year guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share as well as our long-term operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2021.
Now let's turn to Steve for a review of our results for the fourth quarter and other financial developments."

It's great to speak with you today. First, a reminder, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter and the year are posted on our website in our consolidated report to the financial community",791,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you today. First, a reminder, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter and the year are posted on our website in our consolidated report to the financial community. Also, consistent with our practice over the past year, we present operating earnings and projections on a fully diluted basis. This allows us to show preferred shares as fully converted and eliminates the impact of conversion timing. About 87% of the preferred shares had been converted as of January 31. We expect the majority of the remaining preferred shares to be included by the end of July in accordance with the terms of the equity issuance. With that said, let's get started at a look at the fourth quarter.
GAAP earnings were $0.25 per share. This includes a pension mark-to-market adjustment and other special items. Operating earnings were $0.50 per share, in line with the top end of our guidance. Our -- in our distribution business, our results benefited from higher deliveries, lower financing costs and stronger regulated commodity margin in West Virginia. These factors offset higher depreciation and O&M, and -- which was primarily related to additional vegetation management work in Pennsylvania.
Total distribution deliveries across all customer segments increased 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Residential sales increased 1/2 of 1%, while commercial deliveries were up 1.7%. Weather had a modest impact on sales with heating degree days about 7% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. On a weather-adjusted basis, commercial deliveries increased 1.8% and residential deliveries were essentially flat.
In our industrial sector, the trends of steady growth now has stretched into 10 consecutive quarters. Fourth quarter deliveries increased 1.4% compared to the same period of 2017. This was led by gains in the shale gas, steel and electric equipment manufacturing industries.
In our transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings that are formula rate companies were $0.02 favorable due to higher rate base at MAIT and ATSI. This was offset by higher O&M in our stated rate transition companies.
And in our corporate segment, we had slightly lower operating earnings offset by higher income taxes and the nondeductible portion of interest compared to the same period in 2017.
Now I'd like to take a moment on this month's $500 million pension contribution. First, a quick history. Beginning in 2011, we adopted the mark-to-mark (sic) [ mark-to-market ] method for our pension and our other post-employment benefit accounting. Each year, typically in the fourth quarter, we remeasure our pension assets and liabilities to recognize changes in discount rates, actual return on planned assets and other differences to the actuarial assumptions.
The loss or gain is recognized in our GAAP results. This is a preferred method of accounting under GAAP because it recognizes the actuarial gain or loss in the year it occurs instead of amortizing it over a longer period. We exclude this adjustment from our non-GAAP operating earnings to provide greater transparency to our ongoing operational performance.
In 2018, our mark-to-market adjustment with a noncash charge of $0.19 per share, lower-than-expected returns were partially offset by a higher discount rate, which was on the high side of the estimate we provided in our third quarter materials. So we ended 2018 with approximately $3.9 billion of liquidity, of which $367 million was cash. We expected this favorable cash position to remain through 2020 so we decided to put the cash to workforce now by making the $500 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan on February 1 of this year. This contribution improves our pension plans funded status to 82% and eliminates any projected minimum funding requirements through 2021.
As Chuck noted earlier, we're making great progress with the rating agencies. We're now investment grade across the board by S&P, Moody's and Fitch, and we expect further ratings improvements over time as we execute the regulated growth plan that we've outlined.
As many of you know, S&P tracks an FFO to total debt metric with a minimum threshold of 9%. Moody's tracks a CFO working capital to total debt metric, which has a current minimum threshold of 12%. And Fitch tracks an FFO adjusted leverage metric with the maximum threshold multiple of 6.5. We expect to be compliant with all 3 rating agencies and their respective thresholds through our 2021 planning period.
Our actions during 2018 redefined FirstEnergy. We're excited about our future as a premier fully regulated utility. Today, more than ever, we're focused on 3 things: Implementing our strategies; delivering on our commitments; and building a brighter future for our shareholders, customers and employees.
And now, before we turn it over for your questions, Chuck would like to share a few additional comments."

Obviously, we don't have a settlement to announce or I'd have announced it today. So -- but we're hopeful that we can get to a settlement. But to your second question, I think, it's an important one and that is we are planning to spend just shy of $3 billion of CapEx per year for the next several years in our footprint. So when I think about the New Jersey spend, obviously, we filed that plan because that's where we would like to spend $400 million over the next 4 years. But in the event we don't get to a settlement and then we get back on to the procedural schedule and that doesn't work out either, we have plenty of opportunity around FirstEnergy in 4 other states and transmission to make these investments in order to support the 6% to 8% growth that we're committing to. As far as the Emerging Technologies piece, I think that's one of the most exciting things about where we're at as a company that we actually now have the time and the resources to start thinking about what do we want FirstEnergy to be in the future. We've committed to kind of what we're going to do over the next 3 years as far as capital deployment, but we're really looking state by state, utility by utility, and transmission at what are those new emerging technologies that makes sense for us to invest in on behalf of our customers, what are the regulatory and legislative impediments to being able to do that, and then we've got 3 years to start working on how do we deal with those impediments. And as I said, it's just, I think, an exciting time because I've just finished -- or just started my 41st year, I guess, I would say with this company. The first 40 years, we've been working in one form or another to always put some of the past behind us. And today, for the first time, we're really in a position to start looking to the future."

How you're thinking about rectifying that or whether it implies there's a base rate case coming in one of those jurisdictions?"

And here's what I would say. Take Pennsylvania, in particular. As of January this year, the DISC has been turned back on for all 4 of our distribution operating companies. And as you're familiar with how the DISC works, we're making investments under the DISC. Those investments will contribute about $0.02 a share to our 2019 growth. So, one, that's the method we're using right now. At some point in time, if we bump up against the maximum amount of investment we can make under the DISC, then we'll be required to have another base rate case around the base rate cases in Pennsylvania in order to roll that in and then be able to use the DISC going forward. But we're a ways away from that point. I would not anticipate any rate case filings in Pennsylvania this year for sure, even though our stayout is expiring this year. In Ohio, we're in a rate freeze through 2024. In Maryland, we're just wrapping up a rate case with new rates to go on effect on March 23. It's not been that long since we had a rate case in New Jersey. So the investments that we're making this year and really for the next several years, it's just shy of $3 billion, over 50% of that is being made in transmission formula rates and realtime riders and our distribution companies. And so the 6% to 8% growth that we're talking about does not depend on any rate cases in order for us to achieve that growth. It's primarily executing the plan, investing in these formula-driven mechanisms and then the growth will occur."

I think, there are a couple of other things holding our stock back from rerating. One is the continued overhang of FES and even though we have reached a settlement with all the creditors and as settlements have been approved by the court, there is still some confusion in the market as to our ongoing relationship with them that I don't think will go away until they actually emerge and change their name at some point, hopefully, later this year. So I think that's holding us back. But I think -- I can't undersell the value of what the transmission system means to FirstEnergy and its shareholders.

So all of what we're doing is also driving improved service for customers. And just take the ATSI part of our Energizing the Future, we reduced transmission outages by almost 40% on the ATSI part of our system and a single transmission outage can affect -- it affects tens of thousands of customers up to maybe 60,000 to 80,000 customers at times.

Through a series of careful coordinated actions, we met our commitment to fully transform FirstEnergy into a premier high-performance pure-play regulated utility. I will spend just a few moments recapping the year, then move to our opportunities for 2019 and beyond.
We began 2018 by announcing a $2.5 billion equity investment from several prominent investors. Among other things, this new investment enabled us to reduce our holding company debt by $1.45 billion, eliminate the need to issue additional equity outside of our employee benefit and stock purchase plans through 2021, and contribute a total of $1.25 billion to our pension plan in 2018. That investment also helped us accelerate our regulated growth in infrastructure improvement plans. And for the first time ever, introduce a long-term growth rate projection for our regulated operating earnings.
In April, we reached an agreement in principle to address our obligations in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of FirstEnergy Solutions and all of its subsidiaries and FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company. Our final definitive agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court in September. Reaching a fair settlement with the debtors, Unsecured Creditor Committee and key creditor groups within months of the bankruptcy filing helped us deliver on our commitment to quickly and thoughtfully exit competitive generation, allowing us to turn our attention to FirstEnergy's future as a fully regulated utility.
The settlement and our improved risk profile as a utility with stable, predictable earnings and cash flow cleared the way for an across-the-board upgraded S&P, including an upgraded issuer credit rating at FE Corp. and a positive credit outlook with Fitch.
In turn, we had lower liquidity requirements and took several steps in October to reduce our financing costs. We reduced the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facilities to $3.5 billion from $5 billion and extended the maturity dates to December of 2022. At the same time, we refinanced our revolver borrowings through 2 new term loans totaling $1.75 billion. To effectively and efficiently support the growth of our regulated transmission and distribution businesses, we completed our FirstEnergy Tomorrow initiative to realign our shared service organization and cost structure.
Through a voluntary enhanced retirement package and the elimination of open positions, we reduced headcount in our corporate support functions by 40% and expenses by 43% without any involuntary employee layoffs, which is an accomplishment I'm very proud of.
At the same time, we created a flatter, leaner management team by reducing layers and increasing spans of control. We identified and eliminated $300 million in costs associated with our previous support of competitive operations. And we expect to realize an incremental $85 million in savings due to additional reductions in capital, interest and O&M expenses.
As a capstone to our transformation, our board approved a new dividend policy along with an initial 6% dividend increase in November that reflects confidence in our regulated long-term sustainable growth plans. With a targeted payout ratio of 55% to 65% of operating earnings, the new policy supports increased shareholder returns and continued investments in our strategic initiatives.
Our stock ended the year with a total shareholder return of 27.7%, making FirstEnergy the top performer in the EEI Index. I know many of you have been long-term investors in FirstEnergy, and we thank you for both your confidence and patience.
With all of this going on, I couldn't be prouder of the way our employees stayed focused and executed on our growth initiatives.
Last night, we reported full year 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.59 per share. Operating earnings exceeded our initial 2018 guidance and were at the top end of the range we provided in October. This makes 4 consecutive years of consistently meeting or exceeding our guidance to the financial community.
Our 2018 results benefited from weather, solid execution of our growth strategy in the transmission and distribution businesses, and modest load growth in all 3 of our distribution customer classes.
We remain encouraged with the overall trends in our distribution business. Industrial sales have increased steadily for 2.5 years, while most of that growth is driven by the shale gas industry, we're also seeing sustained improvement in the steel sector.
Our weather-adjusted sales to residential and commercial customers were modestly positive across the full year, and we were pleased to see continued gains in the number of new customers in these segments.
In our transmission business, we are entering our sixth year of Energizing the Future program. We continue to efficiently execute our long-term customer-focused strategy to modernize the transmission grid across our service area. Our transmission rate base at 30% of our total regulated assets ranks among the largest in the nation, and our transmission spend as a percentage of market capitalization is at the top of our industry.
We are excited about the future, and I believe we are poised for a strong year ahead.
Let's shift gears to recap some of our ongoing initiatives and expectations, starting with our regulatory activities. 
First, our Ohio utilities have a supplemental settlement pending with the Public Utilities Commission in the matter of tax reform and grid modernization. The original settlement filed last November was signed by the PUCO staff, representatives of industrial and commercial customers, environmental advocates, hospitals, competitive generation suppliers and other parties. The supplemental settlement added the support of residential customer and low-income advocates. This settlement addresses how all of the tax savings associated with federal tax reform would be returned to customers and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid modernization program with investments of $516 million.
Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities also made a filing with the PUCO to request approval for a 2-year extension to the Distribution Modernization Rider. Rider DMR was first authorized by the PUCO in 2016 to provide additional revenues to ensure our Ohio utilities have access to lower-cost capital that promotes a faster and more economical path to modernizing the distribution system for the benefit of our Ohio customers. While we believe we have a strong case to continue this rider, I will remind you that it is not factored into our earnings growth projections.
In Maryland, hearings took place in January, and we expect a final order by late March in our first Potomac Edison base rate case in nearly 25 years. As we have discussed, our request of $17.6 million will address recovery of investments to provide safe and reliable service to our Maryland customers, and it is net of $7.3 million in customer savings related to federal tax reform.
And in New Jersey, the procedural schedule for our 4-year $400 million JCP&L Reliability Plus infrastructure investment plan was suspended due to settlement discussions. JCP&L Reliability Plus will enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system.
Throughout this year, we expect our newly formed Emerging Technologies group to continue identifying opportunity for future investments that will allow us to better serve our customers by analyzing and implementing advanced technologies and working with state and federal policies designed to improve grid performance and energy security.
We are affirming our 2019 full year guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share as well as our long-term operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2021.
Now let's turn to Steve for a review of our results for the fourth quarter and other financial developments."
293515,602110166,1662158,"FirstEnergy Corp., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2019",2019-02-20,"Earnings Calls","FirstEnergy Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you today. First, a reminder, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter and the year are posted on our website in our consolidated report to the financial community",796,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you today. First, a reminder, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter and the year are posted on our website in our consolidated report to the financial community. Also, consistent with our practice over the past year, we present operating earnings and projections on a fully diluted basis. This allows us to show preferred shares as fully converted and eliminates the impact of conversion timing. About 87% of the preferred shares had been converted as of January 31. We expect the majority of the remaining preferred shares to be converted by the end of July in accordance with the terms of the equity issuance. With that said, let's get started at a look at the fourth quarter.
GAAP earnings were $0.25 per share. This includes a pension mark-to-market adjustment and other special items. Operating earnings were $0.50 per share, in line with the top end of our guidance. Our -- in our distribution business, our results benefited from higher deliveries, lower financing costs and stronger regulated commodity margin in West Virginia. These factors offset higher depreciation [ than ] O&M, and -- which was primarily related to additional vegetation management work in Pennsylvania.
Total distribution deliveries across all customer segments increased 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Residential sales increased 1/2 of 1%, while commercial deliveries were up 1.7%. Weather had a modest impact on sales with heating degree days about 7% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. On a weather-adjusted basis, commercial deliveries increased 1.8% and residential deliveries were essentially flat.
In our industrial sector, the trends of steady growth now has stretched into 10 consecutive quarters. Fourth quarter deliveries increased 1.4% compared to the same period of 2017. This was led by gains in the shale gas, steel and electric equipment manufacturing industries.
In our transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings at are formula rate companies were $0.02 favorable due to higher rate base at MAIT and ATSI. This was offset by higher O&M in our stated rate transmission companies.
And in our corporate segment, we had slightly lower operating earnings offset by higher income taxes and the nondeductible portion of interest compared to the same period in 2017.
Now I'd like to take a moment on this month's $500 million pension contribution. First, a quick history. Beginning in 2011, we adopted the mark-to-mark (sic) [ mark-to-market ] method for our pension and our other post-employment benefit accounting. Each year, typically in the fourth quarter, we remeasure our pension assets and liabilities to recognize changes in discount rates, actual return on planned assets and other differences to the actuarial assumptions.
The loss or gain is recognized in our GAAP results. This is a preferred method of accounting under GAAP because it recognizes the actuarial gain or loss in the year it occurs instead of amortizing it over a longer period. We exclude this adjustment from our non-GAAP operating earnings to provide greater transparency to our ongoing operational performance.
In 2018, our mark-to-market adjustment was a noncash charge of $0.19 per share, lower-than-expected returns were partially offset by a higher discount rate, which was on the high side of the estimate we provided in our third quarter materials. So we ended 2018 with approximately $3.9 billion of liquidity, of which $367 million was cash. We expected this favorable cash position to remain through 2020 so we decided to put the cash to work for us now by making the $500 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan on February 1 of this year. This contribution improves our pension plans funded status to 82% and it eliminates any projected minimum funding requirements through 2021.
As Chuck noted earlier, we're making great progress with the rating agencies. We're now investment grade across the board by S&P, Moody's and Fitch, and we expect further ratings improvements over time as we execute the regulated growth plan that we've outlined.
As many of you know, S&P tracks an FFO to total debt metric with a minimum threshold of 9%. Moody's tracks a CFO working capital to total debt metric, which has a current minimum threshold of 12%. And Fitch tracks an FFO adjusted leverage metric with a maximum threshold multiple of 6.5. We expect to be compliant with all 3 rating agencies and their respective thresholds through our 2021 planning period.
Our actions during 2018 redefined FirstEnergy. We're excited about our future as a premier fully regulated utility. Today, more than ever, we're focused on 3 things: Implementing our strategies; delivering on our commitments; and building a brighter future for our shareholders, customers and employees.

Today marks the final earnings call for 2 long-time members of our executive team, who many of you know well, Leila Vespoli and Jim Pearson. Leila and Jim are both retiring in the next couple of months, following long and distinguished careers with our company. They both played key roles in our mergers, various acquisitions and our transformation into a fully regulated utility, and both have been key trusted advisers to me during my tenure as CEO.
I want to thank -- take this opportunity to recognize their strong and thoughtful leadership and to wish them a happy and healthy retirement.
Now I'd like to open the call for your questions."

I wanted to follow up quickly, starting first with the commentary on New Jersey, the Reliability Plus program, just the commentary on suspended timeline here on settlement discussions. How do you think this could advance just procedurally here through the course of the year and against the CapEx that you've already outlined? And then separately, I noticed you kind of mentioned this in conjunction with the newly formed Emerging Technologies group. How do you think about the total potential size of spend here, especially as you go through the settlement process?"

What I mentioned is that the procedural schedule has been suspended to allow the settlement discussions to continue. Obviously, we don't have a settlement to announce or I would have announced it today. So -- but we're hopeful that we can get to a settlement. But your second question, I think, is an important one and that is we are planning to spend just shy of $3 billion of CapEx per year for the next several years in our footprint. So when I think about the New Jersey spend, obviously, we filed that plan because that's where we would like to spend $400 million over the next 4 years. But in the event we don't get to a settlement and then we get back on to the procedural schedule and that doesn't work out either, we have plenty of opportunity around FirstEnergy in 4 other states and transmission to make these investments in order to support the 6% to 8% growth that we're committing to. As far as the Emerging Technologies piece, I think that's one of the most exciting things about where we're at as a company that we actually now have the time and the resources to start thinking about what do we want FirstEnergy to be in the future. We've committed to kind of what we're going to do over the next 3 years as far as capital deployment, but we're really looking state by state, utility by utility, and transmission at what are those new emerging technologies that makes sense for us to invest in on behalf of our customers, what are the regulatory and legislative impediments to being able to do that, and then we've got 3 years to start working on how do we deal with those impediments. And as I said, it's just, I think, an exciting time because I've just finished -- or just started my 41st year, I guess, I would say with this company. The first 40 years, we've been working in one form or another to always put some of the past behind us. And today, for the first time, we're really in a position to start looking to the future."

And here's what I would say. Take Pennsylvania, in particular. As of January this year, the DISC has been turned back on for all 4 of our distribution operating companies. And as you're familiar with how the DISC works, we're making investments under the DISC. Those investments will contribute about $0.02 a share to our 2019 growth. So, one, that's the method we're using right now. At some point in time, if we bump up against the maximum amount of investment we can make under the DISC, then we'll be required to have another base rate case around the base rate cases in Pennsylvania in order to roll that in and then be able to use the DISC going forward. But we're a ways away from that point. I would not anticipate any rate case filings in Pennsylvania this year for sure, even though our stayout is expiring this year. In Ohio, we're in a rate freeze through 2024. In Maryland, we're just wrapping up a rate case with new rates to go in effect on March 23. It's not been that long since we had a rate case in New Jersey. So the investments that we're making this year and really for the next several years, it's just shy of $3 billion, over 50% of that is being made in transmission formula rates and realtime riders in our distribution companies. And so the 6% to 8% growth that we're talking about does not depend on any rate cases in order for us to achieve that growth.

It's growing at 11% per year over the next 3 years in that 6% to 8% growth rate. So I think, it's worthy of really calling it out to make sure investors see it. I think, there are a couple of other things holding our stock back from rerating. One is the continued overhang of FES and even though we have reached a settlement with all the creditors and that settlement's been approved by the court, there is still some confusion in the market as to our ongoing relationship with them that I don't think will go away until they actually emerge and change their name at some point, hopefully, later this year. So I think that's holding us back. But I think -- I can't undersell the value of what the transmission system means to FirstEnergy and its shareholders. We've got forward-looking formula rates for all of it, but former Allegheny system, and that's where we're making all these investments in ATSI and MAIT right now, as I said.

Good investments are formulaic mechanisms at transmission, realtime riders and distribution that don't have regulatory lag, that lead to the improvements that we're making to also serve customers, and you've heard me say this before good investments are the ones customers are willing to pay for and shareholders are willing to invest in. So all of what we're doing is also driving improved service for customers. And just take the ATSI part of our Energizing the Future, we reduced transmission outages by almost 40% on the ATSI part of our system and a single transmission outage can affect -- it affects tens of thousands of customers up to maybe 60,000 to 80,000 customers at times. So those improvements are great for customers too."

They're skilled -- an example of that case of building it out in a way that it's robust, but not duplicative, doing it for a 9.5% to 10% return on equity which is a very cheap way to finance it, and I think it's something that if we really want more EV penetration, our states ought to look at having their utilities help them accomplish.

Through a series of careful coordinated actions, we met our commitment to fully transform FirstEnergy into a premier high-performance pure-play regulated utility. I will spend just a few moments recapping the year, then move to our opportunities for 2019 and beyond.
We began 2018 by announcing a $2.5 billion equity investment from several prominent investors. Among other things, this new investment enabled us to reduce our holding company debt by $1.45 billion, eliminate the need to issue additional equity outside of our employee benefit and stock purchase plans through 2021, and contribute a total of $1.25 billion to our pension plan in 2018. That investment also helped us accelerate our regulated growth in infrastructure improvement plans. And for the first time ever, introduce a long-term growth rate projection for our regulated operating earnings.
In April, we reached an agreement in principle to address our obligations in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of FirstEnergy Solutions and all of its subsidiaries and FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company. Our final definitive agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court in September. Reaching a fair settlement with the debtors, Unsecured Creditor Committee and key creditor groups within months of the bankruptcy filing helped us deliver on our commitment to quickly and thoughtfully exit competitive generation, allowing us to turn our attention to FirstEnergy's future as a fully regulated utility.
The settlement and our improved risk profile as a utility with stable, predictable earnings and cash flow cleared the way for an across-the-board upgraded S&P, including an upgraded issuer credit rating at FE Corp. and a positive credit outlook with Fitch.
In turn, we had lower liquidity requirements and took several steps in October to reduce our financing costs. We reduced the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facilities to $3.5 billion from $5 billion and extended the maturity dates to December of 2022. At the same time, we refinanced our revolver borrowings through 2 new term loans totaling $1.75 billion. To effectively and efficiently support the growth of our regulated transmission and distribution businesses, we completed our FirstEnergy Tomorrow initiative to realign our shared service organization and cost structure.
Through a voluntary enhanced retirement package and the elimination of open positions, we reduced headcount in our corporate support functions by 40% and expenses by 43% without any involuntary employee layoffs, which is an accomplishment I'm very proud of.
At the same time, we created a flatter, leaner management team by reducing layers and increasing spans of control. We identified and eliminated $300 million in costs associated with our previous support of competitive operations. And we expect to realize an incremental $85 million in savings due to additional reductions in capital, interest and O&M expenses.
As a capstone to our transformation, our board approved a new dividend policy along with an initial 6% dividend increase in November that reflects confidence in our regulated long-term sustainable growth plans. With a targeted payout ratio of 55% to 65% of operating earnings, the new policy supports increased shareholder returns and continued investments in our strategic initiatives.
Our stock ended the year with a total shareholder return of 27.7%, making FirstEnergy the top performer in the EEI Index. I know many of you have been long-term investors in FirstEnergy, and we thank you for both your confidence and patience.
With all of this going on, I couldn't be prouder of the way our employees stayed focused and executed on our growth initiatives.
Last night, we reported full year 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.59 per share. Operating earnings exceeded our initial 2018 guidance and were at the top end of the range we provided in October. This makes 4 consecutive years of consistently meeting or exceeding our guidance to the financial community.
Our 2018 results benefited from weather, solid execution of our growth strategy in the transmission and distribution businesses, and modest load growth in all 3 of our distribution customer classes.
We remain encouraged with the overall trends in our distribution business. Industrial sales have increased steadily for 2.5 years, while most of that growth is driven by the shale gas industry, we're also seeing sustained improvement in the steel sector.
Our weather-adjusted sales to residential and commercial customers were modestly positive across the full year, and we were pleased to see continued gains in the number of new customers in these segments.
In our transmission business, we are entering our sixth year of Energizing the Future program. We continue to efficiently execute our long-term customer-focused strategy to modernize the transmission grid across our service area. Our transmission rate base at 30% of our total regulated assets ranks among the largest in the nation, and our transmission spend as a percentage of market capitalization is at the top of our industry.
We are excited about the future, and I believe we are poised for a strong year ahead.
Let's shift gears to recap some of our ongoing initiatives and expectations, starting with our regulatory activities. 
First, our Ohio utilities have a supplemental settlement pending with the Public Utilities Commission in the matter of tax reform and grid modernization. The original settlement filed last November was signed by the PUCO staff, representatives of industrial and commercial customers, environmental advocates, hospitals, competitive generation suppliers and other parties. The supplemental settlement added the support of residential customer and low-income advocates. This settlement addresses how all of the tax savings associated with federal tax reform would be returned to customers and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid modernization program with investments of $516 million.
Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities also made a filing with the PUCO to request approval for a 2-year extension to the Distribution Modernization Rider. Rider DMR was first authorized by the PUCO in 2016 to provide additional revenues to ensure our Ohio utilities have access to lower-cost capital that promotes a faster and more economical path to modernizing the distribution system for the benefit of our Ohio customers. While we believe we have a strong case to continue this rider, I will remind you that it is not factored into our earnings growth projections.
In Maryland, hearings took place in January, and we expect a final order by late March in our first Potomac Edison base rate case in nearly 25 years. As we have discussed, our request of $17.6 million will address recovery of investments to provide safe and reliable service to our Maryland customers, and it is net of $7.3 million in customer savings related to federal tax reform.
And in New Jersey, the procedural schedule for our 4-year $400 million JCP&L Reliability Plus infrastructure investment plan was suspended due to settlement discussions. JCP&L Reliability Plus will enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system.
Throughout this year, we expect our newly formed Emerging Technologies group to continue identifying opportunity for future investments that will allow us to better serve our customers by analyzing and implementing advanced technologies and working with state and federal policies designed to improve grid performance and energy security.
We are affirming our 2019 full year guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share as well as our long-term operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2021.
Now let's turn to Steve for a review of our results for the fourth quarter and other financial developments."
293515,602110166,1664503,"FirstEnergy Corp., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2019",2019-02-20,"Earnings Calls","FirstEnergy Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you today. First, a reminder, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter and the year are posted on our website in our consolidated report to the financial community",796,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you today. First, a reminder, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter and the year are posted on our website in our consolidated report to the financial community. Also, consistent with our practice over the past year, we present operating earnings and projections on a fully diluted basis. This allows us to show preferred shares as fully converted and eliminates the impact of conversion timing. About 87% of the preferred shares had been converted as of January 31. We expect the majority of the remaining preferred shares to be converted by the end of July in accordance with the terms of the equity issuance. With that said, let's get started at a look at the fourth quarter.
GAAP earnings were $0.25 per share. This includes a pension mark-to-market adjustment and other special items. Operating earnings were $0.50 per share, in line with the top end of our guidance. Our -- in our distribution business, our results benefited from higher deliveries, lower financing costs and stronger regulated commodity margin in West Virginia. These factors offset higher depreciation [ than ] O&M, and -- which was primarily related to additional vegetation management work in Pennsylvania.
Total distribution deliveries across all customer segments increased 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Residential sales increased 1/2 of 1%, while commercial deliveries were up 1.7%. Weather had a modest impact on sales with heating degree days about 7% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. On a weather-adjusted basis, commercial deliveries increased 1.8% and residential deliveries were essentially flat.
In our industrial sector, the trends of steady growth now has stretched into 10 consecutive quarters. Fourth quarter deliveries increased 1.4% compared to the same period of 2017. This was led by gains in the shale gas, steel and electric equipment manufacturing industries.
In our transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings at are formula rate companies were $0.02 favorable due to higher rate base at MAIT and ATSI. This was offset by higher O&M in our stated rate transmission companies.
And in our corporate segment, we had slightly lower operating earnings offset by higher income taxes and the nondeductible portion of interest compared to the same period in 2017.
Now I'd like to take a moment on this month's $500 million pension contribution. First, a quick history. Beginning in 2011, we adopted the mark-to-mark (sic) [ mark-to-market ] method for our pension and our other post-employment benefit accounting. Each year, typically in the fourth quarter, we remeasure our pension assets and liabilities to recognize changes in discount rates, actual return on planned assets and other differences to the actuarial assumptions.
The loss or gain is recognized in our GAAP results. This is a preferred method of accounting under GAAP because it recognizes the actuarial gain or loss in the year it occurs instead of amortizing it over a longer period. We exclude this adjustment from our non-GAAP operating earnings to provide greater transparency to our ongoing operational performance.
In 2018, our mark-to-market adjustment was a noncash charge of $0.19 per share, lower-than-expected returns were partially offset by a higher discount rate, which was on the high side of the estimate we provided in our third quarter materials. So we ended 2018 with approximately $3.9 billion of liquidity, of which $367 million was cash. We expected this favorable cash position to remain through 2020 so we decided to put the cash to work for us now by making the $500 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan on February 1 of this year. This contribution improves our pension plans funded status to 82% and it eliminates any projected minimum funding requirements through 2021.
As Chuck noted earlier, we're making great progress with the rating agencies. We're now investment grade across the board by S&P, Moody's and Fitch, and we expect further ratings improvements over time as we execute the regulated growth plan that we've outlined.
As many of you know, S&P tracks an FFO to total debt metric with a minimum threshold of 9%. Moody's tracks a CFO working capital to total debt metric, which has a current minimum threshold of 12%. And Fitch tracks an FFO adjusted leverage metric with a maximum threshold multiple of 6.5. We expect to be compliant with all 3 rating agencies and their respective thresholds through our 2021 planning period.
Our actions during 2018 redefined FirstEnergy. We're excited about our future as a premier fully regulated utility. Today, more than ever, we're focused on 3 things: Implementing our strategies; delivering on our commitments; and building a brighter future for our shareholders, customers and employees.
And now, before we turn it over for your questions, Chuck would like to share a few additional comments."

What I mentioned is that the procedural schedule has been suspended to allow the settlement discussions to continue. Obviously, we don't have a settlement to announce or I would have announced it today. So -- but we're hopeful that we can get to a settlement. But your second question, I think, is an important one and that is we are planning to spend just shy of $3 billion of CapEx per year for the next several years in our footprint. So when I think about the New Jersey spend, obviously, we filed that plan because that's where we would like to spend $400 million over the next 4 years. But in the event we don't get to a settlement and then we get back on to the procedural schedule and that doesn't work out either, we have plenty of opportunity around FirstEnergy in 4 other states and transmission to make these investments in order to support the 6% to 8% growth that we're committing to. As far as the Emerging Technologies piece, I think that's one of the most exciting things about where we're at as a company that we actually now have the time and the resources to start thinking about what do we want FirstEnergy to be in the future. We've committed to kind of what we're going to do over the next 3 years as far as capital deployment, but we're really looking state by state, utility by utility, and transmission at what are those new emerging technologies that makes sense for us to invest in on behalf of our customers, what are the regulatory and legislative impediments to being able to do that, and then we've got 3 years to start working on how do we deal with those impediments. And as I said, it's just, I think, an exciting time because I've just finished -- or just started my 41st year, I guess, I would say with this company. The first 40 years, we've been working in one form or another to always put some of the past behind us. And today, for the first time, we're really in a position to start looking to the future."

And here's what I would say. Take Pennsylvania, in particular. As of January this year, the DISC has been turned back on for all 4 of our distribution operating companies. And as you're familiar with how the DISC works, we're making investments under the DISC. Those investments will contribute about $0.02 a share to our 2019 growth. So, one, that's the method we're using right now. At some point in time, if we bump up against the maximum amount of investment we can make under the DISC, then we'll be required to have another base rate case around the base rate cases in Pennsylvania in order to roll that in and then be able to use the DISC going forward. But we're a ways away from that point. I would not anticipate any rate case filings in Pennsylvania this year for sure, even though our stayout is expiring this year. In Ohio, we're in a rate freeze through 2024. In Maryland, we're just wrapping up a rate case with new rates to go in effect on March 23. It's not been that long since we had a rate case in New Jersey. So the investments that we're making this year and really for the next several years, it's just shy of $3 billion, over 50% of that is being made in transmission formula rates and realtime riders in our distribution companies. And so the 6% to 8% growth that we're talking about does not depend on any rate cases in order for us to achieve that growth. It's merely executing the plan, investing in these formula-driven mechanisms and then the growth will occur."

One is the continued overhang of FES and even though we have reached a settlement with all the creditors and that settlement's been approved by the court, there is still some confusion in the market as to our ongoing relationship with them that I don't think will go away until they actually emerge and change their name at some point, hopefully, later this year.

So all of what we're doing is also driving improved service for customers. And just take the ATSI part of our Energizing the Future, we reduced transmission outages by almost 40% on the ATSI part of our system and a single transmission outage can affect -- it affects tens of thousands of customers up to maybe 60,000 to 80,000 customers at times.

It's just very complicated, and we can't go through the numbers on the call, but those are examples of things that affect how it looks from a GAAP perspective from how it turns out from a regulatory accounting perspective."

They're skilled at planning infrastructure. They're skilled -- an example of that case of building it out in a way that it's robust, but not duplicative, doing it for a 9.5% to 10% return on equity which is a very cheap way to finance it, and I think it's something that if we really want more EV penetration, our states ought to look at having their utilities help them accomplish. Right now, none of our states want us to do that. But that's an area where I think we're going to have ongoing conversation with them about the value that we think we can bring to help them with their environmental strategies for their states."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're off to a very good start in 2019. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share along with operating earnings of $0.67 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range. Steve will discuss later our results reflect the continued success of our regulated growth strategies. 
Let's begin with an update on our progress so far this year. In our transmission business, we're on pace to implement a planned $1.2 billion investment in our Energizing the Future program in 2019. With most of that work in our [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] service territories in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Just a reminder, Energizing the Future is a multiyear program to improve the reliability, resiliency and security of FirstEnergy's portion of the bulk electric system that is shared by our entire nation. It's working. Just 1 example is that we have reduced transmission outages due to equipment failures on our ATSI system during the first 4 years of the program by 37%. And while we are still finalizing [ year 5 ] results it looks like that will increase to eliminate more than half of the equipment-related outages in ATSI. We expect similar results in MAIT as we move forward. We currently have about 1,000 projects underway and stages ranging from engineering and project development to project management and construction. Many of these are multiyear endeavors, and we expect to bring 600 to 700 projects in service in 2019, which is consistent with our pace during the last several years of this customer-focused initiative. 
To support our Energizing the Future initiatives, this month, we opened our center for advanced energy technology, or CAET, in acronym. This 88,000 square foot facility is one of the most comprehensive grid technology testing and training centers of its kind in the country. We designed it to be a centralized hands-on environment, where our engineers and technicians can develop and evaluate new technologies and grid solutions and simulate a variety of real-world conditions. It also includes classroom space where we can train our roofers to safely use new equipment and processes as we upgrade maintain and ensure the security of our great. In addition to supporting our grid modernization program, CAET also creates opportunities for us to advance best practices across the industry. We hope to collaborate with peer utilities, research institutes and key stakeholders such as device manufacturers who could potentially utilize our state-of-the-art facility. 
Turning to our distribution business. As we mentioned last quarter, our Ohio utilities filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission in early February for a 2-year extension to the Distribution Modernization Rider. Again, while we believe we have a strong case to continue this rider, I will remind you that it is not factored into our current earnings growth projections. Also in Ohio, our supplemental settlement regarding tax reform and grid monetization is pending with the PUCO. This proposed settlement addresses how customers will benefit from savings associated with federal tax reform and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid monetization program with investments of $516 million over 3 years.
In New Jersey, we were very pleased to reach a settlement yesterday with a staff of the Board of Public utilities, the division of Rate Council and the New Jersey large energy users coalition for our infrastructure investment program. Our JCP&L Reliability Plus program builds on the service enhancement we have made and our New Jersey footprint in recent years with an additional $97 million investment. Through this program, we plan to implant more than 1,400 targeted of projects to enhance the reliability and resiliency over overhead power lines, replace existing equipment  with smart technology devices and expand the vegetation management program to reduce tree-related outages. On final approval from the VPU, the work take place between June 1, 2019, and December 30, 2020. Once the projects are complete, customers will experience fewer sustained outages under normal conditions as well as a reduction in average tuition. Also, there's a difference between our original IIP request and the settlement amount, we have plenty of opportunities to make those capital investments in other parts of our system, both in distribution and transmission. We will also contemplate filing a subsequent IIP in New Jersey to continue our investments there beyond 2020. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission issued a final order in autocommit rate case on March 22. The order fully resolve tax reform in Maryland, cause for a final bill credits the customer to return prior period tax savings and allows Edison to place the distribution rate by $6.2 million net of tax reform to invest in safety and reliability enhancements. In addition, the Public Service Commission approved a 4-year electric distribution in infrastructure surcharge rider, that program reviews recover incremental cost related to 3 reliability programs, which include installing more distribution automation equipment, accelerating an underground cable replacement program and utilizing new substation reclosers that can minimize the number of customers impacted by service interruptions. Potomac Edison is required to file another distribution rate case at the end of the surcharge period. 
In January, the Public Service Commission also approved Potomac Edison's 5-year $12 million pilot program to install electrical vehicle charging stations in Maryland and offer rebates for charger installations. As part of the program, Potomac Edison plans to install 59 public charging stations at locations across our Maryland service territory including 9 fast chargers. Residential customers will be eligible for rebates for the installation of EV charging stations at their home and rebates will also be available for charging stations installed at multifamily properties. We're proud to support Maryland's efforts to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, which is an important step for cleaner, healthier environment. We see projects like this as a natural fit for FirstEnergy as we fulfill our mission to become a forward-looking utility, committed to making our customers lives brighter, the environment better and our her community stronger. 
Our environmental and social and government strategy is built on the pillars of our mission statement. In 2019, we're continuing our efforts to offer greater transparency and engagement with our ESG goals. Like this year, we will produce a new corporate responsibility report to examine our efforts on issues as wide-ranging as diversity and inclusion, our environmental footprint, corporate governance and community support. This will complement our first climate report, which we published earlier this month. The climate report looks at how our strategies as a fully regulated utility are aligned with the emerging technology trends that support a lower carbon future and examines the business risk associated with a carbon constrained economy. It also reviews our significant progress towards the carbon dioxide reduction goal we announced in 2015. We pledge to reduce CO2 emissions from our generating fleet by at least 90%, below 2005 levels by the year 2045. 
At the end of 2018, we had already achieved a reduction of 62% with about 3 quarters of that reduction related to plant retirements. We expect to reach a CO2 reduction of 80% later this year, well on our way to achieving our goal. I want to express our experience with plant plant decommissioning activities. Over the past 12 [ years ], we safely and responsibly retired [indiscernible] mediated 7 coal plants and successfully anticipated the economic and environmental concerns for each site. This is just one of the ways in which we have demonstrate our commitment to corporate responsibility. It is a core value that we stand by at all times and that includes during the FES bankruptcy. That is why a key component of a settlement agreement was a substantial support for FES to both the advertisement bankruptcy and meet any legacy and future obligation. This includes all environmental responsibilities that could occur when the plants are eventually retired. Following the judge's decision on the FES bankruptcy earlier this month, FES committed to engage with the department of justice and other concerned parties. In light of the commitment by FES, our previous assessment of the obligations and the surety and funding that are already in place, we see no increased risk to removing broad third-party releases from the comprehensive settlement. While these releases would have served to bring finality to FirstEnergy's involvement with these legacy assets, removing the releases does not in our assessment and experience increase liabilities or obligations to our company. We're pleased that FES and submitted a revised disclosure statement and believe they will continue to work constructively with all parties to ensure both timely approval of their plan and their bankruptcy exit. At the same time, we will remain focused on delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our 6 million customers, with a commitment to environmental stewardship, corporate responsibility and implemented our regulated growth strategy. 
We are affirming our 2019 full year operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share, including this year's DMR. In addition, we are introducing a second quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share and affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for a review of the first quarter and other financial developments."

It's my pleasure to join you today. As usual, I'll begin with a couple reminders. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in this strategic and financial highlight document. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view over performance. 
With that, let's take a look at our results. First quarter GAAP earnings were $0.59 per share. Operating earnings were $0.67 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this is above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results benefited from higher weather adjusted residential loans and lower interest expense related to debt refinancing. I'll spend more time on that topic in just a few minutes. These factors were offset by higher depreciation expense related to our rate base. 
Total distribution deliveries were essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 with a slight increase on weather-adjusted basis. Heating degree days were close to normal for the quarter and comparable to the first quarter of 2018. Residential sales were a bright spot for us this quarter. Sales increase about 1% on a national basis. When adjusted for weather, the increase was almost 3% with growth in both customer count and average usage. The upturn in weather-adjusted growth sales over the past 12 months is an encouraging sign. 
In the commercial customer class, sales decreased about 1.5% on national basis and about 1% when adjusted for weather. In our industry class, [indiscernible], marking the end to a long 10-quarter run of growth in that segment. The results reflect lower demand from steel and automotive manufacturers, which offset growth continued growth in the shale and chemical industries. 
Turning to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base, which reflects our continued investment in the Energizing the Future initiatives. This was partially offset by a higher operating expenses, that our stated rate transmission companies. 
And finally, in our corporate segment, first quarter results reflected higher net financing costs in the absence of commodity margin from the Pleasant Power Station. As a reminder, we began to exclude Pleasants from our operating earnings at mid-2018 due to the quarter settlement that transfers economic interest of the plan to FES. These factors were partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Touching on underlying strengths all of our distribution and transmission companies, we have recently seen positive credit ratings actions for several of our subsidiaries. 
Near the end of March, Moody's issued 1 [ notch ] upgrades to ATSI made in JCP&L. And last week, Fitch issued 1 notch upgrade to JCP&L, [indiscernible] Power, Potomac Edison and Allegheny Energy generated company. We believe these positive actions are accustomed to our overall improved risk profile, and we expect to see continued positive momentum. 
Before I close, I'll take a moment to review our finance activity this year. At our Utilities, we refinanced $300 million of maturing debt at both JCP&L and [indiscernible] during the quarter. We issue new senior notes totaling $900 million to repay short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures at these Utilities. We also issued $500 million of new debt at first energy transmission and $100 million at ATSI, primarily repay short-term borrowings and fund continued investments in our Energizing the Future program. 
Lastly, from a liquidity perspective, as of Friday, April 19, we had approximately $3.7 billion of liquidity, of which, $200 million was cash. 
Thank you for your time. We have a very solid quarter, and we're off to a good start this year. Now let's take your questions."

To put it in perspective, it's $97 million over an 18-month period, which begins in June of this year and ends at the end of 2020. So just to give you a perspective, we're talking Ohio about [ 516 million ] over 3 years, that's double the number of customers. So if you have that, it's [ 258 million ]. And it's double the number of years, 3 versus 1.5. So you have it again, it's a [ $129 million ].

Now that we've kind of moved forward beyond the court ruling, I believe, with regard to these nonconsensual third-party releases. And let me just comment on that a little bit more. I would say that caught us by surprise with the focus of the court being fully on the releases. And not on the actual settlement because we believed in the actual settlement, that we have provided substantial value to make sure that FES can emerge, operate these assets and deal with any retirement obligations, when those come down the road. So we felt like the nonconsensual releases weren't a big deal because of the substantial settlement that was on the table. But since the focus is on those, we decided to remove those and move forward. So now the next step in the process is for the court to move -- or to approve the disclosure statements and allow the process to continue moving forward. We're hopeful that will happen on May 20. And then they will continue to make their case for emergence, and we expect that to happen sometime later this summer.

If the sale of power plant, we're still in that chain of ownership at some point if the new owners would default.

It's providing a surety that they have ample supplies of electricity during the most strained terms of your and frigid climates, where natural gas cannot meet all of its obligations. So I think it's providing and just take for example the build that's pending here in Ohio. Is $2.50 per month on a residential customer bill. To provide that security, we all buy insurance for our homes, our cars and a lot of other things. It's a very cost-effective insurance policy that the states are taken out. And it provides long-term economic benefit and clean air benefits too. So I think the states are smart. And among record and I'll continue to say as long as I have this role.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're off to a very good start in 2019. Last night we reported GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share along with operating earnings of $0.67 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range. Steve will discuss later our results reflect the continued success of our regulated growth strategies.
Let's begin with an update on our progress so far this year. In our transmission business, we're on pace to implement a planned $1.2 billion investment in our Energizing the Future program in 2019, with most of that work in our ATSI and MAIT service territories in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Just a reminder, Energizing the Future is a multiyear program to improve the reliability, resiliency and security of FirstEnergy's portion of the bulk electric system that is shared by our entire nation. It's working. Just one example is that we have reduced transmission outages due to equipment failures on our ATSI system during the first 4 years of the program by 37%. And while we are still finalizing year 5 results, it looks like that will increase to eliminate more than half of the equipment-related outages in ATSI. We expect similar results in MAIT as we move forward. We currently have about 1,000 projects underway in stages ranging from engineering and project development to project management and construction. Many of these are multiyear endeavors, and we expect to bring 600 to 700 projects in service in 2019, which is consistent with our pace during the last several years of this customer-focused initiative.
To support our Energizing the Future initiative, this month we opened our Center for Advanced Energy Technology or CAET in acronym. This 88,000 square foot facility is one of the most comprehensive grid technology testing and training center of its kind in the country. We designed it to be a centralized, hands-on environment where our engineers and technicians can develop and evaluate new technologies and grid solutions and simulate a variety of real-world conditions. It also includes classroom space where we can train our workforce to safely use new equipment and processes as we upgrade, maintain and ensure the security of our grid. 
In addition to supporting our grid modernization program, CAET also creates opportunities for us to advance best practices across the industry. We hope to collaborate with peer utilities, research institutes and key stakeholders such as device manufacturers who could potentially utilize our state-of-the-art facility.
Turning to our distribution business, as we mentioned last quarter, our Ohio utilities filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission in early February for a 2-year extension to the Distribution Modernization Rider. Again, while we believe we have a strong case to continue this rider, I will remind you that it is not factored into our current earnings growth projections. Also in Ohio, our supplemental settlement regarding tax reform and grid modernization is pending with the PUCO. This proposed settlement addresses how customers will benefit from savings associated with federal tax reform and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid monetization program with investments of $516 million over 3 years.
In New Jersey, we were very pleased to reach a settlement yesterday with a staff of the Board of Public Utilities, the division of Rate Counsel, and the New Jersey Large Energy Users Coalition for our infrastructure investment program. Our JCP&L Reliability Plus program builds on the service enhancements we have made and our New Jersey footprint in recent years with an additional $97 million investment. Through this program, we plan to implement more than 1,400 targeted projects to enhance the reliability and resiliency of overhead power lines, replace existing equipment with smart technology devices and expand the Vegetation Management Program to reduce tree-related outages. On final approval from the VPU, the work take place between June 1, 2019, and December 30, 2020. Once the projects are complete, customers will experience fewer sustained outages under normal conditions as well as a reduction in outage duration. 
While there was a difference between our original IIP request and the settlement amount, we have plenty of opportunities to make those capital investments in other parts of our system, both in distribution and transmission. We will also contemplate filing a subsequent IIP in New Jersey to continue our investments there beyond 2020.
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission issued a final order in our Potomac Edison rate case on March 22. The order fully resolved tax reform in Maryland, calls for a final bill credit to customers to return prior period tax savings and allows Potomac Edison to increase base distribution rates by $6.2 million, net of tax reform, to invest in safety and reliability enhancements. In addition, the Public Service Commission approved a 4-year electric distribution and infrastructure surcharge rider. That program what we use to recover incremental cost related to 3 reliability programs, which include installing more distribution automation equipment, accelerating an underground cable replacement program and utilizing new substation reclosers that can minimize the number of customers impacted by service interruptions. Potomac Edison is required to file another distribution rate case at the end of the surcharge period.
In January, the Public Service Commission also approved Potomac Edison's 5-year $12 million pilot program to install electrical vehicle charging stations in Maryland and offer rebates for charger installations. As part of the program, Potomac Edison plans to install 59 public charging stations at locations across our Maryland service territory, including 9 fast chargers. Residential customers will be eligible for rebates for the installation of EV charging stations at their home, and rebates will also be available for charging stations installed at multifamily properties. We're proud to support Maryland's efforts to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, which is an important step for a cleaner, healthier environment. We see projects like this as a natural fit for FirstEnergy as we fulfill our mission to become a forward-looking utility committed to making our customers lives brighter, the environment better and our communities stronger.
Our environmental, social and government strategy is built on the pillars of our mission statement. In 2019, we are continuing our efforts to offer greater transparency and engagement with our ESG goals. Late this year we will produce a new corporate responsibility report to examine our efforts on issues as wide-ranging as diversity and inclusion, our environmental footprint, corporate governance and community support. This will complement our first climate report, which we published earlier this month. The climate report looks at how our strategies, as a fully regulated utility, are aligned with the emerging technology trends that support a lower carbon future and examines the business risk associated with a carbon-constrained economy. It also reviews our significant progress towards the carbon dioxide reduction goal we announced in 2015. We pledged to reduce CO2 emissions from our generating fleet by at least 90%, below 2005 levels by the year 2045.
At the end of 2018, we had already achieved a reduction of 62%, with about 3 quarters of that reduction related to plant retirements. We expect to reach a CO2 reduction of 80% later this year, well on our way to achieving our goal.
I want to express our experience with plant decommissioning activities. Over the past 12 years, we safely and responsibly retired and remediated 7 coal plants and successfully anticipated the economic and environmental concerns for each site. This is just one of the ways in which we have demonstrate our commitment to corporate responsibility. It is a core value that we stand by at all times and that includes during the FES bankruptcy. That is why a key component of a settlement agreement was our substantial support for FES to both emerge from bankruptcy and meet any legacy and future obligation. This includes all environmental responsibilities that could occur when the plants are eventually retired. Following the judge's decision on the FES bankruptcy earlier this month, FES committed to engage with the Department of Justice and other concerned parties. In light of the commitment by FES, our previous assessment of the obligations and the surety and funding that are already in place, we see no increased risk to removing the broad third-party releases from the comprehensive settlement. While these releases would have served to bring finality to FirstEnergy's involvement with these legacy assets, removing the releases does not, in our assessment and experience, increase liabilities or obligations to our company. We are pleased that FES has submitted a revised disclosure statement and believe they will continue to work constructively with all parties to ensure both timely approval of their plan and their bankruptcy exit. At the same time we will remain focused on delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our 6 million customers, with a commitment to environmental stewardship, corporate responsibility and implemented our regulated growth strategy. 
We are affirming our 2019 full year operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share, including this year's DMR. In addition, we are introducing a second quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share and affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021.
Thank you. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for a review of the first quarter and other financial developments."

It's my pleasure to join you today. As usual, I'll begin with a couple of reminders. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view of our performance.
With that, let's take a look at our results. First quarter GAAP earnings were $0.59 per share. Operating earnings were $0.67 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this is above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results benefited from higher weather-adjusted residential load and lower interest expense related to debt refinancing. I'll spend more time on that topic in just a few minutes. These factors were offset by a higher depreciation expense related to our rate base.
Total distribution deliveries were essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2018, with a slight increase on a weather-adjusted basis. Heating degree days were close to normal for the quarter and comparable to the first quarter of 2018. Residential sales were a bright spot for us this quarter. Sales increased about 1% on a national basis. When adjusted for weather, the increase was almost 3%, with growth in both customer count and average usage. The upturn in weather-adjusted residential sales over the past 12 months is an encouraging sign.
In the commercial customer class, sales decreased about 1.5% on national basis and about 1% when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load was flat, marking the end to a long 10 quarter run of growth in that segment. The results reflect lower demand from steel and automotive manufacturers, which offset growth -- continued growth in the shale and chemical industries.
Turning to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base, which reflects our continued investment in the Energizing the Future initiative. This was partially offset by higher operating expenses at our stated rate transmission companies.
And finally, in our corporate segment, first quarter results reflected higher net financing costs in the absence of commodity margin from the Pleasants Power Station. As a reminder, we began to exclude Pleasants from our operating earnings in mid-2018 due to the court-approved settlement that transfers economic interest of the plant to FES. These factors were partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Touching on underlying strengths of our distribution and transmission companies, we have recently seen positive credit ratings actions for several of our subsidiaries.
Near the end of March, Moody's issued one notch upgrades to ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L. And last week Fitch issued one notch upgrade to JCP&L, Mon Power, Potomac Edison and Allegheny Energy Generating Company. We believe these positive actions are a testament to our overall improved risk profile, and we expect to see continued positive momentum.
Before I close, I'll take a moment to review our financing activity this year. At our Utilities, we refinanced $300 million of maturing debt at both JCP&L and Met-Ed during the quarter. We issued new senior notes totaling $900 million to repay short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures at these Utilities. We also issued $500 million of new debt at FirstEnergy Transmission and $100 million at ATSI, primarily to repay short-term borrowings and fund continued investments in our Energizing the Future program.
Lastly, from a liquidity perspective, as of Friday, April 19, we had approximately $3.7 billion of liquidity, of which $200 million was cash.
Thank you for your time. We had a very solid quarter, and we're off to a great start this year. Now let's take your questions."

To put it in perspective, it's $97 million over an 18-month period, which begins in June of this year and ends at the end of 2020. So just to give you a little perspective, we talk in Ohio about $516 million over 3 years, that's double the number of customers. So if you have that, it's $258 million. And it's double the number of years, 3 versus 1.5. So you have it again, it's a $129 million. So we're spending $97 million in New Jersey versus a $129 million in Ohio on an apples-to-apples basis.

And let me just comment on that a little bit more. I would say that, that caught us by surprise with the focus of the court being solely on the releases and not on the actual settlement, because we believed in the actual settlement that we have provided substantial value to make sure that FES can emerge, operate these assets and deal with any retirement obligations, when those come down the road. So we felt like the nonconsensual releases weren't a big deal because of the substantial settlement that was on the table. But since the focus was on those, we decided to remove those and move forward. So now the next step in the process is for the court to move or to approve the disclosure statements and allow the process to continue moving forward. We're hopeful that will happen on May 20. And then they will continue to make their case for emergence, and we expect that to happen sometime later this summer.

And they arrived at, given we have already begun the process, for example, with Little Blue Run at the Mansfield plant of closing it in steps part by part every year. So we've got a good track record of what the cost to do that are. And the surety bond is -- was put in place to ensure that the surety for those costs should we at some point not decide to do it, but we're not going to do that. And I want to say very clearly what I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to stand behind any environmental commitment that we have. If we sell a power plant, we're still in that chain of ownership at some point if the new owners would default. But the other thing I want to say very clearly is, we're not afraid of that, because we've shut down, retired, remediated, tore down and turned over sites in some cases for 7 coal-fired power plants already. The cost -- the benefit that you get out of the scrap, steel, iron, copper, aluminum, the property value, et cetera, this is not any big deal for FirstEnergy. And so we're going to move forward fine. But as I said before and I want to repeat, we provided substantial benefits to FES that they're going to have the ability to take care of this on their own."

The value of the scrap and the value of the property offset and there's a cottage industry that has developed as a result of the number of power plants closing around this country to take these plants off their hands, they actually offer to pay you in some cases for the opportunity to deal with this legacy issue on your behalf.

It's nice to be able to answer those instead of FES questions, but with West Virginia, here's what I'd say, we don't have any long-term strategy for West Virginia. We had in place a tree trimming strategy in particular because we had a number of storms dating back to the derecho back in 2013, I think that was that showed that we had some exposure there. But beyond that, West Virginia is kind of a state that we're in a business-as-usual mode. We're spending money every year. We're seeing some growth in West Virginia as a result of being a fully regulated state, industrial growth in the shale and chemicals sector and as well as in the north eastern part of West Virginia in our Potomac Edison West Virginia territory. We're seeing some growth there that's offsetting our cost. When we get to the point there where we think we need to have a rate case, we'll have a rate case. But right now we just don't see any need to. And I don't have any long-term strategy because I think we're performing okay and there's nothing that needs immediate attention in West Virginia.

But I will point out that in Pennsylvania, as of the 1st of this year, the DISC is turned on in all 4 of our operating companies in Pennsylvania. We cannot turn that DISC on unless we're underneath the threshold for allowed rate of return as the commission looks at it. So I think we're in good shape. We're using the DISC at all for companies.

And it's providing a hedge against the most high-beta fuel that we've ever had in this industry, which is natural gas. It's providing a surety that they have ample supplies of electricity during the most strained times of year in frigid climates where natural gas cannot meet all of its obligations. So I think it's providing -- and just take for example the build that's pending here in Ohio, it's $2.50 per month on a residential customer bill. To provide that security, we all buy insurance for our homes, our cars and a lot of other things. It's a very cost-effective insurance policy that these states are taking out and it provides long-term economic benefit and clean air benefits, too. So I think these states are smart. And I'm on record and I'll continue to say, as long as I have this role, it's -- these states are making up for failed market policies that are not working correctly.

Unfortunately, we had a change in chairs and it's taken a while for them to get the train back on the track and move it forward there.

So the lower rate of return made sense for ATSI. We founded MAIT, we founded MAIT from the beginning on a forward-looking formula rate with a 10.38% return. And MAIT's is not that old. So I think it was set very recently. I don't think there's anything that we're worried about with regard to earned rate of returns in our transmission businesses. So I don't think there should be anything that you are worried about. And my read of the [indiscernible], what's it's worth at the FERC is while they're looking at rates of return, they're looking at them in ways to continue to incent investment in this grid across this entire country, not ways to disincent.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're off to a very good start in 2019. Last night we reported GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share along with operating earnings of $0.67 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range. Steve will discuss later our results reflect the continued success of our regulated growth strategies.
Let's begin with an update on our progress so far this year. In our transmission business, we're on pace to implement a planned $1.2 billion investment in our Energizing the Future program in 2019, with most of that work in our ATSI and MAIT service territories in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Just a reminder, Energizing the Future is a multiyear program to improve the reliability, resiliency and security of FirstEnergy's portion of the bulk electric system that is shared by our entire nation. It's working. Just one example is that we have reduced transmission outages due to equipment failures on our ATSI system during the first 4 years of the program by 37%. And while we are still finalizing year 5 results, it looks like that will increase to eliminate more than half of the equipment-related outages in ATSI. We expect similar results in MAIT as we move forward. We currently have about 1,000 projects underway in stages ranging from engineering and project development to project management and construction. Many of these are multiyear endeavors, and we expect to bring 600 to 700 projects in service in 2019, which is consistent with our pace during the last several years of this customer-focused initiative.
To support our Energizing the Future initiative, this month we opened our Center for Advanced Energy Technology or CAET in acronym. This 88,000 square foot facility is one of the most comprehensive grid technology testing and training center of its kind in the country. We designed it to be a centralized, hands-on environment where our engineers and technicians can develop and evaluate new technologies and grid solutions and simulate a variety of real-world conditions. It also includes classroom space where we can train our workforce to safely use new equipment and processes as we upgrade, maintain and ensure the security of our grid. 
In addition to supporting our grid modernization program, CAET also creates opportunities for us to advance best practices across the industry. We hope to collaborate with peer utilities, research institutes and key stakeholders such as device manufacturers who could potentially utilize our state-of-the-art facility.
Turning to our distribution business, as we mentioned last quarter, our Ohio utilities filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission in early February for a 2-year extension to the Distribution Modernization Rider. Again, while we believe we have a strong case to continue this rider, I will remind you that it is not factored into our current earnings growth projections. Also, in Ohio, our supplemental settlement regarding tax reform and grid modernization is pending with the PUCO. This proposed settlement addresses how customers will benefit from savings associated with federal tax reform and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid monetization program with investments of $516 million over 3 years.
In New Jersey, we were very pleased to reach a settlement yesterday with a staff of the Board of Public Utilities, the division of Rate Counsel, and the New Jersey Large Energy Users Coalition for our infrastructure investment program. Our JCP&L Reliability Plus program builds on the service enhancements we have made and our New Jersey footprint in recent years with an additional $97 million investment. Through this program, we plan to implement more than 1,400 targeted projects to enhance the reliability and resiliency of overhead power lines, replace existing equipment with smart technology devices and expand the Vegetation Management Program to reduce tree-related outages. On final approval from the BPU, the work will take place between June 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Once the projects are complete, customers will experience fewer sustained outages under normal conditions as well as a reduction in outage duration. 
While there was a difference between our original IIP request and the settlement amount, we have plenty of opportunities to make those capital investments in other parts of our system, both in distribution and transmission. We will also contemplate filing a subsequent IIP in New Jersey to continue our investments there beyond 2020.
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission issued a final order in our Potomac Edison rate case on March 22. The order fully resolved tax reform in Maryland, calls for a final bill credit to customers to return prior period tax savings and allows Potomac Edison to increase base distribution rates by $6.2 million, net of tax reform, to invest in safety and reliability enhancements. In addition, the Public Service Commission approved a 4-year electric distribution and infrastructure surcharge rider. That program what we use to recover incremental cost related to 3 reliability programs, which include installing more distribution automation equipment, accelerating an underground cable replacement program and utilizing new substation reclosers that can minimize the number of customers impacted by service interruptions. Potomac Edison is required to file another distribution rate case at the end of the surcharge period.
In January, the Public Service Commission also approved Potomac Edison's 5-year $12 million pilot program to install electrical vehicle charging stations in Maryland and offer rebates for charger installations. As part of the program, Potomac Edison plans to install 59 public charging stations at locations across our Maryland service territory, including 9 fast chargers. Residential customers will be eligible for rebates for the installation of EV charging stations at their home, and rebates will also be available for charging stations installed at multifamily properties. We're proud to support Maryland's efforts to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, which is an important step for a cleaner, healthier environment. We see projects like this as a natural fit for FirstEnergy as we fulfill our mission to become a forward-looking utility committed to making our customers lives brighter, the environment better and our communities stronger.
Our environmental, social and government strategy is built on the pillars of our mission statement. In 2019, we are continuing our efforts to offer greater transparency and engagement with our ESG goals. Late this year we will produce a new corporate responsibility report to examine our efforts on issues as wide-ranging as diversity and inclusion, our environmental footprint, corporate governance and community support. This will complement our first climate report, which we published earlier this month. The climate report looks at how our strategies, as a fully regulated utility, are aligned with the emerging technology trends that support a lower carbon future and examines the business risk associated with a carbon-constrained economy. It also reviews our significant progress towards the carbon dioxide reduction goal we announced in 2015. We pledged to reduce CO2 emissions from our generating fleet by at least 90%, below 2005 levels by the year 2045.
At the end of 2018, we had already achieved a reduction of 62%, with about 3 quarters of that reduction related to plant retirements. We expect to reach a CO2 reduction of 80% later this year, well on our way to achieving our goal.
I want to express our experience with plant decommissioning activities. Over the past 12 years, we safely and responsibly retired and remediated 7 coal plants and successfully anticipated the economic and environmental concerns for each site. This is just one of the ways in which we have demonstrated our commitment to corporate responsibility. It is a core value that we stand by at all times and that includes during the FES bankruptcy. That is why a key component of a settlement agreement was our substantial support for FES to both emerge from bankruptcy and meet any legacy and future obligation. This includes all environmental responsibilities that could occur when the plants are eventually retired. Following the judge's decision on the FES bankruptcy earlier this month, FES committed to engage with the Department of Justice and other concerned parties. In light of the commitment by FES, our previous assessment of the obligations and the surety and funding that are already in place, we see no increased risk to removing the broad third-party releases from the comprehensive settlement. While these releases would have served to bring finality to FirstEnergy's involvement with these legacy assets, removing the releases does not, in our assessment and experience, increase liabilities or obligations to our company. We are pleased that FES has submitted a revised disclosure statement and believe they will continue to work constructively with all parties to ensure both timely approval of their plan and their bankruptcy exit. At the same time, we will remain focused on delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our 6 million customers, with a commitment to environmental stewardship, corporate responsibility and implementing our regulated growth strategy. 
We are affirming our 2019 full year operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share, including this year's DMR. In addition, we are introducing a second quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share and affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021.
Thank you. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for a review of the first quarter and other financial developments."
293515,610765208,1704087,"FirstEnergy Corp., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,"Earnings Calls","FirstEnergy Corp.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to join you today. As usual, I'll begin with a couple of reminders.

It's my pleasure to join you today. As usual, I'll begin with a couple of reminders. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view of our performance.
With that, let's take a look at our results. First quarter GAAP earnings were $0.59 per share. Operating earnings were $0.67 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this is above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results benefited from higher weather-adjusted residential load and lower interest expense related to debt refinancing. I'll spend more time on that topic in just a few minutes. These factors were offset by a higher depreciation expense related to our rate base.
Total distribution deliveries were essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2018, with a slight increase on a weather-adjusted basis. Heating degree days were close to normal for the quarter and comparable to the first quarter of 2018. Residential sales were a bright spot for us this quarter. Sales increased about 1% on a national basis. When adjusted for weather, the increase was almost 3%, with growth in both customer count and average usage. The upturn in weather-adjusted residential sales over the past 12 months is an encouraging sign.
In the commercial customer class, sales decreased about 1.5% on national basis and about 1% when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load was flat, marking the end to a long 10 quarter run of growth in that segment. The results reflect lower demand from steel and automotive manufacturers, which offset growth -- continued growth in the shale and chemical industries.
Turning to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base, which reflects our continued investment in the Energizing the Future initiative. This was partially offset by higher operating expenses at our stated rate transmission companies.
And finally, in our corporate segment, first quarter results reflected higher net financing costs in the absence of commodity margin from the Pleasants Power Station. As a reminder, we began to exclude Pleasants from our operating earnings in mid-2018 due to the court-approved settlement that transfers economic interest of the plant to FES. These factors were partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Touching on underlying strengths of our distribution and transmission companies, we have recently seen positive credit ratings actions for several of our subsidiaries.
Near the end of March, Moody's issued one notch upgrades to ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L. And last week Fitch issued one notch upgrade to JCP&L, Mon Power, Potomac Edison and Allegheny Energy Generating Company. We believe these positive actions are a testament to our overall improved risk profile, and we expect to see continued positive momentum.
Before I close, I'll take a moment to review our financing activity this year. At our Utilities, we refinanced $300 million of maturing debt at both JCP&L and Met-Ed during the quarter. We issued new senior notes totaling $900 million to repay short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures at these Utilities. We also issued $500 million of new debt at FirstEnergy Transmission and $100 million at ATSI, primarily to repay short-term borrowings and fund continued investments in our Energizing the Future program.
Lastly, from a liquidity perspective, as of Friday, April 19, we had approximately $3.7 billion of liquidity, of which $200 million was cash.
Thank you for your time. We had a very solid quarter, and we're off to a great start this year. Now let's take your questions."

It's now the second time we've been able to reach a settlement in New Jersey with the main parties that influence our ability to do our business over there. Very happy with the settlement. To put it in perspective, it's $97 million over an 18-month period, which begins in June of this year and ends at the end of 2020. So just to give you a little perspective, we're talking Ohio about $516 million over 3 years, that's double the number of customers. So, if you have that, it's $258 million. And it's double the number of years, 3 versus 1.5. So, you have it again, it's a $129 million. So we're spending $97 million in New Jersey versus a $129 million in Ohio on an apples-to-apples basis. It's a good start, and we're very happy with it. And I believe if we execute to perfection, and we deliver the results that we intend to deliver in New Jersey, we won't have any problem negotiating an addition to this that goes beyond 2020."

And let me just comment on that a little bit more. I would say that, that caught us by surprise with the focus of the court being solely on the releases and not on the actual settlement, because we believed in the actual settlement that we have provided substantial value to make sure that FES can emerge, operate these assets and deal with any retirement obligations, when those come down the road. So we felt like the nonconsensual releases weren't a big deal because of the substantial settlement that was on the table. But since the focus was on those, we decided to remove those and move forward. So now the next step in the process is for the court to move or to approve the disclosure statements and allow the process to continue moving forward. We're hopeful that will happen on May 20. And then they will continue to make their case for emergence, and we expect that to happen sometime later this summer. And then the license transfers would be on the critical path, if it all flows that way."

So we've got a good track record of what the cost to do that are. And the surety bond is -- was put in place to ensure that there is surety for those costs should we at some point not decide to do it, but we're not going to do that. And I want to say very clearly what I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to stand behind any environmental commitment that we have. If we sell a power plant, we're still in that chain of ownership at some point if the new owners would default. But the other thing I want to say very clearly is, we're not afraid of that, because we've shut down, retired, remediated, tore down and turned over sites in some cases for 7 coal-fired power plants already. The cost -- the benefit that you get out of the scrap, steel, iron, copper, aluminum, the property value, et cetera, this is not any big deal for FirstEnergy. And so we're going to move forward fine. But as I said before and I want to repeat, we provided substantial benefits to FES that they're going to have the ability to take care of this on their own."

And get it certified that way by the state EPAs that have jurisdiction over these sites. So there's just that much risk. The value of the scrap and the value of the property offset, and there's a cottage industry that has developed as a result of the number of power plants closing around this country to take these plants off their hands, they actually offer to pay you in some cases for the opportunity to deal with this legacy issue on your behalf.

Once FES emerges, we will issue that note, and that will be outstanding until the end of 2022. In terms of financing activity, I suspect that at some point in time over the next 12 months we will most likely go out into the bond markets and refinance the term loan position and potentially do some liability management on some of the bonds that mature in 2022 and 2023. So you could see a sizable bond deal at some point in time at FE Corp over the next, let's say, 12 months. And as Chuck said, our holding company debt is going to be around the mid-30s, 35% to 37% for the foreseeable future. And that's where we're going to be."

It's nice to be able to answer those instead of FES questions, but with West Virginia, here's what I'd say, we don't have any long-term strategy for West Virginia. We had in place a tree trimming strategy in particular because we had a number of storms dating back to the derecho back in 2013, I think that was that showed that we had some exposure there. But beyond that, West Virginia is kind of a state that we're in a business-as-usual mode. We're spending money every year. We're seeing some growth in West Virginia as a result of being a fully regulated state, industrial growth in the shale and chemicals sector and as well as in the north eastern part of West Virginia in our Potomac Edison West Virginia territory. We're seeing some growth there that's offsetting our cost. When we get to the point there where we think we need to have a rate case, we'll have a rate case. But right now we just don't see any need to. And I don't have any long-term strategy because I think we're performing okay and there's nothing that needs immediate attention in West Virginia.
With regard to Pennsylvania, we've made a concerted effort to improve our disclosures. And I think that means you all are going to be talking about Irene quite a bit. But I don't think we want to get into details about rates or returns and so forth on this call. So I'm just going to encourage you to talk with her off-line about it. But I will point out that in Pennsylvania, as of the 1st of this year, the DISC is turned on in all 4 of our operating companies in Pennsylvania. We cannot turn that DISC on unless we're underneath the threshold for allowed rate of return as the commission looks at it. So I think we're in good shape. We're using the DISC at all 4 companies. And I think we ought to take it off-line to talk about the details, because as we get more and more transparent, it's going to create a lot of questions that we just don't have time for on an earnings call."

It's providing a surety that they have ample supplies of electricity during the most strained times of year in frigid climates where natural gas cannot meet all of its obligations. So I think it's providing -- and just take for example the build that's pending here in Ohio, it's $2.50 per month on a residential customer bill. To provide that security, we all buy insurance for our homes, our cars and a lot of other things. It's a very cost-effective insurance policy that these states are taking out and it provides long-term economic benefit and clean air benefits, too. So I think these states are smart. And I'm on record and I'll continue to say, as long as I have this role, it's -- these states are making up for failed market policies that are not working correctly.

So the lower rate of return made sense for ATSI. When we founded MAIT, we founded MAIT from the beginning on a forward-looking formula rate with a 10.38% return. And MAIT is not that old. So I think it was set very recently. I don't think there's anything that we're worried about with regard to earned rate of returns in our transmission businesses. So I don't think there should be anything that you are worried about.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're off to a very good start in 2019. Last night we reported GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share along with operating earnings of $0.67 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range. Steve will discuss later our results reflect the continued success of our regulated growth strategies.
Let's begin with an update on our progress so far this year. In our transmission business, we're on pace to implement a planned $1.2 billion investment in our Energizing the Future program in 2019, with most of that work in our ATSI and MAIT service territories in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Just a reminder, Energizing the Future is a multiyear program to improve the reliability, resiliency and security of FirstEnergy's portion of the bulk electric system that is shared by our entire nation. It's working. Just one example is that we have reduced transmission outages due to equipment failures on our ATSI system during the first 4 years of the program by 37%. And while we are still finalizing year 5 results, it looks like that will increase to eliminate more than half of the equipment-related outages in ATSI. We expect similar results in MAIT as we move forward. We currently have about 1,000 projects underway in stages ranging from engineering and project development to project management and construction. Many of these are multiyear endeavors, and we expect to bring 600 to 700 projects in service in 2019, which is consistent with our pace during the last several years of this customer-focused initiative.
To support our Energizing the Future initiative, this month we opened our Center for Advanced Energy Technology or CAET in acronym. This 88,000 square foot facility is one of the most comprehensive grid technology testing and training center of its kind in the country. We designed it to be a centralized, hands-on environment where our engineers and technicians can develop and evaluate new technologies and grid solutions and simulate a variety of real-world conditions. It also includes classroom space where we can train our workforce to safely use new equipment and processes as we upgrade, maintain and ensure the security of our grid. 
In addition to supporting our grid modernization program, CAET also creates opportunities for us to advance best practices across the industry. We hope to collaborate with peer utilities, research institutes and key stakeholders such as device manufacturers who could potentially utilize our state-of-the-art facility.
Turning to our distribution business, as we mentioned last quarter, our Ohio utilities filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission in early February for a 2-year extension to the Distribution Modernization Rider. Again, while we believe we have a strong case to continue this rider, I will remind you that it is not factored into our current earnings growth projections. Also, in Ohio, our supplemental settlement regarding tax reform and grid modernization is pending with the PUCO. This proposed settlement addresses how customers will benefit from savings associated with federal tax reform and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid monetization program with investments of $516 million over 3 years.
In New Jersey, we were very pleased to reach a settlement yesterday with a staff of the Board of Public Utilities, the division of Rate Counsel, and the New Jersey Large Energy Users Coalition for our infrastructure investment program. Our JCP&L Reliability Plus program builds on the service enhancements we have made and our New Jersey footprint in recent years with an additional $97 million investment. Through this program, we plan to implement more than 1,400 targeted projects to enhance the reliability and resiliency of overhead power lines, replace existing equipment with smart technology devices and expand the Vegetation Management Program to reduce tree-related outages. On final approval from the BPU, the work will take place between June 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Once the projects are complete, customers will experience fewer sustained outages under normal conditions as well as a reduction in outage duration. 
While there was a difference between our original IIP request and the settlement amount, we have plenty of opportunities to make those capital investments in other parts of our system, both in distribution and transmission. We will also contemplate filing a subsequent IIP in New Jersey to continue our investments there beyond 2020.
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission issued a final order in our Potomac Edison rate case on March 22. The order fully resolved tax reform in Maryland, calls for a final bill credit to customers to return prior period tax savings and allows Potomac Edison to increase base distribution rates by $6.2 million, net of tax reform, to invest in safety and reliability enhancements. In addition, the Public Service Commission approved a 4-year electric distribution and infrastructure surcharge rider. That program what we use to recover incremental cost related to 3 reliability programs, which include installing more distribution automation equipment, accelerating an underground cable replacement program and utilizing new substation reclosers that can minimize the number of customers impacted by service interruptions. Potomac Edison is required to file another distribution rate case at the end of the surcharge period.
In January, the Public Service Commission also approved Potomac Edison's 5-year $12 million pilot program to install electrical vehicle charging stations in Maryland and offer rebates for charger installations. As part of the program, Potomac Edison plans to install 59 public charging stations at locations across our Maryland service territory, including 9 fast chargers. Residential customers will be eligible for rebates for the installation of EV charging stations at their home, and rebates will also be available for charging stations installed at multifamily properties. We're proud to support Maryland's efforts to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, which is an important step for a cleaner, healthier environment. We see projects like this as a natural fit for FirstEnergy as we fulfill our mission to become a forward-looking utility committed to making our customers lives brighter, the environment better and our communities stronger.
Our environmental, social and government strategy is built on the pillars of our mission statement. In 2019, we are continuing our efforts to offer greater transparency and engagement with our ESG goals. Late this year we will produce a new corporate responsibility report to examine our efforts on issues as wide-ranging as diversity and inclusion, our environmental footprint, corporate governance and community support. This will complement our first climate report, which we published earlier this month. The climate report looks at how our strategies, as a fully regulated utility, are aligned with the emerging technology trends that support a lower carbon future and examines the business risk associated with a carbon-constrained economy. It also reviews our significant progress towards the carbon dioxide reduction goal we announced in 2015. We pledged to reduce CO2 emissions from our generating fleet by at least 90%, below 2005 levels by the year 2045.
At the end of 2018, we had already achieved a reduction of 62%, with about 3 quarters of that reduction related to plant retirements. We expect to reach a CO2 reduction of 80% later this year, well on our way to achieving our goal.
I want to express our experience with plant decommissioning activities. Over the past 12 years, we safely and responsibly retired and remediated 7 coal plants and successfully anticipated the economic and environmental concerns for each site. This is just one of the ways in which we have demonstrated our commitment to corporate responsibility. It is a core value that we stand by at all times and that includes during the FES bankruptcy. That is why a key component of a settlement agreement was our substantial support for FES to both emerge from bankruptcy and meet any legacy and future obligation. This includes all environmental responsibilities that could occur when the plants are eventually retired. Following the judge's decision on the FES bankruptcy earlier this month, FES committed to engage with the Department of Justice and other concerned parties. In light of the commitment by FES, our previous assessment of the obligations and the surety and funding that are already in place, we see no increased risk to removing the broad third-party releases from the comprehensive settlement. While these releases would have served to bring finality to FirstEnergy's involvement with these legacy assets, removing the releases does not, in our assessment and experience, increase liabilities or obligations to our company. We are pleased that FES has submitted a revised disclosure statement and believe they will continue to work constructively with all parties to ensure both timely approval of their plan and their bankruptcy exit. At the same time, we will remain focused on delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our 6 million customers, with a commitment to environmental stewardship, corporate responsibility and implementing our regulated growth strategy. 
We are affirming our 2019 full year operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share, including this year's DMR. In addition, we are introducing a second quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share and affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021.
Thank you. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for a review of the first quarter and other financial developments."

It's my pleasure to join you today. As usual, I'll begin with a couple of reminders. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights doc",607,"Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to join you today. As usual, I'll begin with a couple of reminders. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view of our performance.
With that, let's take a look at our results. First quarter GAAP earnings were $0.59 per share. Operating earnings were $0.67 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this is above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results benefited from higher weather-adjusted residential load and lower interest expense related to debt refinancing. I'll spend more time on that topic in just a few minutes. These factors were offset by a higher depreciation expense related to our rate base.
Total distribution deliveries were essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2018, with a slight increase on a weather-adjusted basis. Heating degree days were close to normal for the quarter and comparable to the first quarter of 2018. Residential sales were a bright spot for us this quarter. Sales increased about 1% on a national basis. When adjusted for weather, the increase was almost 3%, with growth in both customer count and average usage. The upturn in weather-adjusted residential sales over the past 12 months is an encouraging sign.
In the commercial customer class, sales decreased about 1.5% on national basis and about 1% when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load was flat, marking the end to a long 10 quarter run of growth in that segment. The results reflect lower demand from steel and automotive manufacturers, which offset growth -- continued growth in the shale and chemical industries.
Turning to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base, which reflects our continued investment in the Energizing the Future initiative. This was partially offset by higher operating expenses at our stated rate transmission companies.
And finally, in our corporate segment, first quarter results reflected higher net financing costs in the absence of commodity margin from the Pleasants Power Station. As a reminder, we began to exclude Pleasants from our operating earnings in mid-2018 due to the court-approved settlement that transfers economic interest of the plant to FES. These factors were partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Touching on underlying strengths of our distribution and transmission companies, we have recently seen positive credit ratings actions for several of our subsidiaries.
Near the end of March, Moody's issued one notch upgrades to ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L. And last week Fitch issued one notch upgrade to JCP&L, Mon Power, Potomac Edison and Allegheny Energy Generating Company. We believe these positive actions are a testament to our overall improved risk profile, and we expect to see continued positive momentum.
Before I close, I'll take a moment to review our financing activity this year. At our Utilities, we refinanced $300 million of maturing debt at both JCP&L and Met-Ed during the quarter. We issued new senior notes totaling $900 million to repay short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures at these Utilities. We also issued $500 million of new debt at FirstEnergy Transmission and $100 million at ATSI, primarily to repay short-term borrowings and fund continued investments in our Energizing the Future program.
Lastly, from a liquidity perspective, as of Friday, April 19, we had approximately $3.7 billion of liquidity, of which $200 million was cash.
Thank you for your time. We had a very solid quarter, and we're off to a great start this year. Now let's take your questions."

It's now the second time we've been able to reach a settlement in New Jersey with the main parties that influence our ability to do our business over there. Very happy with the settlement. To put it in perspective, it's $97 million over an 18-month period, which begins in June of this year and ends at the end of 2020. So just to give you a little perspective, we're talking Ohio about $516 million over 3 years, that's double the number of customers. So, if you have that, it's $258 million. And it's double the number of years, 3 versus 1.5. So, you have it again, it's a $129 million. So we're spending $97 million in New Jersey versus a $129 million in Ohio on an apples-to-apples basis. It's a good start, and we're very happy with it. And I believe if we execute to perfection, and we deliver the results that we intend to deliver in New Jersey, we won't have any problem negotiating an addition to this that goes beyond 2020."

And let me just comment on that a little bit more. I would say that, that caught us by surprise with the focus of the court being solely on the releases and not on the actual settlement, because we believed in the actual settlement that we have provided substantial value to make sure that FES can emerge, operate these assets and deal with any retirement obligations, when those come down the road. So we felt like the nonconsensual releases weren't a big deal because of the substantial settlement that was on the table. But since the focus was on those, we decided to remove those and move forward. So now the next step in the process is for the court to move or to approve the disclosure statements and allow the process to continue moving forward. We're hopeful that will happen on May 20. And then they will continue to make their case for emergence, and we expect that to happen sometime later this summer. And then the license transfers would be on the critical path, if it all flows that way."

So we've got a good track record of what the cost to do that are. And the surety bond is -- was put in place to ensure that there is surety for those costs should we at some point not decide to do it, but we're not going to do that. And I want to say very clearly what I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to stand behind any environmental commitment that we have. If we sell a power plant, we're still in that chain of ownership at some point if the new owners would default. But the other thing I want to say very clearly is, we're not afraid of that, because we've shut down, retired, remediated, tore down and turned over sites in some cases for 7 coal-fired power plants already. The cost -- the benefit that you get out of the scrap, steel, iron, copper, aluminum, the property value, et cetera, this is not any big deal for FirstEnergy. And so we're going to move forward fine.

Once FES emerges, we will issue that note, and that will be outstanding until the end of 2022. In terms of financing activity, I suspect that at some point in time over the next 12 months we will most likely go out into the bond markets and refinance the term loan position and potentially do some liability management on some of the bonds that mature in 2022 and 2023. So you could see a sizable bond deal at some point in time at FE Corp over the next, let's say, 12 months.

Well, first of all, thank you for asking regulated questions. It's nice to be able to answer those instead of FES questions, but with West Virginia, here's what I'd say, we don't have any long-term strategy for West Virginia. We had in place a tree trimming strategy in particular because we had a number of storms dating back to the derecho back in 2013, I think that was that showed that we had some exposure there. But beyond that, West Virginia is kind of a state that we're in a business-as-usual mode. We're spending money every year. We're seeing some growth in West Virginia as a result of being a fully regulated state, industrial growth in the shale and chemicals sector and as well as in the north eastern part of West Virginia in our Potomac Edison West Virginia territory. We're seeing some growth there that's offsetting our cost. When we get to the point there where we think we need to have a rate case, we'll have a rate case. But right now we just don't see any need to. And I don't have any long-term strategy because I think we're performing okay and there's nothing that needs immediate attention in West Virginia.
With regard to Pennsylvania, we've made a concerted effort to improve our disclosures. And I think that means you all are going to be talking about Irene quite a bit. But I don't think we want to get into details about rates or returns and so forth on this call. So I'm just going to encourage you to talk with her off-line about it. But I will point out that in Pennsylvania, as of the 1st of this year, the DISC is turned on in all 4 of our operating companies in Pennsylvania. We cannot turn that DISC on unless we're underneath the threshold for allowed rate of return as the commission looks at it. So I think we're in good shape. We're using the DISC at all 4 companies. And I think we ought to take it off-line to talk about the details, because as we get more and more transparent, it's going to create a lot of questions that we just don't have time for on an earnings call."

And it's providing a hedge against the most high-beta fuel that we've ever had in this industry, which is natural gas. It's providing a surety that they have ample supplies of electricity during the most strained times of year in frigid climates where natural gas cannot meet all of its obligations. So I think it's providing -- and just take for example the build that's pending here in Ohio, it's $2.50 per month on a residential customer bill. To provide that security, we all buy insurance for our homes, our cars and a lot of other things. It's a very cost-effective insurance policy that these states are taking out and it provides long-term economic benefit and clean air benefits, too. So I think these states are smart. And I'm on record and I'll continue to say, as long as I have this role, it's -- these states are making up for failed market policies that are not working correctly. When you form a market on nothing but a lease cost, marginal cost, it's not going to ever take care of the fixed cost of these important assets.

Unfortunately, we had a change in chairs and it's taken a while for them to get the train back on the track and move it forward there.

So the lower rate of return made sense for ATSI. When we founded MAIT, we founded MAIT from the beginning on a forward-looking formula rate with a 10.38% return. And MAIT is not that old. So I think it was set very recently. I don't think there's anything that we're worried about with regard to earned rate of returns in our transmission businesses. So I don't think there should be anything that you are worried about. And my read of the [ lease ], for what's it's worth at the FERC is while they're looking at rates of return, they're looking at them in ways to continue to incent investment in this grid across this entire country, not ways to disincent.

I am glad you could join us. Last night, we reported solid second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share along with operating earnings of $0.61 per share, which is above the midpoint of the guidance range, which we provided on our last call. While the mild spring weather across our service territory contributed to lower distribution sales this quarter, our results benefited from continued transmission rate base growth related to our Energizing the Future program as well as lower expenses. We are executing on our plans to focus on customer service oriented growth, as we strengthen our distribution and transmission systems and prepare them for the greater the future. 
As promised, these strategies are producing solid and consistent earnings growth that is in line with our guidance. The only downside I see is you may start to find our calls a little boring. But seriously, I'm very excited about where we're at FirstEnergy, but more importantly, where we are going.
Let's start with a review of some of the recent developments in our business over the last few months. Then Steve will walk you through the results and as always, we will have ample time for questions. In our transmission business, we remain on pace to implement $1.2 billion in Energizing the Future investments this year with 600 to 700 projects on track to come into service during 2019. Last week, we participated in a transmission summit hosted by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Our team briefed the commission and staff on the key areas of investment addressed by our Energizing the Future program, the need for this work and the benefits to customers as well as our process for project selection. When we began our Energizing the Future initiative, a large portion of the work supported projects required by regulators, which included changes taking place in the electric generation sector and supporting local low growth. Today, our transmission system is expected to withstand cyber attacks and extreme weather events, help predict when maintenance is needed and limit the impact of adages when they occur. Reflecting this shift, our investments are focused on utilizing technology to modernize the grid, enhance security and create greater operational flexibility, while also upgrading aging infrastructure.
As we discussed last quarter, these investments are designed to significantly reduce the impact of transmission outages on our electric customers. For example, where our work has been completed in our at sea service area since 2014, we've recognized a nearly 50% reduction in the duration of customer interruptions caused by a transmission outages and a 52% reduction in the number of customers affected by such outages. I would like to remind you that one transmission outage can impact tens of thousands of customers, so a 50% reduction in outage events is providing tremendous reliability benefits. To manage the hundreds of transmission projects in various stages of planning, development and construction each year, we are implementing our new performance and process called achieving performance excellence or Apex. The goal is to refine our transmission project management processes into a more structured consistent and efficient method of delivering projects as designed, on time and on budget.
Turning to our distribution business. On May 23, the Pennsylvania Public utility commission approved our modified long-term infrastructure investment plans or LTIPs. The plan's increased the spending in each of our 4 Pennsylvania operating companies in 2019 by a total of about $85 million. This includes accelerating capital that was planned for 2020, as well as additional capital to support enhancing reliability in the state. We are currently recovering these investments through the discwriter at all 4 utilities. Next month, we plan to file new LTIPs that will outline our Pennsylvania operating companies incremental reliability spending plan for the 2020 through 2024 period."

As promised, these strategies are producing solid and consistent earnings growth that is in line with our guidance. The only downside I see is you may start to find our calls a little boring. But seriously, I'm very excited about where we're at FirstEnergy but more importantly, where we are going.
Before we move from Pennsylvania, I will mention that we have signed a nonbinding term sheet to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning through 3 Mile Island Unit. This will transfer the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the responsibility for decommissioning to a subsidiary of energy solutions LLC, an industry leader in the nuclear decommissioning business. As background, TMI 2 is currently licensed to do GPU nuclear and owned by Met-Ed [indiscernible] and JCP&L. We acquired it in 2001 as part of the GP merger. Since it was not an operating plant, it was never part of FES or FENOC. While we are still at the beginning of the process, which requires numerous regulatory approvals, this agreement would future nuclear obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus.
Turning to New Jersey, the BPU approved our JCP&L reliability plus plan in early May, and we begun to implement this infrastructure investment plan with projects design to enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system. One of the first projects is installation of 1,700 new trip saver automated reclosing devices on local neighborhood powerlines. These devices help limit the frequency and duration of service interruptions by automatically detecting issues, isolating outages and pinpointing the location of problems to help speed restoration.
Now let's turn to Ohio where there has been quite a bit of activity over the last several weeks. Last week, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission for our grid monetization program. With investments of $516 million over 3 years. The stipulation was approved unanimously by all 5 commissioners, and the commissioners complemented the parties on reaching a global settlement that resolved many issues with the broad base of support. This order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in Ohio with our customers receiving 100% of the tax savings. We expect related refunds to begin this quarter. In addition, we will begin work to further modernize our Ohio electric distribution system, programmers designed to reduce the number and duration of outages and help our customers make informed decisions about their energy usage with advanced metering and communications. On July 15, we filed our 2018 significantly excessive earnings test or SEET results with the PUCO for each over 3 Ohio utilities. Each utilities individual 2018 return on equity was well below our calculated SEET threshold and the consolidated [indiscernible] for Ohio companies was 8.8% also well below calculated threshold. The Ohio operating budget approved last week included an amendment that allows us to combine our Ohio results under a single SEET review. This change will not increase our customers rates. It preserves an important consumer protection and maintains the ability of the PUCO and other interested stakeholders to assess our annual earnings. At the same time, it allows us to implement our rate plan in a manner that best serves customers across our entire Ohio footprint. In other developments, household 6 by the Ohio legislature and signed by Governor [indiscernible] yesterday. As you know, the key issue of household 6 provides nuclear assets in the state, while we no longer own this generation. We believe this legislation is good for our customers because it will contribute to the states economic success and the security and resiliency of the regional electric grid, while mitigating the potentially impact of uncertain electric markets on our customers electric bills now and in the future. Household 6 also include provisions that allow electrical utilities to implement a decoupling mechanism, which further supports energy efficiency initiatives that benefit Ohio customers, while providing revenue certainty to utilities. It would set residential and commercial base distribution related revenues at the levels collected in 2018, breaking the link between revenue and the amount of electricity consumed. While reviewing the potential impacts to our customers and the companies and could seek approval for this mechanism later in the year.
Finally, I know many of you are interested in the status of our Distribution Modernization Rider. As a bit of background, this rider was approved by the PUCO in 2016. It initially allowed the collection of $204 million in revenues each year for 3 years and that was adjusted to $168 million in 2018 after tax reform. 2019 is the last year of the initial rider, although we filed earlier this year to extend the DMR for 2 more years. In June, the Ohio Supreme Court issued a 4 to 3 decision calling for removal of rider DMR from our Ohio company's current rates, but the court recognized that the funds already returned under the rider are not subject to refund. Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities filed a motion for reconsideration with the court. We firmly believe the DMR was benefiting our customers by jumpstarting our investments in grid modernization. And we believe we have a solid argument to support our position. However, along with the motion for reconsideration, we proactively filed with the PUCO to make the DMR charges billed during the reconsideration period, which began July 1, subject to refund if the court ultimately orders, the rider DMR must be removed from our rate plan.
Given our peripheral year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per share. If we do not ultimately recover the approximately $0.12 per share contribution from the DMR for the second half of the year, we would expect results in the lower half of this range. We're also introducing a third quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.68 to $0.80 per share including the DMR of $0.06 per share. Finally, we're affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021. You'll recall that the DMR has never been included in our growth projections.
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the second quarter and the first half of the year."

It's good to speak with you today. As always, I'll begin with a couple of housekeeping items. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view of our performance. As of July 22, there are currently 181,520 preferred shares outstanding with conversions expected to be completed by January of 2020.
Now let's look at our results. Our second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share. Operating earnings were $0.61 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results were primarily impacted by very mild spring weather, which contrasted with a very hot spring in 2018. This drove lower load across all 3 of your customer classes. Results also reflect the absence of last year's benefit from a court ruling on costs incurred for renewable energy credits in Ohio. These factors were slightly offset by the impact of lower expenses and income taxes. Total distribution deliveries decreased compared to the second quarter of 2018, both in actual and weather adjusted basis. Heating degree days were 20% below normal for the second quarter and 23% lower than the second quarter of 2018, while cooling degree days were about 4% below normal and 28% below the same period in 2018. Residential sales decreased 9.7% on a natural basis compared to the second quarter of 2018 and 2.4% on a weather adjusted basis. Overall, our weather adjusted residential sales have grown modestly over the last 12-month period.
Second quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 5.6% on a natural basis and about 3.2% when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load decreased 1.7%, as continued growth in this shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel and automotive manufacturers. If you look back at the second quarter of 2018, steel sector usage was about the highest we have seen over the last 4-year period. And our automotive sector still included the now closed GM [indiscernible] plan. These changes contributed to the tough year-over-year comparison.
Moving to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the Energizing the Future initiative. And at our corporate segment, second quarter results reflect lower operating expenses, which offset higher net financing costs. Before I open the call to your questions, I'll review a few items within recent ratings activity. We're pleased that Moody's upgraded the credit ratings yesterday of several other utilities. Ohio [indiscernible] both -- were both upgraded from BAA1 to A3. CEI was upgraded from BAA3 to BAA2. And Toledo Edison was upgraded 2 notches from BAA3 to BAA1. The ratings outlook is positive for Ohio Edison and Penn Power and stable for CEI and Toledo Edison. We believe these upgrades in addition to those earlier this year by Moody's for ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L demonstrate the underlying strength and positive momentum of our regulated platform. In addition, as you may know, S&P recently revised its group rating methodology, which is used to determine issuer credit ratings for entities that are part of corporate groups. As a result, we expect to see positive actions for several of our operating companies that have the stronger credit ratings profile then the consolidated group. We are pleased with our progress this quarter and through the first half of this year. We remain focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing our plans. Now let's take your questions."

And then secondly, in addition to the mechanics of filing for it and applying it to the 2019 year, how should we think about establishing 2018 rights? That might be the trickier piece here, but how do we understand '18 versus '19?

And I don't think we are going to be prepared to speak to the exact nuances, and how it's going to affect either 2018 and 2019 till we get a chance to fully analyze it. But the bill was a clean energy bill at its heart. The decoupling is included in the bill to support Ohio's clean energy goals. It allows all of the utilities to continue to work with customers to drive further energy efficiencies without a concern for the impact on the revenues with the companies. In Ohio, we have a shared mechanism for lost distribution revenue that this now eliminates the needs for us to worry about that. And it's ultimately going to help reduce customers bills because that energy efficiency mandates on our bills were going to grow significantly over the next several years. AAP Duke and DPL already have some type of decoupling mechanisms in place. And I will point out. This applies to the base rates only. And as you already said Julien, it's a 90-day period before it goes into effect and then 30 day. So we're looking at November 20 would be the earliest date that we could file for being included under this new decoupling mechanism. And the commission would ultimately has 60 days to make a decision. So that pushes it to January 19. For me, as I look at it, I think if you combine the decoupling opportunity with the SEET provisions that were combined in -- that were included in the budget bill with our ESP that's already in place through 2024. It puts us in a position for our Ohio companies where the base distribution revenues can be very predictable and very strong. And the growth in our Ohio utilities is going to come from continued investments in the DCR rider and the $516 million that was just approved for the grid modernization rider. So I think it's going to ultimately provider a very clear and transparent story for our 3 Ohio companies. But I just can't give you the specifics on the details of how it affects '18 and '19 just yet. We've got to get into it."

Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. Last night, we reported solid second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share along with operating earnings of $0.61 per share, which is above the midpoint of the guidance range which we provided on our last call. While the mild spring weather across our service territory contributed to lower distribution sales this quarter, our results benefited from continued transmission rate base growth related to our Energizing the Future program as well as lower expenses. We are executing on our plans to focus on customer service-oriented growth as we strengthen our distribution and transmission systems and prepare them for the grid of the future.
As promised, these strategies are producing solid and consistent earnings growth that is in line with our guidance. The only downside I see is you may start to find our calls a little boring. But seriously, I'm very excited about where we're at FirstEnergy but more importantly, where we are going.
Let's start with a review of some of the recent developments in our business over the last few months. Then Steve will walk you through the results, and as always, we will have ample time for questions. In our transmission business, we remain on pace to implement $1.2 billion in Energizing the Future investments this year with 600 to 700 projects on track to come into service during 2019. Last week, we participated in a transmission summit hosted by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Our team briefed the commission and staff on the key areas of investment addressed by our Energizing the Future program, the need for this work and the benefits to customers as well as our process for project selection. When we began our Energizing the Future initiative, a large portion of the work supported projects required by regulators, which included changes taking place in the electric generation sector and supporting local low growth. Today, our transmission system is expected to withstand cyber attacks and extreme weather events, help predict when maintenance is needed and limit the impact of outages when they occur. Reflecting this shift, our investments are focused on utilizing technology to modernize the grid, enhance security and create greater operational flexibility, while also upgrading aging infrastructure.
As we discussed last quarter, these investments are designed to significantly reduce the impact of transmission outages on our electric customers. For example, where our work has been completed in our ATSI service area since 2014, we've recognized a nearly 50% reduction in the duration of customer interruptions caused by transmission outages and a 52% reduction in the number of customers affected by such outages. I would like to remind you that one transmission outage can impact tens of thousands of customers, so a 50% reduction in outage events is providing tremendous reliability benefits. To manage the hundreds of transmission projects in various stages of planning, development and construction each year, we are implementing our new performance management process called Achieving Performance Excellence or APEX. The goal is to refine our transmission project management processes into a more structured consistent and efficient method of delivering projects as designed, on time and on budget.
Turning to our distribution business. On May 23, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our modified long-term infrastructure investment plans or LTIPs. The plans increased the spending in each of our 4 Pennsylvania operating companies in 2019 by a total of about $85 million. This includes accelerating capital that was planned for 2020 as well as additional capital to support enhancing reliability in the state. We are currently recovering these investments through the DISC writer at all 4 utilities. Next month, we plan to file new LTIPs that will outline our Pennsylvania operating companies' incremental reliability spending plan for the 2020 through 2024 period.
Before we move from Pennsylvania, I will mention that we have signed a nonbinding term sheet to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning through Three Mile Island Unit 2. This would transfer the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the responsibility for decommissioning to a subsidiary of EnergySolutions, LLC, an industry leader in the nuclear decommissioning business. As background, TMI-2 is currently licensed to do GPU Nuclear and owned by Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L. We acquired it in 2001 as part of the GPU merger. Since it was not an operating plant, it was never part of FES or FENOC. While we are still at the beginning of the process, which requires numerous regulatory approvals, this agreement would transfer future nuclear obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus.
Turning to New Jersey, the BPU approved our JCP&L Reliability Plus plan in early May, and we've begun to implement this infrastructure investment plan with projects design to enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system. One of the first projects is installation of 1,700 new trip-saver, automated reclosing devices on local neighborhood power lines. These devices help limit the frequency and duration of service interruptions by automatically detecting issues, isolating outages and pinpointing the location of problems to help speed restoration.
Now let's turn to Ohio where there has been quite a bit of activity over the last several weeks. Last week, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission for our grid modernization program, with investments of $516 million over 3 years. The stipulation was approved unanimously by all 5 commissioners, and the commissioners complemented the parties on reaching a global settlement that resolved many issues with the broad base of support. This order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in Ohio with our customers receiving 100% of the tax savings. We expect related refunds to begin this quarter. In addition, we will begin work to further modernize our Ohio electric distribution system, programmers designed to reduce the number and duration of outages and help our customers make informed decisions about their energy usage with advanced metering and communications. On July 15, we filed our 2018 Significantly Excessive Earnings Test or SEET results with the PUCO for each of our 3 Ohio utilities. Each utility's individual 2018 return on equity was well below our calculated SEET threshold and the consolidated ROE for Ohio companies was 8.8%, also well below calculated threshold. The Ohio operating budget approved last week included an amendment that allows us to combine our Ohio results under a single SEET review. This change will not increase our customers' rates. It preserves an important consumer protection and maintains the ability of the PUCO and other interested stakeholders to assess our annual earnings. At the same time, it allows us to implement our rate plan in a manner that best serves customers across our entire Ohio footprint. In other developments, House Bill 6 was approved by the Ohio legislature and signed by Governor DeWine yesterday. As you know, the key issue of House Bill 6 is the support it provides to nuclear assets in the state. While we no longer own this generation, we believe this legislation is good for our customers because it will contribute to the state's economic success and the security and resiliency of the regional electric grid, while mitigating the potential impact of uncertain electric markets on our customers' electric bills now and in the future. House Bill 6 also include provisions that allow electrical utilities to implement a decoupling mechanism, which further supports energy efficiency initiatives that benefit Ohio customers, while providing revenue certainty to utilities. It would set residential and commercial base distribution-related revenues at the levels collected in 2018, breaking the link between revenue and the amount of electricity consumed. We're reviewing the potential impacts to our customers and the companies and could seek approval for this mechanism later in the year.
Finally, I know many of you are interested in the status of our Distribution Modernization Rider. As a bit of background, this rider was approved by the PUCO in 2016. It initially allowed the collection of $204 million in revenues each year for 3 years and that was adjusted to $168 million in 2018 after tax reform. 2019 is the last year of the initial rider, although we filed earlier this year to extend the DMR for 2 more years. In June, the Ohio Supreme Court issued a 4-3 decision calling for removal of rider DMR from our Ohio company's current rates, but the court recognized that the funds already recovered under the rider are not subject to refund. Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities filed a motion for reconsideration with the court. We firmly believe the DMR was benefiting our customers by jumpstarting our investments in grid modernization, and we believe we have a solid argument to support our position. However, along with the motion for reconsideration, we proactively filed with the PUCO to make the DMR charges billed during the reconsideration period, which began July 1, subject to refund, if the court ultimately orders, the rider DMR must be removed from our rate plan.
Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per share. If we do not ultimately recover the approximately $0.12 per share contribution from the DMR for the second half of the year, we would expect results in the lower half of this range. We're also introducing a third quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.68 to $0.80 per share, including the DMR of $0.06 per share. Finally, we are affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021. You'll recall that the DMR has never been included in our growth projections.
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the second quarter and the first half of the year."

It's good to speak with you today. As always, I'll begin with a couple of housekeeping items. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view of our performance. As of July 22, there are currently 181,520 preferred shares outstanding with conversions expected to be completed by January of 2020.
Now let's look at our results. Our second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share. Operating earnings were $0.61 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results were primarily impacted by very mild spring weather, which contrasted with a very hot spring in 2018. This drove lower load across to all 3 of your customer classes. Results also reflect the absence of last year's benefit from a court ruling on cost incurred for renewable energy credits in Ohio. These factors were slightly offset by the impact of lower expenses and income taxes. Total distribution deliveries decreased compared to the second quarter of 2018, both on actual and weather-adjusted basis. Heating degree days were 20% below normal for the second quarter and 23% lower than the second quarter of 2018, while cooling degree days were about 4% below normal and 28% below the same period in 2018. Residential sales decreased 9.7% on an actual basis compared to the second quarter of 2018 and 2.4% on a weather-adjusted basis. Overall, our weather-adjusted residential sales have grown modestly over the last 12-month period.
Second quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 5.6% on an actual basis and about 3.2% when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load decreased 1.7% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel and automotive manufacturers. If you look back at the second quarter of 2018, steel sector usage was about the highest we've seen over the last 4-year period. And our automotive sector still included the now closed GM Lordstown plant. These changes contributed to the tough year-over-year comparison.
Moving to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the Energizing the Future initiative. And at our corporate segment, second quarter results reflect lower operating expenses, which offset higher net financing costs. Before I open the call to your questions, I'll review a few items within recent ratings activity. We're pleased that Moody's upgraded the credit ratings yesterday of several other utilities. Ohio Edison and Penn Power, both -- were both upgraded from Baa1 to A3. CEI was upgraded from Baa3 to Baa2. And Toledo Edison was upgraded 2 notches from Baa3 to Baa1. The ratings outlook is positive for Ohio Edison and Penn Power and stable for CEI and Toledo Edison. We believe these upgrades, in addition to those earlier this year by Moody's for ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L, demonstrate the underlying strength and positive momentum of our regulated platform. In addition, as you may know, S&P recently revised its group rating methodology, which is used to determine issuer credit ratings for entities that are part of corporate groups. As a result, we expect to see positive actions for several of our operating companies that have a stronger credit ratings profile than the consolidated group. We are pleased with our progress this quarter and through the first half of this year. We remain focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing our plans. Now let's take your questions."

I know that there's a 90-day element to file for it, but how exactly would it be implemented with respect to full year '19? And then secondly, in addition to the mechanics of filing for and applying it to the 2019 year, how should we think about establishing 2018 rates? That might be the trickier piece here, but how do we understand '18 versus '19? And I appreciate the nuance that you have. These are the tracker mechanisms in place that make it a little bit apples and oranges at least from our side just to see it comparably. So if you don't mind because I get it, at the end of the day, this is a decoupling mechanism, but there's a few nuances here."

And I don't think we're going to be prepared to speak to the exact nuances and how it's going to affect either 2018 and 2019 till we get a chance to fully analyze it. But the bill was a clean energy bill at its heart. The decoupling is included in the bill to support Ohio's clean energy goals. It allows all of the utilities to continue to work with customers to drive further energy efficiencies without a concern for the impact on the revenues with the companies. In Ohio, we have a shared mechanism for lost distribution revenue that this now eliminates the need for us to worry about that. And it's ultimately going to help reduce customer bills because that energy efficiency mandates on our bills, we're going to grow significantly over the next several years. AEP, Duke and DP&L already had some type of decoupling mechanisms in place. And I'll point out, this applies to the base rates only. And as you already said, Julien, it's a 90-day period before it goes into effect and then 30 days. So we're looking at November 20 would be the earliest date that we could file for being included under this new decoupling mechanism. And the commission would ultimately -- has 60 days to make a decision, so that pushes it to January 19. For me, as I look at it, I think if you combine the decoupling opportunity with the SEET provisions that were combined -- that were included in the budget bill with our ESP that's already in place through 2024, it puts us in a position for our Ohio companies where the base distribution revenues can be very predictable and very strong. And the growth in our Ohio utilities is going to come from continued investments in the DCR rider and the $516 million that was just approved for the grid modernization rider. So I think it's going to ultimately provider a very clear and transparent story for our 3 Ohio companies. But I just can't give you the specifics on the details of how it affects '18 and '19 just yet. We've got to get into it."

Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. Last night, we reported solid second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share along with operating earnings of $0.61 per share, which is above the midpoint of the guidance range which we provided on our last call. While the mild spring weather across our service territory contributed to lower distribution sales this quarter, our results benefited from continued transmission rate base growth related to our Energizing the Future program as well as lower expenses. We are executing on our plans to focus on customer service-oriented growth as we strengthen our distribution and transmission systems and prepare them for the grid of the future.
As promised, these strategies are producing solid and consistent earnings growth that is in line with our guidance. The only downside I see is you may start to find our calls a little boring. But seriously, I'm very excited about where we're at at FirstEnergy but more importantly, where we are going.
Let's start with a review of some of the recent developments in our business over the last few months. Then Steve will walk you through the results, and as always, we will have ample time for your questions. In our transmission business, we remain on pace to implement $1.2 billion in Energizing the Future investments this year with 600 to 700 projects on track to come into service during 2019. Last week, we participated in a transmission summit hosted by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Our team briefed the commission and staff on the key areas of investment addressed by our Energizing the Future program, the need for this work and the benefits to customers as well as our process for project selection. When we began our Energizing the Future initiative, a large portion of the work supported projects required by regulators, which included changes taking place in the electric generation sector and supporting local low growth. Today, our transmission system is expected to withstand cyber attacks and extreme weather events, help predict when maintenance is needed and limit the impact of outages when they occur. Reflecting this shift, our investments are focused on utilizing technology to modernize the grid, enhance security and create greater operational flexibility, while also upgrading aging infrastructure.
As we discussed last quarter, these investments are designed to significantly reduce the impact of transmission outages on our electric customers. For example, where our work has been completed in our ATSI service area since 2014, we've recognized a nearly 50% reduction in the duration of customer interruptions caused by transmission outages and a 52% reduction in the number of customers affected by such outages. I would like to remind you that one transmission outage can impact tens of thousands of customers, so a 50% reduction in outage events is providing tremendous reliability benefits. To manage the hundreds of transmission projects in various stages of planning, development and construction each year, we are implementing our new performance management process called Achieving Performance Excellence or APEX. The goal is to refine our transmission project management processes into a more structured consistent and efficient method of delivering projects as designed, on time and on budget.
Turning to our distribution business. On May 23, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our modified long-term infrastructure investment plans or LTIPs. The plans increased the spending in each of our 4 Pennsylvania operating companies in 2019 by a total of about $85 million. This includes accelerating capital that was planned for 2020 as well as additional capital to support enhancing reliability in the state. We are currently recovering these investments through the DISC writer at all 4 utilities. Next month, we plan to file new LTIPs that will outline our Pennsylvania operating companies' incremental reliability spending plan for the 2020 through 2024 period.
Before we move from Pennsylvania, I will mention that we have signed a nonbinding term sheet to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning Three Mile Island Unit 2. This would transfer the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the responsibility for decommissioning to a subsidiary of EnergySolutions, LLC, an industry leader in the nuclear decommissioning business. As background, TMI-2 is currently licensed to do GPU Nuclear and owned by Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L. We acquired it in 2001 as part of the GPU merger. Since it was not an operating plant, it was never part of FES or FENOC. While we are still at the beginning of the process, which requires numerous regulatory approvals, this agreement would transfer future nuclear obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus.
Turning to New Jersey, the BPU approved our JCP&L Reliability Plus plan in early May, and we've begun to implement this infrastructure investment plan with projects design to enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system. One of the first projects is installation of 1,700 new trip-saver, automated reclosing devices on local neighborhood power lines. These devices help limit the frequency and duration of service interruptions by automatically detecting issues, isolating outages and pinpointing the location of problems to help speed restoration.
Now let's turn to Ohio where there has been quite a bit of activity over the last several weeks. Last week, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission for our grid modernization program, with investments of $516 million over 3 years. The stipulation was approved unanimously by all 5 commissioners, and the commissioners complemented the parties on reaching a global settlement that resolved many issues with the broad base of support. This order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in Ohio with our customers receiving 100% of the tax savings. We expect related refunds to begin this quarter. In addition, we will begin work to further modernize our Ohio electric distribution system, programmers designed to reduce the number and duration of outages and help our customers make informed decisions about their energy usage with advanced metering and communications. On July 15, we filed our 2018 Significantly Excessive Earnings Test or SEET results with the PUCO for each of our 3 Ohio utilities. Each utility's individual 2018 return on equity was well below our calculated SEET threshold and the consolidated ROE for Ohio companies was 8.8%, also well below calculated threshold. The Ohio operating budget approved last week included an amendment that allows us to combine our Ohio results under a single SEET review. This change will not increase our customers' rates. It preserves an important consumer protection and maintains the ability of the PUCO and other interested stakeholders to assess our annual earnings. At the same time, it allows us to implement our rate plan in a manner that best serves customers across our entire Ohio footprint. In other developments, House Bill 6 was approved by the Ohio legislature and signed by Governor DeWine yesterday. As you know, the key issue of House Bill 6 is the support it provides to nuclear assets in the state. While we no longer own this generation, we believe this legislation is good for our customers because it will contribute to the state's economic success and the security and resiliency of the regional electric grid, while mitigating the potential impact of uncertain electric markets on our customers' electric bills now and in the future. House Bill 6 also include provisions that allow electrical utilities to implement a decoupling mechanism, which further supports energy efficiency initiatives that benefit Ohio customers, while providing revenue certainty to utilities. It would set residential and commercial base distribution-related revenues at the levels collected in 2018, breaking the link between revenue and the amount of electricity consumed. We're reviewing the potential impacts to our customers and the companies and could seek approval for this mechanism later in the year.
Finally, I know many of you are interested in the status of our Distribution Modernization Rider. As a bit of background, this rider was approved by the PUCO in 2016. It initially allowed the collection of $204 million in revenues each year for 3 years and that was adjusted to $168 million in 2018 after tax reform. 2019 is the last year of the initial rider, although we filed earlier this year to extend the DMR for 2 more years. In June, the Ohio Supreme Court issued a 4-3 decision calling for removal of rider DMR from our Ohio company's current rates, but the court recognized that the funds already recovered under the rider are not subject to refund. Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities filed a motion for reconsideration with the court. We firmly believe the DMR was benefiting our customers by jumpstarting our investments in grid modernization, and we believe we have a solid legal argument to support our position. However, along with the motion for reconsideration, we proactively filed with the PUCO to make the DMR charges billed during the reconsideration period, which began July 1, subject to refund, if the court ultimately orders, the rider DMR must be removed from our rate plan.
Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per share. If we do not ultimately recover the approximately $0.12 per share contribution from the DMR for the second half of the year, we would expect results in the lower half of this range. We're also introducing a third quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.68 to $0.80 per share, including the DMR of $0.06 per share. Finally, we are affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021. You'll recall that the DMR has never been included in our growth projections.
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the second quarter and the first half of the year."

It's good to speak with you today. As always, I'll begin with a couple of housekeeping items. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view of our performance. As of July 22, there are currently 181,520 preferred shares outstanding with conversions expected to be completed by January of 2020.
Now let's look at our results. Our second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share. Operating earnings were $0.61 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results were primarily impacted by very mild spring weather, which contrasted with a very hot spring in 2018. This drove lower load across to all 3 of your customer classes. Results also reflect the absence of last year's benefit from a court ruling on cost incurred for renewable energy credits in Ohio. These factors were slightly offset by the impact of lower expenses and income taxes. Total distribution deliveries decreased compared to the second quarter of 2018, both on actual and weather-adjusted basis. Heating degree days were 20% below normal for the second quarter and 23% lower than the second quarter of 2018, while cooling degree days were about 4% below normal and 28% below the same period in 2018. Residential sales decreased 9.7% on an actual basis compared to the second quarter of 2018 and 2.4% on a weather-adjusted basis. Overall, our weather-adjusted residential sales have grown modestly over the last 12-month period.
Second quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 5.6% on an actual basis and about 3.2% when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load decreased 1.7% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel and automotive manufacturers. If you look back at the second quarter of 2018, steel sector usage was about the highest we've seen over the last 4-year period. And our automotive sector still included the now closed GM Lordstown plant. These changes contributed to the tough year-over-year comparison.
Moving to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the Energizing the Future initiative. And at our corporate segment, second quarter results reflect lower operating expenses, which offset higher net financing costs. Before I open the call to your questions, I'll review a few items within recent ratings activity. We're pleased that Moody's upgraded the credit ratings yesterday of several of our  utilities. Ohio Edison and Penn Power, both -- were both upgraded from Baa1 to A3. CEI was upgraded from Baa3 to Baa2. And Toledo Edison was upgraded 2 notches from Baa3 to Baa1. The ratings outlook is positive for Ohio Edison and Penn Power and stable for CEI and Toledo Edison. We believe these upgrades, in addition to those earlier this year by Moody's for ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L, demonstrate the underlying strength and positive momentum of our regulated platform. In addition, as you may know, S&P recently revised its group rating methodology, which is used to determine issuer credit ratings for entities that are part of corporate groups. As a result, we expect to see positive actions for several of our operating companies that have a stronger credit ratings profile than the consolidated group. We are pleased with our progress this quarter and through the first half of this year. We remain focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing our plans. Now let's take your questions."

I know that there's a 90-day element to file for it, but how exactly would it be implemented with respect to full year '19? And then secondly, in addition to the mechanics of filing for and applying it to the 2019 year, how should we think about establishing 2018 rates? That might be the trickier piece here, but how do we understand '18 versus '19? And I appreciate the nuance that you have. These are the tracker mechanisms in place that make it a little bit apples and oranges at least from our side just to see it comparably. So if you don't mind because I get it, at the end of the day, this is a decoupling mechanism, but there's a few nuances here."

And I don't think we're going to be prepared to speak to the exact nuances and how it's going to affect either 2018 and 2019 till we get a chance to fully analyze it. But the bill was a clean energy bill at its heart. The decoupling is included in the bill to support Ohio's clean energy goals. It allows all of the utilities to continue to work with customers to drive further energy efficiencies without a concern for the impact on the revenues with the companies. In Ohio, we have a shared mechanism for lost distribution revenue that this now eliminates the need for us to worry about that. And it's ultimately going to help reduce customer bills because that energy efficiency mandates on our bills, we're going to grow significantly over the next several years. AEP, Duke and DP&L already had some type of decoupling mechanisms in place. And I'll point out, this applies to the base rates only. And as you already said, Julien, it's a 90-day period before it goes into effect and then 30 days. So we're looking at November 20 would be the earliest date that we could file for being included under this new decoupling mechanism. And the commission would ultimately -- has 60 days to make a decision, so that pushes it to January 19. For me, as I look at it, I think if you combine the decoupling opportunity with the SEET provisions that were combined -- that were included in the budget bill with our ESP that's already in place through 2024, it puts us in a position for our Ohio companies where the base distribution revenues can be very predictable and very strong. And the growth in our Ohio utilities is going to come from continued investments in the DCR rider and the $516 million that was just approved for the grid modernization rider. So I think it's going to ultimately provider a very clear and transparent story for our 3 Ohio companies. But I just can't give you the specifics on the details of how it affects '18 and '19 just yet. We've got to get into it."

And then what you would do once you have a signed contract is -- or the 2 of you acting together since they can accelerate this decommissioning, you would go ahead and derisk the trust fund.

Last night, we reported solid second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share along with operating earnings of $0.61 per share, which is above the midpoint of the guidance range which we provided on our last call. While the mild spring weather across our service territory contributed to lower distribution sales this quarter, our results benefited from continued transmission rate base growth related to our Energizing the Future program as well as lower expenses. We are executing on our plans to focus on customer service-oriented growth as we strengthen our distribution and transmission systems and prepare them for the grid of the future.
As promised, these strategies are producing solid and consistent earnings growth that is in line with our guidance. The only downside I see is you may start to find our calls a little boring.

In our transmission business, we remain on pace to implement $1.2 billion in Energizing the Future investments this year with 600 to 700 projects on track to come into service during 2019. Last week, we participated in a transmission summit hosted by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Our team briefed the commission and staff on the key areas of investment addressed by our Energizing the Future program, the need for this work and the benefits to customers as well as our process for project selection. When we began our Energizing the Future initiative, a large portion of the work supported projects required by regulators, which included changes taking place in the electric generation sector and supporting local low growth. Today, our transmission system is expected to withstand cyberattacks and extreme weather events, help predict when maintenance is needed and limit the impact of outages when they occur. Reflecting this shift, our investments are focused on utilizing technology to modernize the grid, enhance security and create greater operational flexibility, while also upgrading aging infrastructure.
As we discussed last quarter, these investments are designed to significantly reduce the impact of transmission outages on our electric customers. For example, where our work has been completed in our ATSI service area since 2014, we've recognized a nearly 50% reduction in the duration of customer interruptions caused by transmission outages and a 52% reduction in the number of customers affected by such outages. I would like to remind you that one transmission outage can impact tens of thousands of customers, so a 50% reduction in outage events is providing tremendous reliability benefits. To manage the hundreds of transmission projects in various stages of planning, development and construction each year, we are implementing our new performance management process called Achieving Performance Excellence or APEX. The goal is to refine our transmission project management processes into a more structured consistent and efficient method of delivering projects as designed, on time and on budget.
Turning to our distribution business. On May 23, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our modified long-term infrastructure investment plans or LTIPs. The plans increased the spending in each of our 4 Pennsylvania operating companies in 2019 by a total of about $85 million. This includes accelerating capital that was planned for 2020 as well as additional capital to support enhancing reliability in the state. We are currently recovering these investments through the DISC writer at all 4 utilities. Next month, we plan to file new LTIPs that will outline our Pennsylvania operating companies' incremental reliability spending plan for the 2020 through 2024 period.
Before we move from Pennsylvania, I will mention that we have signed a nonbinding term sheet to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning Three Mile Island Unit 2. This would transfer the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the responsibility for decommissioning to a subsidiary of EnergySolutions, LLC, an industry leader in the nuclear decommissioning business. As background, TMI-2 is currently licensed to do GPU Nuclear and owned by Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L. We acquired it in 2001 as part of the GPU merger. Since it was not an operating plant, it was never part of FES or FENOC. While we are still at the beginning of the process, which requires numerous regulatory approvals, this agreement would transfer future nuclear obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus.
Turning to New Jersey, the BPU approved our JCP&L Reliability Plus plan in early May, and we've begun to implement this infrastructure investment plan with projects design to enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system. One of the first projects is installation of 1,700 new trip-saver, automated reclosing devices on local neighborhood power lines. These devices help limit the frequency and duration of service interruptions by automatically detecting issues, isolating outages and pinpointing the location of problems to help speed restoration.
Now let's turn to Ohio where there has been quite a bit of activity over the last several weeks. Last week, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission for our grid modernization program, with investments of $516 million over 3 years. The stipulation was approved unanimously by all 5 commissioners, and the commissioners complemented the parties on reaching a global settlement that resolved many issues with the broad base of support. This order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in Ohio with our customers receiving 100% of the tax savings. We expect related refunds to begin this quarter. In addition, we will begin work to further modernize our Ohio electric distribution system, programmers designed to reduce the number and duration of outages and help our customers make informed decisions about their energy usage with advanced metering and communications. On July 15, we filed our 2018 Significantly Excessive Earnings Test or SEET results with the PUCO for each of our 3 Ohio utilities. Each utility's individual 2018 return on equity was well below our calculated SEET threshold and the consolidated ROE for Ohio companies was 8.8%, also well below calculated threshold. The Ohio operating budget approved last week included an amendment that allows us to combine our Ohio results under a single SEET review. This change will not increase our customers' rates. It preserves an important consumer protection and maintains the ability of the PUCO and other interested stakeholders to assess our annual earnings. At the same time, it allows us to implement our rate plan in a manner that best serves customers across our entire Ohio footprint. In other developments, House Bill 6 was approved by the Ohio legislature and signed by Governor DeWine yesterday. As you know, the key issue of House Bill 6 is the support it provides to nuclear assets in the state. While we no longer own this generation, we believe this legislation is good for our customers because it will contribute to the state's economic success and the security and resiliency of the regional electric grid, while mitigating the potential impact of uncertain electric markets on our customers' electric bills now and in the future. House Bill 6 also include provisions that allow electrical utilities to implement a decoupling mechanism, which further supports energy efficiency initiatives that benefit Ohio customers, while providing revenue certainty to utilities. It would set residential and commercial base distribution-related revenues at the levels collected in 2018, breaking the link between revenue and the amount of electricity consumed. We're reviewing the potential impacts to our customers and the companies and could seek approval for this mechanism later in the year.
Finally, I know many of you are interested in the status of our Distribution Modernization Rider. As a bit of background, this rider was approved by the PUCO in 2016. It initially allowed the collection of $204 million in revenues each year for 3 years and that was adjusted to $168 million in 2018 after tax reform. 2019 is the last year of the initial rider, although we filed earlier this year to extend the DMR for 2 more years. In June, the Ohio Supreme Court issued a 4-3 decision calling for removal of rider DMR from our Ohio company's current rates, but the court recognized that the funds already recovered under the rider are not subject to refund. Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities filed a motion for reconsideration with the court. We firmly believe the DMR was benefiting our customers by jumpstarting our investments in grid modernization, and we believe we have a solid legal argument to support our position. However, along with the motion for reconsideration, we proactively filed with the PUCO to make the DMR charges billed during the reconsideration period, which began July 1, subject to refund, if the court ultimately orders, the rider DMR must be removed from our rate plan.
Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per share. If we do not ultimately recover the approximately $0.12 per share contribution from the DMR for the second half of the year, we would expect results in the lower half of this range. We're also introducing a third quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.68 to $0.80 per share, including the DMR of $0.06 per share. Finally, we are affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021. You'll recall that the DMR has never been included in our growth projections.
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the second quarter and the first half of the year."

It's good to speak with you today. As always, I'll begin with a couple of housekeeping items. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view of our performance. As of July 22, there are currently 181,520 preferred shares outstanding with conversions expected to be completed by January of 2020.
Now let's look at our results. Our second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share. Operating earnings were $0.61 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results were primarily impacted by very mild spring weather, which contrasted with a very hot spring in 2018. This drove lower load across to all 3 of your customer classes. Results also reflect the absence of last year's benefit from a court ruling on cost incurred for renewable energy credits in Ohio. These factors were slightly offset by the impact of lower expenses and income taxes. Total distribution deliveries decreased compared to the second quarter of 2018, both on actual and weather-adjusted basis. Heating degree days were 20% below normal for the second quarter and 23% lower than the second quarter of 2018, while cooling degree days were about 4% below normal and 28% below the same period in 2018. Residential sales decreased 9.7% on an actual basis compared to the second quarter of 2018 and 2.4% on a weather-adjusted basis. Overall, our weather-adjusted residential sales have grown modestly over the last 12-month period.
Second quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 5.6% on an actual basis and about 3.2% when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load decreased 1.7% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel and automotive manufacturers. If you look back at the second quarter of 2018, steel sector usage was about the highest we've seen over the last 4-year period. And our automotive sector still included the now closed GM Lordstown plant. These changes contributed to the tough year-over-year comparison.
Moving to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the Energizing the Future initiative. And at our corporate segment, second quarter results reflect lower operating expenses, which offset higher net financing costs. Before I open the call to your questions, I'll review a few items within recent ratings activity. We're pleased that Moody's upgraded the credit ratings yesterday of several of our utilities. Ohio Edison and Penn Power, both -- were both upgraded from Baa1 to A3. CEI was upgraded from Baa3 to Baa2. And Toledo Edison was upgraded 2 notches from Baa3 to Baa1. The ratings outlook is positive for Ohio Edison and Penn Power and stable for CEI and Toledo Edison. We believe these upgrades, in addition to those earlier this year by Moody's for ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L, demonstrate the underlying strength and positive momentum of our regulated platform. In addition, as you may know, S&P recently revised its group rating methodology, which is used to determine issuer credit ratings for entities that are part of corporate groups. As a result, we expect to see positive actions for several of our operating companies that have a stronger credit ratings profile than the consolidated group. We are pleased with our progress this quarter and through the first half of this year. We remain focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing our plans. Now let's take your questions."

I know that there's a 90-day element to file for it, but how exactly would it be implemented with respect to full year '19? And then secondly, in addition to the mechanics of filing for and applying it to the 2019 year, how should we think about establishing 2018 rates? That might be the trickier piece here, but how do we understand '18 versus '19? And I appreciate the nuance that you have. These are the tracker mechanisms in place that make it a little bit apples and oranges at least from our side just to see it comparably. So if you don't mind because I get it, at the end of the day, this is a decoupling mechanism, but there's a few nuances here."

And I don't think we're going to be prepared to speak to the exact nuances and how it's going to affect either 2018 and 2019 till we get a chance to fully analyze it. But the bill was a clean energy bill at its heart. The decoupling is included in the bill to support Ohio's clean energy goals. It allows all of the utilities to continue to work with customers to drive further energy efficiencies without a concern for the impact on the revenues with the companies. In Ohio, we have a shared mechanism for lost distribution revenue that this now eliminates the need for us to worry about that. And it's ultimately going to help reduce customer bills because that energy efficiency mandates on our bills, we're going to grow significantly over the next several years. AEP, Duke and DP&L already had some type of decoupling mechanisms in place. And I'll point out, this applies to the base rates only. And as you already said, Julien, it's a 90-day period before it goes into effect and then 30 days. So we're looking at November 20 would be the earliest date that we could file for being included under this new decoupling mechanism. And the commission would ultimately -- has 60 days to make a decision, so that pushes it to January 19. For me, as I look at it, I think if you combine the decoupling opportunity with the SEET provisions that were combined -- that were included in the budget bill with our ESP that's already in place through 2024, it puts us in a position for our Ohio companies where the base distribution revenues can be very predictable and very strong. And the growth in our Ohio utilities is going to come from continued investments in the DCR rider and the $516 million that was just approved for the grid modernization rider. So I think it's going to ultimately provider a very clear and transparent story for our 3 Ohio companies. But I just can't give you the specifics on the details of how it affects '18 and '19 just yet. We've got to get into it."

And then what you would do once you have a signed contract is -- or the 2 of you acting together since they can accelerate this decommissioning, you would go ahead and derisk the trust fund.

This morning, we announced strong results for the third quarter, with GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and operating earnings of $0.76 per share. Consistent with our nearly 5-year track record of delivering on our commitments to you, our third quarter operating earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. As a reminder, when we held our second quarter call, we were waiting for a final outcome related to our Ohio distribution modernization rider. Because of this, the third quarter guidance we provided to you included a $0.06 benefit from the DMR.  
While the rider was ultimately removed from our Ohio rate plan, I'm pleased to say that we were able to offset its absence during the quarter through a combination of favorable weather compared to normal, the continued strong execution of our customer service-oriented growth strategy and O&M discipline. 
For the full year, we are narrowing our 2019 operating earnings guidance to $2.50 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as the absence of the DMR in the second half. We're also providing 2020 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. And affirming our projection for [ 6% to 8% ] of compound annual operating earnings growth from 2018 through 2021. 
I know you're anxious for us to communicate both our CAGR and equity plans beyond the 2018 to 2021 time frame. We will provide this information as soon as it makes sense once we've completed our internal financial planning process. That should not be taken as any indication that either of these will ultimately be disappointing to the market. It's simply that I am very protective of our 5-year track record of meeting or exceeding every commitment we have made, and I need to get the detailed planning in place before getting ahead of that process. 
Now let's review our progress with our customer-focused growth strategies at our Utilities. In late August, each of our 4 Pennsylvania utilities filed new long-term infrastructure improvement plans, or LTIPs, for the 2020 through 2024 period. The filings outline our plans to invest $572 million over that time frame to accelerate infrastructure improvements and enhanced service reliability for more than 2 million customers in Pennsylvania. 
These investments build on earlier improvement plans and included targeted projects that are designed to reduce the frequency of electric service interruptions for customers and shorten the duration of outages when they do occur. Major initiatives will include replacing older infrastructure with new poles, overhead lines, underground cable, substation equipment, network vaults and manholes. 
Reconfiguring circuits to minimize customers impacted by service interruptions and installing more advanced smart devices that can detect and isolate problems to help quickly restore power to impacted customers. The work outlined in the LTIP programs accelerates infrastructure repairs, improvements and replacements, while also introducing new investments to enhance our distribution, infrastructure and service reliability. 
We expect to recover the costs associated with the LTIP through the DISC rider mechanism. We look forward to working with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to have the plans approved by the end of the year, so work can begin in early 2020. 
Before we move from Pennsylvania, on our last call, we mentioned that we were in discussions to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning 3-mile Island Unit 2 to a subsidiary of Energy Solutions, LLC. This would remove any future nuclear decommission obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus. 
In October, we signed that agreement, which includes transferring the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the associated liabilities and responsibility for decommissioning. While the agreement is subject to regulatory approvals, we expect transfer to take place around the second half of 2020. 
Turning to Ohio, we are beginning to implement our $516 million 3-year grid modernization program, which was approved by the Public Utilities Commission in July. We are laying the groundwork to begin construction on these projects during the first quarter of next year. Our investments include the installation of 700,000 smart meters and related infrastructure, building an advanced distribution management system in our Ohio Edison Alumina Company and Toledo Edison Service areas, selling automated equipment on at least 200 distribution lines that can automatically isolate problems to prevent entire circuit outages and quickly restore electric service to customers. 
Installing voltage-regulating equipment on more than 200 circuits to provide energy efficiency benefits by optimizing Goldie's levels on the distribution grid. In addition, we have committed to developing time bearing rates that give customers the opportunity to reduce their monthly electric bill by using energy during off-peak periods. 
Together, these modernization projects are expected to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage. As you'll recall, the grid mod order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and we began implementing those tax savings for customers on September 1. Later this month, we expect to file plans with the PUCO to implement a decoupling mechanism in Ohio. 
As we discussed last quarter, decoupling breaks the link between utility revenue and the amount of electricity consumed by customers. This supports continued energy efficiency efforts, while ensuring that our utilities have adequate resources to continue providing safe and reliable power to our customers. 
Our plan ensures that residential and commercial customers pay no more for base distribution service that was charged in 2018. After our filing, the commission will have 60 days to review and approve the application. 
Moving to our transmission business. Last week, we filed a plan with FERC to move our New Jersey transmission assets on to a forward-looking formula rate structure effective January 1, 2020. Base CP&L transmission assets are currently on stated rates based on a settlement approved by FERC in February of 2018. 
A rate moratorium that was part of that settlement will expire on December 31. Our forward-looking formula rate plan would support energizing the future investment needs in New Jersey, including approximately $175 million in capital spending planned for 2020. We expect an initial response from FERC by the end of December. 
Finally, in mid-October, the bankruptcy court approved FES' plan of reorganization. FES has stated that it plans to merge as an independent company with a new name by the end of this year. 
Now let's look ahead to next week when we will see many of you at EEI. At the meeting, we look forward to sharing with you our new corporate responsibility report and strategic plan. These reports support our commitment to increase transparency and engagement with investors, customers and other stakeholders, while providing a platform to track our progress as we transition to a cleaner, smarter and more sustainable energy future. 
Corporate responsibility report is aligned with the 5 pillars of our mission statement. It includes extensive detail on our initiatives from reducing the environmental impact of our operations. And upholding high standards for corporate governance to advancing employee and public safety, while building a diverse and inclusive workplace. 
The report includes our initial steps to provide data and alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards board metrics as well as links to our policies. We plan to update the corporate responsibility report annually, including a data refresh next year in alignment with our 2019 annual report. 
At EEI, we will also introduce our first public strategic plan using the foundation of our 7-core values, a plan clearly articulates our vision for the next 5 years. It includes our approach to the rapid changes in our industry, fueled by evolving customer expectations, emerging technologies and a lower carbon economy. 
As we have continuously demonstrated over the past several years, FirstEnergy and our dedicated employees are prepared to meet any challenge as we work together to deliver energy for a brighter future. Thank you for your time. We've made great progress this year, and we remain focused on executing our strategies for sustainable customer-focused growth that will continue to build value for our investors, customers, communities and employees. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the third quarter."

Also, you will",732,"Good morning. It's good to speak with you today. Before I begin, I will remind you that all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. 
Also, you will recall that because of the preferred shares issuance in January 2018, and we have been presenting our operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis to ensure the best comparative view of our performance. 
As of August 1, and all of the outstanding preferred shares were converted to common stock. 
Now let's review our results. Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share. Operating earnings were $0.76 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. 
In the distribution business, earnings decreased compared to the third quarter of 2018. And primarily as a result of more moderate weather compared to the very hot conditions last summer. Results for the third quarter of 2019 also reflects the absence of the DMR in Ohio, as well as higher expenses and depreciation. These factors were slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate and lower net financing costs. 
Distribution deliveries decreased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2018, both on an actual and weather-adjusted basis. Cooling degree days were 22% above normal for the third quarter, but 9% lower than the third quarter of 2018. Residential sales were down 2.2% on an actual basis compared to the third quarter of 2018, but slightly increased on a weather-adjusted basis. 
We continue to see a very slight increase in weather-adjusted residential sales over the last 12 months. Third quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 3.8% on an actual basis and 2.9% when adjusted for weather compared to the third quarter of 2018. This change was driven largely by lower demand in the education sector, partially due to the implementation of energy efficiency measures as well as decreases in the food and beverage and real estate sectors. 
In our industrial class, third quarter load decreased 1% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel, automotive and chemical manufacturers, including the impact of the shutdown of the GM Lordstown plant earlier this year.  
While we continue to watch these trends very closely, load for each customer segment remains in line with our forecast with bright spots, including stable residential customer usage and modest growth in both residential and commercial customer count. Looking at our transmission business, earnings increased primarily as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to the continued investment in the energizing the future program. 
And in our corporate segment, third quarter results reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a third quarter 2018 contribution to the FirstEnergy Foundation. 
Before we open the call to your questions. We have a few other financial matters to discuss. First, it is our custom to provide an estimate of the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, which is a noncash item, along with third quarter results. Based on market conditions as of September 30, we estimate that adjustment to be in the range of $400 million to $1 billion. 
As always, the final adjustment will be determined by the discount rate and asset returns at the end of the year. Our return on assets currently stand at a solid 17-plus percent for 2019. Looking ahead, if these results hold through the end of the year, we would be on track to decrease our 2022 funding requirements by approximately $140 million. 
In addition, while the lower interest rate environment resulted in a higher pension liability, our funded status has slightly improved to 78% from 77% and at year-end 2018. Second, during the third quarter, we successfully extended our corporate term loans and now have a $1 billion 1-year facility and a $750 million 2-year facility. We will evaluate refinancing some or all of these amounts into the capital markets sometime next year. 
Finally, we met with the rating agencies earlier this quarter to review our progress on our goals as a fully regulated company with an improved risk profile. We expect all 3 to provide normal course updates on our entities possibly as soon as EEI. Thank you. 
We continue to be committed to executing our strategies and meeting our commitments to investors. Now let's take your questions."

It allows us to continue to promote energy efficiency with our customers so that they can get the benefit of that without impacting our base revenues.

I mean, as you know, there's also some procedural stuff going on, stakeholder process at PJM. And I was just wondering what your thoughts were about. Your  perspective on these orders in these efforts? Well, I think GM, in particular, has a very transparent process already that affects these supplemental projects. And since that's where we operate. I'll comment on that. Because it's transparent, it's caused some of the questioning that goes on. But I will tell you that the projects that we do in transmission today, about half of the money is spent on PJM rtEP projects already. So those are already projects that PJM are saying are needed for future reliability reasons. And the rest fall into the category of what I call good asset management practice. And I think for the regulator, whether that be or even the state commissions to try to get too involved and how we do asset management as a business would be a mistake because we're the one ultimately responsible for making sure that this grid is reliable and resilient and able to perform for customers, not just today, but for the long term. And the projects that we're doing just fall into the typical asset management decisions you make when you're running a bulk -- piece of the bulk electric system and a system that serves 6 million customers.

This morning, we announced strong results for the third quarter with GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and operating earnings of $0.76 per share. Consistent with our nearly 5-year track record of delivering on our commitments to you, our third quarter operating earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. 
As a reminder, when we held our second quarter call, we were waiting for a final outcome related to our Ohio distribution modernization rider. Because of this, the third quarter guidance we provided to you included a $0.06 benefit from the DMR. While the rider was ultimately removed from our Ohio rate plan, I'm pleased to say that we were able to offset its absence during the quarter through a combination of favorable weather compared to normal, the continued strong execution of our customer service-oriented growth strategy and O&M discipline. 
For the full year, we are narrowing our 2019 operating earnings guidance to $2.50 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as the absence of the DMR in the second half. We're also providing 2020 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share and affirming our projection for 6% to 8% of compound annual operating earnings growth from 2018 through 2021. 
I know you're anxious for us to communicate both our CAGR and equity plans beyond the 2018 to 2021 time frame. We will provide this information as soon as it makes sense once we've completed our internal financial planning process. That should not be taken as any indication that either of these will ultimately be disappointing to the market. It's simply that I am very protective of our 5-year track record of meeting or exceeding every commitment we have made, and I need to get the detailed planning in place before getting ahead of that process. 
Now let's review our progress with our customer-focused growth strategies at our utilities. In late August, each of our 4 Pennsylvania utilities filed new long-term infrastructure improvement plans, or LTIPs, for the 2020 through 2024 period. The filings outline our plans to invest $572 million over that time frame to accelerate infrastructure improvements and enhance service reliability for more than 2 million customers in Pennsylvania. These investments build on earlier improvement plans and included targeted projects that are designed to reduce the frequency of electric service interruptions for customers and shorten the duration of outages when they do occur. 
Major initiatives will include replacing older infrastructure with new poles, overhead lines, underground cables, substation equipment, network vaults and manholes; reconfiguring circuits to minimize customers impacted by service interruptions; and installing more advanced smart devices that can detect and isolate problems to help quickly restore power to impacted customers. The work outlined in the LTIP programs accelerates infrastructure repairs, improvements and replacements while also introducing new investments to enhance our distribution, infrastructure and service reliability. 
We expect to recover the costs associated with the LTIP through the DISC rider mechanism. We look forward to working with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to have the plans approved by the end of the year so work can begin in early 2020. 
Before we move from Pennsylvania, on our last call, we mentioned that we were in discussions to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning Three Mile Island Unit 2 to a subsidiary of Energy Solutions LLC. This would remove any future nuclear decommission obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus. 
In October, we signed that agreement, which includes transferring the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the associated liabilities and responsibility for decommissioning. While the agreement is subject to regulatory approvals, we expect transfer to take place around the second half of 2020. 
Turning to Ohio, we are beginning to implement our $516 million 3-year grid modernization program, which was approved by the Public Utilities Commission in July. We are laying the groundwork to begin construction on these projects during the first quarter of next year. Our investments include the installation of 700,000 smart meters and related infrastructure, building an advanced distribution management system in our Ohio Edison Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison service areas; installing automated equipment on at least 200 distribution lines that can automatically isolate problems to prevent entire circuit outages and quickly restore electric service to customers; installing voltage-regulating equipment on more than 200 circuits to provide energy efficiency benefits by optimizing voltage levels on the distribution grid. In addition, we have committed to developing time-varying rates that give customers the opportunity to reduce their monthly electric bill by using energy during off-peak periods. 
Together, these modernization projects are expected to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage. As you'll recall, the grid mod order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and we began implementing those tax savings for customers on September 1. 
Later this month, we expect to file plans with the PUCO to implement a decoupling mechanism in Ohio. As we discussed last quarter, decoupling breaks the link between utility revenue and the amount of electricity consumed by customers. This supports continued energy efficiency efforts while ensuring that our utilities have adequate resources to continue providing safe and reliable power to our customers. Our plan ensures that residential and commercial customers pay no more for base distribution service that was charged in 2018. After our filing, the commission will have 60 days to review and approve the application. 
Moving to our transmission business. Last week, we filed a plan with FERC to move our New Jersey transmission assets onto a forward-looking formula rate structure effective January 1, 2020. JCP&L transmission assets are currently on stated rates based on a settlement approved by FERC in February of 2018. A rate moratorium that was part of that settlement will expire on December 31. Our forward-looking formula rate plan would support energizing the future investment needs in New Jersey, including approximately $175 million in capital spending planned for 2020. We expect an initial response from FERC by the end of December. 
Finally, in mid-October, the Bankruptcy Court approved FES' plan of reorganization. FES has stated that it plans to merge as an independent company with a new name by the end of this year. 
Now let's look ahead to next week when we will see many of you at EEI. At the meeting, we look forward to sharing with you our new corporate responsibility report and strategic plan. These reports support our commitment to increase transparency and engagement with investors, customers and other stakeholders while providing a platform to track our progress as we transition to a cleaner, smarter and more sustainable energy future. Corporate responsibility report is aligned with the 5 pillars of our mission statement. It includes extensive detail on our initiatives from reducing the environmental impact of our operations and upholding high standards for corporate governance to advancing employee and public safety while building a diverse and inclusive workplace. The report includes our initial steps to provide data and alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board metrics as well as links to our policies. We plan to update the corporate responsibility report annually, including a data refresh next year in alignment with our 2019 annual report. 
At EEI, we will also introduce our first public strategic plan. Using the foundation of our 7 core values, the plan clearly articulates our vision for the next 5 years. It includes our approach to the rapid changes in our industry, fueled by evolving customer expectations, emerging technologies and a lower carbon economy. As we have continuously demonstrated over the past several years, FirstEnergy and our dedicated employees are prepared to meet any challenge as we work together to deliver energy for a brighter future. 
Thank you for your time. We've made great progress this year, and we remain focused on executing our strategies for sustainable customer-focused growth that will continue to build value for our investors, customers, communities and employees. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the third quarter."

Before I begin, I will remind you that all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document.

Before I begin, I will remind you that all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. 
Also, you will recall that because of the preferred shares issuance in January 2018, we have been presenting our operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis to ensure the best comparative view of our performance. As of August 1, all of the outstanding preferred shares were converted to common stock. 
Now let's review our results. Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share. Operating earnings were $0.76 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. 
In the distribution business, earnings decreased compared to the third quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of more moderate weather compared to the very hot conditions last summer. Results for the third quarter of 2019 also reflect the absence of the DMR in Ohio as well as higher expenses and depreciation. These factors were slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate and lower net financing costs.
Distribution deliveries decreased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2018 both on an actual and weather-adjusted basis. Cooling degree days were 22% above normal for the third quarter, but 9% lower than the third quarter of 2018. Residential sales were down 2.2% on an actual basis compared to the third quarter of 2018 but slightly increased on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see a very slight increase in weather-adjusted residential sales over the last 12 months. 
Third quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 3.8% on an actual basis and 2.9% when adjusted for weather compared to the third quarter of 2018. This change was driven largely by lower demand in the education sector, partially due to the implementation of energy efficiency measures as well as decreases in the food and beverage and real estate sectors. 
In our industrial class, third quarter load decreased 1% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel, automotive and chemical manufacturers, including the impact of the shutdown of the GM Lordstown plant earlier this year. While we continue to watch these trends very closely, load for each customer segment remains in line with our forecast with bright spots, including stable residential customer usage and modest growth in both residential and commercial customer count. 
Looking at our transmission business, earnings increased primarily as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to the continued investments in the Energizing the Future program. 
And in our Corporate segment, third quarter results reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a third quarter 2018 contribution to the FirstEnergy Foundation. 
Before we open the call to your questions, we have a few other financial matters to discuss. First, it is our custom to provide an estimate of the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, which is a noncash item, along with third quarter results. Based on market conditions as of September 30, we estimate that adjustment to be in the range of $400 million to $1 billion. As always, the final adjustment will be determined by the discount rate and asset returns at the end of the year. 
Our return on assets currently stand at a solid 17-plus percent for 2019. Looking ahead, if these results hold through the end of the year, we would be on track to decrease our 2022 funding requirements by approximately $140 million. 
In addition, while the lower interest rate environment resulted in a higher pension liability, our funded status has slightly improved to 78% from 77% at year-end 2018. 
Second, during the third quarter, we successfully extended our corporate term loans and now have a $1 billion 1-year facility and a $750 million 2-year facility. We will evaluate refinancing some or all of these amounts into the capital markets sometime next year. 
Finally, we met with the rating agencies earlier this quarter to review our progress on our goals as a fully regulated company with an improved risk profile. We expect all 3 to provide normal course updates on our entities possibly as soon as EEI. 
Thank you. We continue to be committed to executing our strategies and meeting our commitments to investors. Now let's take your questions."

As far as how I look at it, I think it establishes a fixed cost for the base distribution costs in Ohio. Obviously, the DCR and the grid mod riders are on top of that. But by establishing this fixed base, it's going to accomplish what the legislature tried to do. It allows us to continue to promote energy efficiency with our customers so that they can get the benefit of that without impacting our base revenues. 
I think you pointed out the risk piece of it. It fixes our base revenues. And essentially, it takes about 1/3 of our company and I think makes it somewhat recession-proof.

This morning, we announced strong results for the third quarter with GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and operating earnings of $0.76 per share.

This morning, we announced strong results for the third quarter with GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and operating earnings of $0.76 per share. Consistent with our nearly 5-year track record of delivering on our commitments to you, our third quarter operating earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. 
As a reminder, when we held our second quarter call, we were waiting for a final outcome related to our Ohio distribution modernization rider. Because of this, the third quarter guidance we provided to you included a $0.06 benefit from the DMR. While the rider was ultimately removed from our Ohio rate plan, I'm pleased to say that we were able to offset its absence during the quarter through a combination of favorable weather compared to normal, the continued strong execution of our customer service-oriented growth strategy and O&M discipline. 
For the full year, we are narrowing our 2019 operating earnings guidance to $2.50 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as the absence of the DMR in the second half. We're also providing 2020 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share and affirming our projection for 6% to 8% of compound annual operating earnings growth from 2018 through 2021. 
I know you're anxious for us to communicate both our CAGR and equity plans beyond the 2018 to 2021 time frame. We will provide this information as soon as it makes sense once we've completed our internal financial planning process. That should not be taken as any indication that either of these will ultimately be disappointing to the market. It's simply that I am very protective of our 5-year track record of meeting or exceeding every commitment we have made, and I need to get the detailed planning in place before getting ahead of that process. 
Now let's review our progress with our customer-focused growth strategies at our utilities. In late August, each of our 4 Pennsylvania utilities filed new long-term infrastructure improvement plans, or LTIPs, for the 2020 through 2024 period. The filings outline our plans to invest $572 million over that time frame to accelerate infrastructure improvements and enhance service reliability for more than 2 million customers in Pennsylvania. These investments build on earlier improvement plans and included targeted projects that are designed to reduce the frequency of electric service interruptions for customers and shorten the duration of outages when they do occur. 
Major initiatives will include replacing older infrastructure with new poles, overhead lines, underground cables, substation equipment, network vaults and manholes; reconfiguring circuits to minimize customers impacted by service interruptions; and installing more advanced smart devices that can detect and isolate problems to help quickly restore power to impacted customers. The work outlined in the LTIP programs accelerates infrastructure repairs, improvements and replacements while also introducing new investments to enhance our distribution, infrastructure and service reliability. 
We expect to recover the costs associated with the LTIP through the DISC rider mechanism. We look forward to working with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to have the plans approved by the end of the year so work can begin in early 2020. 
Before we move from Pennsylvania, on our last call, we mentioned that we were in discussions to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning Three Mile Island Unit 2 to a subsidiary of Energy Solutions LLC. This would remove any future nuclear decommission obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus. 
In October, we signed that agreement, which includes transferring the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the associated liabilities and responsibility for decommissioning. While the agreement is subject to regulatory approvals, we expect transfer to take place around the second half of 2020. 
Turning to Ohio, we are beginning to implement our $516 million 3-year grid modernization program, which was approved by the Public Utilities Commission in July. We are laying the groundwork to begin construction on these projects during the first quarter of next year. Our investments include the installation of 700,000 smart meters and related infrastructure, building an advanced distribution management system in our Ohio Edison Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison service areas; installing automated equipment on at least 200 distribution lines that can automatically isolate problems to prevent entire circuit outages and quickly restore electric service to customers; installing voltage-regulating equipment on more than 200 circuits to provide energy efficiency benefits by optimizing voltage levels on the distribution grid. In addition, we have committed to developing time-varying rates that give customers the opportunity to reduce their monthly electric bill by using energy during off-peak periods. 
Together, these modernization projects are expected to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage. As you'll recall, the grid mod order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and we began implementing those tax savings for customers on September 1. 
Later this month, we expect to file plans with the PUCO to implement a decoupling mechanism in Ohio. As we discussed last quarter, decoupling breaks the link between utility revenue and the amount of electricity consumed by customers. This supports continued energy efficiency efforts while ensuring that our utilities have adequate resources to continue providing safe and reliable power to our customers. Our plan ensures that residential and commercial customers pay no more for base distribution service than was charged in 2018. After our filing, the commission will have 60 days to review and approve the application. 
Moving to our transmission business. Last week, we filed a plan with FERC to move our New Jersey transmission assets onto a forward-looking formula rate structure effective January 1, 2020. JCP&L transmission assets are currently on stated rates based on a settlement approved by FERC in February of 2018. A rate moratorium that was part of that settlement will expire on December 31. Our forward-looking formula rate plan would support energizing the future investment needs in New Jersey, including approximately $175 million in capital spending planned for 2020. We expect an initial response from FERC by the end of December. 
Finally, in mid-October, the Bankruptcy Court approved FES' plan of reorganization. FES has stated that it plans to merge as an independent company with a new name by the end of this year. 
Now let's look ahead to next week when we will see many of you at EEI. At the meeting, we look forward to sharing with you our new corporate responsibility report and strategic plan. These reports support our commitment to increase transparency and engagement with investors, customers and other stakeholders while providing a platform to track our progress as we transition to a cleaner, smarter and more sustainable energy future. Corporate responsibility report is aligned with the 5 pillars of our mission statement. It includes extensive detail on our initiatives from reducing the environmental impact of our operations and upholding high standards for corporate governance to advancing employee and public safety while building a diverse and inclusive workplace. The report includes our initial steps to provide data in alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board metrics as well as links to our policies. We plan to update the corporate responsibility report annually, including a data refresh next year in alignment with our 2019 annual report. 
At EEI, we will also introduce our first public strategic plan. Using the foundation of our 7 core values, the plan clearly articulates our vision for the next 5 years. It includes our approach to the rapid changes in our industry, fueled by evolving customer expectations, emerging technologies and a lower carbon economy. As we have continuously demonstrated over the past several years, FirstEnergy and our dedicated employees are prepared to meet any challenge as we work together to deliver energy for a brighter future. 
Thank you for your time. We've made great progress this year, and we remain focused on executing our strategies for sustainable customer-focused growth that will continue to build value for our investors, customers, communities and employees. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the third quarter."

Before I begin, I will remind you that all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. 
Also, you will recall that because of the preferred shares issuance in January 2018, we have been presenting our operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis to ensure the best comparative view of our performance. As of August 1, all of the outstanding preferred shares were converted to common stock. 
Now let's review our results. Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share. Operating earnings were $0.76 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. 
In the distribution business, earnings decreased compared to the third quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of more moderate weather compared to the very hot conditions last summer. Results for the third quarter of 2019 also reflect the absence of the DMR in Ohio as well as higher expenses and depreciation. These factors were slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate and lower net financing costs.
Distribution deliveries decreased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2018 both on an actual and weather-adjusted basis. Cooling degree days were 22% above normal for the third quarter, but 9% lower than the third quarter of 2018. Residential sales were down 2.2% on an actual basis compared to the third quarter of 2018 but slightly increased on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see a very slight increase in weather-adjusted residential sales over the last 12 months. 
Third quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 3.8% on an actual basis and 2.9% when adjusted for weather compared to the third quarter of 2018. This change was driven largely by lower demand in the education sector, partially due to the implementation of energy efficiency measures as well as decreases in the food and beverage and real estate sectors. 
In our industrial class, third quarter load decreased 1% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel, automotive and chemical manufacturers, including the impact of the shutdown of the GM Lordstown plant earlier this year. While we continue to watch these trends very closely, load for each customer segment remains in line with our forecast with bright spots, including stable residential customer usage and modest growth in both residential and commercial customer count. 
Looking at our transmission business, earnings increased primarily as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to the continued investments in the Energizing the Future program. 
And in our Corporate segment, third quarter results reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a third quarter 2018 contribution to the FirstEnergy Foundation. 
Before we open the call to your questions, we have a few other financial matters to discuss. First, it is our custom to provide an estimate of the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, which is a noncash item, along with third quarter results. Based on market conditions as of September 30, we estimate that adjustment to be in the range of $400 million to $1 billion. As always, the final adjustment will be determined by the discount rate and asset returns at the end of the year. 
Our return on assets currently stand at a solid 17-plus percent for 2019. Looking ahead, if these results hold through the end of the year, we would be on track to decrease our 2022 funding requirements by approximately $140 million. 
In addition, while the lower interest rate environment resulted in a higher pension liability, our funded status has slightly improved to 78% from 77% at year-end 2018. 
Second, during the third quarter, we successfully extended our corporate term loans and now have a $1 billion 1-year facility and a $750 million 2-year facility. We will evaluate refinancing some or all of these amounts into the capital markets sometime next year. 
Finally, we met with the rating agencies earlier this quarter to review our progress on our goals as a fully regulated company with an improved risk profile. We expect all 3 to provide normal course updates on our entities possibly as soon as EEI. 
Thank you. We continue to be committed to executing our strategies and meeting our commitments to investors. Now let's take your questions."

As far as how I look at it, I think it establishes a fixed cost for the base distribution costs in Ohio. Obviously, the DCR and the grid mod riders are on top of that. But by establishing this fixed base, it's going to accomplish what the legislature tried to do. It allows us to continue to promote energy efficiency with our customers so that they can get the benefit of that without impacting our base revenues. 
I think you pointed out the risk piece of it. It fixes our base revenues. And essentially, it takes about 1/3 of our company and I think makes it somewhat recession-proof.

We do talk with them frequently, and they're very aware of our plans. As far as holdco leverage, I wish it wasn't what it is. But at the same point, as I've discussed in the past, we are comfortable that we can deploy about $3 billion of capital investment in our transmission and distribution system that's what's driving the growth of this company and do it in a way where we will eventually grow into a stronger balance sheet. We could deploy some of that cash towards maybe some of the holding company debt, but I just don't think that's the right thing to do for shareholders over the long term. 
So we're going to continue to take our cash, investment in growth, and then as I said, we'll tell you what that's going to look like for the future coming up soon."

This morning, we announced strong results for the third quarter with GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and operating earnings of $0.76 per share. Consistent with our nearly 5-year track record of delivering on",1370,"Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced strong results for the third quarter with GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and operating earnings of $0.76 per share. Consistent with our nearly 5-year track record of delivering on our commitments to you, our third quarter operating earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. 
As a reminder, when we held our second quarter call, we were waiting for a final outcome related to our Ohio distribution modernization rider. Because of this, the third quarter guidance we provided to you included a $0.06 benefit from the DMR. While the rider was ultimately removed from our Ohio rate plan, I'm pleased to say that we were able to offset its absence during the quarter through a combination of favorable weather compared to normal, the continued strong execution of our customer service-oriented growth strategy and O&M discipline. 
For the full year, we are narrowing our 2019 operating earnings guidance to $2.50 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as the absence of the DMR in the second half. We're also providing 2020 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share and affirming our projection for 6% to 8% of compound annual operating earnings growth from 2018 through 2021. 
I know you're anxious for us to communicate both our CAGR and equity plans beyond the 2018 to 2021 time frame. We will provide this information as soon as it makes sense once we've completed our internal financial planning process. That should not be taken as any indication that either of these will ultimately be disappointing to the market. It's simply that I am very protective of our 5-year track record of meeting or exceeding every commitment we have made, and I need to get the detailed planning in place before getting ahead of that process. 
Now let's review our progress with our customer-focused growth strategies at our utilities. In late August, each of our 4 Pennsylvania utilities filed new long-term infrastructure improvement plans, or LTIPs, for the 2020 through 2024 period. The filings outline our plans to invest $572 million over that time frame to accelerate infrastructure improvements and enhance service reliability for more than 2 million customers in Pennsylvania. These investments build on earlier improvement plans and included targeted projects that are designed to reduce the frequency of electric service interruptions for customers and shorten the duration of outages when they do occur. 
Major initiatives will include replacing older infrastructure with new poles, overhead lines, underground cables, substation equipment, network vaults and manholes; reconfiguring circuits to minimize customers impacted by service interruptions; and installing more advanced smart devices that can detect and isolate problems to help quickly restore power to impacted customers. The work outlined in the LTIP programs accelerates infrastructure repairs, improvements and replacements while also introducing new investments to enhance our distribution, infrastructure and service reliability. 
We expect to recover the costs associated with the LTIP through the DISC rider mechanism. We look forward to working with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to have the plans approved by the end of the year so work can begin in early 2020. 
Before we move from Pennsylvania, on our last call, we mentioned that we were in discussions to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning Three Mile Island Unit 2 to a subsidiary of Energy Solutions LLC. This would remove any future nuclear decommission obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus. 
In October, we signed that agreement, which includes transferring the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the associated liabilities and responsibility for decommissioning. While the agreement is subject to regulatory approvals, we expect transfer to take place around the second half of 2020. 
Turning to Ohio, we are beginning to implement our $516 million 3-year grid modernization program, which was approved by the Public Utilities Commission in July. We are laying the groundwork to begin construction on these projects during the first quarter of next year. Our investments include the installation of 700,000 smart meters and related infrastructure, building an advanced distribution management system in our Ohio Edison Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison service areas; installing automated equipment on at least 200 distribution lines that can automatically isolate problems to prevent entire circuit outages and quickly restore electric service to customers; installing voltage-regulating equipment on more than 200 circuits to provide energy efficiency benefits by optimizing voltage levels on the distribution grid. In addition, we have committed to developing time-varying rates that give customers the opportunity to reduce their monthly electric bill by using energy during off-peak periods. 
Together, these modernization projects are expected to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage. As you'll recall, the grid mod order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and we began implementing those tax savings for customers on September 1. 
Later this month, we expect to file plans with the PUCO to implement a decoupling mechanism in Ohio. As we discussed last quarter, decoupling breaks the link between utility revenue and the amount of electricity consumed by customers. This supports continued energy efficiency efforts while ensuring that our utilities have adequate resources to continue providing safe and reliable power to our customers. Our plan ensures that residential and commercial customers pay no more for base distribution service than was charged in 2018. After our filing, the commission will have 60 days to review and approve the application. 
Moving to our transmission business. Last week, we filed a plan with FERC to move our New Jersey transmission assets onto a forward-looking formula rate structure effective January 1, 2020. JCP&L transmission assets are currently on stated rates based on a settlement approved by FERC in February of 2018. A rate moratorium that was part of that settlement will expire on December 31. Our forward-looking formula rate plan would support energizing the future investment needs in New Jersey, including approximately $175 million in capital spending planned for 2020. We expect an initial response from FERC by the end of December. 
Finally, in mid-October, the Bankruptcy Court approved FES' plan of reorganization. FES has stated that it plans to merge as an independent company with a new name by the end of this year. 
Now let's look ahead to next week when we will see many of you at EEI. At the meeting, we look forward to sharing with you our new corporate responsibility report and strategic plan. These reports support our commitment to increase transparency and engagement with investors, customers and other stakeholders while providing a platform to track our progress as we transition to a cleaner, smarter and more sustainable energy future. Corporate responsibility report is aligned with the 5 pillars of our mission statement. It includes extensive detail on our initiatives from reducing the environmental impact of our operations and upholding high standards for corporate governance to advancing employee and public safety while building a diverse and inclusive workplace. The report includes our initial steps to provide data in alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board metrics as well as links to our policies. We plan to update the corporate responsibility report annually, including a data refresh next year in alignment with our 2019 annual report. 
At EEI, we will also introduce our first public strategic plan. Using the foundation of our 7 core values, the plan clearly articulates our vision for the next 5 years. It includes our approach to the rapid changes in our industry, fueled by evolving customer expectations, emerging technologies and a lower carbon economy. As we have continuously demonstrated over the past several years, FirstEnergy and our dedicated employees are prepared to meet any challenge as we work together to deliver energy for a brighter future. 
Thank you for your time. We've made great progress this year, and we remain focused on executing our strategies for sustainable customer-focused growth that will continue to build value for our investors, customers, communities and employees. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the third quarter."

Before I begin, I will remind you that all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, you will",728,"Good morning. It's good to speak with you today. Before I begin, I will remind you that all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. 
Also, you will recall that because of the preferred shares issuance in January 2018, we have been presenting our operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis to ensure the best comparative view of our performance. As of August 1, all of the outstanding preferred shares were converted to common stock. 
Now let's review our results. Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share. Operating earnings were $0.76 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. 
In the distribution business, earnings decreased compared to the third quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of more moderate weather compared to the very hot conditions last summer. Results for the third quarter of 2019 also reflect the absence of the DMR in Ohio as well as higher expenses and depreciation. These factors were slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate and lower net financing costs.
Distribution deliveries decreased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2018 both on an actual and weather-adjusted basis. Cooling degree days were 22% above normal for the third quarter, but 9% lower than the third quarter of 2018. Residential sales were down 2.2% on an actual basis compared to the third quarter of 2018 but slightly increased on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see a very slight increase in weather-adjusted residential sales over the last 12 months. 
Third quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 3.8% on an actual basis and 2.9% when adjusted for weather compared to the third quarter of 2018. This change was driven largely by lower demand in the education sector, partially due to the implementation of energy efficiency measures as well as decreases in the food and beverage and real estate sectors. 
In our industrial class, third quarter load decreased 1% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel, automotive and chemical manufacturers, including the impact of the shutdown of the GM Lordstown plant earlier this year. While we continue to watch these trends very closely, load for each customer segment remains in line with our forecast with bright spots, including stable residential customer usage and modest growth in both residential and commercial customer count. 
Looking at our transmission business, earnings increased primarily as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to the continued investments in the Energizing the Future program. 
And in our Corporate segment, third quarter results reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a third quarter 2018 contribution to the FirstEnergy Foundation. 
Before we open the call to your questions, we have a few other financial matters to discuss. First, it is our custom to provide an estimate of the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, which is a noncash item, along with third quarter results. Based on market conditions as of September 30, we estimate that adjustment to be in the range of $400 million to $1 billion. As always, the final adjustment will be determined by the discount rate and asset returns at the end of the year. 
Our return on assets currently stand at a solid 17-plus percent for 2019. Looking ahead, if these results hold through the end of the year, we would be on track to decrease our 2022 funding requirements by approximately $140 million. 
In addition, while the lower interest rate environment resulted in a higher pension liability, our funded status has slightly improved to 78% from 77% at year-end 2018. 
Second, during the third quarter, we successfully extended our corporate term loans and now have a $1 billion 1-year facility and a $750 million 2-year facility. We will evaluate refinancing some or all of these amounts into the capital markets sometime next year. 
Finally, we met with the rating agencies earlier this quarter to review our progress on our goals as a fully regulated company with an improved risk profile. We expect all 3 to provide normal course updates on our entities possibly as soon as EEI. 
Thank you. We continue to be committed to executing our strategies and meeting our commitments to investors. Now let's take your questions."

As far as how I look at it, I think it establishes a fixed cost for the base distribution costs in Ohio. Obviously, the DCR and the grid mod riders are on top of that. But by establishing this fixed base, it's going to accomplish what the legislature tried to do. It allows us to continue to promote energy efficiency with our customers so that they can get the benefit of that without impacting our base revenues. 
I think you pointed out the risk piece of it. It fixes our base revenues. And essentially, it takes about 1/3 of our company and I think makes it somewhat recession-proof. So I get a question a lot about whether I'm worried about a future recession. It's 2 million customers in Ohio that this is going to help make sure that, that doesn't impact us. And I think..."

Because it's transparent, it's caused some of the questioning that goes on. But I will tell you that the projects that we do in transmission today, about half of the money is spent on PJM RTEP projects already. So those are already projects that PJM are saying are needed for future reliability reasons. And the rest fall into the category of what I call good asset management practice. And I think for the regulator, whether that be FERC or even the state commissions, to try to get too involved in how we do asset management as a business would be a mistake because we're the one ultimately responsible for making sure that this grid is reliable and resilient and able to perform for customers, not just today but for the long term. And the projects that we're doing just fall into the typical asset management decisions you make when you're running a bulk -- piece of the bulk electric system and a system that serves 6 million customers."

Then second, I'm hoping you could help me reconcile some of the guidance updates. Again, in the fact book here, it looks like you've -- on the transmission side, you increased your rate base forecast by around 2%, but the CapEx figures are unchanged. And then it's sort of the opposite on distribution, where the CapEx numbers are now at the high end of the prior ranges yet the rate base forecasts have actually come down a little bit. Can you maybe just walk us through how to reconcile those 2 things that seem a little bit at odds?"

But we clearly do prefer very transparent rate mechanisms. We mentioned on the call that we just filed another long-term infrastructure plan in Pennsylvania. The DCR and the grid mod in Ohio are very transparent riders. We have utilized the new rider in New Jersey for the first time starting last year. And then we have transmission formula rates. And out of that $3 billion, a little over 60% of that is being deployed in these mechanisms that are very transparent and return cash back to the business quicker for reinvestment."
