I'm Stuart Chambers, the Chairman. And it's my pleasure to do so. Just wanted to talk about 2 things before I hand over to Mark. Firstly, board changes. So Phil",389,"So good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and very warm welcome to Anglo American's 2018 results. I'm Stuart Chambers, the Chairman. And it's my pleasure to do so. Just wanted to talk about 2 things before I hand over to Mark. Firstly, board changes. So Philip Hampton, retired in December of last year. So he stepped down after 9 years of fantastic service. He was our senior independent director. And that role has been passed on to Byron Great. And secondly, Jack Thompson, he attended his last board earlier this week. And will be stepping down before the AGM. And therefore, won't be seeking reelection, also after nine years of fantastic service. Jack is one of our two nonexecutive directors with extensive mining experience, operationally non-technical side. That something we're very keen to replaced, we're towards the end of our process to do so. And we expect him to announce something before the AGM in terms of replacement. Those are the board changes, the only other subject that I want to touch on not understandably is safety. Very encouraging and very reassuring you'll hear from Mark, how we've improved our safety performance again last year to a new record level, 16% better than on recorded than a year before, which itself is a record, very encouraging, however, as many of you if not all of you know 5 people lost their lives in our operations last year. And it has to stop, obviously. Some we launched a elimination of fatalities task force last year. The design of that of course is to penetrate the whole of the organization, every working County and under -- to discover essentially what underpins these fatal incidents. The fundamental underlying issues. We've done that, we've got program, the program is underway. And we're in the middle of executing that. And its key, and I think if you add to that, the tragedy last month, where one of our industries; one of the industries tailing stems fell, you all know very much about that. That just serves to underway yet again for all of us, safety has to be our number 1 priority. And the only goal that makes any sense in this is zero harm. So it's a constant residual. I think with that, let me hand over to Mark to kick off our presentation."
409115,603087483,1663146,"Anglo American plc, 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, very much Stuart. Ladies and Gentlemen, now we're pleased to be here today and thank you for joining us. Like Stuart, I think it's important to acknowledge the recent Brazilian tragedy. The one thing I would like to say is all of us in the indus",3135,"Thanks, very much Stuart. Ladies and Gentlemen, now we're pleased to be here today and thank you for joining us. Like Stuart, I think it's important to acknowledge the recent Brazilian tragedy. 
The one thing I would like to say is all of us in the industry are connected and talking about how we can all play a part in finding solutions for the industry. I'll talk about that a little bit further, but again, I thought it was appropriate just to acknowledge our colleagues and their losses. And on a broader basis, the need or reemphasize the need to continue to take steps to make sure that we can create a zero harm workplace and that includes zero harm to both employees and local communities, now think it's most our pressing and important priority in our industry. 
In terms of our results for the year, the key theme that we'll be talking to is unlocking our full potential. Consistent with our frame, you'll see that we have photo of our copper mine, but some interesting diagrams on it, that was totally attempt to show that we've become a modern miner. And it is actually a photo of El Soldado, the reason that's important is also El Soldado will be the first site we're recommissioning our new bunk all sorters orders and by the end of the year, we'll be commissioning our coals part of co floatation. So for us, whilst that photo may not look that interesting, for a mining engineering knowing the background to it, it's extremely attractive photo. 
So in terms of results, I think the important point to make is we're continuing to deliver on what we said we do. Well, 2018, wasn't without challenges obviously, the minister of pipeline has been a key issue. We've been able and we've seen step ups from a number of key areas in the business to try and cover that event across the numbers and the numbers are respectable I think in the context with what we had to do with during the course of the year. The volumes were up, most notably from copper, Duncan and the team really did do a great job. And the feedback that we had from analyst visit in the last quarter of the year I think reflected on how much progress I think both the copper team has done and how I think we've done broader organization. [ EBIT ] margins continue to improve to 42% up from 40% last year. That reflects both ongoing focus and productivity improvements, I'll talk to that little bit later and cost controls across the business, and the marketing contribution, and mark have good job in continuing to improve our real life prices against the value and use click they use and again, making a good contribution. 
Free cash flow was strong, our return on capital employed was a healthy 19%, so I think we're continuing to build a solid foundation for future performance. And I've just pressed the wrong button, almost panic stations. So in falling apart the performance, we always talk to safety, health and environment. As Stewart reflected in terms of safety, five fatal incidents. For us, it doesn't matter how good the results are, no year is a good year if you have a fatal incident or if you have lost a colleague. So for us we do take the time to reflect, try and understand and the elimination of fatalities task team work is along with that work, they are the most two most pressing for us or important project for us to continue to work on. And for us and everyone in this organization, we're committed to delivering a zero harm workplace and yes, we have made good progress again best performance in a 100 years, 16% lower injury frequency rate but at the same time again, nothing to celebrate when you lose a colleague. 
In terms of the health front, again for us, it is an important issue for our industry, making sure that we're creating workplaces that do no harm. We've got some work to do on Moscow's collateral injuries, now those people doing work, where there's a degenerative conditions we've got to do some redesign in nice workplaces and that's an important project to us. 
And then finally, on the environmental side, again, the Brazilian incident cast a shadow over the industry, in our case we had 2 pipeline leaks in Minas-Rio that we reported in the first quarter and I've already talked about those in the half year, against the positive side there is we commissioned or recommissioned Minas-Rio in December as we forecasted the time. In the first two months, the operation has gone very well, we're up to capacity and so the forecast we talked about for the full-year production appeared to be on track. 
Again, I'll talk a little bit more about the Minas-Rio incident because we've had a few inbound questions but if I could make a simple observation, in engineering terms, we have what we called an upstream lift, where the damn wells are been on tailings-on-tailings, we then have a downstream with where you've got a more purpose built containment structure, then you've got a water containing facility, which is another level of engineering above downstream construction. Minas-Rio is a water containing engineered facility. So we think once there will be debates about tailing dams in Brazil, the Minas-Rio construction is 2 levels above in terms of its engineering approach and again, happy to answer more questions, but I think, we're in the right place in terms of those conversations and in terms of what we've built at this time. 
To be more specific about our current processes, again I want to reemphasize there's been a lot of discussion around what will we do and how will we they engage in the conversations around tailings dams for the industry. We will participate and collaborate with all of their colleagues because this is an industry issue. When I talk about Anglo American, if I can describe it in the most sync way possible we have their staff on site that monitor and responsible for the placement of tailings and management of water on a daily basis. We have at each side, an engineer or a competent person that has background in Geo mechanics, Geo soil mechanics or geotechnical background, that is classed as competent person and is responsible for the engineering of and the correct management of the tailings facility on the daily, weekly, monthly basis. We have an engineering of record that was with us at the start that helped us design the facility, design the process to manage the facility, and we have been involved in monitoring our practice is in process during the course of deposition and at least on a quarterly basis, giving us feedback in terms of what they're seeing, what we're doing and how we're operating. Now because their partner become part and personal with the design in the process, we don't count them as independent in terms of managing the facility. So we have a central role, reporting to now outside the line that does regular checks on all of their facilities and with his team, making sure that everything we should be doing is in place and then on top of that, we have in each commodity grouping, a tailings risk committee that looks at all the tailings facilities and ensures that the correct process are being applied. And then on top of that, we have an independent review that's done on an annual basis by another consultant outside the group. So from our point of view, those standards were developed in 2014, the development of the ICMN standards came in 2016, and they drew from our standards as part of their design. So what we are trying to work at now is how we can work with the industry on a collaborative basis and where they maybe organizations may not be able to have that level of internal discipline and process had with the industry create, some sort of process or resource that can help us make sure that all tailings in the industry are save, it's not simply a single company issue, it's a industry problem and from our point-of-view how do we play a part in finding an industry solution, I think that's very important. And that's the important message that we want to deliver with today. 
In terms of the operations, we continue to make progress in terms of performance. Over the course of the last 12 months, our productivity has continued to improve. So going back to our 2012 benchmark. We've almost double productivity across the group as you can see with the 98% number. Overall production is 10% above where we were in 2012, with around 50% less assets. each asset that we've retain and we've been working with, is now on average doing 30% more -- always delivering 30% more production that it was 5 years ago, and in the mine that's been done through operating improvements, process improvements, incremental model making and generally running the asset building we were 5 years ago. There's a consequence, our real cost are down 43% or as you can see the [ 23 ]% in nominal terms. And that's been a key driver in terms of our business improvement and margin growth over the last 5 years, where we going from around 30% industrial margin, EBITDA margin to 42% and that's despite the 10% drop in our basket price receipt. And so from our point of view, we believe the progress has been solid, but there's still a lot more we can achieve because we're not universally, across-the-board best-in-class. We're certainly competitive today, compared to where we were but we're not yet best-in-class and so there's a lot more opportunity. If you take the numbers, and we've used an independent report at the half year and we've tried to look through public numbers to see where we rate against our competitors, now might just explain this chart again because I've got have few question where I'm not sure everybody understands where we come from on these numbers. I'm going to walk across the chart, if you look at Anglo American, back in 2012, our average cost position and we take quality into account, so we call it leading margin curve improvement. So it's actually a breakeven cost curve, so we're taking the quality of our product into account and coming back with the breakeven price and we do that for our competitors product as well. It's mainly in Metco and Allin out that you make that adjustment. The other numbers are pretty easy to take into the chart. We were at about the midpoint on the cost curve, the 49 percentile. In the last five years, we've improved our relative position across all of our commodities and it's actually revenue weighted, so we're trying to give you a weighted position, we're at this 37 percentile or so we're in the mid-Q2 on average. So that suggests that we've improved our cost quicker than many of our competitors. I think that's important point, everybody's getting better, but we've got to do is get better quicker. And yes, we had, probably had in some cases, a lower base to work from, but doing that across the board and doing it a consistent way is the big challenge. And so far, we have made good progress. Now against our peers, 27% to 38%, 36% to 45%, peer 3 doing better, some new assets making a real difference. So we've been competitive -- or against our major diversified competitors. And at the end of the day, there's always a little bit of noise in the numbers. From our perspective, we believe we can continue to improve our position, and that's going to be important part of the focus in terms of our presentation today, but so we've made good progress, but there's a lot more we think we can do to continue to improve that position because I've got no doubt everybody's in the same conversation about how do we get better. 
So and stepping back and looking at the journey, we've been on the last 3 years, there are 3 key points we wanted to make: Firstly, in terms of operating leverage, that is how good are you on the cost curve, we've moved to the bottom of the range. So from a competitive position, we think we're well placed. Doesn't mean you stop, there's a lot more work to be done. In terms of financial leverage and Steven will unpack the numbers, we've still got a little more work to do to make sure we've got our balance sheet where we want it, we're certainly in the right area and looking very strong in terms of our balance sheet and what we can do from here in terms of driving the business and doing the things that we need to do to make sure we're delivering value for shareholders; third, is inside the portfolio and we talk about Quellaveco, being a key driver of profitable growth for business in the next 5 years, it represents about 50% of that incremental growth, the thing and Stephen will use the word balance in his conversation and more than simply about the balance sheet, he'll use the word balance in that we've got Quellaveco as a large scale project that we're executing on, we've also got a number of small scale, quick return projects, known by the bottlenecking, shipping a new shipping, may be Chris has got a range of opportunities he can see the particularly around the , he's doing that work now. Bruce is working on things inside his business as he does the transition through Venetia, we've got a number of small scale rapid pipe projects that give us a nice portfolio, the business improvement opportunities. And again, Stephen will impact that but for us, it's starting to give us a real balance, in the portfolio, in terms of what we doing today, and what we can improve, and where we can continue to enhance the portfolio. 
So sort of to put a bit more shape behind that, if I talk to what we've been doing in the last 5 years, we talk about the operating model. In some ways, it ends up being a gred bag of a whole range of conversation, but it is about doing things differently and making sure that the conversation I'm having here is no different to the conversation that front-line supervisors are having with the people that really do deliver the results, but it has to be in the context that's meaningful and so how do we translate that through the organization and make sure the planned work, the objectives we've set get delivered, that's really the guts of what we're doing and how we're improving the business. we're also now starting to transition into a different type of improvement over the next five years. But we think doesn't deliver on lower result, it delivers continuing improvement, but in a different shape. And then starts to focus on pre one-to-one. So when I talked about our operating practices, let's say we are in the bottom half of the performance in terms of equipment. So I'll give an example, shovel, a 4100 shovel, the best in the class with 45 million ton a year. The Anglo American average from its fleet of 4100 shovels is around 22 million, 23 million ton a year, our best was around 30 million. 12 months ago, we set the chance to P101, how do we, on each part of or each major piece of mining equipment we're processing plant delivering top quarter performance. So we said okay, the benchmark for the shovel 45 million ton a year, every one of our operators who are running a 4100 shovels said we will achieve that number within 3 years. In 12 months, Dolson was hitting 50 million tons a year, right? of around a a 28 million ton starting position, so looking at how we set the places up, how we ran those assets and that type of improvement is being replicated across the portfolio. It looks different, in different places, different baselines, different skill sets, but that's the approach. And we're doing that with all of that critical plant and equipment. P101, 100 being best-in-class, the objective is what's -- how we go beyond best-in-class, so that's where the P101 came from. As Steven said a typical engineer's title for project it should be a lot [ sexier ] than P101 in the case. 
And on future smart mining, it's around new innovation, how do we reconfigure traditional processes to drive step changes in our performance? And when I talk sustainability, I'll show you what we think that transformation of our process looks like in the longer term. So P101 in the business, we think copper processing, the Venetia acceleration so Bruce is in the room PGM shovels and productivity long performance are all areas of business where we see potential for significant changes, and is a good example where we've -- where we double productivity over the last three years, and the question is how do you go another 30% over the next 3 years. And then, in terms of the future smart mining, bulk sorting as I said El Soldado is the first unit, we've got a unit going into Barro Alto and into Tomball Oquendo, cost particle flotation had its first this year, data analytics underline the way we think about the business, the way we pull apart the data is how we can improve the business. 
So for us, the journey from 30% to 42% margin was all about fundamental business improvement, the things that we could say on the ground that we are good at, things that we could change, reconfiguring the pit, turning session around 90 degrees, all of those types of changes have helped us get to 42% including the marketing work and the change in the marketing model. To get from 42% to 45% to peer 50%, P101 the innovation work and the projects that we're developing across the business, they key maker and the incremental improvements are all design to put us in this this sort of territory. So from where we're today, 20% to 25% growth in the operations and at the same time, improving the quality of the business, expressed through how EBITDA margin is where we're taking the business, that's all an apples-for-apples basis. So that's where we're about that's what we're trying to achieve and with that, I'll pass across to Stephen."
409115,603087483,1663146,"Anglo American plc, 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now Mark speak about his picture on his slides. so I figure It's only for our speak about my picture on mine. I just wanted discussion around that's what I eat for breakfast. It's a bowl of palladium grain and as Chris would tell me, I proba",2076,"Thanks, Mark. Now Mark speak about his picture on his slides. so I figure It's only for our speak about my picture on mine. I just wanted discussion around that's what I eat for breakfast. It's a bowl of palladium grain and as Chris would tell me, I probably couldn't afford it these days with the price of palladium anyway. 
So let's turn to the numbers. As Mark said, a really strong set of results and very consistent with what we're presented for the period on period. And that's something they we are really striving to achieve with the business. It's that sort of run rate, the rhythm building on strong fundamentals and whether there's the operating model or a strong balance sheet, it's that consistent base that gives us the ability to sort of grow and continue the journey in the business. So EBITDA obviously increased year-on-year, despite the suspension at Minas-Rio that flowed into EPS of $2.55 per share and obviously, the 40% payout ratio into the dividend and returning to shareholders. $3.2 billion of free cash flow and CapEx of $2.8 billion was in line with our guidance. 
Turning to EBITDA and just the drivers of that, obviously, a 4% increase from $8.8 billion to $9.2 billion across the year again, despite the head wind at Minas-Rio. You can see there the benefit of of prices, our currency, offset by inflation at Minas-Rio, almost offset one another. 
Now turning to cost and volume, we set ourselves, a target of $800 billion for the year, and we achieved $400 billion of that. so a little bit disappointed with our progress there. And we did in fact achieve improvements of the $800 million, but they were offset by headwinds and in particular, we had above CPI increase in oil prices through that March to September timeframe. Few other cost particular in South Africa slightly above CPI, and we had a little bit of inventory build, which should itself release itself through the first half of '19. So not making any excuses, it is our job to deliver that target and we do intend to do so. 
Turning to the balance sheet, again the same sort of messages that we have delivered over the last couple of years, we have spoken about this window that we had this opportunity to fundamentally reset the balance sheet up until the middle of 2019. And that's the point when we start contributing our cash flow to the Quellaveco CapEx in particular. So very pleased with our journey, now to date, net debt down to $2.8 billion. And as we've said we're pleased with the transformation of the balance sheet that some $10 billion that we've reduced net debt by over the last four years. Clearly across all of the metrics we're in a very strong position SSI and really pleased with the progress there. Just a couple of small little footnotes. So obviously, at the end of December, we're still sitting in about $500 million of the cash we've recieved from from Mitsubishi. So sort of proforma debt you could say, it's closer to the [ 3.4 ]. And during 2019, with the change in accounting standard, you'll see some of the operating leases come onto the balance sheet and that's also about $400 million to $500 million. So we again, we will take you on that journey as we work through the year. In terms of returns to shareholders, obviously, the 40% payout ratio, again, we have done exactly what we said we would do, 40% payout on underlying earning results of $0.51 dividend for the second half. And that takes dividend for the full year to $1 per share. 
Again, that's over $2.6 billion and they'll take us to in terms of returns to shareholders since we reinserted the dividend about 18 months ago. Obviously, as well as the debt reduction of an excess of $10 billion over the year, we have invested back in the business in addition to the returns to shareholders and over that same sort of timeframe since '15, we've invested some $10 billion plus back into the business. And again, that's important in terms of building and sustaining the future as we go forward. So how have we have done, this is a slide I like because we all talk a good game in terms of capital location, but how are we're going in terms of the scorecard. So in terms of the score card for us for the year, attributable free cash flow prior to discretionary capital of $3.8 billion. So again, quite pleased with our outcome, how do we use that? We reduced debt by $1.7 billion, paid cash dividends in the year of $1.3 billion and then obviously, $0.5 billion in terms of the discretionary allocation, that does include things like expiration, evaluation, CapEx, across a number of small projects et cetera. You will see that increase as we go forward, particularly in terms of Quellaveco, and we'll feed into that growth number as we go forward. 
I'm going to touch on CapEx now and you see in the presentation, we've given you some additional guidance, I mean in the out a year so I just want to talk that through a little bit so that we're understanding with that the value in particular that drives. So in terms of sustaining business -- sustaining CapEx, we flagged in December that we would see that pick up a little bit in the next couple of years in particular. And part of our priorities as a management team is to not only preserve but also enhance the value of the portfolio of operations that we have. And that's exactly what we intend to do. Those opportunities present themselves in a number of ways and that can be cost opportunities, efficiency, productivity and it could be some brownfield expansion, sort of programs from some life extensions. But as we realize that higher production rate and generate value, that comes with an increasing in the absolute number of sustaining staying capital as we grow the base, we grow the portfolio and we grow production. A good example of that is the one that Mark mentioned earlier in terms of the long walls at Moranbah obviously with the production productivity that we had there that means work through the mine development areas quicker, you're into the next longwall move quicker and therefore, in just a snapshot of time, obviously, your absolute number looks a little bit higher number but it's for the right reasons, is generating increased production, generating increased value, generating increased cash flow. And that's really what we're all about. So as a result of that, and obviously given that we've got things like Quellaveco, coming on in 2022 and Moranbah Governer, and production that I've spoken about, Minas-Rio coming back to full production, we upped our guidance in terms of that sustaining capital, that 2.8 that 3.1, in terms of longer-term number that you should guide to. Again, for all the right reasons in terms of generating value. 
In particular and I'll touch on this in slide or two, the sort of projects and the sort of productivity improvements that we're working and generate really good margins, very attractive margins, very attractive returns. And that adds to that margin journey that Mark spoke about moving from [ 42 ] towards [ 50 ]. And obviously, in terms of the cash flow that generates. So the big test for us and this is something that I wanted to spend a little bit time on this or how we do spend the money well, because the sort of the question that came from the December update talk that we did. I'm pleased to say yes, we have. so we're seeing exactly the same efficiencies of that we've seen on the operating side of the business in the capital spend, measured as dollars of sustaining capital per copper equivalent production. And you can pee holes in the calculation if you want to, the level of improvement is so significant that it's hard to ignore, so that's 30% on nominal terms and closer to 40% in terms of real term. So a really good journey, shouldn't be a surprise because some of our sustaining CapEx and mine development is using the same to against the same fleet that we are using from an opening point of view. So it's the same sort of influence that's feeding in to our capital spend. 
obviously, as I say as the portfolio increases, we will look to maintain that efficiency. We have slightly high sustaining CapEx in the next year or two. So may see that just double around a little bit, but we're very confident on the journey that we are on from that capital spend in efficiency. Ultimately, measure us on return on capital employed rather than break it down and pull bits of capital are. And that again has been a great journey as we've moved from 9% 11% up to 19%. And so it kind of measures as we intended. And that's been a great journey for us, that return on capital employed and again, something that we replaced with the journey and pride ourselves on. 
So turning to growth CapEx, again that will increase a little over the next year, but over the next couple of years, there's no surprises our spent on Quellaveco, in particular is probably the main driver. As you can see on the slide, we do have a number of incredibly attractive brownfield, relatively small scale individually opportunities ahead of us. Again, the main messages is here, they'll be assessed and studied with the same sort of discipline you've seen in the past. They happen over time, and again, relatively small in nature. So they'll come up for approval and over time, the capital spend will be over time and obviously, always to subject to market conditions and assessment. So just coming back to the cost and volume improvement that Mark touched on early on 10% of detail on drivers of that. Obviously, a big focus on P101 and the technology development, we remain absolutely committed to that $3 billion to $4 billion target by the end of 2022. So that's start of over [ $18 ] into 2022, we're $900 million into that, if you take last year's actual and this year's target, I just wanted to make sure it's clear that the $500 million for '19 doesn't include the Minas-Rio turnaround. 
As we've done this year, so we're putting that out separately, we show the turnaround of that separately next year as well. So this $500 million would be on top of that, in terms of EBITDA driver. As we flagged I think it was a half years, some of this will be a little bit back into that time frame. Some of the investments we're making in the technology development, the P101, we'll just take a little bit of time to float self into EBITDA and cash flow. But that's okay, it's planned, there's programs in place to deliver, to deliver those initiatives and Mike touched on some of the things that start to go live through this year and particularly El Soldado. 
In terms of this year number, probably one of the bigger influence is some of this productivity increased and that we're expected to see that Grosvenor from Queensland, met coal operations. So just to wrap it up from me, where does it all take us? Steady, but meaningful production growth over that next four to five years. And I think is something as we Mark mentioned a lot to talk about that the word balance at the moment, but it is a balance for us. It's the balance about what we've done with the balance sheet, and we continue to focus on that, make sure we're building from strong foundations. The P101 initiatives would drive margins and cash flow again enables us to continue to do what we want to do. Again built on sound operating practice. So yes, a lot of you did attend the corporate visit back at the end of last year you can see the benefits of the operating model flow through and lot of the other sides are going on exactly the same journey. And obviously, built off strong balance sheet at the end of the day. Thank you."

So the delivery of an improved product report as an important part of that process. And the unit cost at if they be is at around [ 21 ] range we expect [ 28 to 31 ]. At full rate, we expect it to be closer to $25 a ton, maybe with inflation, somewhere near $26. Our breakeven cost at full rate still looks like about $35 a ton. It's what we're for the product. It's a 67% product low elements. And if you got some really tough questions Ruben is actually in the audience today. So we can cover off anything, you may want to hear about. And on tailing side, we have an existing tailings as a described it as basically water containing facility we're actually we've got the license to install. So we're actually lifting the next level. And the last approval required will be then the license to operate, when it's completed. We would expect to have that license midyear, but we're making sure that we could place through this authority, the federal authorities have already talked to publicized the standards, that has no issues for us at all. We would expect the Minas-Rio will come out with some comments on new standards in the next couple of months. Again, we don't expect that to impact us, given the nature of the installation we have if I could say this right, if they were to be something were to impact Minas-Rio, given the nature of the dam, it would literally all mining across the country, if they came anywhere near what we've built. We don't expect that to be an issue, but at the same time, we work with the authorities just to make sure we got all the key points covered. So we're still forecasting midyear. As I said it might the conversation might go from another month or two, but beyond that, we think we're in pretty good shape. 
On Quellaveco, again not much additional to report, post December, other than good progress continues, the dam, which was built as part of the river diversion gone going well, earth works are going well and we when characterize the project last year,  I said that next 12 to 18 months is critical, big earth work projects and lots of concrete. So once we get through that phase, which I think is the real critical path pr gram, once we get out of the ground and you start seeing metal being erected, I think we will navigate the toughest part of the program and we're very pleased with the progress so far. So at this stage, the 44 month schedule looks very good, cost's tight, but still in good shape, particularly on the schedule, with the schedule being in good shape as well. So we're pretty happy with where we're. And the [ 1.3 ] to [ 1.5 ] estimate for this year, for us will be mainly back end loaded at a 100% basis to [ 1.3 ] to [ 1.5 ] last year would be somewhere between [ 400 ] and 600 in the second have given that Mitsubishi funds where already been in the first half of the year. I will continue to keep an expiration slide in the peck because as we speak John and the guys are starting to show some interesting opportunities emerge. In Brazil, I can confirm and I will confirm that yes, we intersected corporate mineralization. Yes, the grades are at or above in number of those intersections above nominal growth that we would think on a larger scale, low grade corporate deposit would be monial. The intersections are in some cases above 100 meters, but I've got to stress that we've got some interesting intersections that's all we have at the moment. As a consequence of those intersections, we stopped oil drilling after 6 holes. We secured 37,000 square kilometers of tenements. We had overflown the tenements and we've got 3 or 4 prospects that we have identified from the area surveys. so we are following those up and during the course of the next 12 months, we'll work out what we've actually got. If I could say this at the moment it's interesting, it's not anything that we could call a resource. It's an interesting position that will take a little bit of time to unpack. And I expect this time next year, we'll give you a much better scope and be able to paint a much better picture of what we have or what we may not have, but I think it's important that you should know the things that we've talked about been confirmed and it's interesting, it's not yet exciting. So somebody described it as being excited, no, I'm interested, I'm not yet excited. And also I just want to make sure that we got that conversation in balance. We've also been doing some work across the portfolio and in Mogalakwena. The work at Mogalakwena has been interesting and we're looking at extensions to the old body, the key point to make is the mineralization appears maybe a bit thicker than we thought. The grades may be a little bit better. And the material may be a little bit shallower. So I think Chris is not yet excited, but he's getting close, so we're encouraged. A lot of work to be done, Chris and the team are doing feasibility work on potential options. We're watching the market very carefully as well. So anything we do, would be with an aye to the market and I on what's right for our shareholders and the long-term. So we're just measuring our pace and the work we're doing, but the results there also very encouraging. 
On sustainability, and really sustainability is part of everything we do, its part of any conversations we're in, starting with safety with all the way to social performance. So it remains a key part of all of that dialogue. If you look at our portfolio, from our point of view we think that the commodities that we have is a consequence of the quality assets remember, we're about a quality asset portfolio. So what drives us forward, and where we focus area is having the best mining deserts in the world. Yes, we take into account the markets that we're selling into and geographies, it's about quality assets. As a consequence of that focus on quality assets. The major commodity positions is that we're in diamonds, copper, PGM's, bulks, we think plays into the macro trends around growing middle-class consumer world. The focus on the environment, long-term, a greater world. an electrified world, some people thought that I was talking about what supporter, while we're talking about electrified and exciting. But in terms of the the big trends."

In terms of the products and in each case we're building the portfolio, Bruce focusing getting the business up to [ 37 ] million karates with the transition at Venetia, in the copper business we've talk about we talk obviously about Quellaveco, and the longer-term opportunities of lost Broncos and particularly the underground potential is significant. PGM as I said Mogalakwena I think really important piece of work for the platinum team is obviously the turnaround of the Moranbah. I was there with Chris for a couple of days about three months ago and very excited with the work, but still a lot of work to be done, but making good progress, and the bulks 2 great positions, though 3 great position in terms of quality and cost competitive position, more work to be done to improve our competitive position, but again, we've got a good portfolio across the globe, people have asked and so I'll preamp the question on thermal coal, we've actually halved our footprint in thermal coal in the last two years. And as we've said, we talk to adjust transition. So our position hasn't changed. And so we're looking at all the moving parts and making sure we're positioning ourselves to have the right type of portfolio that investors want to invest in for the long term. When we look at and if I connect the operating model, the innovation work, the changes we're delivering. We talked to sustainability in the same conversation. And as a consequence of the competitive work we're doing, we're looking at delivering 30% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030, so that helps us drive down the cost curve. In terms of reduction of water, water place 2 parts yes, it's a cost, but also it's a constraint on the development of our assets particularly in the long term desert climates. And so it provides us a double whammy in terms of improving the performance of the portfolio, so that's a critical piece of work for us. And greenhouse gas emissions is about the climate change debate. And how we play out our part in making sure the world achieves its target. If you go back to the strategy around trusted corporate leader I think, the conversation for all of us in the industry today is about tailings. I think we've all got to play our part and I've said, whatever we can do to help the industry lift tailings standards then we'll be involved in all of those conversations. And what do we need to do with their colleagues to improve I think is a good example of this sort of approach we believe is right in terms of the industry. Thriving communities, the people most affected by our operations, are our partners in those local communities. Now I think over long period of time we haven't done a good job with local communities. And we certainly changed our approach over the last few years. And we know we've got a lot more work to do. So those familiar with the courageous conversations, that are occurring in South African with the attribution, that's the type of approach in terms of engaging with communities we think it's very noble in different. And certainly creating a new dialogue. And healthy environment. So how do we make sure that we're doing all things right in terms of the environment. Are we doing the best we can do with tailings and all those other areas that potentially impact on communities is where our focus is and we've been doing a lot of work and our tailings we've done in 2014, it's part of that program. So in terms of the business, what we look at and how we think about the future. 
In terms of margins, driving cash flow. Cash flow for us is a team is we think the effective measure major shareholders are looking for in terms of our ability to retain today, tomorrow and through the long-term. So the margins is a real focus, getting ourselves to 45% to 50% is a critical focus for us because cash flow then comes as a consequence. Return on capital employed measures the efficiency that is how well did you generate that cash flow, it's easy to generate cash flow in this industry over short periods of time. The real measure is the long-term sustainability and the deliverability or the repeatability of that cash flow looks for your return capital employed. Did you use the capital well? And will the shareholder support you continuing to use capital, kind of respect to this number. We believe that we can deliver better than 20% through the cycle with the quality assets and the work we're doing inside the business. And asset life, the one thing I would say that over the next few years this number will move around a little bit because you'll see increase our production another 25%, it's never quite linear how that number move but at 30 years it's where we're right at the life of asset, so when I want you to do when I want you to take away from today is we look at these metrics and we drive all of these metrics and making sure we've got a sustainable business that is cash flow returns and long-term continuity e.g. in terms of the business and in our industry, there are pretty tough set of metrics to deliver on consistently. And certainly that's where we're focused. 
Finally, in terms of the investment proposition, we've been talking to this, for a couple two or three years, Paul; I noticed a few others are started to talk to the same sort of slides. Maybe I'll just focus on capabilities today you know about the asset story how we're trying to position the portfolio and what we're doing in terms of return, I think Stevens done a good job explaining our position there. So for us, the operating model is about creating a culture inside Anglo American that's about being the best. In the end, I'll say today we're not the best. I can point to many examples where players are doing better than as on an individual basis. But as a team, we're determined to continue to take every step to catch and overtake those that we see as best. In sum areas of the business, for example I think in the long hauls, we're probably right up there. Platinum, I think again, right up there in the best. But there are five more places, where we're behind further than we should be. And we're not going to stay there, we're going to keep improving and we're going to keep improving quicker than anybody else. In terms of Future Smart Mining, we can't continue to mine if we mine for a 100 years. You can't just quit building bigger trucks, you got to think laterally, we've got to get open cut there and think differently and so the changes that we're making to the flow sheet is about the changes that will driving the next 100 years of mining we want to be on the forefront of that because those changes that lead those changes with the out performance in the industry. And third, we make sure that every product we produce, wherever commodity it may be and remembering the diamonds as a commodity, we still dreams in the diamond industry. We have to make sure that every product, isn't it right, Bruce? every product we produced we have to get the best price we can and that means understanding your customer, making sure you got a relationship and making sure that we're creating value for them to ensure that we get the value reflected back in the price that we've paid for our products. 
And so with that, we're more than happy to take questions."

So could be just maybe just map out, how we should think about excess capital returns; when, what's appropriate, is a 40% payout the appropriate payout ratio of the business and are there any constraints around preferred mechanism for excess capital returns? Is it special dividends, share buyback any constraints around that. 
Second question. In terms of think about long-term capital planning, the industry has a poor track record, long-term, very poor record in respect to downside, so with respect to diamonds, could you maybe give us a bit more thoughts how you think about risks posed by synthetics, what your base case. how do you stress test that into the long-term capital allocation for the diamonds business and again maybe some coins on what's going on at life box at the moment and then final question big moves in the idol prices, there's structured premium that embedded into high grade ional, how does that affect your long-term planning for Kumba? so center for long dated mine and life extensions.

Thanks for the question, Dominic. When we said the 40% payout ratio, we did it with a view over time. And again, come back to the balance, where we knew we were probably likely to approve Quellaveco. We have a view of what's in front of us in terms of capital spend, balance sheet journey et cetera. And so we factored that into our thinking in terms of that 40% payout ratio. 1 point, I do want to emphasize, we will constantly assess where we're. That is our job to do, and we will absolutely do that in terms of considering additional returns. We have maybe tracked to where we're perhaps six months ahead of where we thought given the strength in prices. If you recall when I speak about that window, we have to reset the balance sheet to the midyear. I'd say we'll probably likely have 3 in front of it, I'd love to think we have 2 in front of it little bit quicker than what we thought. But would just come back to the proforma sort of your concept of data I mentioned. We have got about $500 million of the cash from the sale and the Mitsubishi on the balance sheet. We know that's going to be spent about half year, we know we're going to start our contribution thereafter. So the approach that we really do want to take and the we are on a more conservative balance sheet then we have, clearly, we're sitting very well in terms of what the balance sheet metrics, we'll actively consider it. But we probably are almost at the low point today as we look forward, but we will actively consider it. We will consider all forms of returns to shareholders, we'll probably stick with 40% base of dividend, we'll stick with that, but if we do considering the excess returns then we'll consider the buybacks, the additional dividend et cetera as you sould expect."

You remember, we said that the current synthetic offering doesn't differentiate synthetics from the natural product. And that consumers told that this wasn't great, but they were confused by the offering. So we see there's a perfectly legitimate place for a laboratory grade diamond offering, but we don't think it's the same as the natural business and that's really why we launched Lightbox. We announced Lightbox in June and we sold our first diamond at the end of September. And we only sell 20,000 carats in total by the end of 2019 before our facility in Oregon comes on stream. Since we started, the Lightbox offering has had a tremendously positive impact on price up from a light grade diamond point of view, at the wholesale level prices have come down of the competitive product between 30% and 60%, which is extraordinary given how little we've sold. So I think there's already evidence that the positioning of the product as to what it should be, which is not a natural diamond is already starting to be successful. We'll carry on working on that. But I think on the other side of the question in relation to how do we stress test projects going forward. A couple of things. As Mark said, we think supply has probably just about peaked in 2018. And we think that's good provided, we can continue to grow demand. So as long as we can keep growing demand for the natural there should be a positive outcome there. And secondly, as Mark I think to point out in relationship to the asset quality. We have overall the highest quality assets and the highest margin assets in the diamond business. So our ability to withstand price fluctuation is I think considerably higher than other people. So I think in the round of those 3 points as we feel positive about the project going forward. Of course, we stress test different scenarios, when there's upside and the downside in relation to all projects, but we're up comfortably we think within any range of consents there."

And that in itself it's a brand it's a luxury brand, it's a very special case and you want to make sure that we keep it there and take it further as a important part of the business. 
In terms of structural, the issues with respect to capital in a longer term. I think, and I tried to say it, maybe not as well as I could, we've got Quellaveco, as a material step change in the business, one of the things I think and I talked about this is one of the damages, the damage that Minas-Rio did is towards as a business not only as itself but also rob the rest of the business of the incremental capital you need to continue to improve your business. So I think the damage was too far, we're not going to make that mistake again. So when I talked about Quellaveco, making a 50% contribution to the quality and growth in the business, those other the incremental projects in my view as just as important. So you're spreading the risk. So you're actually changing and lowering the risk profile and you're improving the quality of all parts of the portfolio. And I think, taking that balanced approach in terms of capital allocation is critical. And I think again reinforcing the point through the syndication exercise in Quellaveco, it's a very different company, in a very different company approach in terms of capital as well."

And the fact that we have 90% to 95% support from the community, it was a pretty important factor I think in making sure we got the support going forward. So I think we've got good support from the local communities that they've been fantastic with us even in the spill, in fact popularity with the community went up after we had the first spill and what they said is your reaction to the spill was as good as we could've expected. So I'm not saying you're happy, but certainly I think the we've done a all the right things and everyone in the team has done a great job.

So you'll recall that we've been talking about a deficit in the palladium market for many years now. clearly, everyone as it was supplied palladium from aboveground stock. Everyone said, we believe it we're actually aboveground stock runs out but at the end of 2016, for the first time we really started seeing the structural deficit and the fact that there wasn't materially around. So recalling 2016, we had that shut down in our precious metal refinery. We needed to go back into the market to buy metal and then we started finding and actually it was very difficult to buy palladium. Towards the end of 2016, we started seeing the price move for the first time. 2017 and 2018  over the last 3 years we've seen 1.5 mill ounces of palladium ETF's being redeemed. And this is what's been supplying the market. And over the last two years you haven't been able to get that. So we went on 600,000 ounces in palladium, last year, the Johnson making numbers look like in deficit. It required the Russians ration to sell 300,000 ounces from the stock, and 600,000 ounces from ETF, just to get to the balance number. So the point is actually the structural deficit in palladium with very low above stocks is what's driving the price. So is there about to be crash? we don't think so. There's also remember, in a years time, you're starting to see China six, which is the loadings about a gram per vehicle extra. At 700,000 to 1 million extra ounces of palladium that's going to be needed. So if you look at where there can come from, it can only come from platinum switching. So we don't think that there's any likelihood, anytime soon that you see a palladium crash? I think there is much more likely palladium runs really hard and it drags Rhodium with that. Rhodium is still less than twice the palladium price. Rhodium is cheap at these prices. There's been some speculation in rhodium, we think but I think generally still underlying basis for rhodium demand. We know the Chinese are being buying additional rhodium as they're being putting extra rhodium on to the catalyst. So I don't hold your breath for 10 years may be a bit longer. Rhodium, palladium still a good. And there has to be some substitution for platinum back into palladium. We don't think that happens anytime soon. We still think that's two years out. And the reason for that is because the car makers at the moment are trying to deal with the real world driving issues. And that's why they're not substituting yet.

And you've got to look at rhodium, palladium and platinum on a continuum. And the basket price is really important to understand the cause producers of different product, catalyst can move across that continual at any particular time. But then what is required to then switch between the two is quiet an administrative exercise. And I've been talking to people in the last few months what is that entire. And so it's not continuous movement, it's a bit lumpy, but the basket price gives you a sense of what funds are being allocated into PGM's in terms of industrial applications, and I think that's the more important number to focus on because those uses are actually, they're quite substitutable, but the administration process, to make the changes quite significant. So over the long term, we look towards continuum in the short term, where they go it provides us with a bit flexible at in terms of the short term capital allocation, but we take the long view on the big project. and that's why we think we had about in Mogalakwena in the longer term context as well . We don't know what it will do in the short term, none of us know how quickly substitution may occur, but we think the underlying fundamentals are very strong, particularly with the potential for the hydrogen economy, the greener economy, I think were very well-positioned in the business with great assets and what we think is a long-term high potential business."

So at the consumer level, there has been increased demand in the main market. Outside of the U.S., it's a little bit more mix but it's very much ForEx driven for example because ultimately, diamonds are priced in dollars and if you live in a non dollar country that can be quite difficult to for a retailer to match a dollar price increase. If you also look at supplier for last 3 or 4 years, there has been a reasonable increase of supplier over the same period. Not necessarily of higher quality goods but there has been an increase of supplier but has been karates available to be sold. We think that peak is about now, it might be in a few months time but it's years out, clearly there have been difficulties in the period in the midstream.

So Phil",393,"So good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and very warm welcome to Anglo American's 2018 results. I'm Stuart Chambers, the Chairman, and it's my pleasure to do so. Just wanted to talk about 2 things before I hand over to Mark. Firstly, board changes. So Philip Hampton retired in December of last year. So he stepped down after 9 years of fantastic service. He was our senior independent director. And that role has been passed on to Byron Grote. And secondly, Jack Thompson, he attended his last board earlier this week and will be stepping down before the AGM. And therefore, won't be seeking reelection, also after nine years of fantastic service. Jack is one of our two nonexecutive directors with extensive mining experience, operationally non-technical side. That's something we're very keen to replace. We're towards the end of our process to do so and we are expecting to announce something before the AGM in terms of the replacement. Those are the board changes. The only other subject that I want to touch on not -- and understandably, is safety. Very encouraging and very reassuring. You'll hear from Mark how we've improved our safety performance again last year to a new record level, 16% better on recordables than a year before, which was itself a record. Very encouraging, however, as many of you, if not all of you know, 5 people lost their lives in our operations last year. And it has to stop, obviously. So we launched our Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce last year. The design of that, of course, is to penetrate the whole of the organization, every nook and cranny and under -- discover essentially what underpins these fatal incidents. The fundamental underlying issues. We've done that, we've got the program, the program is underway and we're in the middle of executing that, and its key. And I think if you add to that the tragedy last month, where one of our industries -- one of the industries' tailings dam fell, which you all know very much about that. That just serves to underpin yet again for all of us, safety has to be our number 1 priority. And the only goal that makes any sense in this is zero harm. So it's a constant vigil. I think with that, let me hand over to Mark to kick off our presentation."

Ladies and Gentlemen, we're pleased to be here today and thank you for joining us. Like Stuart, I think it's important to acknowledge the recent Brazilian tragedy. The one thing I would like to say is all of us in the industry",3175,"Thanks, very much Stuart. Ladies and Gentlemen, we're pleased to be here today and thank you for joining us. Like Stuart, I think it's important to acknowledge the recent Brazilian tragedy. 
The one thing I would like to say is all of us in the industry are connecting and talking about how we can all play a part in finding solutions for the industry. I'll talk about that a little bit further, but again, I thought it was appropriate just to acknowledge our colleagues and their losses. And on a broader basis, the need or reemphasize the need to continue to take steps to make sure that we can create a zero harm workplace and that includes zero harm to both employees and local communities, and I think that's our most pressing and important priority as an industry. 
In terms of our results for the year, the key theme that we'll be talking to is unlocking our full potential. Consistent with our theme, you'll see that we have a photo of a copper mine with some interesting diagrams on it. That was totally Anil's attempt to show that we've become a modern miner. And it is actually a photo of El Soldado, and the reason that's important is El Soldado will be the first site where we're recommissioning our new bulk ore sorters and by the end of the year, we'll be commissioning our coarse particle flotation units as well. So for us, whilst that photo may not look that interesting, for a mining engineer knowing the background to it, it's an extremely attractive photo. 
So in terms of results, I think the important point to make is we're continuing to deliver on what we said we'd do. While 2018 wasn't without challenges, obviously, the administer of pipeline being a key issue, we've been able and we've seen step ups from a number of key areas in the business to try and cover that event across the business and the numbers are respectable, I think, in the context with what we had to do with -- during the course of the year. The volumes were up, most notably from copper. Duncan and the team really did do a great job. And the feedback that we had from the analyst visit in the last quarter of the year I think reflected on how much progress I think both the copper team have done and how I think we've done as a broader organization. EBITDA margins continued to improve to 42%, up from 40% last year. That reflects both ongoing focus on productivity improvements, I'll talk to that a little bit later, and cost controls across the business, and the marketing contribution. Peter and the girls have done a good job in continuing to improve our realized prices against the value and use metric that we use, and again, making a good contribution. 
Free cash flow was strong. Return on capital employed was a healthy 19%, so I think we're continuing to build a solid foundation for future performance. And I've just pressed the wrong button, we were almost panicked stations. So in pulling apart the performance, we always talk to safety, health and environment. As Stuart reflected in terms of safety, 5 fatal incidents. For us, it doesn't matter how good the results are, no year is a good year if you have a fatal incident or if you have lost a colleague. And so for us, we do take the time to reflect, try and understand and the Elimination of Fatalities Task (sic) [Taskforce] teamwork is -- along with our tailings work, they are the 2 most pressing projects or important projects for us to continue to work on. And for us and everyone in the organization, we're committed to delivering a zero harm workplace. And yes, we've made good progress, again, our best performance in  100 years, 16% lower injury frequency rate, but at the same time again, nothing to celebrate when you lose a colleague. 
In terms of the health front, again for us, it's an important issue for our industry, making sure that we're creating workplaces that do no harm. We've got some work to do on Moscow's skeletal injuries, that is, people doing work where there's a degenerative condition so we've got to do some redesign in those workplaces and that's an important project to us. 
And then finally, on the environmental side, again, the Brazilian incident cast a shadow over the industry. In our case, we had 2 pipeline leaks in Australia that we reported in the first quarter and I've already talked about those at the half year. I guess the positive side there is we commissioned or recommissioned Minas-Rio in December as we forecast at the time. In the first two months, the operation has gone very well. We're up to capacity and so the forecast that we talked about for the full-year production appear to be on track. 
Again, I'll talk a little bit more about the Minas-Rio tailings dam, because we've had a few inbound questions. But if I could make a simple observation, in engineering terms, we have what we call an upstream lift where the dam wells are built tailings-on-tailings. You then have a downstream lift where you've got a more purpose built containment structure. Then you've got a water containing facility, which is another level of engineering above downstream construction. Minas-Rio is a water containing engineered facility. So we think whilst there will be debates about tailings dams in Brazil, the Minas-Rio construction is 2 levels above in terms of its engineering approach and again, happy to answer more questions, but I think we're in the right place in terms of those conversations and in terms of what we've built at the site. 
To be more specific about our current processes, and again, I want to reemphasize there's been a lot of discussion around what will we do and how will we engage in the conversations around tailings dams for the industry. We will participate and collaborate with all of our colleagues because this is an industry issue. When I talk about Anglo American, if I can describe it in the most succinct way possible, we have our staff on site that monitor and are responsible for the placement of tailings and management of water on a daily basis. We have at each site, an engineer or a competent person that has a background in either geomechanics, geosoil mechanics or geotechnical background, that is classed our competent person that is responsible for the engineering of and the correct management of the tailings facility on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. We have an engineer of record that was with us at the start that helped us design the facility, design the process to manage the facility, and we have been involved in monitoring our practices and processes during the course of deposition and at least on a quarterly basis, giving us feedback in terms of what they're seeing, what we're doing and how we're operating. Now because they're partnered and become part and parcel of the design and the process, we don't count them as independent in terms of managing the facility. So we have a central role, reporting to now Tony O'Neill outside the line that does regular checks on all of our facilities and with his team, making sure that everything we should be doing is in place. And then on top of that, we have in each commodity grouping, a tailings risk committee that looks at all the tailings facilities and ensures that the correct processes are being applied. And then on top of that, we have an independent review that's done on an annual basis by another consultant outside the group. So from our point of view -- those standards were developed in 2014, the development of the ICMN standards came in 2016, and they drew from our standard as part of their design. So what we are trying to work at now is how we can work with the industry on a collaborative basis and where there may be organizations may not be able to have that level of internal discipline and process had, where as an, industry create, some sort of process or resource that can help us make sure that all tailings in the industry. So it's not simply a single company issue, it's an industry problem and from our point-of-view, how do we play a part in finding an industry solution and I think that's very important. And that's the important message that we wanted to leave you with today. 
In terms of the operations, we continue to make progress in terms of performance. Over the course of the last 12 months, our productivity has continued to improve. So going back to our 2012 benchmark, we've almost doubled productivity across the group as you can see with the 98% number. Overall production is 10% above where we were in 2012, with around 50% less assets. Each asset that we retain and we've been working with, is now on average doing 30% more -- or is delivering 30% more production than it was 5 years ago, and in the mine that's been done through operating improvements, process improvements, incremental dam model making and generally running the asset better than we were 5 years ago. There's a consequence. Our real costs are down 43% or as you can see there, 26% in nominal terms. And that's been a key driver in terms of our business improvement and margin growth over the last 5 years, where we've gone from around a 30% industrial margin, EBITDA margin, to 42% and that's despite a 10% drop in our basket price receipt. And so from our point of view, we believe the progress has been solid, but there's still a lot more we can achieve because we're not universally or across-the-board best-in-class. We're certainly competitive today compared to where we were, but we're not yet best-in-class and so there's a lot more opportunity. If you take the numbers, and we've used an independent report at the half year and we've tried to look through public numbers to see where we rate against our competitors. Now I might just explain this chart again because I've had a few question where -- I'm not sure everybody understands where we come from on these numbers. I'm going to walk across the chart. If you look at Anglo American back in 2012, our average cost position, and we take quality into account, so we call it leading margin curve improvement. It's actually a breakeven cost curve, so we're taking the quality of our product into account and coming back with a breakeven price and we do that for our competitors' products as well. It's mainly in met coal and iron ore that you make that adjustment. The other numbers are pretty easy to take into the chart. We're at about the midpoint on the cost curve, the 49th percentile. In the last 5 years, we've improved our relative position across all of our commodities and it's actually revenue weighted, so we're trying to give you a weighted position. We're at this 37th percentile, so we're mid-Q2 on average. So that suggests that we've improved our costs quicker than many of our competitors. And I think that's the important point. Everybody is getting better. What we've got to do is get better quicker. And yes, we had probably had in some cases a lower base to work from, but doing that across the board and doing it in a consistent way is the big challenge. And so far, we've made good progress. Now against our peers, 27% to 38%, 36% to 45%, peer 3 doing better, some new assets making a real difference. So we've been competitive in -- or against our major diversified competitors. At the end of the day, there's always a little bit of noise in the numbers. From our perspective, we believe we can continue to improve our position, and that's going to be an important part of the focus in terms of our presentation today. But -- so we've made good progress, but there's a lot more we think we can do to continue to improve that position because I've got no doubt everybody's in the same conversation about how do we get better. 
So in stepping back and looking at the journey we've been on in the last 3 years, there are 3 key points we wanted to make: Firstly, in terms of operating leverage, that is, how good are you on the cost curve, we've moved to the bottom of the range. So from a competitive position, we think we're well placed. Doesn't mean you stop, there's a lot more work to be done. In terms of financial leverage, and Stephen will unpack the numbers, we've still got a little more work to do to make sure we've got our balance sheet where we want it, we're certainly in the right area and looking very strong in terms of our balance sheet and what we can do from here in terms of driving the business and doing the things that we need to do to make sure we're delivering value for shareholders; third, is inside the portfolio and we talk about Quellaveco, being a key driver of profitable growth for business over the next 5 years, it represents about 50% of that incremental growth. The thing -- and Stephen will use the word balance in his conversation and more than simply about the balance sheet, he'll use the word balance in that we've got Quellaveco as a large scale project that we're executing on. We've also got a number of small scale, quick return projects, Moranbah we're having to do bottlenecking, shipping -- a new ship in Namibia. Chris has got a range of opportunities he can see, particularly around the [indiscernible]. He's doing that work now. Bruce is working on things inside his business as he does the transition through Venetia. We've got a number of small scale rapid private projects that gives us a nice portfolio of business improvement opportunities. And again, Stephen will impact that. But for us, it's starting to give us a real balance, in the portfolio in terms of what we doing today, what we can improve, and where we can continue to enhance the portfolio. 
To sort of put a bit more shape behind that, if I talk to what we've been doing in the last 5 years, we talk about the operating model. In some ways, it ends up being a grab bag of a whole range of conversation, but it is about doing things differently and making sure that the conversation I'm having here is no different to the conversation that front-line supervisors are having with the people that really do deliver the results, but it has to be in the context that's meaningful. So how do we translate that through the organization and make sure the planned work, the objectives we've set, get delivered and that's really the guts of what we're doing and how we're improving the business. We're also now starting to transition into a different type of improvement over the next five years that we think doesn't deliver a lower result, it delivers continuing improvement, but in a different shape. And it then starts to focus on P101. So when I talked about our operating practices, let's say we are in the bottom half of the performance in terms of equipment. So I'll give you an example, shovel. A 4100 shovel, the best in the class with 45 million ton a year, the Anglo American average from its fleet of 4100 shovels was around 22 million, 23 million ton a year, our best was around 30 million. 12 months ago, we set the challenge.  P101, how do we have each part of -- or each major piece of mining equipment or processing plant delivering top quartile performance. So we said okay, the benchmark for the shovel, 45 million ton a year. Every one of our operators who was running a 4100 shovel said we will achieve that number within 3 years. In 12 months, Dawson was hitting 50 million tons a year, right, of around a 28 million ton starting position. So I'm looking at how we set the places up, how we ran those assets and that type of improvement is being replicated across the portfolio. It looks different in different places, different baselines, different skill sets, but that's the approach. And we're doing that with all of our critical plant and equipment. P101, 100 being best-in-class, the objective is let's -- how do we go beyond best-in-class, so that's where the P101 came from, as Stephen said, a typical engineer's title for a project that should be a lot sexier than P101 indicates. 
And on future smart mining, it's around new innovation. How do we reconfigure traditional processes to drive step changes in our performance? And when I talk sustainability, I'll show you what we think that transformation of our process looks like in the longer term. So P101 in the business, we think copper processing, the Venetia acceleration, so Bruce is in the room. PGM shovels and productivity, along with performance are all areas of business where we see potential for significant changes and Moranbah is a good example where we've -- where we've doubled productivity over the last three years, and the question is how do you go another 30% over the next 3 years. And then, in terms of the future smart mining, bulk sorting as I said, El Soldado is the first unit. We've got a unit going into Barro Alto and into Mogalakwena, coarse particle flotation will have its first this year under the install this year. Data analytics underline the way we think about the business and the way we pull apart the data and think how we can improve the business. 
So for us, the journey from 30% to 42% margin was all about fundamental business improvement, the things that we could see on the ground that we could get at, things that we could change, reconfiguring the pit, turning session around 90 degrees, all of those types of changes have helped us get to 42%, including the marketing work and the change in the marketing model. To get from 42% to 45% to peer 50%, P101, the innovation work and the projects that we're developing across the business -- both Quellaveco and the incremental improvements are all designed to put us in this sort of territory. So from where we are today, the 20% to 25% growth in the operations and at the same time, improving the quality of the business, expressed through our EBITDA margin is where we're taking the business, and that's on an apples-for-apples basis. So that's where we're about, that's what we're trying to achieve and with that, I'll pass across to Stephen."
409115,603087483,1663837,"Anglo American plc, 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now Mark got to speak about his picture on his slides, so I figure it's only fair that I speak about my picture on mine. I just wanted to squash any rumors that that's what I eat for breakfast. It's a bowl of palladium grain and as Chris wou",2093,"Thanks, Mark. Now Mark got to speak about his picture on his slides, so I figure it's only fair that I speak about my picture on mine. I just wanted to squash any rumors that that's what I eat for breakfast. It's a bowl of palladium grain and as Chris would tell me, I probably couldn't afford it these days with the price of palladium anyway. 
So let's turn to the numbers. As Mark said, a really strong set of results and very consistent with what we're presented sort of period on period. And that's something they we are really striving to achieve with the business. It's that sort of run rate, the rhythm, building on strong fundamentals and whether that's the operating model or a strong balance sheet. It's that consistent base that gives us that ability to sort of grow and continue the journey in the business. So EBITDA obviously increased year-on-year, despite the suspension at Minas-Rio. That flowed into EPS of $2.55 per share and obviously, the 40% payout ratio into the dividend and returning to shareholders. $3.2 billion of free cash flow and CapEx of $2.8 billion was in line with our guidance. 
Turning to EBITDA and just the drivers of that, obviously, a 4% increase from $8.8 billion to $9.2 billion across the year again, despite the headwind at Minas-Rio. You can see there the benefit of prices, our currency, offset by inflation at Minas-Rio, almost offset one another. 
Now turning to the cost and volume. We'd set ourselves a target of $800 billion for the year, and we achieved $400 billion of that. So a little bit disappointed with our progress there. We did, in fact, achieve improvements of $800 million, but they were offset by headwinds. In particular, we had above CPI increase in oil prices through that March to September timeframe. A few other little costs, particular in South Africa slightly above CPI, and we had a little bit of inventory build, which should itself release itself through the first half of '19. So not making any excuses, it is our job to deliver that target and we do intend to do so. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Again, the same sort of messages that we have delivered over the last couple of years. We have spoken about this window that we have, this opportunity to fundamentally reset the balance sheet up until the middle of 2019. And that's the point when we start contributing our cash flow to the Quellaveco CapEx in particular. So very pleased with our journey to date, net debt down to $2.8 billion. And as we've said, we're pleased with the transformation of the balance sheet, that's some $10 billion that we've reduced net debt by over the last 4 years. Clearly, across all of the metrics we're in a very strong position as I say, and really pleased with the progress there. Just a couple of small little footnotes. So obviously, at the end of December, we're still sitting on about $500 million of the cash we received from Mitsubishi. So sort of proforma debt you could say is closer to that [ 3.4 ]. And during 2019, with the change in accounting standard, you'll see some of the operating leases come onto the balance sheet and that's also about $400 million to $500 million. So again, we'll take you on that journey with us as we work through the year. In terms of returns to shareholders. Obviously, the 40% payout ratio, again, we've done exactly what we said we would do. 40% payout on underlying earning resulted in a $0.51 dividend for the second half. And that takes dividends for the full year to $1 per share. 
Again, that's just over $2.6 billion that'll take us to in terms of returns to shareholders since we reinserted the dividend about 18 months ago. Obviously, as well as the debt reduction of an excess of $10 billion over the years, we have invested back in the business in addition to the returns to shareholders and over that same sort of timeframe since '15, we've invested some $10 billion-plus back into the business. And again, that's important in terms of building and sustaining the future as we go forward. So how have we done? This is a slide I like because we all talk a good game in terms of capital location, but how are we going in terms of the scorecard. So in terms of the scorecard for us for the year, attributable free cash flow prior to discretionary capital of $3.8 billion. So again, quite pleased with our outcome. How did we use that? We reduced debt by $1.7 billion, paid cash dividends in the year of $1.3 billion and then obviously, $0.5 billion in terms of that discretionary allocation. That does include things like exploration, evaluation, CapEx, across a number of small projects et cetera. You will see that increase as we go forward, particularly in terms of Quellaveco, and we'll feed into that growth number as we go forward. 
I'm going to touch on CapEx now and you'll see in the presentation, we've given you some additional guidance in the outer years and I just want to talk that through a little bit so that we're understanding that the value, in particular, that that drives. So in terms of sustaining business -- sustaining CapEx, we flagged in December that we would see that tick up a little bit in the next couple of years in particular. And part of our priorities as a management team is to not only preserve but also enhance the value of the portfolio of operations that we have. And that's exactly what we intend to do. Those opportunities present themselves in a number of ways and that can be cost opportunities, efficiency, productivity and it could be some brownfield expansion, sort of programs from some life extensions. But as we realize that higher production rate and generate value, that comes with an increase in the absolute number of sustaining staying capital as we grow the base, we grow the portfolio and we grow production. A good example of that is the one that Mark mentioned earlier in terms of the longwalls at Moranbah-Grosvenor, obviously, with the production and productivity improvements that we've had there, that means you work through your mine development areas quicker, you're into the next longwall move quicker and therefore, in just a snapshot of time, obviously, your absolute number looks a little bit higher but it's for the right reasons, it's generating increased production, generating increased value, generating increased cash flow. And that's really what we're all about. So as a result of that, and obviously given that we've got things like Quellaveco coming on in 2022, the Moranbah-Grosvenor, and production that I've spoken about, Minas-Rio coming back to full production, we upped our guidance in terms of that sustaining capital, that 2.8 that 3.1, in terms of a longer-term number that you should then guide to. Again, for all the right reasons in terms of generating value. 
In particular, and I'll touch on this in a slide or two, the sort of projects and the sort of productivity improvements that we're working on generate really good margins, very attractive margins, very attractive returns. And that adds to that margin journey that Mark spoke about moving from 42 towards 50. And obviously, in terms of the cash flow that it generates. So the big test for us, and this is something that I wanted to just spend a little bit time on this morning is, have we spent the money well because I know that was sort of the question that came from the December update talk that we did. I'm pleased to say yes, we have. So we're seeing exactly the same efficiencies that we've seen on the operating side of the business in the capital spend, measured as dollars of sustaining capital per copper equivalent production. And you can pee holes in the calculation if you want to, the level of improvement is so significant that it's hard to ignore. So that's 30% on nominal terms and closer to 40% in terms of real terms. So a really good journey. It shouldn't be a surprise because some of our sustaining CapEx and mine development is using the same that gives the same fleet that we're using from an opening point of view. So it's the same sort of influence that's feeding into our capital spend. 
Obviously as I say, as the portfolio increases, we will look to maintain that efficiency. We'll have slightly higher sustaining CapEx in the next year or two. So may see that just bobble around a little bit, but we're very confident on the journey that we're on from that capital spend inefficiency. Ultimately, measure us on return on capital employed rather than trying to break it down and pull bits of capital out. And that again has been a great journey as we've moved from 9%, 11% up to 19%. I'm sorry, no turn on those words intended. And that's been a great journey for us, that return on capital employed and again, something that we -- we're pleased with the journey and pride ourselves on. 
So turning to growth CapEx, again that will increase a little over the next year, but -- over the next couple of years, but no surprise as our spent on Quellaveco, in particular, is probably the main driver. As you can see on the slide, we do have a number of incredibly attractive brownfield, relatively small scale individually opportunities ahead of us. Again, the main messages is here, they'll be assessed and studied with the same sort of discipline that you've seen in the past. They happen over time, and again, relatively small in nature. So they'll come up for approval and over time, the capital spend will be over time and obviously, always subject to market conditions and assessment. So just coming back to the cost and volume improvement that Mark touched on earlier in terms of some of the detail on the drivers of that. Obviously, a big focus on P101 and the technology development, we remain absolutely committed to that $3 billion to $4 billion target by the end of 2022. So that's the start of '18 to '22. We're $900 million into that, if you take last year's actual and then this year's target. I just want to make sure it's clear that that $500 million for '19 doesn't include the Minas-Rio turnaround as we've done this year. So I'll be pulling that out separately, we'll show the turnaround of that separately next year as well. So this $500 million would be on top of that, in terms of an EBITDA driver. As we flagged, I think it was a half year, some of this will be a little bit back ended in that timeframe. Some of the investment we're making in the technology development, the P101, will just take a little bit of time to flow itself into EBITDA and cash flow. But that's okay, it's planned, there's programs in place to deliver -- to deliver those initiatives and Mike touched on some of the things that start to go live through this year and particularly at El Soldado. 
In terms of this year's number, probably one of the bigger influence is some of this productivity increase that we're expected to see out of Moranbah-Grosvenor from the Queensland met coal operations. So just to wrap it up from me, where does it all take us? I think steady, but meaningful production growth over that next 4 to 5 years. And I think is something as we -- Mark mentioned, I love to talk about the word balance at the moment, but it is a balance for us. It's a balance about what we've done with the balance sheet, and we continue to focus on that and make sure we're building from strong foundations. The P101 initiatives would drive margins and cash flow again and enables us to continue to do what we want to do. Again built on sound operating practice. So yes, a lot of you did attend the copper visit back at the end of last year. You can see the benefits of the operating model flow through and a lot of the other sites are going on exactly the same journey. And obviously, built off a strong balance sheet at the end of the day. Thank you."

Let me kick away with a Minas-Rio. So as I mentioned earlier, we have recommissioned Minas-Rio. All the key parameters that we were looking to deliver is being delivered in terms of the startup. We did upgrade the guidance in December on the basis of getting the earlier license for mining and we thought 6 months ahead of schedule, so that allows us to open the pit up so we can blend ores, so the delivery of an improved product to port as an important part of that process. And the unit costs, FAV, is around $21, at the range we expect $28 to $31. At full rate, we'd expect it to be closer to $25 a ton, maybe with inflation, somewhere near $26. Our breakeven cost at full rate still looks like about $35 a ton. It's what we're targeting for the product. It's a 67% product low deleterious element. And if you've got some really tough questions, Ruben is actually in the audience today. So we can cover off anything you may want to hear about. And on the tailings side, we have an existing tailings dam that's used, and as I described it, basically a water containing facility. We're actually -- we've got the license to install so we're actually lifting the next level. And the last approval required will be then the license to operate when it's completed. We would expect to have that license midyear, but we are making sure that we could place through the authorities. The federal authorities have already talked to and publicized the new standard. That has no issues for us at all. We would expect that Minas-Rio will come out with some comments on new standards in the next couple of months. Again, we don't expect that to impact us, given the nature of the installation we have. If I could say this way, if there were to be something that were to impact Minas-Rio, given the nature of the dam, it would literally all mining across the country, if they came anywhere near what we've built. So we don't expect that to be an issue, but at the same time, we'll work with the authorities just to make sure that we've got all the key points covered. So we're still forecasting midyear. As I said, it might -- the conversation might go for another month or two, but beyond that, we think we're in pretty good shape. 
On Quellaveco, again not much additional to report post December, other than good progress continues. The dam, which was built as part of the river diversion, has gone well. Earthworks are going well and when we characterized the project last year, I said that the next 12 to 18 months was critical. Big earthwork projects and lots of concrete. So once we get through that phase, which I think is the real critical path program, once we get out of the ground and you start seeing metal being erected, I think we'll have navigated the toughest part of the program and we're very pleased with the progress so far. So at this stage, the 44 month schedule looks very good. Costs tight, but still in good shape, particularly on the schedule -- with the schedule being in good shape as well. So we're pretty happy with where we're. And the [ 1.3 ] to [ 1.5 ] estimate for this year, for us, will be mainly back end loaded at a 100% basis to [ 1.3 ] to [ 1.5]. Our share would be somewhere between [ 400 ] and 600 in the second half given we've got the Mitsubishi funds we'll draw again for the first half of the year. I will continue to keep an exploration slide in the pack because as we speak, John and the guys are starting to show some interesting opportunities emerge. In Brazil, I can confirm and I will confirm that yes, we intersected copper mineralization. Yes, the grades are at or above -- in number of those intersections, above nominal growth that we would think on a larger scale lower grade copper deposit would be mineable. The intersections are in some cases above 100 meters, but I've got to stress that we've got some interesting intersections. That's all we have at the moment. As a consequence of those intersections, we stopped ore drilling after 6 holes. We secured 37,000 square kilometers of tenements. We had overflown the tenements and we've got 3 or 4 prospects that we have identified from the Aero Mag surveys. So we're following those up and during the course of the next 12 months, we'll work out what we've actually got. If I could say this, at the moment it's interesting, it's not anything that we could call a resource. It's an interesting position that will take a little bit of time to unpack. And I expect this time next year, we'll give you a much better scope and be able to paint a much better picture of what we have or what we may not have, but I think it's important to let you know that the things we've talked about are being confirmed and it's interesting, it's not yet exciting. So somebody described me as being excited, I said no, I'm interested, I'm not yet excited. And so I just want to make sure we've got that conversation in balance. We've also been doing some work across the portfolio and in Mogalakwena. The work at Mogalakwena has been interesting. We're looking at extensions to the ore body. The key points to make is the mineralization appears maybe to be a bit thicker than we thought. The grades may be a little bit better, and the material may be a little bit shallower. So I think Chris is not yet excited, but he's getting close, so we're encouraged. A lot of work to be done, Chris and the team are doing feasibility work on potential options. We are watching the market very carefully as well. So anything we do will be with an eye to the market and an eye on what's right for our shareholders in the long-term. So we're just measuring our pace and the work we're doing, but the results there are also very encouraging. 
On sustainability, and really sustainability is part of everything we do, its part of any conversation we're in. Starting with safety right the way through to social performance. So it remains a key part of all of our dialogue. If you look at our portfolio, from our point of view we think that the commodities that we have is a consequence of the quality assets. Remember, we're about a quality asset portfolio. So what drives us forward, and where we focus our efforts is having the best mining assets in the world. Yes, we take into account the markets that we're selling into and geographies, but it's about quality assets. As a consequence of that focus on quality assets, the major commodity positions that we're in, diamonds, copper, PGM's, bulks, we think plays into the macro trends around growing middle-class consumer world. The focus on the environment long-term, a greener world, and an electrified world. Now some people thought that I was talking about a WhatIt's supporter, while we're talking about electrified and exciting. But in terms of the big trends..."

In terms of the products and in each case we're building the portfolio, Bruce focusing, getting the business up to [ 37 ] million carats with the transition at Venetia, in the copper business we talk about Collahuasi, we talk about, obviously, Quellaveco, and the longer-term opportunities of Los Bronces, in particular, the underground potential is significant. PGMs, as I said, Mogalakwena. I think a really important piece of work for the platinum team is obviously the turnaround at Amandelbult. I was there with Chris for a couple of days about three months ago and very excited with the work, but still a lot of work to be done, but making good progress. And in the bulks, 2 great positions -- well, 3 great positions in terms of quality and cost competitive position. More work to be done to improve our competitive position, but again, we've got a good portfolio across the globe. People have asked, and so I'll preempt the question on thermal coal, we've actually halved our footprint in thermal coal in the last 3 years. And as we've said, we talked to adjust transition. So our position hasn't changed. And so we're looking at all the moving parts and making sure we're positioning ourselves to have the right type of portfolio that investors want to invest in for the long term. When we look at, and if I connect the operating model, the innovation work, the changes we're delivering, we talk to sustainability in the same conversation. And as a consequence of the competitive work we're doing, we're looking at delivering a 30% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030, so that helps us drive down the cost curve. In terms of reduction of water, water place 2 parts yes, it's a cost, but also it's a constraint on the development of our assets, particularly in the long term desert climates. And so it provides us a double whammy in terms of improving the performance of the portfolio, so that's a critical piece of work for us. And greenhouse gas emissions is about the climate change debate and how we play out our part in making sure the world achieves its targets. If I go back to the strategy around trusted corporate leader I think the conversation for all of us in the industry today is about tailings. I think we've all got to play a part. And as we've said, whatever we can do to help the industry lift tailings standards then we'll be involved in all of those conversations. And what do we need to do with their colleagues to improve, I think, is a good example of this sort of approach we believe is right in terms of the industry. Thriving communities, the people most affected by our operations, are our partners in those local communities. Now I think over a long period of time we haven't done a good job with local communities, and we certainly changed our approach over the last few years. And we know we've got a lot more work to do. And for those familiar with the courageous conversations that are occurring in South African with the archbishop, that's the type of approach in terms of engagement with communities that we think it very novel and different, and certainly creating a new dialogue and healthy environment. So how do we make sure that we're doing all things right in terms of the environment? Are we doing the best we can do with tailings and all those other areas that potentially impact on communities is where our focus is and we've been doing a lot of work and our tailings we've done in 2014 is part of that program. So in terms of the business, what we look at and how we think about the future. 
In terms of margins, driving cash flow. Cash flow for us as a team is we think the effectiveness measure major shareholders are looking for in terms of our ability to return today, tomorrow and through the long-term. So margins is a real focus, getting ourselves to 45% to 50% is a critical focus for us because the cash flow then comes as a consequence. Return on capital employed measures the efficiency, that is, how well did you generate that cash flow. It's easy to generate cash flow in this industry over short periods of time. The real measure is your long-term sustainability and the deliverability or the repeatability of that cash flow, look for your return on capital employed. Did you use the capital well? And will the shareholder support you continuing to use capital, kind of respect to this number. We believe that we can deliver better than 20% through the cycle with the quality assets and the work we're doing inside the business. And asset life. The one thing I would say that over the next few years this number will move around a little bit because if we increase our production another 25%, it's never quite linear how that number moves, but at 30 years we're right out there in terms of life of asset. And so what I want you to know, what I want you to take away from today is we look at these metrics and we drive all of these metrics and making sure we've got a sustainable business that is cash flow returns and long-term continuity in terms of the business. And in our industry, they're a pretty tough set of metrics to deliver on consistently. And certainly, that's where we're focused. 
Finally, in terms of the investment proposition, we've been talking to this for a couple or 2 or 3 years, now. Paul, I noticed a few others are starting to talk to the same sort of slides. Maybe I'll just focus on capabilities today. You know about the asset story and how we've tried to position the portfolio and what we're doing in terms of return. And I think Stephen's done a good job explaining our position there. So for us, the operating model is about creating a culture inside Anglo American that's about being the best. In the end, I'll say today we're not the best. I can point to many examples where players are doing better than us on an individual basis. But as a team, we're determined to continue to take every step to catch and overtake those that we see as best. In some areas of the business, for example, I think in the longwalls, we are probably right up there. Platinum, I think again, we're right up there in the best again. But there are far more places that we're behind further than we should be. And we're not going to stay there, we're going to keep improving and we're going to keep improving quicker than anyone else. In terms of future smart mining, we can't continue to mine as we've mined for 100 years. You can't just keep building bigger trucks. We've got to think laterally, we've gone out there and think differently and so the changes that we're making to the flow sheet is about the changes that will driving the next 100 years of mining. We want to be on the forefront of that because those that lead those changes will be the outperformancers in the industry. And third, we make sure that every product we produce, whatever commodity it may be, and remembering that diamonds aren't a commodity, we sell dreams in the diamond industry. We have to make sure that every product -- is that right, Bruce? Every product we produce we have to get the best price we can and that means understanding your customers, making sure you've got a relationship and making sure that we're creating value for them to ensure that we get the value reflected back in the price that we've paid for our products. 
And so with that, we're more than happy to take questions."

The first, it's a bit childish maybe to criticize a company for doing what they said they were going to do, but a 40% payout, given the strength of the balance sheet, does look a little bit skinny versus some of your peers. So could be just maybe map out how we should think about excess capital returns; when, what's appropriate, is a 40% payout the appropriate payout ratio for this business? And are there any constraints around preferred mechanism for excess capital returns? Is it special dividends, share buybacks, any constraints around that?
Second question. In terms of -- thinking about long-term capital planning, the industry's had a very poor track record long-term, very poor record in stress testing the downside, so with respect to diamonds, could you maybe just give us some thoughts around how you think about the risks posed by synthetics? What's your base case? How do you stress test that into the long-term capital allocation for the diamonds business? And again, maybe some color on what's going on at Lightbox at the moment? And then final question. Obviously, big moves in iron ore prices, there's a sort of structural premium now embedded into high grade iron ore. How does that affect your long-term planning for Kumba? So essential for long dated mine life extensions and maybe long-term exploration there."

Thanks for the question, Dominic. When we set the 40% payout ratio, we did it with a view over time. And again, I'll come back to that balance, where we knew we were probably likely to approve Quellaveco. We have a view of what's in front of us in terms of capital spend, balance sheet journey et cetera. And so we factored that into our thinking in terms of that 40% payout ratio. One point I do want to emphasize, we will constantly assess where we are. I mean, that is our job to do and we will absolutely do that in terms of considering additional returns. We have maybe tracked to where we are perhaps six months ahead of what we thought given the strength in prices. If you recall when I speak about that window we have to reset the balance sheet to the midyear, I've said, well, we'll probably likely have a 3 in front of it, I'd love to think we'd have a 2 in front of it little it and we probably got there a little bit quicker than what I thought. But I would just come back to the proforma sort of concept of data swell that I mentioned. We have got about $500 million of the cash from the sale down to Mitsubishi on the balance sheet. We know that's going to be spent about half year, we know we're going to start our contributions thereafter. So the approach that we really do want to take and we will run a more conservative balance sheet than we have. Clearly, we are sitting very well in terms of all of the balance sheet metrics. We'll actively consider it. But we probably are almost at the low point today as we look forward, but we will actively consider it. We'll consider all forms of returns to shareholders. We'll probably stick to the 40% base dividend. We will stick with that, but if we do consider any excess returns then we'll consider the buybacks, the additional dividends et cetera, as you would expect."

You'll remember we said that the current synthetic offering doesn't differentiate synthetics from the natural product. And that consumers told us that wasn't right, but that they were confused by the offering. So we see there's a perfectly legitimate place for a laboratory ground diamond offering, but we don't think it's the same as the natural business and that's really why we launched Lightbox. We announced Lightbox in June and we sold our first diamond at the end of September. And we'll only sell 20,000 carats in total by the end of 2019 before our facility in Oregon comes on stream. Since we've started, the Lightbox offering has had a tremendously positive impact on price up from a low ground diamond point of view. At the wholesale level, prices have come down over the competitive product between 30% and 60%, which is extraordinary given how little we've sold. So I think there's already evidence that the positioning of the product as to what it should be, which is not a natural diamond, is already starting to be successful. We'll carry on working on that. But I think on the other side of the question in relation to how do we stress test projects going forward. A couple of things. As Mark said, we think supply has probably just about peaked in 2018. And we think that's good provided, we can continue to grow demand. So as long as we can keep growing demand for the natural there should be a positive outcome there. And secondly, as Mark, it was a pain, I think, to point out in relation to the asset quality. We have overall the highest quality assets and the highest margin assets in the diamond business. So our ability to withstand price fluctuations is, I think, considerably higher than other people. So I think in the round of those 3 points is we feel positive about the projects going forward. Of course we stress test different scenarios on the upside and the downside in relation to all projects, but we are comfortably, we think, within any range of concerns there."

It's a brand, it's a luxury brand, it's a very special case and we want to make sure we keep it there and take it further. It's an important part of the business. 
In terms of structural, the issues with respect to capital in the longer term. I think, and I tried to say it, maybe not as well as I could, we've got Quellaveco as a material step change in the business. One of the things I think, and I talk about this, is one of the damages or the damage that Minas-Rio did to us as a business was not only the project in of itself but also robbed the rest of the business of the incremental capital you need to continue to improve your business. So I think the damage was too far. We're not going to make that mistake again. So when I talked about Quellaveco making a 50% contribution to the quality and growth in the business, those other incremental projects in my view as just as important. So you're spreading the risk. So you're actually changing and lowering the risk profile and you're improving the quality of all parts of the portfolio. And I think, taking that balanced approach in terms of capital allocation is critical. And I think again reinforcing the point through the syndication exercise in Quellaveco, it's a very different company and a very different company approach in terms of capital as well."

On Minas-Rio, the current dam in its current configuration has around 12 months ahead of it. We would expect to see the licensing done by midyear. And that's on the assumption that it'll take the  Minas Gerais authorities a couple of months to form a final view in terms of the dam -- in terms of their legislative requirements. We don't think the Minas-Rio dam, given its construction, would likely have any material changes given the engineering aspects of the business. We think they will be more focused on other dams and other construction. And certainly, that's what we've seen at the federal level. So we're pretty confident we're in the right place. Now at the same time, we're in conversation with government. We've got at least 6 to 8 months, we think, breathing space in terms of anything we do. And the conversations have been positive and we've got 95% local community support. And when we delivered the license and the operating license for the mining business, that came 6 months early. And the fact that we had 90% to 95% support from the community was a pretty important factor, I think, in making sure we got the support to go forward. So I think we've got good support from the local communities. They've been fantastic with us, even in the spill. In fact, our popularity with the community went up after we had the first spill and what they said is your reaction to the spill was as good as we could've expected. So I'm not saying we're happy, but certainly, I think we've done all the right things and Ruben and the team have done a great job. Ruben, is there anything you'd like to add to what I said there."

So again, not telling you anything that you wouldn't think is right. If prices continue where they are today, they're probably above our base assumptions. And so yes, that would probably generate additional cash flow. Obviously, feeding off the margins and the work we're doing, that feeds into the cash flow, it feeds into less volatility, less sensitivity to movements in process and it does give you confidence then about how you run your balance sheet. So yes, that feeds into that thinking as well. And as Mark spoke about the portfolio, from an asset point of view, we also have been able to think more strategically about our capital structure. And again, lift the vision, you'll see there's a slide in there on the debt portfolio, the work we've done there over the last few years also helps de-risk any volatility and movement in prices as well. Because we have very little maturing now in the next one, two and three years. So all of those things feed into our thinking absolutely. As I say, pleased with where we are.

So you'll recall that we've been talking about a deficit in the palladium market for many years now. I mean clearly, everyone that has been supplied palladium from aboveground stock. Everyone said, well, we believe it when actually the aboveground stock runs out. At the end of 2016, for the first time, we really started seeing the structural deficit and the fact that there wasn't materially around. So recalling 2016, we had that shut down in our precious metal refinery. We needed to go back into the market to buy metal and then we started finding that actually it was very difficult to buy palladium. Towards the end of 2016, we started seeing the price move for the first time. 2017 and 2018, over the last 3 years we've seen 1.5 million ounces of palladium ETF's being redeemed. And this is what's been supplying the market. And over the last two years, you haven't been able to get that. So we went down 600,000 ounces in palladium, last year, the Johnson Matthey numbers looked like they were in deficit. It required the Russians to sell 300,000 ounces from their stock and 600,000 ounces from ETFs just to get to that balance number. So the point is actually the structural deficit in palladium with very low above ground stocks is what's driving the price. So is there about to be crash? We don't think so. There's also remember, in a years' time, you're starting to see China six, which is the loadings about a gram per vehicle extra. At 700,000 to 1 million ounces extra of palladium that's going to be needed. So if you look at where that can come from, it can only come from platinum switching. So we don't think that there's any likelihood anytime soon that you see a palladium crash. I think it is much more likely that palladium really runs hard and it drags rhodium with that. Rhodium is sold less than twice the palladium price. Rhodium is cheap at these prices. There's been some speculation in rhodium, we think, but actually generally it's still underlying basis for rhodium demand. We know the Chinese have been buying additional rhodium as they've been putting extra rhodium onto their catalysts. So I don't hold your breath for, so Mark, 10 years maybe, maybe a bit longer. Rhodium, palladium still look good. And there has to be some substitution for platinum back into palladium. We don't think that happens anytime soon. We still think that's two years out. And the reason for that is because the car makers at the moment are trying to deal with the real world driving issues. And that's why they're not substituting yet. So I think you can expect to see basket price PGM's remaining good. Stephen?"

And the basket price is really important to understand because producers of different products, catalysts, can move across that continuum at any particular time. But then the -- what is required to then switch between the two is quite an administrative exercise. So I was talking to people in the last few months about what does that entail. And so it's not a continuous movement, it's a bit lumpy. But the basket price gives you a sense of what funds are being allocated into PGMs in terms of industrial applications, and I think that's the more important number to focus on because those uses are actually, they're quite substitutable, but the administration process to make the change is quite significant. So over the long term, we look at the continuum. In the short term, where they go, it provides us with a bit flexible in terms of our short term capital allocation, but we take the long view on the big projects. And that's why we think very hard about a Mogalakwena in the longer term context as well. We don't know what it will do in the short term, none of us know how quickly substitution may occur. But we think the underlying fundamentals are very strong, particularly with the potential for the hydrogen economy, the greener economy, I think we're very well-positioned in a business with great assets and what we think is a long-term high potential business."

So at a consumer level, there has been increased demand in the main market. Outside of the U.S., it's a little bit more mixed but it's very much ForEx driven, for example, because ultimately diamonds are priced in dollars and if you live in a non-dollar country that can be quite difficult to -- for a retailer to match a dollar price increase. If you also look at supply over the last 3 or 4 years, there has been a reasonable increase of supply over the same period. Know not necessarily of higher quality goods but there has been an increase of supply so there have been carats available to be sold. We think that peak is about now, if maybe in a few months' time, but it's years out. Clearly, there have been difficulties in this period in the midstream. So the midstream has battled, as we've said before, to access enough finance on a sustainable basis to become more efficient and I think there's more work to be done there.

And second question. This Slide 30 where you're showing your capability in terms of production by individual commodities. Is this something that we should think about achievable say by 2023, which is kind of the..."

So the volumes are certainly down in South Africa, but our average index price for rough diamonds for De Beers across the group for the year was up 1%. And the niche's average production is kind of in the middle of the average range. So actually there was no significant decline in rough prices for Venetia, there was a decline in volume in South Africa."

I'm Stuart Chambers, the Chairman, and it's my pleasure to do so. Just wanted to talk about 2 things before I hand over to Mark. Firstly, board changes. So Phil",391,"So good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and very warm welcome to Anglo American's 2018 results. I'm Stuart Chambers, the Chairman, and it's my pleasure to do so. Just wanted to talk about 2 things before I hand over to Mark. Firstly, board changes. So Philip Hampton retired in December of last year. So he stepped down after 9 years of fantastic service. He was our senior independent director. And that role has been passed on to Byron Grote. And secondly, Jack Thompson, he attended his last board earlier this week and will be stepping down before the AGM and therefore, won't be seeking reelection, also after nine years of fantastic service. Jack is one of our two nonexecutive directors with extensive mining experience, operationally non-technical side. That's something we're very keen to replace. We're towards the end of our process to do so and we are expecting to announce something before the AGM in terms of the replacement. Those are the board changes. 
The only other subject that I want to touch on not -- and understandably, is safety. Very encouraging and very reassuring. You'll hear from Mark how we've improved our safety performance again last year to a new record level, 16% better on recordables than a year before, which was itself a record. Very encouraging, however, as many of you, if not all of you know, 5 people lost their lives in our operations last year. And it has to stop, obviously. So we launched our Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce last year. The design of that, of course, is to penetrate the whole of the organization, every nook and cranny and under -- discover essentially what underpins these fatal incidents, the fundamental underlying issues. We've done that, we've got the program, the program is underway and we're in the middle of executing that, and its key. And I think if you add to that the tragedy last month, where one of our industries -- one of the industries' tailings dam failed, which you all know very much about, that just serves to underpin yet again for all of us, safety has to be our #1 priority. And the only goal that makes any sense in this is zero harm. So it's a constant vigil. 
I think with that, let me hand over to Mark to kick off our presentation."
409115,603087483,1666843,"Anglo American plc, 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, very much Stuart. Ladies and gentlemen, we're pleased to be here today and thank you for joining us. Like Stuart, I think it's important to acknowledge the recent Brazilian tragedy. The one thing I would like to say is all of us in the industry",3176,"Thanks, very much Stuart. Ladies and gentlemen, we're pleased to be here today and thank you for joining us. Like Stuart, I think it's important to acknowledge the recent Brazilian tragedy. 
The one thing I would like to say is all of us in the industry are connecting and talking about how we can all play a part in finding solutions for the industry. I'll talk about that a little bit further, but again, I thought it was appropriate just to acknowledge our colleagues and their losses. And on a broader basis, the need or reemphasize the need to continue to take steps to make sure that we can create a zero harm workplace and that includes zero harm to both employees and local communities, and I think that's our most pressing and important priority as an industry. 
In terms of our results for the year, the key theme that we'll be talking to is unlocking our full potential. Consistent with our theme, you'll see that we have a photo of a copper mine with some interesting diagrams on it. That was Tony O'Neill's attempt to show that we've become a modern miner. And it is actually a photo of El Soldado, and the reason that's important is El Soldado will be the first site where we're commissioning our new bulk ore sorters and by the end of the year, we'll be commissioning our coarse particle flotation units as well. So for us, whilst that photo may not look that interesting, for a mining engineer knowing the background to it, it's an extremely attractive photo. 
So in terms of results, I think the important point to make is we're continuing to deliver on what we said we'd do. While 2018 wasn't without its challenges, obviously, the administering of pipeline being a key issue, we've been able and we've seen step-ups from a number of key areas in the business to try and cover that event across the business and the numbers are respectable, I think, in the context of what we had to do with -- during the course of the year. The volumes were up, most notably from copper. Duncan and the team really did do a great job. And the feedback that we had from the analyst visit in the last quarter of the year I think reflected on how much progress I think both the copper team have done and how I think we've done as a broader organization. EBITDA margins continued to improve to 42%, up from 40% last year. That reflects both ongoing focus on productivity improvements, I'll talk to that a little bit later, and cost controls across the business and the marketing contribution. Peter and the guys have done a good job in continuing to improve our realized prices against the value and use metric that we use, and again, making a good contribution. 
Free cash flow was strong. Return on capital employed was a healthy 19%, so I think that we're continuing to build a solid foundation for future performance. And I've just pressed the wrong button, we were almost at panic stations. 
So in pulling apart the performance, we always talk to safety, health and environment. As Stuart reflected in terms of safety, 5 fatal incidents. For us, it doesn't matter how good the results are, no year is a good year if you have a fatal incident or if you have lost a colleague. And so for us, we do take the time to reflect, try and understand and the Elimination of Fatalities Task (sic) [Taskforce] teamwork is -- along with our tailings work, they are the 2 most pressing projects or important projects for us to continue to work on. And for us and everyone in the organization, we're committed to delivering a zero harm workplace. And yes, we've made good progress, again, our best performance in  100 years, 16% lower injury frequency rate, but at the same time, again, nothing to celebrate when you lose a colleague. 
In terms of the health front, again for us, it's an important issue for our industry, making sure that we're creating workplaces that do no harm. We've got some work to do on musculoskeletal injuries, that is people doing work where there's a degenerative condition, so we've got to do some redesign in those workplaces and that's an important project for us. 
And then finally, on the environmental side, again, the Brazilian incident cast a shadow over the industry. In our case, we had 2 pipeline leaks in Minas-Rio that we reported in the first quarter and I've already talked about those at the half year. I guess the positive side there is we commissioned or recommissioned Minas-Rio in December as we forecast at the time. In the first 2 months, the operation has gone very well. We're up to capacity and so the forecast that we talked about for the full-year production appear to be on track. 
Again, I'll talk a little bit more about the Minas-Rio tailings dam because we've had a few inbound questions. But if I could make a simple observation, in engineering terms, we have what we call an upstream lift where the dam walls are built tailings-on-tailings. You then have a downstream lift where you've got a more purpose-built containment structure. Then you've got a water-containing facility, which is another level of engineering above downstream construction. Minas-Rio is a water-containing engineered facility. So we think whilst there will be debates about tailings dams in Brazil, the Minas-Rio construction is 2 levels above in terms of its engineering approach and again, happy to answer more questions, but I think we're in the right place in terms of those conversations and in terms of what we've built at the site. 
To be more specific about our current processes, and again, I want to reemphasize there's been a lot of discussion around what will we do and how will we engage in the conversations around tailings dams for the industry. We will participate and collaborate with all of our colleagues because this is an industry issue. When I talk about Anglo American, if I can describe it in the most succinct way possible, we have our staff on site that monitor and are responsible for the placement of tailings and management of water on a daily basis. We have at each site, an engineer or a competent person that has a background in either geomechanics, geosoil mechanics or geotechnical background, that is classed our competent person that is responsible for the engineering of and the correct management of the tailings facility on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. We have an engineer of record that was with us at the start that helped us design the facility, design the process to manage the facility, and we have them involved in monitoring our practices and processes during the course of deposition and at least on a quarterly basis, giving us feedback in terms of what they're seeing, what we're doing and how we're operating. Now because they're part -- they've become part and parcel of the design and the process, we don't count them as independent in terms of managing the facility. So we have a central role, reporting to, now, Tony O'Neill, outside the line that does regular checks on all of our facilities and with his team, making sure that everything we should be doing is in place. And then on top of that, we have in each commodity grouping, a tailings risk committee that looks at all the tailings facilities and ensures that the correct processes are being applied. And then on top of that, we have an independent review that's done on an annual basis by another consultant outside the group. So from our point of view -- those standards were developed in 2014, the development of the ICMM standards came in 2016, and they drew from our standard as part of their design. So what we are trying to work at now is how we can work with the industry on a collaborative basis and where there may be organizations may not be able to have that level of internal discipline and process had we, as an industry, create some sort of process or resource that can help us make sure that all tailings in the industry are safe. It's not simply a single company issue, it's an industry problem and from our point-of-view, how do we play our part in finding an industry solution and I think that's very important. And that's the important message that we wanted to leave you with today. 
In terms of the operations, we continue to make progress in terms of performance. Over the course of the last 12 months, our productivity has continued to improve. So going back to our 2012 benchmark, we've almost doubled productivity across the group as you can see with the 98% number. Overall production is 10% above where we were in 2012, with around 50% less assets. Each asset that we retain and we've been working with, is now on average doing 30% more -- or is delivering 30% more production than it was 5 years ago, and in the mine that's been done through operating improvements, process improvements, incremental dig model making and generally running the asset better than we were 5 years ago. As 0a consequence, our real costs are down 43% or as you can see there, 26% in nominal terms. And that's been a key driver in terms of our business improvement and margin growth over the last 5 years, where we've gone from around a 30% industrial margin, EBITDA margin, to 42% and that's despite a 10% drop in our basket price receipt. And so from our point of view, we believe the progress has been solid, but there's still a lot more we can achieve because we're not universally or across-the-board best-in-class. We're certainly competitive today compared to where we were, but we're not yet best-in-class and so there's a lot more opportunity. 
If you take the numbers, and we've used an independent report at the half year and we've tried to look through public numbers to see where we rate against our competitors. Now I might just explain this chart again because I've had a few question where -- I'm not sure everybody understands where we come from on these numbers. I'm going to walk across the chart. If you look at Anglo American back in 2012, our average cost position, and we take quality into account, so we call it leading margin curve improvement. It's actually a breakeven cost curve, so we're taking the quality of our product into account and coming back with a breakeven price and we do that for our competitors' products as well. It's mainly in met coal and iron ore that you make that adjustment. The other numbers are pretty easy to take into the chart. We're at about the midpoint on the cost curve, the 49th percentile. In the last 5 years, we've improved our relative position across all of our commodities and it's actually revenue weighted, so we're trying to give you a weighted position, we're at this 37th percentile, so we're mid-Q2 on average. So that suggests that we've improved our costs quicker than many of our competitors. And I think that's the important point. Everybody is getting better. What we've got to do is get better quicker. And yes, we had probably had in some cases a lower base to work from, but doing that across the board and doing it in a consistent way is the big challenge. And so far, we've made good progress. Now against our peers, 27% to 38%, 36% to 45%, peer 3 doing better, some new assets making a real difference. So we've been competitive in -- or against our major diversified competitors. At the end of the day, there's always a little bit of noise in the numbers. From our perspective, we believe we can continue to improve our position, and that's going to be an important part of the focus in terms of our presentation today. But -- so we've made good progress, but there's a lot more we think we can do to continue to improve that position because I've got no doubt everybody's in the same conversation about how do we get better. 
So in stepping back and looking at the journey we've been on in the last 3 years, there are 3 key points we wanted to make: firstly, in terms of operating leverage, that is, how good are you on the cost curve, we've moved to the bottom of the range. So from a competitive position, we think we're well placed. Doesn't mean you stop, there's a lot more work to be done. In terms of financial leverage, and Stephen will unpack the numbers, we've still got a little more work to do to make sure we've got our balance sheet where we want it, we're certainly in the right area and looking very strong in terms of our balance sheet and what we can do from here in terms of driving the business and doing the things that we need to do to make sure we're delivering value for shareholders; third, is inside the portfolio and we talk about Quellaveco being a key driver of profitable growth for business over the next 5 years, it represents about 50% of that incremental growth. The thing -- and Stephen will use the word balance in his conversation and more than simply about the balance sheet, he'll use the word balance in that we've got Quellaveco as a large-scale project that we're executing on. We've also got a number of small scale, quick return projects, Moranbah, we're having a debottlenecking, shipping -- a new ship in Namibia. Chris has got a range of opportunities he can see, particularly around the [ Aquila ]. He's doing that work now. Bruce is working on things inside his business as he does the transition through Venetia. We've got a number of small scale rapid-payback projects that gives us a nice portfolio of business improvement opportunities. And again, Stephen will unpack that. But for us, it's starting to give us a real balance, in the portfolio in terms of what we doing today, what we can improve, and where we can continue to enhance the portfolio. 
To sort of put a bit more shape behind that, if I talk to what we've been doing in the last 5 years, we talk about the operating model. In some ways, it ends up being a grab bag of a whole range of conversations, but it is about doing things differently and making sure that the conversation I'm having here is no different to the conversation that front-line supervisors are having with the people that really do deliver the results, but it has to be in the context that's meaningful to them. So how do we translate that through the organization and make sure the planned work, the objectives we've set, get delivered and that's really the guts of what we're doing and how we're improving the business. We're also now starting to transition into a different type of improvement over the next five years that we think doesn't deliver a lower result, it delivers continuing improvement, but in a different shape. And it then starts to focus on P101. So when I talked about our operating practices, let's say we were in the bottom half of the performance in terms of equipment. So I'll give you an example, shovel. A 4100 shovel, the best in the class with 45 million ton a year, the Anglo American average from its fleet of 4100 shovels was around 22 million, 23 million ton a year, our best was around 30 million. 12 months ago, we set the challenge.  P101, how do we have each part of -- or each major piece of mining equipment or processing plant delivering top quartile performance. So we said okay, the benchmark for the shovel, 45 million ton a year. Every one of our operators who was running a 4100 shovel said we will achieve that number within 3 years. In 12 months, Dawson was hitting 50 million tons a year, right, of around a 28 million ton starting position. So I'm looking at how we set the places up, how we run those assets and that type of improvement is being replicated across the portfolio. It looks different in different places, different baselines, different skill sets, but that's the approach. And we're doing that with all of our critical plant and equipment. P101, 100 being best-in-class, the objective is let's -- how do we go beyond best-in-class, so that's where the P101 came from, as Stephen said, a typical engineer's title for a project that should be a lot sexier than P101 indicates. 
And on FutureSmart mining, it's around new innovation. How do we reconfigure traditional processes to drive step changes in our performance? And when I talk sustainability, I'll show you what we think that transformation of our process looks like in the longer term. 
So P101 in the business, we think copper processing, the Venetia acceleration, so Bruce is in the room. PGM shovels and productivity, this longwall performance are all areas of the business where we see potential for significant changes. And Moranbah is a good example where we've -- where we've doubled productivity over the last three years, and the question is how do you go another 30% over the next 3 years. And then, in terms of the FutureSmart mining, bulk sorting as I said, El Soldado is the first unit. We've got a unit going into Barro Alto and into Mogalakwena, coarse particle flotation will have its first this year under the install this year. Data analytics underline the way we think about the business and the way we pull apart the data and think how we can improve the business. 
So for us, the journey from 30% to 42% margin was all about fundamental business improvement, the things that we could see on the ground that we could get at, things that we could change, reconfiguring the pit, turning session around 90 degrees, all of those types of changes have helped us get to 42%, including the marketing work and the change in the marketing model. To get from 42% to 45% to peer 50%, P101, the innovation work and the projects that we're developing across the business -- both Quellaveco and the incremental improvements are all designed to put us in this sort of territory. So from where we are today, the 20% to 25% growth in the operations and at the same time, improving the quality of the business, expressed through our EBITDA margin is where we're taking the business, and that's on an apples-for-apples basis. So that's where we're all about, that's what we're trying to achieve and with that, I'll pass across to Stephen."
409115,603087483,1666843,"Anglo American plc, 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now Mark got to speak about his picture on his slides, so I figure it's only fair that I speak about my picture on mine. I just wanted to squash any rumors that that's what I ate for breakfast. It's a bowl of palladium grain and as Chris wou",2089,"Thanks, Mark. Now Mark got to speak about his picture on his slides, so I figure it's only fair that I speak about my picture on mine. I just wanted to squash any rumors that that's what I ate for breakfast. It's a bowl of palladium grain and as Chris would tell me, I probably couldn't afford it these days with the price of palladium anyway. 
So let's turn to the numbers. As Mark said, a really strong set of results and very consistent with what we're presented sort of period on period. And that's something they we really are striving to achieve with the business. It's that sort of run rate, the rhythm, building on strong fundamentals and whether that's the operating model or a strong balance sheet, it's that consistent base that gives us that ability to sort of grow and continue the journey in the business. So EBITDA obviously increased year-on-year, despite the suspension at Minas-Rio. That flowed into EPS of $2.55 per share and obviously, the 40% payout ratio into the dividend and returning to shareholders. $3.2 billion of free cash flow and CapEx at $2.8 billion was in line with our guidance. 
Turning to EBITDA and just the drivers of that, obviously, a 4% increase from $8.8 billion to $9.2 billion across the year, again, despite the headwind at Minas-Rio. You can see there the benefit of prices or currency offset by inflation at Minas-Rio, almost offset one another. 
Now turning to the cost and volume. We'd set ourselves a target of $800 billion for the year, and we achieved $400 billion of that. So a little bit disappointed with our progress there. We did, in fact, achieve improvements of $800 million, but they were offset by headwinds. In particular, we had above CPI increase in oil prices through that March to September timeframe. A few other little costs, particular in South Africa slightly above CPI, and we had a little bit of inventory build, which should itself release itself through the first half of '19. So not making any excuses, it is our job to deliver that target and we do intend to do so. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Again, the same sort of messages that we have delivered over the last couple of years. We have spoken about this window that we have, this opportunity to fundamentally reset the balance sheet up until the middle of 2019. And that's the point when we start contributing our cash flow to the Quellaveco CapEx in particular. So very pleased with our journey to date, net debt down to $2.8 billion. And as we've said, we're pleased with the transformation of the balance sheet, that's some $10 billion that we've reduced net debt by over the last 4 years. Clearly, across all of the metrics, we're in a very strong position as I say, and really pleased with the progress there. Just a couple of small little footnotes. So obviously, at the end of December, we're still sitting on about $500 million of the cash we received from Mitsubishi. So sort of proforma debt you could say is closer to that 3.4.And during 2019, with the change in accounting standard, you'll see some of the operating leases come onto the balance sheet and that's also about $400 million to $500 million. So again, we'll take you on that journey with us as we work through the year. In terms of returns to shareholders. Obviously, the 40% payout ratio, again, we've done exactly what we said we would do. 40% payout on underlying earnings resulted in a $0.51 dividend for the second half. And that takes dividends for the full year to $1 per share. 
Again, that's just over $2.6 billion that'll take us to in terms of returns to shareholders since we reinstated the dividend about 18 months ago. Obviously, as well as the debt reduction of in excess of $10 billion over the years, we have invested back in the business in addition to the returns to shareholders and over that same sort of timeframe since '15, we've invested some $10 billion-plus back into the business. And again, that's important in terms of building and sustaining the future as we go forward. So how have we done? This is a slide I like because we all talk a good game in terms of capital allocation, but how are we going in terms of the scorecard. So in terms of the scorecard for us for the year, attributable free cash flow prior to discretionary capital of $3.8 billion. So again, quite pleased with our outcome. How did we use that? We reduced debt by $1.7 billion, paid cash dividends in the year of $1.3 billion and then obviously, $0.5 billion in terms of that discretionary allocation. That does include things like exploration, evaluation, CapEx, across a number of small projects, et cetera. You will see that increase as we go forward, particularly in terms of Quellaveco, and we'll feed into that growth number as we go forward. 
I'm going to touch on CapEx now and you'll see in the presentation, we've given you some additional guidance in the outer years and I just want to talk that through a little bit so that we're understanding that the value, in particular, that, that drives. So in terms of sustaining business -- sustaining CapEx, we flagged in December that we would see that tick up a little bit in the next couple of years in particular. And part of our priorities as a management team is to not only preserve but also enhance the value of the portfolio of operations that we have. And that's exactly what we intend to do. Those opportunities present themselves in a number of ways and that can be cost opportunities, efficiency, productivity and it could be some brownfield expansion, sort of programs from some life extensions. But as we realize that higher production rate and generate value, that comes with an increase in the absolute number of sustaining staying capital as we grow the base, we grow the portfolio and we grow production. A good example of that is the one that Mark mentioned earlier in terms of the longwalls at Moranbah-Grosvenor, obviously, with the production and productivity improvements that we've had there, that means you work through your mine development areas quicker, you're into the next longwall move quicker and therefore, in just a snapshot of time, obviously, your absolute number looks a little bit higher but it's for the right reasons, it's generating increased production, generating increased value, generating increased cash flow. And that's really what we're all about. So as a result of that, and obviously given that we've got things like Quellaveco coming on in 2022, the Moranbah-Grosvenor, and production that I've spoken about, Minas-Rio coming back to full production, we upped our guidance in terms of that sustaining capital, that 2.8 that 3.1, in terms of a longer-term number that you should then guide to. Again, for all the right reasons in terms of generating value. 
In particular, and I'll touch on this in a slide or two, the sort of projects and the sort of productivity improvements that we're working on generate really good margins, very attractive margins, very attractive returns. And that adds to that margin journey that Mark spoke about moving from 42 towards 50. And obviously, in terms of the cash flow that it generates. So the big test for us, and this is something that I wanted to just spend a little bit time on this morning is, have we spent the money well because I know that was sort of the question that came from the December update talk that we did. I'm pleased to say yes, we have. So we're seeing exactly the same efficiencies that we've seen on the operating side of the business in the capital spend, measured as dollars of sustaining capital per copper equivalent production. And you can pee holes in the calculation if you want to, the level of improvement is so significant that it's hard to ignore. So that's 30% on nominal terms and closer to 40% in terms of real terms. So a really good journey. It shouldn't be a surprise because some of our sustaining CapEx and mine development is using the same that gives the same fleet that we're using from an opening point of view. So it's the same sort of influence that's feeding into our capital spend. 
Obviously as I say, as the portfolio increases, we will look to maintain that efficiency. We'll have slightly higher sustaining CapEx in the next year or two. So may see that just bubble around a little bit, but we're very confident on the journey that we're on from that capital spend inefficiency. Ultimately, measure us on return on capital employed rather than trying to break it down and pull bits of capital out. And that, again, has been a great journey as we've moved from 9%, 11% up to 19%. I'm sorry, no pun on those words intended. And that's been a great journey for us, that return on capital employed and again, something that we -- we're pleased with the journey and pride ourselves on. 
So turning to growth CapEx, again that will increase a little over the next year, but -- over the next couple of years, but no surprise as our spent on Quellaveco, in particular, is probably the main driver. As you can see on the slide, we do have a number of incredibly attractive brownfield, relatively small scale, individually, opportunities ahead of us. Again, the main messages here, they'll be assessed and studied with the same sort of discipline that you've seen in the past. They happen over time, and again, relatively small in nature. So they'll come up for approval over time, the capital spend will be over time and obviously, always subject to market conditions and assessment. 
So just coming back to the cost and volume improvement that Mark touched on earlier in terms of some of the detail on the drivers of that. Obviously, a big focus on P101 and the technology development, we remain absolutely committed to that $3 billion to $4 billion target by the end of 2022. So that's the start of '18 to '22. We're $900 million into that, if you take last year's actual and then this year's target. I just want to make sure it's clear that, that $500 million for '19 doesn't include the Minas-Rio turnaround as we've done this year. So I'll be pulling that out separately, we'll show the turnaround of that separately next year as well. So this $500 million would be on top of that, in terms of an EBITDA driver. As we flagged, I think it was at the half year, some of this will be a little bit back ended in that timeframe. Some of the investment we're making in the technology development, the P101, will just take a little bit of time to flow itself into EBITDA and cash flow. But that's okay, it's planned, there's programs in place to deliver -- to deliver those initiatives and Mike touched on some of the things that start to go live through this year and particularly at El Soldado. 
In terms of this year's number, probably one of the bigger influence is some of this productivity increase that we're expected to see out of Moranbah-Grosvenor from the Queensland met coal operations. So just to wrap it up from me, where does it all take us? I think steady, but meaningful production growth over that next 4 to 5 years. And I think is something as we -- Mark mentioned, I love to talk about the word balance at the moment, but it is a balance for us. It's a balance about what we've done with the balance sheet, and we continue to focus on that and make sure we're building from strong foundations. The P101 initiatives would drive margins and cash flow again and enables us to continue to do what we want to do, again, built on sound operating practice. So yes, a lot of you did attend the copper visit back at the end of last year. You can see the benefits of the operating model flow through and a lot of the other sites are going on exactly the same journey. And obviously, built off a strong balance sheet at the end of the day. Thank you."

Let me kick away with a Minas-Rio. So as I mentioned earlier, we have recommissioned Minas-Rio. All the key parameters that we were looking to deliver has been delivered in terms of the startup. We did upgrade the guidance in December on the basis of getting the earlier license for mining and we thought 6 months ahead of schedule, so that allows us to open the pit up so we can blend ores, so the delivery of an improved product to port as an important part of that process. And the unit costs, FAV, is around $21, at the range we expect $28 to $31. At full rate, we'd expect it to be closer to $25 a ton, maybe with inflation, somewhere near $26. Our breakeven cost at full rate still looks like about $35 a ton is what we're targeting for the product. It's a 67% product low deleterious element. And if you've got some really tough questions, Ruben is actually in the audience today, so we can cover off anything you may want to hear about. And on the tailings side, we have an existing tailings dam that's used, and as I described it, basically a water-containing facility. We're actually -- we've got the license to install so we're actually lifting the next level. And the last approval required will be then the license to operate when it's completed. We would expect to have that license midyear, but we are making sure that we could place through the authorities. The federal authorities have already talked to and publicized the new standard. That has no issues for us at all. We would expect that Minas Gerais will come out with some comments on new standards in the next couple of months. Again, we don't expect that to impact us, given the nature of the installation we have. If I could say it this way, if there were to be something that were to impact Minas-Rio, given the nature of the dam, it would literally all mining across the country, if they came anywhere near what we've built. So we don't expect that to be an issue, but at the same time, we'll work with the authorities just to make sure that we've got all the key points covered. So we're still forecasting midyear. As I said, it might -- the conversation might go for another month or two, but beyond that, we think we're in pretty good shape. 
On Quellaveco, again not much additional to report post December, other than good progress continues. The dam, which was built as part of the river diversion, has gone well. Earthworks are going well and when we characterized the project last year, I said that the next 12 to 18 months was critical. Big earthwork projects and lots of concrete. So once we get through that phase, which I think is the real critical part of the program, once we get out of the ground and you start seeing metal being erected, I think we'll have navigated the toughest part of the program and we're very pleased with the progress so far. So at this stage, the 44-month schedule looks very good. Costs tight, but still in good shape, particularly on the schedule -- with the schedule being in good shape as well. So we're pretty happy with where we're. And the $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion estimate for this year, for us, will be mainly back-end loaded at a 100% basis to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Our share would be somewhere between 400 and 600 in the second half given we've got the Mitsubishi funds we'll draw again for the first half of the year. I will continue to keep an exploration slide in the pack because as we speak, John and the guys are starting to show some interesting opportunities emerge. In Brazil, I can confirm or I will confirm that yes, we intersected copper mineralization. Yes, the grades are at or above -- in a number of those intersections, above minable grades that we would think on a larger scale lower grade copper deposit would be mineable. The intersections are in some cases above 100 meters, but I've got to stress that we've got some interesting intersections. That's all we have at the moment. As a consequence of those intersections, we stopped ore drilling after 6 holes. We secured 37,000 square kilometers of tenements. We have overflown the tenements and we've got 3 or 4 prospects that we have identified from the aeromag surveys. So we're following those up and during the course of the next 12 months, we'll work out what we've actually got. If I could say this, at the moment it's interesting, it's not anything that we could call a resource. It's an interesting position that will take a little bit of time to unpack. And I expect this time next year that we'll give you a much better scope and be able to paint a much better picture of what we have or what we may not have, but I think it's important to let you know that the things we've talked about are being confirmed and it's interesting, it's not yet exciting. So somebody described me as being excited, I said no, I'm interested, I'm not yet excited. And so I just want to make sure we've got that conversation in balance. We've also been doing some work across the portfolio and in Mogalakwena. The work at Mogalakwena has been interesting. We're looking at extensions to the ore body. The key points to make is the mineralization appears maybe to be a bit thicker than we thought. The grades may be a little bit better, and the material may be a little shallower. So I think Chris is not yet excited, but he's getting close, so we're encouraged. A lot of work to be done, Chris and the team are doing feasibility work on potential options. We are watching the market very carefully as well. So anything we do will be with an eye to the market and an eye on what's right for our shareholders in the long-term. So we're just measuring our pace and the work we're doing, but the results there are also very encouraging. 
On sustainability, and really sustainability is part of everything we do, its part of any conversation we're in. Starting with safety right the way through to social performance. So it remains a key part of all of our dialogue. If you look at our portfolio, from our point of view we think that the commodities that we have is a consequence of the quality assets. Remember, we're about a quality asset portfolio. So what drives us forward, and where we focus our efforts is having the best mining assets in the world. Yes, we take into account the markets that we're selling into and geographies, but it's about quality assets. As a consequence of that focus on quality assets, the major commodity positions that we're in, diamonds, copper, PGM's, bulks, we think plays into the macro trends around growing middle-class consumer world. The focus on the environment long-term, a greener world, and an electrified world. Now some people thought that I was talking about a whatsit supporter, while we're talking about electrified and exciting. But in terms of the big trends..."

It's all about next year. In terms of the products and in each case we're building the portfolio, Bruce focusing, getting the business up to 37 million carats with the transition at Venetia, in the copper business we talk about Collahuasi, we talk about, obviously, Quellaveco, and the longer-term opportunities of Los Bronces, in particular, the underground potential is significant. PGM, as I said, Mogalakwena. I think a really important piece of work for the platinum team is obviously the turnaround at Amandelbult. I was there with Chris for a couple of days about three months ago and very excited with the work, but still a lot of work to be done, but making good progress. And in the bulks, 2 great positions -- well, 3 great positions in terms of quality and cost competitive position. More work to be done to improve our competitive position, but again, we've got a good portfolio across the globe. People have asked, and so I'll preempt the question on thermal coal, we've actually halved our footprint in thermal coal in the last 3 years. And as we've said, we talked to adjust transition. So our position hasn't changed. And so we're looking at all the moving parts and making sure we're positioning ourselves to have the right type of portfolio that investors want to invest in for the long term. When we look at and if I connect the operating model, the innovation work, the changes we're delivering, we talk to sustainability in the same conversation. And as a consequence of the competitive work we're doing, we're looking at delivering a 30% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030, so that helps us drive down the cost curve. In terms of reduction of water, water plays 2 parts. Yes, it's a cost, but also it's a constraint on the development of our assets, particularly in the long term desert climates. And so it provides us a double whammy in terms of improving the performance of the portfolio, so that's a critical piece of work for us. And greenhouse gas emissions is about the climate change debate and how we play our part in making sure the world achieves its targets. If I go back to the strategy around trusted corporate leader I think the conversation for all of us in the industry today is about tailings. I think we've all got to play a part. And as we've said, whatever we can do to help the industry lift tailings standards then we'll be involved in all of those conversations. And what do we need to do with our colleagues to improve, I think, is a good example of this sort of approach we believe is right in terms of the industry. Thriving communities, the people most affected by our operations, are our partners in those local communities. Now I think over a long period of time we haven't done a good job with local communities, and we certainly changed our approach over the last few years. And we know we've got a lot more work to do. And for those familiar with the courageous conversations that are occurring in South Africa with the archbishop, that's the type of approach in terms of engagement with communities that we think it very novel and different, and certainly creating a new dialogue and healthy environment. So how do we make sure that we're doing all things right in terms of the environment? Are we doing the best we can do with tailings and all those other areas that potentially impact on communities is where our focus is and we've been doing a lot of work and our tailings we've done in 2014 as part of that program. So in terms of the business, what we look at and how we think about the future. 
In terms of margins, driving cash flow. Cash flow for us as a team is we think the effectiveness measure major shareholders are looking for in terms of our ability to return today, tomorrow and through the long-term. So margins is a real focus, getting ourselves to 45% to 50% is a critical focus for us because the cash flow then comes as a consequence. Return on capital employed measures the efficiency, that is, how well did you generate that cash flow. It's easy to generate cash flow in this industry over short periods of time. The real measure is your long-term sustainability and the deliverability or the repeatability of that cash flow, look for your return on capital employed. Did you use the capital well? And will the shareholder support you continuing to use capital come with respect to this number. We believe that we can deliver better than 20% through the cycle with the quality assets and the work we're doing inside the business. And asset life. The one thing I would say that over the next few years this number will move around a little bit because if we increase our production another 25%, it's never quite linear how that number moves, but at 30 years we're right up there in terms of life of asset. And so what I want you to know, what I want you to take away from today is we look at these metrics and we drive all of these metrics in making sure we've got a sustainable business that is cash flow returns and long-term continuity in terms of the business. And in our industry, they're a pretty tough set of metrics to deliver on consistently. And certainly, that's where we're focused. 
Finally, in terms of the investment proposition, we've been talking to this for a couple or 2 or 3 years, now. Paul, I noticed a few others are starting to talk to the same sorts of slides. Maybe I'll just focus on capabilities today. You know about the asset story and how we've tried to position the portfolio and what we're doing in terms of return. And I think Stephen's done a good job explaining our position there. For us, the operating model is about creating a culture inside Anglo American that's about being the best. In the end, I'll say today we're not the best. I can point to many examples where players are doing better than us on an individual basis. But as a team, we're determined to continue to take every step to catch and overtake those that we see as best. In some areas of the business, for example, I think in the longwalls, we are probably right up there. Platinum, I think again, we're right up there in the Bs, again. But there are far more places that we're behind further than we should be. And we're not going to stay there, we're going to keep improving and we're going to keep improving quicker than anyone else. In terms of FutureSmart mining, we can't continue to mine as we've mined for 100 years. You can't just keep building bigger trucks. We've got to think laterally, we've gone out there and think differently and so the changes that we're making to the flow sheet is about the changes that will drive the next 100 years of mining. We want to be on the forefront of that because those that lead those changes will be the outperformancers in the industry. And third, we make sure that every product we produce, whatever commodity it may be, and remembering that diamonds aren't a commodity, we sell dreams in the diamond industry. We have to make sure that every product -- is that right, Bruce? He was getting a bit worried there. Every product we produce we have to get the best price we can and that means understanding your customers, making sure you've got a relationship and making sure that we're creating value for them to ensure that we get the value reflected back in the price that we've paid for our products. 
And so with that, we're more than happy to take questions."

The first, it's a bit churlish maybe to criticize a company for doing what they said they were going to do, but a 40% payout, given the strength of the balance sheet, does look a little bit skinny versus some of your peers. So could we just maybe map out how we should think about excess capital returns; when, what's appropriate, is a 40% payout the appropriate payout ratio for this business? And are there any constraints around preferred mechanism for excess capital returns? Is it special dividends, share buybacks, any constraints around that?
Second question. In terms of thinking about long-term capital planning, the industry's had a very poor track record long-term, very poor track record in stress testing the downside, so with respect to diamonds, could you maybe just give us some thoughts around how you think about the risks posed by synthetics? What's your base case? How do you stress test that into the long-term capital allocation for the diamonds business? And again, maybe some comments around what's going on at Lightbox at the moment? And then final question. Obviously, big moves in iron ore prices, there's a sort of structural premium now embedded into high grade iron ore. How does that affect your long-term planning for Kumba? So essential for long-dated mine life extensions and maybe long-term exploration there."

When we set the 40% payout ratio, we did it with a view over time. And again, I'll come back to that balance, where we knew we were probably likely to approve Quellaveco. We have a view of what's in front of us in terms of capital spend, balance sheet journey, et cetera. And so we factored that into our thinking in terms of that 40% payout ratio. One point I do want to emphasize, we will constantly assess where we are. I mean, that is our job to do and we will absolutely do that in terms of considering additional returns. We have maybe tracked to where we are perhaps 6 months ahead of what we thought given the strength in prices. If you recall when I speak about that window we have to reset the balance sheet to the midyear, I've said, well, we'll probably likely have a 3 in front of it, I'd love to think we'd have a 2 in front of it and we probably got there a little bit quicker than what I thought. But I would just come back to the pro forma sort of concept of data swell that I mentioned. We have got about $500 million of the cash from the sale down to Mitsubishi on the balance sheet. We know that's going to be spent about half year, we know we're going to start our contributions thereafter. So the approach that we really do want to take and we will run a more conservative balance sheet than we have. Clearly, we are sitting very well in terms of all of the balance sheet metrics. We'll actively consider it. But we probably are almost at the low point today as we look forward, but we will actively consider it. We'll consider all forms of returns to shareholders. We'll probably stick to the 40% base dividend. We will stick with that, but if we do consider any excess returns then we'll consider the buybacks, the additional dividends, et cetera, as you would expect."

You'll remember we said that the current synthetic offering doesn't differentiate synthetics from the natural product. And that consumers told us that wasn't right, but that they were confused by the offering. So we see there's a perfectly legitimate place for a laboratory grown diamond offering, but we don't think it's the same as the natural business and that's really why we launched Lightbox. We announced Lightbox in June and we sold our first diamond at the end of September. And we'll only sell 20,000 carats in total by the end of 2019 before our facility in Oregon comes on stream. Since we've started, the Lightbox offering has had a tremendously positive impact on price up from a lab-ground diamond point of view. At the wholesale level, prices have come down over the competitive product between 30% and 60%, which is extraordinary given how little we've sold. So I think there's already evidence that the positioning of the product as to what it should be, which is not a natural diamond, is already starting to be successful. We'll carry on working on that. But I think on the other side of the question in relation to how do we stress test projects going forward. A couple of things. As Mark said, we think supply has probably just about peaked in 2018. And we think that's good provided we can continue to grow demand. So as long as we can keep growing demand for the natural there should be a positive outcome there. And secondly, as Mark, was a pain, I think, to point out in relation to the asset quality. We have overall the highest quality assets and the highest margin assets in the diamond business. So our ability to withstand price fluctuations is, I think, considerably higher than other people. So I think in the round of those 3 points is we feel positive about the projects going forward. Of course we stress test different scenarios on the upside and the downside in relation to all projects, but we are comfortably, we think, within any range of concerns there."

It's a brand, it's a luxury brand, it's a very special case and we want to make sure we keep it there and take it further, so an important part of the business. In terms of structural, the issues with respect to capital in the longer term. I think, and I tried to say it, maybe not as well as I could, we've got Quellaveco as a material step change in the business. One of the things I think, and I talk about this, is one of the damages or the damage that Minas-Rio did to us as a business was not only the project in and of itself but also robbed the rest of the business of the incremental capital you need to continue to improve your business. So I think the damage was twofold. We're not going to make that mistake again. So when I talked about Quellaveco making a 50% contribution to the quality and growth in the business, those other incremental projects in my view as just as important. So you're spreading the risk. So you're actually changing and lowering the risk profile and you're improving the quality of all parts of the portfolio. And I think, taking that balanced approach in terms of capital allocation is critical. And I think, again, reinforcing the point through the syndication exercise in Quellaveco, it's a very different company and a very different company approach in terms of capital as well."

Our job, let's say with Chris and Bruce, is to think 5, 10, so that whilst they're delivering the execution on the things we see in front of us, we're thinking about -- together, thinking about the next step and the next step so that the improvement continues. And I think getting the jobs right and getting ourselves thinking about the right time frames, and sequencing the business is as critical, if not more critical, than delivering today's improvements. So I think what we're trying to present today is we've done the basics you would have expected us to do. We've thought about the next level of improvement at the operating level with P101. We've thought about the next level of improvement with the innovation strategies and targets to change our position against our competitors. And we're building a portfolio through our capital allocation on even better projects again. So today, it's a 4-tier strategy that's timed over the next 10 to 20 years that we think we'll position this company for the long-term. So I hope that sort of scratches at the  core of your question. It's never smooth, there'll be a couple of bumps. As I said, this year will be a little bit, not flat, but as a launching pad for 2021, because the innovation stuff that we're putting in place this year will start to deliver in '21, '22, '23. So its never smooth, but making sure you're sequencing the improvements to drive continuous improvement and outrun your competitors is the key."

We don't think the Minas-Rio dam, given its construction, would likely have any material changes given the engineering aspects of the business. We think they will be more focused on other dams and other construction. And certainly, that's what we've seen at the federal level. So we're pretty confident we're in the right place. Now at the same time, we're in conversation with government. We've got at least 6 to 8 months, we think, breathing space in terms of anything we do. And the conversations have been positive and we've got 95% local community support. And when we delivered the license and the operating license for the mining business, that came 6 months early. And the fact that we had 90% to 95% support from the community was a pretty important factor, I think, in making sure we got the support to go forward. So I think we've got good support from the local communities. They've been fantastic with us, even when the spill. In fact, our popularity with the community went up after we had the first spill and what they said is your reaction to the spill was as good as we could've expected.

So as I mentioned earlier, we're probably at the low point in that balance sheet journey, and it probably got there a little bit quicker than what we might have thought. If prices stay up where they are, then clearly we'll be generating very healthy cash flows and that would feed into our active consideration of additional return. So again, not telling you anything that you wouldn't think is right. If prices continue where they are today, they're probably above our base assumptions. And so yes, that would probably generate additional cash flow. Obviously, feeding off the margins and the work we're doing, that feeds into cash flow, it feeds into less volatility, less sensitivity to movements in process and it does give you confidence then about how you run your balance sheet. So yes, that feeds into that thinking as well. And as Mark spoke about the portfolio, from an asset point of view, we also have been able to think more strategically about our capital structure. And again, lift the vision, you'll see there's a slide in there on the debt portfolio, the work we've done there over the last few years also helps de-risk any volatility and movement in prices as well. Because we have very little maturing now in the next 1, 2 and 3 years. So all of those things feed into our thinking absolutely. As I say, pleased with where we are.

So you'll recall that we've been talking about a deficit in the palladium market for many years now. I mean clearly, everyone that has been supplied palladium from aboveground stock. Everyone said, well, we'll believe it when actually the aboveground stock runs out. At the end of 2016, for the first time, we really started seeing the structural deficit and the fact that there wasn't material around. So recalling 2016, we had that shutdown in our precious metal refinery. We needed to go back into the market to buy metal and then we started finding that actually it was very difficult to buy palladium. Towards the end of 2016, we started seeing the price move for the first time. 2017 and 2018, over the last 3 years we've seen 1.5 million ounces of palladium ETFs being redeemed. And this is what's been supplying the market. And over the last two years, you haven't been able to get that. So we went down 600,000 ounces in palladium, last year, the Johnson Matthey numbers looked like they were in deficit. It required the Russians to sell 300,000 ounces from their stock and 600,000 ounces from ETFs just to get to that balance number. So the point is actually the structural deficit in palladium with very low aboveground stocks is what's driving the price. So is there about to be crash? We don't think so. There's also, remember, in a years' time, you're starting to see China 6, which is the loadings about a gram per vehicle extra. At 700,000 to 1 million ounces extra of palladium that's going to be needed. So if you look at where that can come from, it can only come from platinum switching. So we don't think that there's any likelihood anytime soon that you see a palladium crash. I think that it is much more likely that palladium really runs hard and it drags rhodium with it. Rhodium is sold less than twice the palladium price. Rhodium is cheap at these prices. There's been some speculation in rhodium we think, but actually generally it's still underlying basis for rhodium demand. We know the Chinese have been buying additional rhodium as they've been putting extra rhodium onto their catalysts. So I don't hold your breath for, so Mark, 10 years maybe, maybe a bit longer. Rhodium, palladium still look good. And there has to be some substitution from platinum back into palladium. We don't think that happens anytime soon. We still think that's 2 years out. And the reason for that is because the car makers at the moment are trying to deal with the real world driving issues. And that's why they're not substituting yet. So I think you can expect to see basket price for PGMs remaining good. Stephen?"

And the basket price is really important to understand because producers of different products, catalysts, can move across that continuum at any particular time. But then the -- what is required to then switch between the two is quite an administrative exercise. And I was talking to people in the last few months about what does that entail. And so it's not a continuous movement, it's a bit lumpy. But the basket price gives you a sense of what funds are being allocated into PGMs in terms of industrial applications, and I think that's the more important number to focus on because those uses are actually, they're quite substitutable, but the administration process to make the change is quite significant. So over the long term, we look at them as a continuum. In the short term, where they go, it provides us with a bit flexible in terms of our short term capital allocation, but we take the long view on the big projects. And that's why we think very hard about a Mogalakwena in the longer-term context as well. We don't know what it will do in the short term, none of us know how quickly substitution may occur. But we think the underlying fundamentals are very strong, particularly with the potential for the hydrogen economy, the greener economy, I think we're very well-positioned in a business with great assets and what we think is a long-term high potential business."

Mark can speak more knowledgeably than I, but that's my best comment about just where that's heading at the moment. In terms of spot free cash flow, obviously that depends on your price assumptions. What Paul had set out in the pack is a pretty good really reckoning that table in terms of EBITDA, sort of reconciliation and calculation. So hopefully, you can model Anglo in about 5 lines as you go forward just to make your life a little bit simpler in today's world.

We think that peak is about now, if maybe in a few months' time, but it's years out. Clearly, where there have been difficulties in this period is in the midstream. So the midstream has battled, as we've said before, to access enough finance on a sustainable basis to become more efficient and I think there's more work to be done there. But I don't think there's evidence that there hasn't been demand for diamond jewelry over the last 4 years in the main market and so we're hopeful that -- and we believe very strongly actually that as long as we can continue to drive demand, which is a big thing, but we're very good at that, that the tailing off or the leveling of supply for the next few years should be helpful for us."

So Phil",391,"So good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and very warm welcome to Anglo American's 2018 results. I'm Stuart Chambers, the Chairman, and it's my pleasure to do so. Just wanted to talk about 2 things before I hand over to Mark. Firstly, board changes. So Philip Hampton retired in December of last year. So he stepped down after 9 years of fantastic service. He was our senior independent director. And that role has been passed on to Byron Grote. And secondly, Jack Thompson, he attended his last board earlier this week and will be stepping down before the AGM and therefore, won't be seeking reelection, also after nine years of fantastic service. Jack is one of our two nonexecutive directors with extensive mining experience, operationally non-technical side. That's something we're very keen to replace. We're towards the end of our process to do so and we are expecting to announce something before the AGM in terms of the replacement. Those are the board changes. 
The only other subject that I want to touch on not -- and understandably, is safety. Very encouraging and very reassuring. You'll hear from Mark how we've improved our safety performance again last year to a new record level, 16% better on recordables than a year before, which was itself a record. Very encouraging, however, as many of you, if not all of you know, 5 people lost their lives in our operations last year. And it has to stop, obviously. So we launched our Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce last year. The design of that, of course, is to penetrate the whole of the organization, every nook and cranny and under -- discover essentially what underpins these fatal incidents, the fundamental underlying issues. We've done that, we've got the program, the program is underway and we're in the middle of executing that, and its key. And I think if you add to that the tragedy last month, where one of our industries -- one of the industries' tailings dam failed, which you all know very much about, that just serves to underpin yet again for all of us, safety has to be our #1 priority. And the only goal that makes any sense in this is zero harm. So it's a constant vigil. 
I think with that, let me hand over to Mark to kick off our presentation."

Ladies and gentlemen, we're pleased to be here today and thank you for joining us. Like Stuart, I think it's important to acknowledge the recent Brazilian tragedy. The one thing I would like to say is all of us in the industry",3176,"Thanks, very much Stuart. Ladies and gentlemen, we're pleased to be here today and thank you for joining us. Like Stuart, I think it's important to acknowledge the recent Brazilian tragedy. 
The one thing I would like to say is all of us in the industry are connecting and talking about how we can all play a part in finding solutions for the industry. I'll talk about that a little bit further, but again, I thought it was appropriate just to acknowledge our colleagues and their losses. And on a broader basis, the need or reemphasize the need to continue to take steps to make sure that we can create a zero harm workplace and that includes zero harm to both employees and local communities, and I think that's our most pressing and important priority as an industry. 
In terms of our results for the year, the key theme that we'll be talking to is unlocking our full potential. Consistent with our theme, you'll see that we have a photo of a copper mine with some interesting diagrams on it. That was Tony O'Neill's attempt to show that we've become a modern miner. And it is actually a photo of El Soldado, and the reason that's important is El Soldado will be the first site where we're commissioning our new bulk ore sorters and by the end of the year, we'll be commissioning our coarse particle flotation units as well. So for us, whilst that photo may not look that interesting, for a mining engineer knowing the background to it, it's an extremely attractive photo. 
So in terms of results, I think the important point to make is we're continuing to deliver on what we said we'd do. While 2018 wasn't without its challenges, obviously, the administering of pipeline being a key issue, we've been able and we've seen step-ups from a number of key areas in the business to try and cover that event across the business and the numbers are respectable, I think, in the context of what we had to do with -- during the course of the year. The volumes were up, most notably from copper. Duncan and the team really did do a great job. And the feedback that we had from the analyst visit in the last quarter of the year I think reflected on how much progress I think both the copper team have done and how I think we've done as a broader organization. EBITDA margins continued to improve to 42%, up from 40% last year. That reflects both ongoing focus on productivity improvements, I'll talk to that a little bit later, and cost controls across the business and the marketing contribution. Peter and the guys have done a good job in continuing to improve our realized prices against the value and use metric that we use, and again, making a good contribution. 
Free cash flow was strong. Return on capital employed was a healthy 19%, so I think that we're continuing to build a solid foundation for future performance. And I've just pressed the wrong button, we were almost at panic stations. 
So in pulling apart the performance, we always talk to safety, health and environment. As Stuart reflected in terms of safety, 5 fatal incidents. For us, it doesn't matter how good the results are, no year is a good year if you have a fatal incident or if you have lost a colleague. And so for us, we do take the time to reflect, try and understand and the Elimination of Fatalities Task (sic) [Taskforce] teamwork is -- along with our tailings work, they are the 2 most pressing projects or important projects for us to continue to work on. And for us and everyone in the organization, we're committed to delivering a zero harm workplace. And yes, we've made good progress, again, our best performance in  100 years, 16% lower injury frequency rate, but at the same time, again, nothing to celebrate when you lose a colleague. 
In terms of the health front, again for us, it's an important issue for our industry, making sure that we're creating workplaces that do no harm. We've got some work to do on musculoskeletal injuries, that is people doing work where there's a degenerative condition, so we've got to do some redesign in those workplaces and that's an important project for us. 
And then finally, on the environmental side, again, the Brazilian incident cast a shadow over the industry. In our case, we had 2 pipeline leaks in Minas-Rio that we reported in the first quarter and I've already talked about those at the half year. I guess the positive side there is we commissioned or recommissioned Minas-Rio in December as we forecast at the time. In the first 2 months, the operation has gone very well. We're up to capacity and so the forecast that we talked about for the full-year production appear to be on track. 
Again, I'll talk a little bit more about the Minas-Rio tailings dam because we've had a few inbound questions. But if I could make a simple observation, in engineering terms, we have what we call an upstream lift where the dam walls are built tailings-on-tailings. You then have a downstream lift where you've got a more purpose-built containment structure. Then you've got a water-containing facility, which is another level of engineering above downstream construction. Minas-Rio is a water-containing engineered facility. So we think whilst there will be debates about tailings dams in Brazil, the Minas-Rio construction is 2 levels above in terms of its engineering approach and again, happy to answer more questions, but I think we're in the right place in terms of those conversations and in terms of what we've built at the site. 
To be more specific about our current processes, and again, I want to reemphasize there's been a lot of discussion around what will we do and how will we engage in the conversations around tailings dams for the industry. We will participate and collaborate with all of our colleagues because this is an industry issue. When I talk about Anglo American, if I can describe it in the most succinct way possible, we have our staff on site that monitor and are responsible for the placement of tailings and management of water on a daily basis. We have at each site, an engineer or a competent person that has a background in either geomechanics, geosoil mechanics or geotechnical background, that is classed our competent person that is responsible for the engineering of and the correct management of the tailings facility on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. We have an engineer of record that was with us at the start that helped us design the facility, design the process to manage the facility, and we have them involved in monitoring our practices and processes during the course of deposition and at least on a quarterly basis, giving us feedback in terms of what they're seeing, what we're doing and how we're operating. Now because they're part -- they've become part and parcel of the design and the process, we don't count them as independent in terms of managing the facility. So we have a central role, reporting to, now, Tony O'Neill, outside the line that does regular checks on all of our facilities and with his team, making sure that everything we should be doing is in place. And then on top of that, we have in each commodity grouping, a tailings risk committee that looks at all the tailings facilities and ensures that the correct processes are being applied. And then on top of that, we have an independent review that's done on an annual basis by another consultant outside the group. So from our point of view -- those standards were developed in 2014, the development of the ICMM standards came in 2016, and they drew from our standard as part of their design. So what we are trying to work at now is how we can work with the industry on a collaborative basis and where there may be organizations may not be able to have that level of internal discipline and process had we, as an industry, create some sort of process or resource that can help us make sure that all tailings in the industry are safe. It's not simply a single company issue, it's an industry problem and from our point-of-view, how do we play our part in finding an industry solution and I think that's very important. And that's the important message that we wanted to leave you with today. 
In terms of the operations, we continue to make progress in terms of performance. Over the course of the last 12 months, our productivity has continued to improve. So going back to our 2012 benchmark, we've almost doubled productivity across the group as you can see with the 98% number. Overall production is 10% above where we were in 2012, with around 50% less assets. Each asset that we retain and we've been working with, is now on average doing 30% more -- or is delivering 30% more production than it was 5 years ago, and in the mine that's been done through operating improvements, process improvements, incremental dig model making and generally running the asset better than we were 5 years ago. As a consequence, our real costs are down 43% or as you can see there, 26% in nominal terms. And that's been a key driver in terms of our business improvement and margin growth over the last 5 years, where we've gone from around a 30% industrial margin, EBITDA margin, to 42% and that's despite a 10% drop in our basket price receipt. And so from our point of view, we believe the progress has been solid, but there's still a lot more we can achieve because we're not universally or across-the-board best-in-class. We're certainly competitive today compared to where we were, but we're not yet best-in-class and so there's a lot more opportunity. 
If you take the numbers, and we've used an independent report at the half year and we've tried to look through public numbers to see where we rate against our competitors. Now I might just explain this chart again because I've had a few question where -- I'm not sure everybody understands where we come from on these numbers. I'm going to walk across the chart. If you look at Anglo American back in 2012, our average cost position, and we take quality into account, so we call it leading margin curve improvement. It's actually a breakeven cost curve, so we're taking the quality of our product into account and coming back with a breakeven price and we do that for our competitors' products as well. It's mainly in met coal and iron ore that you make that adjustment. The other numbers are pretty easy to take into the chart. We're at about the midpoint on the cost curve, the 49th percentile. In the last 5 years, we've improved our relative position across all of our commodities and it's actually revenue weighted, so we're trying to give you a weighted position, we're at this 37th percentile, so we're mid-Q2 on average. So that suggests that we've improved our costs quicker than many of our competitors. And I think that's the important point. Everybody is getting better. What we've got to do is get better quicker. And yes, we had probably had in some cases a lower base to work from, but doing that across the board and doing it in a consistent way is the big challenge. And so far, we've made good progress. Now against our peers, 27% to 38%, 36% to 45%, peer 3 doing better, some new assets making a real difference. So we've been competitive in -- or against our major diversified competitors. At the end of the day, there's always a little bit of noise in the numbers. From our perspective, we believe we can continue to improve our position, and that's going to be an important part of the focus in terms of our presentation today. But -- so we've made good progress, but there's a lot more we think we can do to continue to improve that position because I've got no doubt everybody's in the same conversation about how do we get better. 
So in stepping back and looking at the journey we've been on in the last 3 years, there are 3 key points we wanted to make: firstly, in terms of operating leverage, that is, how good are you on the cost curve, we've moved to the bottom of the range. So from a competitive position, we think we're well placed. Doesn't mean you stop, there's a lot more work to be done. In terms of financial leverage, and Stephen will unpack the numbers, we've still got a little more work to do to make sure we've got our balance sheet where we want it, we're certainly in the right area and looking very strong in terms of our balance sheet and what we can do from here in terms of driving the business and doing the things that we need to do to make sure we're delivering value for shareholders; third, is inside the portfolio and we talk about Quellaveco being a key driver of profitable growth for business over the next 5 years, it represents about 50% of that incremental growth. The thing -- and Stephen will use the word balance in his conversation and more than simply about the balance sheet, he'll use the word balance in that we've got Quellaveco as a large-scale project that we're executing on. We've also got a number of small scale, quick return projects, Moranbah, we're having a debottlenecking, shipping -- a new ship in Namibia. Chris has got a range of opportunities he can see, particularly around the [ Aquila ]. He's doing that work now. Bruce is working on things inside his business as he does the transition through Venetia. We've got a number of small scale rapid-payback projects that gives us a nice portfolio of business improvement opportunities. And again, Stephen will unpack that. But for us, it's starting to give us a real balance, in the portfolio in terms of what we doing today, what we can improve, and where we can continue to enhance the portfolio. 
To sort of put a bit more shape behind that, if I talk to what we've been doing in the last 5 years, we talk about the operating model. In some ways, it ends up being a grab bag of a whole range of conversations, but it is about doing things differently and making sure that the conversation I'm having here is no different to the conversation that front-line supervisors are having with the people that really do deliver the results, but it has to be in the context that's meaningful to them. So how do we translate that through the organization and make sure the planned work, the objectives we've set, get delivered and that's really the guts of what we're doing and how we're improving the business. We're also now starting to transition into a different type of improvement over the next five years that we think doesn't deliver a lower result, it delivers continuing improvement, but in a different shape. And it then starts to focus on P101. So when I talked about our operating practices, let's say we were in the bottom half of the performance in terms of equipment. So I'll give you an example, shovel. A 4100 shovel, the best in the class with 45 million ton a year, the Anglo American average from its fleet of 4100 shovels was around 22 million, 23 million ton a year, our best was around 30 million. 12 months ago, we set the challenge.  P101, how do we have each part of -- or each major piece of mining equipment or processing plant delivering top quartile performance. So we said okay, the benchmark for the shovel, 45 million ton a year. Every one of our operators who was running a 4100 shovel said we will achieve that number within 3 years. In 12 months, Dawson was hitting 50 million tons a year, right, of around a 28 million ton starting position. So I'm looking at how we set the places up, how we run those assets and that type of improvement is being replicated across the portfolio. It looks different in different places, different baselines, different skill sets, but that's the approach. And we're doing that with all of our critical plant and equipment. P101, 100 being best-in-class, the objective is let's -- how do we go beyond best-in-class, so that's where the P101 came from, as Stephen said, a typical engineer's title for a project that should be a lot sexier than P101 indicates. 
And on FutureSmart mining, it's around new innovation. How do we reconfigure traditional processes to drive step changes in our performance? And when I talk sustainability, I'll show you what we think that transformation of our process looks like in the longer term. 
So P101 in the business, we think copper processing, the Venetia acceleration, so Bruce is in the room. PGM shovels and productivity, this longwall performance are all areas of the business where we see potential for significant changes. And Moranbah is a good example where we've -- where we've doubled productivity over the last three years, and the question is how do you go another 30% over the next 3 years. And then, in terms of the FutureSmart mining, bulk sorting as I said, El Soldado is the first unit. We've got a unit going into Barro Alto and into Mogalakwena, coarse particle flotation will have its first this year under the install this year. Data analytics underline the way we think about the business and the way we pull apart the data and think how we can improve the business. 
So for us, the journey from 30% to 42% margin was all about fundamental business improvement, the things that we could see on the ground that we could get at, things that we could change, reconfiguring the pit, turning session around 90 degrees, all of those types of changes have helped us get to 42%, including the marketing work and the change in the marketing model. To get from 42% to 45% to peer 50%, P101, the innovation work and the projects that we're developing across the business -- both Quellaveco and the incremental improvements are all designed to put us in this sort of territory. So from where we are today, the 20% to 25% growth in the operations and at the same time, improving the quality of the business, expressed through our EBITDA margin is where we're taking the business, and that's on an apples-for-apples basis. So that's where we're all about, that's what we're trying to achieve and with that, I'll pass across to Stephen."
409115,603087483,1667248,"Anglo American plc, 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now Mark got to speak about his picture on his slides, so I figure it's only fair that I speak about my picture on mine. I just wanted to squash any rumors that that's what I ate for breakfast. It's a bowl of palladium grain and as Chris wou",2089,"Thanks, Mark. Now Mark got to speak about his picture on his slides, so I figure it's only fair that I speak about my picture on mine. I just wanted to squash any rumors that that's what I ate for breakfast. It's a bowl of palladium grain and as Chris would tell me, I probably couldn't afford it these days with the price of palladium anyway. 
So let's turn to the numbers. As Mark said, a really strong set of results and very consistent with what we're presented sort of period on period. And that's something they we really are striving to achieve with the business. It's that sort of run rate, the rhythm, building on strong fundamentals and whether that's the operating model or a strong balance sheet, it's that consistent base that gives us that ability to sort of grow and continue the journey in the business. So EBITDA obviously increased year-on-year, despite the suspension at Minas-Rio. That flowed into EPS of $2.55 per share and obviously, the 40% payout ratio into the dividend and returning to shareholders. $3.2 billion of free cash flow and CapEx at $2.8 billion was in line with our guidance. 
Turning to EBITDA and just the drivers of that, obviously, a 4% increase from $8.8 billion to $9.2 billion across the year, again, despite the headwind at Minas-Rio. You can see there the benefit of prices or currency offset by inflation at Minas-Rio, almost offset one another. 
Now turning to the cost and volume. We'd set ourselves a target of $800 billion for the year, and we achieved $400 billion of that. So a little bit disappointed with our progress there. We did, in fact, achieve improvements of $800 million, but they were offset by headwinds. In particular, we had above CPI increase in oil prices through that March to September timeframe. A few other little costs, particular in South Africa slightly above CPI, and we had a little bit of inventory build, which should itself release itself through the first half of '19. So not making any excuses, it is our job to deliver that target and we do intend to do so. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Again, the same sort of messages that we have delivered over the last couple of years. We have spoken about this window that we have, this opportunity to fundamentally reset the balance sheet up until the middle of 2019. And that's the point when we start contributing our cash flow to the Quellaveco CapEx in particular. So very pleased with our journey to date, net debt down to $2.8 billion. And as we've said, we're pleased with the transformation of the balance sheet, that's some $10 billion that we've reduced net debt by over the last 4 years. Clearly, across all of the metrics, we're in a very strong position as I say, and really pleased with the progress there. Just a couple of small little footnotes. So obviously, at the end of December, we're still sitting on about $500 million of the cash we received from Mitsubishi. So sort of proforma debt you could say is closer to that 3.4.And during 2019, with the change in accounting standard, you'll see some of the operating leases come onto the balance sheet and that's also about $400 million to $500 million. So again, we'll take you on that journey with us as we work through the year. In terms of returns to shareholders. Obviously, the 40% payout ratio, again, we've done exactly what we said we would do. 40% payout on underlying earnings resulted in a $0.51 dividend for the second half. And that takes dividends for the full year to $1 per share. 
Again, that's just over $2.6 billion that'll take us to in terms of returns to shareholders since we reinstated the dividend about 18 months ago. Obviously, as well as the debt reduction of in excess of $10 billion over the years, we have invested back in the business in addition to the returns to shareholders and over that same sort of timeframe since '15, we've invested some $10 billion-plus back into the business. And again, that's important in terms of building and sustaining the future as we go forward. So how have we done? This is a slide I like because we all talk a good game in terms of capital allocation, but how are we going in terms of the scorecard. So in terms of the scorecard for us for the year, attributable free cash flow prior to discretionary capital of $3.8 billion. So again, quite pleased with our outcome. How did we use that? We reduced debt by $1.7 billion, paid cash dividends in the year of $1.3 billion and then obviously, $0.5 billion in terms of that discretionary allocation. That does include things like exploration, evaluation, CapEx, across a number of small projects, et cetera. You will see that increase as we go forward, particularly in terms of Quellaveco, and we'll feed into that growth number as we go forward. 
I'm going to touch on CapEx now and you'll see in the presentation, we've given you some additional guidance in the outer years and I just want to talk that through a little bit so that we're understanding that the value, in particular, that, that drives. So in terms of sustaining business -- sustaining CapEx, we flagged in December that we would see that tick up a little bit in the next couple of years in particular. And part of our priorities as a management team is to not only preserve but also enhance the value of the portfolio of operations that we have. And that's exactly what we intend to do. Those opportunities present themselves in a number of ways and that can be cost opportunities, efficiency, productivity and it could be some brownfield expansion, sort of programs from some life extensions. But as we realize that higher production rate and generate value, that comes with an increase in the absolute number of sustaining staying capital as we grow the base, we grow the portfolio and we grow production. A good example of that is the one that Mark mentioned earlier in terms of the longwalls at Moranbah-Grosvenor, obviously, with the production and productivity improvements that we've had there, that means you work through your mine development areas quicker, you're into the next longwall move quicker and therefore, in just a snapshot of time, obviously, your absolute number looks a little bit higher but it's for the right reasons, it's generating increased production, generating increased value, generating increased cash flow. And that's really what we're all about. So as a result of that, and obviously given that we've got things like Quellaveco coming on in 2022, the Moranbah-Grosvenor, and production that I've spoken about, Minas-Rio coming back to full production, we upped our guidance in terms of that sustaining capital, that 2.8 that 3.1, in terms of a longer-term number that you should then guide to. Again, for all the right reasons in terms of generating value. 
In particular, and I'll touch on this in a slide or two, the sort of projects and the sort of productivity improvements that we're working on generate really good margins, very attractive margins, very attractive returns. And that adds to that margin journey that Mark spoke about moving from 42 towards 50. And obviously, in terms of the cash flow that it generates. So the big test for us, and this is something that I wanted to just spend a little bit time on this morning is, have we spent the money well because I know that was sort of the question that came from the December update talk that we did. I'm pleased to say yes, we have. So we're seeing exactly the same efficiencies that we've seen on the operating side of the business in the capital spend, measured as dollars of sustaining capital per copper equivalent production. And you can pee holes in the calculation if you want to, the level of improvement is so significant that it's hard to ignore. So that's 30% on nominal terms and closer to 40% in terms of real terms. So a really good journey. It shouldn't be a surprise because some of our sustaining CapEx and mine development is using the same that gives the same fleet that we're using from an opening point of view. So it's the same sort of influence that's feeding into our capital spend. 
Obviously as I say, as the portfolio increases, we will look to maintain that efficiency. We'll have slightly higher sustaining CapEx in the next year or two. So may see that just bubble around a little bit, but we're very confident on the journey that we're on from that capital spend inefficiency. Ultimately, measure us on return on capital employed rather than trying to break it down and pull bits of capital out. And that, again, has been a great journey as we've moved from 9%, 11% up to 19%. I'm sorry, no pun on those words intended. And that's been a great journey for us, that return on capital employed and again, something that we -- we're pleased with the journey and pride ourselves on. 
So turning to growth CapEx, again that will increase a little over the next year, but -- over the next couple of years, but no surprise as our spent on Quellaveco, in particular, is probably the main driver. As you can see on the slide, we do have a number of incredibly attractive brownfield, relatively small scale, individually, opportunities ahead of us. Again, the main messages here, they'll be assessed and studied with the same sort of discipline that you've seen in the past. They happen over time, and again, relatively small in nature. So they'll come up for approval over time, the capital spend will be over time and obviously, always subject to market conditions and assessment. 
So just coming back to the cost and volume improvement that Mark touched on earlier in terms of some of the detail on the drivers of that. Obviously, a big focus on P101 and the technology development, we remain absolutely committed to that $3 billion to $4 billion target by the end of 2022. So that's the start of '18 to '22. We're $900 million into that, if you take last year's actual and then this year's target. I just want to make sure it's clear that, that $500 million for '19 doesn't include the Minas-Rio turnaround as we've done this year. So I'll be pulling that out separately, we'll show the turnaround of that separately next year as well. So this $500 million would be on top of that, in terms of an EBITDA driver. As we flagged, I think it was at the half year, some of this will be a little bit back ended in that timeframe. Some of the investment we're making in the technology development, the P101, will just take a little bit of time to flow itself into EBITDA and cash flow. But that's okay, it's planned, there's programs in place to deliver -- to deliver those initiatives and Mike touched on some of the things that start to go live through this year and particularly at El Soldado. 
In terms of this year's number, probably one of the bigger influence is some of this productivity increase that we're expected to see out of Moranbah-Grosvenor from the Queensland met coal operations. So just to wrap it up from me, where does it all take us? I think steady, but meaningful production growth over that next 4 to 5 years. And I think is something as we -- Mark mentioned, I love to talk about the word balance at the moment, but it is a balance for us. It's a balance about what we've done with the balance sheet, and we continue to focus on that and make sure we're building from strong foundations. The P101 initiatives would drive margins and cash flow again and enables us to continue to do what we want to do, again, built on sound operating practice. So yes, a lot of you did attend the copper visit back at the end of last year. You can see the benefits of the operating model flow through and a lot of the other sites are going on exactly the same journey. And obviously, built off a strong balance sheet at the end of the day. Thank you."

Let me kick away with a Minas-Rio. So as I mentioned earlier, we have recommissioned Minas-Rio. All the key parameters that we were looking to deliver has been delivered in terms of the startup. We did upgrade the guidance in December on the basis of getting the earlier license for mining and we thought 6 months ahead of schedule, so that allows us to open the pit up so we can blend ores, so the delivery of an improved product to port as an important part of that process. And the unit costs, FAV, is around $21, at the range we expect $28 to $31. At full rate, we'd expect it to be closer to $25 a ton, maybe with inflation, somewhere near $26. Our breakeven cost at full rate still looks like about $35 a ton is what we're targeting for the product. It's a 67% product low deleterious element. And if you've got some really tough questions, Ruben is actually in the audience today, so we can cover off anything you may want to hear about. And on the tailings side, we have an existing tailings dam that's used, and as I described it, basically a water-containing facility. We're actually -- we've got the license to install so we're actually lifting the next level. And the last approval required will be then the license to operate when it's completed. We would expect to have that license midyear, but we are making sure that we could place through the authorities. The federal authorities have already talked to and publicized the new standard. That has no issues for us at all. We would expect that Minas Gerais will come out with some comments on new standards in the next couple of months. Again, we don't expect that to impact us, given the nature of the installation we have. If I could say it this way, if there were to be something that were to impact Minas-Rio, given the nature of the dam, it would literally all mining across the country, if they came anywhere near what we've built. So we don't expect that to be an issue, but at the same time, we'll work with the authorities just to make sure that we've got all the key points covered. So we're still forecasting midyear. As I said, it might -- the conversation might go for another month or two, but beyond that, we think we're in pretty good shape. 
On Quellaveco, again not much additional to report post December, other than good progress continues. The dam, which was built as part of the river diversion, has gone well. Earthworks are going well and when we characterized the project last year, I said that the next 12 to 18 months was critical. Big earthwork projects and lots of concrete. So once we get through that phase, which I think is the real critical part of the program, once we get out of the ground and you start seeing metal being erected, I think we'll have navigated the toughest part of the program and we're very pleased with the progress so far. So at this stage, the 44-month schedule looks very good. Costs tight, but still in good shape, particularly on the schedule -- with the schedule being in good shape as well. So we're pretty happy with where we're. And the $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion estimate for this year, for us, will be mainly back-end loaded at a 100% basis to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Our share would be somewhere between 400 and 600 in the second half given we've got the Mitsubishi funds we'll draw again for the first half of the year. I will continue to keep an exploration slide in the pack because as we speak, John and the guys are starting to show some interesting opportunities emerge. In Brazil, I can confirm or I will confirm that yes, we intersected copper mineralization. Yes, the grades are at or above -- in a number of those intersections, above minable grades that we would think on a larger scale lower grade copper deposit would be mineable. The intersections are in some cases above 100 meters, but I've got to stress that we've got some interesting intersections. That's all we have at the moment. As a consequence of those intersections, we stopped ore drilling after 6 holes. We secured 37,000 square kilometers of tenements. We have overflown the tenements and we've got 3 or 4 prospects that we have identified from the aeromag surveys. So we're following those up and during the course of the next 12 months, we'll work out what we've actually got. If I could say this, at the moment it's interesting, it's not anything that we could call a resource. It's an interesting position that will take a little bit of time to unpack. And I expect this time next year that we'll give you a much better scope and be able to paint a much better picture of what we have or what we may not have, but I think it's important to let you know that the things we've talked about are being confirmed and it's interesting, it's not yet exciting. So somebody described me as being excited, I said no, I'm interested, I'm not yet excited. And so I just want to make sure we've got that conversation in balance. We've also been doing some work across the portfolio and in Mogalakwena. The work at Mogalakwena has been interesting. We're looking at extensions to the ore body. The key points to make is the mineralization appears maybe to be a bit thicker than we thought. The grades may be a little bit better, and the material may be a little shallower. So I think Chris is not yet excited, but he's getting close, so we're encouraged. A lot of work to be done, Chris and the team are doing feasibility work on potential options. We are watching the market very carefully as well. So anything we do will be with an eye to the market and an eye on what's right for our shareholders in the long-term. So we're just measuring our pace and the work we're doing, but the results there are also very encouraging. 
On sustainability, and really sustainability is part of everything we do, its part of any conversation we're in. Starting with safety right the way through to social performance. So it remains a key part of all of our dialogue. If you look at our portfolio, from our point of view we think that the commodities that we have is a consequence of the quality assets. Remember, we're about a quality asset portfolio. So what drives us forward, and where we focus our efforts is having the best mining assets in the world. Yes, we take into account the markets that we're selling into and geographies, but it's about quality assets. As a consequence of that focus on quality assets, the major commodity positions that we're in, diamonds, copper, PGM's, bulks, we think plays into the macro trends around growing middle-class consumer world. The focus on the environment long-term, a greener world, and an electrified world. Now some people thought that I was talking about a whatsit supporter, while we're talking about electrified and exciting. But in terms of the big trends..."

It's all about next year. In terms of the products and in each case we're building the portfolio, Bruce focusing, getting the business up to 37 million carats with the transition at Venetia, in the copper business we talk about Collahuasi, we talk about, obviously, Quellaveco, and the longer-term opportunities of Los Bronces, in particular, the underground potential is significant. PGM, as I said, Mogalakwena. I think a really important piece of work for the platinum team is obviously the turnaround at Amandelbult. I was there with Chris for a couple of days about three months ago and very excited with the work, but still a lot of work to be done, but making good progress. And in the bulks, 2 great positions -- well, 3 great positions in terms of quality and cost competitive position. More work to be done to improve our competitive position, but again, we've got a good portfolio across the globe. People have asked, and so I'll preempt the question on thermal coal, we've actually halved our footprint in thermal coal in the last 3 years. And as we've said, we talked to adjust transition. So our position hasn't changed. And so we're looking at all the moving parts and making sure we're positioning ourselves to have the right type of portfolio that investors want to invest in for the long term. When we look at and if I connect the operating model, the innovation work, the changes we're delivering, we talk to sustainability in the same conversation. And as a consequence of the competitive work we're doing, we're looking at delivering a 30% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030, so that helps us drive down the cost curve. In terms of reduction of water, water plays 2 parts. Yes, it's a cost, but also it's a constraint on the development of our assets, particularly in the long term desert climates. And so it provides us a double whammy in terms of improving the performance of the portfolio, so that's a critical piece of work for us. And greenhouse gas emissions is about the climate change debate and how we play our part in making sure the world achieves its targets. If I go back to the strategy around trusted corporate leader I think the conversation for all of us in the industry today is about tailings. I think we've all got to play a part. And as we've said, whatever we can do to help the industry lift tailings standards then we'll be involved in all of those conversations. And what do we need to do with our colleagues to improve, I think, is a good example of this sort of approach we believe is right in terms of the industry. Thriving communities, the people most affected by our operations, are our partners in those local communities. Now I think over a long period of time we haven't done a good job with local communities, and we certainly changed our approach over the last few years. And we know we've got a lot more work to do. And for those familiar with the courageous conversations that are occurring in South Africa with the archbishop, that's the type of approach in terms of engagement with communities that we think it very novel and different, and certainly creating a new dialogue and healthy environment. So how do we make sure that we're doing all things right in terms of the environment? Are we doing the best we can do with tailings and all those other areas that potentially impact on communities is where our focus is and we've been doing a lot of work and our tailings we've done in 2014 as part of that program. So in terms of the business, what we look at and how we think about the future. 
In terms of margins, driving cash flow. Cash flow for us as a team is we think the effectiveness measure major shareholders are looking for in terms of our ability to return today, tomorrow and through the long-term. So margins is a real focus, getting ourselves to 45% to 50% is a critical focus for us because the cash flow then comes as a consequence. Return on capital employed measures the efficiency, that is, how well did you generate that cash flow. It's easy to generate cash flow in this industry over short periods of time. The real measure is your long-term sustainability and the deliverability or the repeatability of that cash flow, look for your return on capital employed. Did you use the capital well? And will the shareholder support you continuing to use capital come with respect to this number. We believe that we can deliver better than 20% through the cycle with the quality assets and the work we're doing inside the business. And asset life. The one thing I would say that over the next few years this number will move around a little bit because if we increase our production another 25%, it's never quite linear how that number moves, but at 30 years we're right up there in terms of life of asset. And so what I want you to know, what I want you to take away from today is we look at these metrics and we drive all of these metrics in making sure we've got a sustainable business that is cash flow returns and long-term continuity in terms of the business. And in our industry, they're a pretty tough set of metrics to deliver on consistently. And certainly, that's where we're focused. 
Finally, in terms of the investment proposition, we've been talking to this for a couple or 2 or 3 years, now. Paul, I noticed a few others are starting to talk to the same sorts of slides. Maybe I'll just focus on capabilities today. You know about the asset story and how we've tried to position the portfolio and what we're doing in terms of return. And I think Stephen's done a good job explaining our position there. For us, the operating model is about creating a culture inside Anglo American that's about being the best. In the end, I'll say today we're not the best. I can point to many examples where players are doing better than us on an individual basis. But as a team, we're determined to continue to take every step to catch and overtake those that we see as best. In some areas of the business, for example, I think in the longwalls, we are probably right up there. Platinum, I think again, we're right up there in the Bs, again. But there are far more places that we're behind further than we should be. And we're not going to stay there, we're going to keep improving and we're going to keep improving quicker than anyone else. In terms of FutureSmart mining, we can't continue to mine as we've mined for 100 years. You can't just keep building bigger trucks. We've got to think laterally, we've gone out there and think differently and so the changes that we're making to the flow sheet is about the changes that will drive the next 100 years of mining. We want to be on the forefront of that because those that lead those changes will be the outperformancers in the industry. And third, we make sure that every product we produce, whatever commodity it may be, and remembering that diamonds aren't a commodity, we sell dreams in the diamond industry. We have to make sure that every product -- is that right, Bruce? He was getting a bit worried there. Every product we produce we have to get the best price we can and that means understanding your customers, making sure you've got a relationship and making sure that we're creating value for them to ensure that we get the value reflected back in the price that we've paid for our products. 
And so with that, we're more than happy to take questions."

The first, it's a bit churlish maybe to criticize a company for doing what they said they were going to do, but a 40% payout, given the strength of the balance sheet, does look a little bit skinny versus some of your peers. So could we just maybe map out how we should think about excess capital returns; when, what's appropriate, is a 40% payout the appropriate payout ratio for this business? And are there any constraints around preferred mechanism for excess capital returns? Is it special dividends, share buybacks, any constraints around that?
Second question. In terms of thinking about long-term capital planning, the industry's had a very poor track record long-term, very poor track record in stress testing the downside, so with respect to diamonds, could you maybe just give us some thoughts around how you think about the risks posed by synthetics? What's your base case? How do you stress test that into the long-term capital allocation for the diamonds business? And again, maybe some comments around what's going on at Lightbox at the moment? And then final question. Obviously, big moves in iron ore prices, there's a sort of structural premium now embedded into high grade iron ore. How does that affect your long-term planning for Kumba? So essential for long-dated mine life extensions and maybe long-term exploration there."

We have a view of what's in front of us in terms of capital spend, balance sheet journey, et cetera. And so we factored that into our thinking in terms of that 40% payout ratio. One point I do want to emphasize, we will constantly assess where we are. I mean, that is our job to do and we will absolutely do that in terms of considering additional returns. We have maybe tracked to where we are perhaps 6 months ahead of what we thought given the strength in prices. If you recall when I speak about that window we have to reset the balance sheet to the midyear, I've said, well, we'll probably likely have a 3 in front of it, I'd love to think we'd have a 2 in front of it and we probably got there a little bit quicker than what I thought. But I would just come back to the pro forma sort of concept of data swell that I mentioned. We have got about $500 million of the cash from the sale down to Mitsubishi on the balance sheet. We know that's going to be spent about half year, we know we're going to start our contributions thereafter. So the approach that we really do want to take and we will run a more conservative balance sheet than we have. Clearly, we are sitting very well in terms of all of the balance sheet metrics. We'll actively consider it. But we probably are almost at the low point today as we look forward, but we will actively consider it. We'll consider all forms of returns to shareholders. We'll probably stick to the 40% base dividend. We will stick with that, but if we do consider any excess returns then we'll consider the buybacks, the additional dividends, et cetera, as you would expect."

You'll remember we said that the current synthetic offering doesn't differentiate synthetics from the natural product. And that consumers told us that wasn't right, but that they were confused by the offering. So we see there's a perfectly legitimate place for a laboratory grown diamond offering, but we don't think it's the same as the natural business and that's really why we launched Lightbox. We announced Lightbox in June and we sold our first diamond at the end of September. And we'll only sell 20,000 carats in total by the end of 2019 before our facility in Oregon comes on stream. Since we've started, the Lightbox offering has had a tremendously positive impact on price up from a lab-ground diamond point of view. At the wholesale level, prices have come down over the competitive product between 30% and 60%, which is extraordinary given how little we've sold. So I think there's already evidence that the positioning of the product as to what it should be, which is not a natural diamond, is already starting to be successful. We'll carry on working on that. But I think on the other side of the question in relation to how do we stress test projects going forward. A couple of things. As Mark said, we think supply has probably just about peaked in 2018. And we think that's good provided we can continue to grow demand. So as long as we can keep growing demand for the natural there should be a positive outcome there. And secondly, as Mark, was a pain, I think, to point out in relation to the asset quality. We have overall the highest quality assets and the highest margin assets in the diamond business. So our ability to withstand price fluctuations is, I think, considerably higher than other people. So I think in the round of those 3 points is we feel positive about the projects going forward. Of course we stress test different scenarios on the upside and the downside in relation to all projects, but we are comfortably, we think, within any range of concerns there."

One of the things I think, and I talk about this, is one of the damages or the damage that Minas-Rio did to us as a business was not only the project in and of itself but also robbed the rest of the business of the incremental capital you need to continue to improve your business. So I think the damage was twofold. We're not going to make that mistake again. So when I talked about Quellaveco making a 50% contribution to the quality and growth in the business, those other incremental projects in my view as just as important. So you're spreading the risk. So you're actually changing and lowering the risk profile and you're improving the quality of all parts of the portfolio. And I think, taking that balanced approach in terms of capital allocation is critical. And I think, again, reinforcing the point through the syndication exercise in Quellaveco, it's a very different company and a very different company approach in terms of capital as well."

And I think getting the jobs right and getting ourselves thinking about the right time frames, and sequencing the business is as critical, if not more critical, than delivering today's improvements. So I think what we're trying to present today is we've done the basics you would have expected us to do. We've thought about the next level of improvement at the operating level with P101. We've thought about the next level of improvement with the innovation strategies and targets to change our position against our competitors. And we're building a portfolio through our capital allocation on even better projects again. So today, it's a 4-tier strategy that's timed over the next 10 to 20 years that we think we'll position this company for the long-term. So I hope that sort of scratches at the  core of your question. It's never smooth, there'll be a couple of bumps. As I said, this year will be a little bit, not flat, but as a launching pad for 2021, because the innovation stuff that we're putting in place this year will start to deliver in '21, '22, '23.

We don't think the Minas-Rio dam, given its construction, would likely have any material changes given the engineering aspects of the business. We think they will be more focused on other dams and other construction. And certainly, that's what we've seen at the federal level. So we're pretty confident we're in the right place. Now at the same time, we're in conversation with government. We've got at least 6 to 8 months, we think, breathing space in terms of anything we do. And the conversations have been positive and we've got 95% local community support. And when we delivered the license and the operating license for the mining business, that came 6 months early. And the fact that we had 90% to 95% support from the community was a pretty important factor, I think, in making sure we got the support to go forward. So I think we've got good support from the local communities. They've been fantastic with us, even when the spill. In fact, our popularity with the community went up after we had the first spill and what they said is your reaction to the spill was as good as we could've expected.

And again, lift the vision, you'll see there's a slide in there on the debt portfolio, the work we've done there over the last few years also helps de-risk any volatility and movement in prices as well. Because we have very little maturing now in the next 1, 2 and 3 years. So all of those things feed into our thinking absolutely. As I say, pleased with where we are.

So you'll recall that we've been talking about a deficit in the palladium market for many years now. I mean clearly, everyone that has been supplied palladium from aboveground stock. Everyone said, well, we'll believe it when actually the aboveground stock runs out. At the end of 2016, for the first time, we really started seeing the structural deficit and the fact that there wasn't material around. So recalling 2016, we had that shutdown in our precious metal refinery. We needed to go back into the market to buy metal and then we started finding that actually it was very difficult to buy palladium. Towards the end of 2016, we started seeing the price move for the first time. 2017 and 2018, over the last 3 years we've seen 1.5 million ounces of palladium ETFs being redeemed. And this is what's been supplying the market. And over the last two years, you haven't been able to get that. So we went down 600,000 ounces in palladium, last year, the Johnson Matthey numbers looked like they were in deficit. It required the Russians to sell 300,000 ounces from their stock and 600,000 ounces from ETFs just to get to that balance number. So the point is actually the structural deficit in palladium with very low aboveground stocks is what's driving the price. So is there about to be crash? We don't think so. There's also, remember, in a years' time, you're starting to see China 6, which is the loadings about a gram per vehicle extra. At 700,000 to 1 million ounces extra of palladium that's going to be needed. So if you look at where that can come from, it can only come from platinum switching. So we don't think that there's any likelihood anytime soon that you see a palladium crash. I think that it is much more likely that palladium really runs hard and it drags rhodium with it. Rhodium is sold less than twice the palladium price. Rhodium is cheap at these prices. There's been some speculation in rhodium we think, but actually generally it's still underlying basis for rhodium demand. We know the Chinese have been buying additional rhodium as they've been putting extra rhodium onto their catalysts. So I don't hold your breath for, so Mark, 10 years maybe, maybe a bit longer. Rhodium, palladium still look good. And there has to be some substitution from platinum back into palladium. We don't think that happens anytime soon. We still think that's 2 years out. And the reason for that is because the car makers at the moment are trying to deal with the real world driving issues. And that's why they're not substituting yet. So I think you can expect to see basket price for PGMs remaining good. Stephen?"

And the basket price is really important to understand because producers of different products, catalysts, can move across that continuum at any particular time. But then the -- what is required to then switch between the two is quite an administrative exercise. And I was talking to people in the last few months about what does that entail. And so it's not a continuous movement, it's a bit lumpy. But the basket price gives you a sense of what funds are being allocated into PGMs in terms of industrial applications, and I think that's the more important number to focus on because those uses are actually, they're quite substitutable, but the administration process to make the change is quite significant. So over the long term, we look at them as a continuum. In the short term, where they go, it provides us with a bit flexible in terms of our short term capital allocation, but we take the long view on the big projects. And that's why we think very hard about a Mogalakwena in the longer-term context as well. We don't know what it will do in the short term, none of us know how quickly substitution may occur. But we think the underlying fundamentals are very strong, particularly with the potential for the hydrogen economy, the greener economy, I think we're very well-positioned in a business with great assets and what we think is a long-term high potential business."

So hopefully, you can model Anglo in about 5 lines as you go forward just to make your life a little bit simpler in today's world.

Themba and the guys have been talking about a $10 a ton improvement potential on their base operating costs. He won't get in the year out so better over the next 3 years. So that would put him ahead of inflation. So some of that will be given back to inflation, but on a real bases, that's the sort of number he's pushing at based on the P101 programs, and some work on the DMS plant. So $10 dollars over 3 years, that's what his objective is. He will give probably half of that back to inflation, but I think it's about that range. And he gets some incremental improvement through the DNS plant. So beyond that, some of the bigger innovation issues need to kick in more solidly, but he's already extended life to 20 years, so we're pretty pleased with the work that's been done.

I think -- if you look for a start at the growth in diamond jewelry consumption in the U.S. in the last 4 or 5 years, you'll find it actually has gone up year-on-year. So at a consumer level, there has been increased demand in the main market. Outside of the U.S., it's a little bit more mixed but it's very much ForEx driven, for example, because ultimately diamonds are priced in dollars and if you live in a non-dollar country that can be quite difficult to -- for a retailer to match a dollar price increase. If you also look at supply over the last 3 or 4 years, there has been a reasonable increase of supply over the same period. Now they're not necessarily of higher quality goods but there has been an increase of supply so there have been more carats available to be sold. We think that peak is about now, if maybe in a few months' time, but it's years out. Clearly, where there have been difficulties in this period is in the midstream. So the midstream has battled, as we've said before, to access enough finance on a sustainable basis to become more efficient and I think there's more work to be done there. But I don't think there's evidence that there hasn't been demand for diamond jewelry over the last 4 years in the main market and so we're hopeful that -- and we believe very strongly actually that as long as we can continue to drive demand, which is a big thing, but we're very good at that, that the tailing off or the leveling of supply for the next few years should be helpful for us."

My name is Stuart Chambers, Chairman of Anglo American. it's my pleasure to welcome you to our 2019 half year results presentation. I just wanted to cover 2 things before I hand over to Mark. I wanted to touch -- first of all within HCE, I want to just touch on safety. Mark will cover this shortly in his presentation, so I won't duplicate. But I do want to share with you that the Board of Anglo American is very engaged in this. We are very clear that it's a journey. It's by no means a job done. There is a lot more to do and in fact, we're pretty clear now on the things that we have to change to ensure that we continue to improve in this area build on the improvements we are already making in the underlying message but of course, importantly, to eliminate the fatalities And as I said, Mark will cover this again quite shortly. 
The second thing to do is simply to update you on board changes since we last spoke in this forum, which was the full result in February. So since then, Jack Thompson, one of our 2 mining nonexecs retired, having served 9 years, and we are very pleased to been able to bring in Marcella to get us back to miners within our own nonexecs. And Marcella, of course, is also -- he's Brazilian, but even more importantly, he has extensive mining experience in South America, an increasingly important part of our operations.
Then I don't know if you saw it, but 2 days ago, we announced then some further changes, which is the steppes down from the Board, which is a loss, our South African nonexec director one of them and -- but I'm pleased to say that we're not losing her because she is stepping down because she is taking out a full-time executive role in Mark's Senior Executive team, leading down in South Africa.
We're than bringing in 2 new nonexecs, one directly replaced and second also South African to ensure that we sustain our target level, which is that we wish to have 2 South African nonexecs overtime in our board to, again, stress the importance of that part of our operations.
So in that respect, we're bringing on and they both join in November and January, respectively. So that's enough for me. Thank you. I'll hand over to Mark."

Thanks for joining us today. I would like to acknowledge my colleagues here in the room. As always, we'll be available after the session for additional questions that you may have and certainly from my point of",3446,"Thanks, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us today. I would like to acknowledge my colleagues here in the room. As always, we'll be available after the session for additional questions that you may have and certainly from my point of your I encourage you to talk to the guys and hear their version of events.
I'd also like to acknowledge both Ruben and just on the GMC. So this is his first session timbre. Is the CFO of. So if you've got really tough questions, well throw them to Timba. And Ruben is just taking out of copper business from Duncan. And we had a good performance, both of them are taking credit for the improving performance in copper at the moment.
So I'm sure when you talk you'll get 2 versions of that story. For us, the order of march for today very consistent with what we've done in the past I'll kick away with an overview of the results. Stephen will pick up the financials and really pull apart the numbers, and help give you a bit sense of how we got there. And then I'll add some insights in terms of where to from here. And I think that's an important point to make as we pick up conversations around buyback if you look back at where we've come from in resetting the business, restructuring the business, it's been a lot of work done, but from our point of view there is still a lot to do as we look forward, and we believe a lot more improvement potential, and we'll unpack that conversation as we go and the buyback and the part of the story around buyback is obviously about what we think about or where we think we are and where we believe we're going and certainly, I think that's very important part of the story for me, probably the most important part of the conversations during the course of today.
So on the results, our financials reflect both good prices, particularly in iron ore and solid cost control across the broader business. And while volumes were down 2%, that's the disappointment. The cost control work was exceptionally good. I'm very pleased with the work that's been done, obviously, still a lot more to be done. But in the case of inflation and other processes, I think that's been incredible. 
As a consequence, our EBITDA margin of 46% is right up there with the best we've ever achieved and certainly right up there with the best in the industry.
So again, it reflects both improving cost control and also improving prices or realized prices on our products. And I think one of the unsung changes in the business and transformation of the business had been the marketing story and we're proud of what Peter and the guys have achieved.
Our dividends reflect the earnings improvement obviously, the 40% payout ratio represents $800 million payout to shareholders. And in addition, we're announcing a $1 billion buyback. And again, we'll unpack the logic behind that and I'll leave most of that to Steven. But from our point of view, I think it's very clear statement about where we believe we are, the projects in control, we're investing in growth in the future. And certainly from our point of view, the prognosis going forward is we look to continue pretty solid, and so we felt that it was appropriate and it also reflects the confidence has in the future of the company.
Free cash flow isn't as good as it might have been given the headline performance. We have about $600 million locked up in working capital, we should see that come out, but again Stephen will give you a much better picture on what that looks like. We have over the course of the 6 months seen some pleasure in the diamond market, again, happy to unpack some of those conversations. But the real high point I think for the first half is the performance at Minas-Rio. We've adjusted up the guidance once, we've done it again today, 19 million to 21 million tonnes, really pleased with how the team has come back after the pipeline incident, obviously, a lot of work done while the pipeline and that certainly gave us the running start, so very pleased with that work. And our return on capital employed, 22% reflects both improving margins and the continuing discipline that we have on capital allocation and again Steve will unpack the conversation.
As Stuart flagged, safety critical issue for us. And from our point of view, it remains an absolute focus and our priority item. We reported 3 fatalities in the first 6 months: 1 at Moranbah in Australia, 1 in Los Bronces in Chile, and 1 in in Peru on a concrete track supply concrete to the plant.
Post the results, we've had 2 bus incidents, people commuting from work to home at and near Los Bronces. In our case, we've extended our transportation work -- we've extended our elimination to fatality work into transportation which includes commuting off-site and with third-party providers to make sure we pick up that element because when we look at the risks across the business, one think that doesn't get pick up as well as it should be is where we have off-site commutes back to -- whether it's San Diego. And so we're working with our third-party suppliers and contractors to make sure that we've got that covered as well.
So that's certainly been very disappointing from our perspective, and it will be included in the very important piece of work for us as we feel that responsibility not only on-site or within the mine gate, but getting people back home and helping people make sure that their homes are safer as well and that's responsible we take very seriously.
On health, again, continuing to improve the operations focusing on making sure where people work is in the right shape and certainly the progress has been significant. We'll continue to focus on that work and on the environment -- the improvement in the environmental reflects discipline around the planning, the discipline around the operations and control each of our processes. And whilst we are not a 0, we've got to keep improving until we get to the 0 number and certainly, we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far.
In terms of the environmental side and tailings, we continue to work on tailings and we're going through the process obviously but that facility is certainly something very new and a high-level of technical, a high degree of technical complexity has gone into the design and is certainly a very different design to most of the tailing dams in Brazil, and it's also designed to actually manage water as well, so its actually a water containing facility. So we don't expect problems in terms of the approval, and we're on track to actually get that approval by the end of the year.
In terms of the overall talent, we went public recently. Feedback's been very positive. We thank people have provided us with some -- with feedback. And we are looking at anything we can do to improve. We're working with our colleagues in the industry, particularly in the ICMM and looking at standards more broadly. We're currently operating above the ICMM standards, we have done -- in fact, we created a new set of standards back in '14.
They were used to help define the new standards for the ICMM in '16, and we're continuing to improve our facilities and management of assets across the group. And I just want to ensure people -- assure people that it really does remain a key area of focus for us in the business and very pleased with the progress we've made.
In terms of the operations, we've seen this chart, a few times before. Our portfolio work is resulted in us being able to focus on the largest scale, assets and resources that we felt had a lot more potential and our improvement focus has been around 3 areas: Firstly, we've reconfigured our technical process, so 70% of the mining operations have been adjusted to mine the orebody more effectively than we were mining and that includes mining methods and process technologies. Our operating model helped us to improve the way we plan and execute work and so we certainly improved our consistency, we're not at a where we want to be. But in terms of where we were, we're at least 20% better than where we were, in fact each operating asset has improved 30% in the last 5 years. That's on average across assets we have in the portfolio to date.
And we are now working on the technical and innovation platform across resource right through to delivering product to market, and Tony is here, again, to dive through any questions about the process, I'll touch a few points for you, but if you like a little more detail Tony will certainly be happy to answer a few questions. 
We have delivered, as I said, 30% more production from asset and more importantly, in terms of driving margins we dropped our operating costs by around 45% in real terms.
27% normally since 2012. And so that transformation has been absolutely key in supporting our improvement in EBITDA margins of 46% EBITDA margins and again going with the work that the marketing teams has done is certainly underpinned our improvement in margins across the business.
Now in terms of measuring that performance across the industry and in particularly talking about competitive position, we've improved -- since the last time you saw this chart we've gone from the 37% on average, that's cost position across our assets, to the 36 percentile 
On balance sheet, while we're not the lowest number, we'd like to think that our debt is in a good place and that the way we think about the balance sheet and investing in growth and investing in returns to shareholders, the approach is a balanced approach. And there I think it's a great, and now he unpack that a little bit more in his presentation.
And on looking forward, our suite of high quality growth options, most of those assets have a EBITDA margins better than 50%. And so from our point of view, that's really important as we continue to grow the business through investment in those quality growth options, and so we think over the next 3 to 5 years, it really is an exciting time as we grow top line performance by around 20% to 25% and at the same time, we drive ourselves towards the 50% EBITDA margin and 46%. We're a little bit further ahead than we thought we'd be, but of course, iron ore has helped us get there. So pleased with where we stand and how we've positioned ourselves.
When we talk about the transformation, we talked about FutureSmart mining and the changes that we've made. We do like to make the point, I think it's very important that it's all connected to being part of our sustainability work. So the work we're doing to reduce energy consumption, water consumption, improve our physical footprint is all about improving the business in return, which is absolutely consistent with creating a more sustainable operation. And whether you're talking enviromental health, safety, social partnerships, they're all part of the conversations and obviously, having a much more competitive cost position is also about sustainability. So for us, our material -- or our organic improvement is built on the 3 key short-term foundations of. Obviously, with the quality of the assets, we have provides us with raw materials to shape the business over the longer term and position ourselves for continuing performance improvement and growth. Our P101 program, actually, builds off the implementation of the operating model. So we put the operating model in.
we've improved our competitive position, but every one of us, when we look at each other in the eyes, we're not yet best practice. The real drive from here is to get each part of the business to operating best practice. Now that doesn't mean every one of your processes get to that position because there are a critical points in the process that we need to be at the top to ensure we've got best performance across the business. And so that's important for us, and the operating model and the work around the operating model has provided the platform for that next set of conversation. 
So every one of our operators, knows what they have to achieve to get the best-in-class on a shovel, a truck, loaders and the plants right across the business.  And it's really generating a buzz and a conversation about how do we get there and how do we help each other get there. And the second part, the technical change. So when talked about mining method changes and configuration changes, in taking that to logical next step, Tony and the team have been talking about changing the footprint, reducing energy consumption by 30%, reducing water consumption by 50%, all of those technologies and those different approaches, come off the base that we've created that is we're mining the ore bodies, in our view, the best way in terms of managing short-term, medium-term and longer-term returns and looking for right technologies to hit those critical points that improves our performance and continues to improve both the recovery of the resources, the cost position on those resources, and we've  positioned assets for the long term. Because when we look at cut-off grades and those sorts of things, we're trying to think about squaring up those 3 dimensions, short, medium and longer term and getting the best out of our assets, and I think the continuity that we've been able to achieve in our operations speaks to try to get that balance right.
On FutureSmart mining specifically, we look at the program right through the value chain, concentrated mine is around getting the mining methods right, mining the ore and only the ore and driving the process or driving the ore through the process at the highest grade possible so making sure that we're not wasting money on mining waste or processing waste through the system and that a critical part of the process, and we've got our first ore sorter currently being commissioned at and so far the results look pretty good.
In the mine, we're looking at various elements of the process, being able to coarse a grind and I talked about last time, so I won't go back through that, that's part of the process. Mine is around the systems we're building and the operating model provides a very different base for us to look at, think about the plan and execute work in the operation. And so from our point of view, the operating model provides the starting point. Its really an industrial model applied to the operation. And we take every person through the business, and it takes us 18 months to transform an operation from the standing start to having a very different mentality about the operation. And what I'll say it is hard work, it takes time, someplace it takes a bit longer and some places where you're working on a number of fronts, you might have some places come back a bit, and it's important and it helps us identify where that's occurring quickly, so we can go back and then address it. I think there was a good at kumba where we've said we had a bit of problem with operating equipment, but [ Timba ] and his team identified the issue early and the fact that you've got those processes in pace helps you identify those sort of issues and then the reaction time is much shorter, and you're able to pull the operation up back much quicker. I think [ Timba ] did a good job explaining that in his results presentation a few days back.
And finally, on the think about what we do in a very different way. Our industry, in my experience, has not been good with the data, and data literacy has been fairly poor, even though we're in an industry that's had a Big Data for a long period of time and the work on understanding the data and understanding of how to apply the data and working the critical pinch points and control points and opportunity points across a business are different.
It also has gone to another level with the development of different algorithms and diagnostics across the industry it tells us that we think the changes or the possible much more significant the most people understand and so we've really pushed too hard into this part of the business and again, it connects everything else that we've been doing from basically getting a better understanding of the geology, the mining opportunities, the mining methods and the application of new technologies to these operations, which we think is absolutely, critical, and we've been investing in this for 5 years.
So it's not we work up last week, and this wee this might be a good idea. When we started to transform the business, we're investing in this thinking, 5 and 6 years ago, and we're starting to see the benefits in terms of what we believe we can achieve going forward.
I thought this a very simple graphic. The small truck, 1,900 today, where we're actually mining or spending 16x the amount of energy, double the amount of water, about 8x the amount of ground to actually produce a pound of copper. And the trucks keep getting clearly the benefits of scale have been through cost performance, but we think we're getting to not the limits, but the curve is starting to flatten off and the opportunities to think very differently about mining using all of the tools I've just talked about is significant, and we've been significant investor over the last 5 years in that whole thinking process. Tony has been the leader with operating CEOs and they worked with partners in working out how those technologies can be applied in these businesses. And I think of the next 3 to 4 years the transformation in the business is going to be just as significant as the transformation we're seeing in the last 3 or 4 years, and I think that's the point we're making about, we're thinking about where we're going as a company when we look at what we should do with shareholder returns and investment in the future and getting that balance right.
Again, sustainability. I've talked to the 3 elements. I won't go back through that, but I think it's important to make the point that we connect them, and they are interconnected for us. It's all about the same conversation, and we look at both sides of that equation in everything we're doing and again, we've been doing that for a number of years, and I think the benefits are coming through both in the terms of the results, the relationships we have with our core stakeholders across the business, local community, lot more to be done. But again, I think is a good example of doing the right work in the community and what can be a fairly complex, social environment and certainly I think the way the Tom and the guys are handling the work in has really gone well and certainly, the feedback from the government has been exceptional.
Finally, before I hand across to Stephen, pretty simple story. 2012, 30% EBITDA margin has been an important piece for us reflecting production and the nature of the production We've continued to grow the business. We're now at 46% EBITDA so an 8% production improvement drive that type of improvement in EBITDA because the price comparison, the price of today are actually lower still when we did these numbers.
It's been all about the transformation in the portfolio and that drive in the operating cost side. And for us, with the projects we have in place, we can see growth up to that 135 of the 100 base in 2012, and we believe on the current prices, we can deliver a 50% margin. The 45% margin is on long-term prices, and so that's the difference that we saw or that's the explanation of the range that we shown.
So I think with that, I'll hand across to Stephen, and he can really unpack that detail behind the numbers."

As I talked through some of the numbers this morning, I really wanted to touch on 3 key themes and it sort of flows on some of the topics that Mark was talking about. So firstly, constant delivery of the numbers is really derived from consistent delivery from the operations, and that's underpinned by the operating model and that focus on productivity that Mark has spoken about.
Secondly, the increasing margin driven by the relentless focus on productivity and also our prices, this half have really flowed in to our improvement in our relative cost position. And thirdly, then is the disciplined use of cash. I'll try not to overuse this word this morning, but balance is my word of the reporting season. It about how we think about that balance between the balance sheet, the capital and way we invest in the business and returns to shareholders. If we take that cycle right now, it allows us to set up for that next, wave of growth and cash flow and investment and returns.
But obviously, the big news for this morning is the return to shareholders So the buyback of up to USD 1 billion consistent with those 3 themes that I have, in fact, just spoken about and the how we're thinking about that use and allocation of the discretionary free cash flow that we generate.
And then the base dividend. 40% payout ratio, USD 62 cents per share and I'll talk to both of those components in a few slides' time.
So the numbers themselves, EBITDA $5.5 billion, earnings per share, $1.58, as Mark mentioned, the best half we've had since 2011. Free cash flow of $1.6 billion, slight building working capital, as we've noted in the results. If ever there was a good building working capital from a finance director's point of view, the majority of it is this and it's in receivables because we've had increasing prices, which obviously flows through the cash flow and the returns at Minas-Rio have also led to some of that build in working capital to say if ever there was a good build, this would have to be it.
CapEx, as usual, half 1, half 2 split and obviously then in terms of using the Mitsubishi cash we've had on hand coming into the second half we'll find our portion importantly guidance for the year on CapEx is maintained.
And finally, effective tax rate. I know it causes you a few issues in terms of getting to your EPS and dividend number, apologies, but it really is the mix of results across the businesses that drives that to some extent , in particular this 6 months is the return at Mitsubishi strongly in a higher iron ore price environment we've mean able to use some of those past tax losses that we've accumulated from those operations so that's really driven us down to 30% and our guidance going forward is 29% to 31%.
Okay. Mark often talks about the number of assets that we have in the business. I suppose another way to think about that it is, yes, we have 34 assets, but we're currently organized around 4 simple business units. obviously driven by return of Minas-Rio on prices, PGM's nice to see coming back to give us a little bit of a hand; copper, continued great work in terms of both volumes and the cost; and diamonds, even though we've seen softness in the market, particularly from quarter 2 onwards still contributes over $0.5 billions to the group result.
In each case and to pick up a big theme of Mark's, driving very healthy margins in each of those 4 business units. So as we worked through the underlying numbers period on period so as we say $5.5 billion, up 19% from the prior year, price largely driven by iron or price, 62% averaged around $91 a tonne that translates to us from a realized CFR price of about $118 a tonne, really driven by quality grade and product offsetting that some price weakness in thermal coal.
This period we've had a little bit of turnaround in terms of positive impact across FX and CPI. So currencies generally moved in our favor, offsetting about a 200 negative movement in CPI and inflation costs. As you look across the combination of currency, the impact of inflation, the Minas-Rio recovery and the cost and volume changes we've had apart for the period, it's a net positive when you add all of those things up and that translates to that relatively improvement in our cost position across the portfolio.
As we come into half 2 some real momentum with Kumba, met coal, Minas-Rio and the copper, all from a production point of view and looking to recover some of that shortfall that you saw in our quarterly that we had  that we had released the other day. As we look at cost and volume going forward, it's not always an even flow, half to half, so you recall last year, we've had very strong first half and then slightly flat second half , at this time around we're actually anticipating to see the reverse within the momentum that we have a fairly flat first half and good momentum into the second.
If we then turn to the balance sheet, again, very consistent messages every time I get up here around the balance sheet, and that's not going to change today and it's not going to change as we go forward. So net debt, effectively flat. We had the accounting standard adjustment for operating leases, opening adjustment of 500 and then 100 added during the 6 months mainly around the shipping contracts, so fairly flat period-to-period. 
Net-debt-to-EBITDA, 0.3x, again, a very healthy position to take the business forward. And net gearing, what really go to the underlying strength of the balance sheet in terms of debt to balance sheet, a very healthy 10%.
So return to shareholders. We are committed to the payout ratio, we're committed to the 40% payout ratio and that has resulted in quite substantial increase in dividends per share for the half, again, a direct reflection of the improvement in the underlying earnings [ of ] 27 percentile.
That compares to 100 cents for the full year from last year, so a very good start assuming we continue with our performance, and that's a roughly around 5% yield. 
In terms of the buyback, it really is consistent with our capital allocation policy and I'll touch on the wheel that we normally talk to in a moment. As we work through that allocation of discretionary cash flow, it reflects a confidence in our balance sheet, confidence in our near and medium-term growth and again that balance that we have as we think about where we're taking the business today and as we go forward.
We also thought about the balance of returns to shareholders, and here we recognize different shareholders have different preferences. But to date, leading up to today and including today's 40% buyback that would represent $3.4 billion of dividends and now with the buyback of $1 billion of a buybacks, so in total $4.4 billion since we started, we out of dividend back in '17, so it's an 80-20 split, again, its about balance.
Going forward, please put in your spreadsheets, 40% of payout policy, we will continue with that policy. I know we perhaps surprised some of you given absolute resolute sticking to the 40% guidance. But it's okay to reassess those things from time to time, and we will reassess those things from time to time as we go forward as well. We'll always consider how we allocate the cash flow.
So how we've done, let's look at the scorecard in terms of our capital allocation and cash flow. So  $1.6 billion of sustaining cash flow, 40% dividend last year with $700 million this year, it's $800 million and pleased where we are from the balance sheet point of view, and you can see we are starting to allocate cash some of the discretionary items, whether that be some smaller brownfield growth projects, we will start to see our proportionate funding comes through this year and then obviously, the share buyback, which will flow between now and the early next year.
So back in February, we tried to give you some really good forward information around capital spend and where we saw the capital spend, excuse me, journey going. As you noted then and as you can see today, we see it peaking up a little bit through '20 and '21 and I would anticipate as we move to '21 will be towards the top end of that range, and that's a combination of the sustaining CapEx that we've clearly flagged, and the productivity gains and extra volumes that we will see, the Brownfield approvals, which I will touch on shortly and then the investment in innovation and technology and obviously Quellaveco. 
You'll recall that the full year I presented a capital efficiency slide and nothing really has changed in that, so we're tracking at the moment to sort of 20% to 30% capital efficiency and as you recall that reflects exactly the same 20% to 30% operating efficiency that we've are seeing through the operating sides of the business. You will see that fluctuate a little bit from time to time, spoke about while it's okay for the absolute number of sustaining CapEx to go up provided on a copper equivalent part-time basis we're spending that money more efficiently, that's exactly what we're still seeing. But some of the businesses go through ramp up and volume improvements, good example is Moranbah-Grosvenor. We're seeing increased productivity rates, which means we need to step forward a little bit quicker in terms of the degassing and mine development and setting up for the next long hauls.
So good reason why that's increasing, it's driving really high margin growth returns even though the absolute number creeps up by 0.1 or 0.2 across that timeframe.
Looking at some of the options that we have across the portfolio and that as far as it's to see that we've got a nice list in front of us and we own these options. Again, we flagged this last year, and we got to keep you informed in terms of how this unfolds going forward. So we can tick another one off. In May, we approved the vessel in Namibia, for the operations, and we've been being talking about the Moranbah-Grosvenor expansion that's likely to come through through the first half of next year, I would anticipate at this stage with some of the improvements in that the bottleneck was that we've seen already, we are already seeing, let's call it, some of the volume of benefits we thought we would have seen in the next CapEx program already coming forward to today. So we'll just feed into the study and see how that flows out.
And probably some of the next thing you'd see would be some of the technology and innovation, perhaps, showing itself a little more obviously to you as we invest through that '19 and '20 period, and then you'll see some of those benefits flow out through the '21 and '22 period as it works its way through the production systems and into underlying EBITDA.
What we will guarantee is that we'll keep you posted on those things. These things will be very visible to you as we go through, they will only be approved over time and take full account of markets, balance sheet, cash flows, and the circumstances of the day and we'll keep you posted through the time frame.
So just coming back to our cost and volume improvement targets. So we are targeting $400 million for this year, originally $500 million, so we've just softened a little bit. With the softness in the market that was seen in diamonds in particular, yes, we are not prepared to give up on the $400 million it will be, perhaps, challenging, but we have a number of initiatives building up to that and through that that we will be working very hard to deliver through the year.
On the basis that we've achieved that, that will take our cost and volume benefit from this $3 billion to $4 billion to $800 million. And if you recall in that bottom section there, the operating model and sort of productivity improvements we've flagged a $1 billion to $1.5 billion in that bucket.
So over time, and we said that that would probably be more front end loaded than the other categories, that's what we're seeing, and we're starting to move towards the target over the next year or 2.
As I said earlire, the technology and innovation, you will see a little more backended and so we would expect to see some of those benefits flow-through in that '21 and '22 period and then obviously there's the growth projects as well, very much a mix of the brownfields in the near term and then the delivery of Quellaveco towards the end of '21, '22 so those things should flow, again, nicely and quite visibly through the results over time. So very much reconfirming our target of $3 billion to $4 billion between now and the end of 2022, and you should expect to see progressive delivery against that through that time frame.
So just to wrap up for me. Where are we and where we want to be, obviously growth, highly competitive and market-leading, in particular, what we're delivering edge to the margin story that Mark spoke about underpinned by  disciplined allocation of cash flow and from strong balance sheet position.
But what we do have, I suppose, is real commitment in terms of getting the balance of these things right whether that would be around the balance sheet returns to shareholders or delivering and investing in the future of the company. Thank you."

Obviously, the word is something that we're very sensitive. And when we talk about growth we are a very specific, and we try and make sure that in the business people understand the conversation the right way given the history of th",2057,"So thank you, Stephen. Obviously, the word is something that we're very sensitive. And when we talk about growth we are a very specific, and we try and make sure that in the business people understand the conversation the right way given the history of the industry. The focus on quality is absolutely, critical. And from our point of view, we do look at our markets, we look at the responses we test our projects against the impact we would have on those markets, that's very important to us.
And we look at the absolute margin we expect to achieve after adjusting for those changes. And so it's all about quality. And as I said, almost all of those projects better than 50% margin long-term prices.
Driving margins is about making sure the quality is there, and if you got the quality project, you'll get the margins and also how we place product into the markets. And our focus on quality, which I'll pick up towards the end of the presentation is something that we think is absolutely critical as the world evolves across mining and then making sure that the capital discipline is right and that the projects to the potential is also important in making sure we do better than that 20% threshold return of capital employed that we set ourselves through the cycle and so all those pieces come group together to put us into, I think, is a very balanced position about what they should look like across the business.
In terms of what we've seen in the last 6 months and to talk to the things that we will continue to improve the quality of our performance and margins. Minas-Rio has had very strong ramp-up in the first 6 months as we said we've adjusted the guidance a couple of times now, and we're very pleased with where we are in terms of the tailings program. Yes, tailings is a sensitivity word in Brazil at the moment, but again, I think the technological differences we've had in the dam set us apart. And by the way, the next lift is no different to the approval process that everyone else in the industry has to go through tailings, that's part of the process in Brazil. So we're not in a unique cycle today, we're now in a normal operating process.
So I think, that point has to be made pretty strongly, and it is a little bit different to way we've come from in terms of our processes. So again based on everything we've done so far, we think is certainly the right expectation given the conversation and we certainly got a lot of support from the government and the authorities in those prices.
And by the way, one thing, which should remind people as we go to our step 3 license 6 months earlier than we forecast that was license we got in December, which allowed us to open the footprint, and that's also being part of why we've done much better in the first 6 months because we've been able to blend product and get better throughputs  for the plant so is very important, and I think that's also a measure of the nature of the relationship we've built with the authorities in Brazil.
So I certainly don't see the risk around that is somehow talking to it more broadly, certainly very comparable very happy with where the. In terms of projects Quellaveco, on track, very pleased with the progress, that's been made and certainly from our point of view Tom and the team have done a great job. Most complex part of the business is obviously around the social dimensions and I think, again, the guys have done good work there. We've all the major work areas, we're pouring concrete, and certainly the progress has been very good.
we've ordered the knew ship, its on its way, very excited. For us, this is a really special bit of gear. Obviously, technically, its very different, but also it mines our highest-valued diamonds on a per capita basis and they're not large, but they're very high quality, smaller diamonds but a real good part of the business, again, pretty rapid payback so a good project and following Grasstree good piece of work and the guys in Queensland have done a great job in the business, again, Moranbah has won 5 years best in Australia and also best mine in Australia a couple of times as well.
And all of the learnings from Moranbah, Grasstree Grosvenor will go into or have gone into the design of a Aquilla. So from our point of view, good shape on the project side and again supporting the quality growth story that Stephen talked to.
On positioning for the future, we would argue that our portfolio is quite unique in the industry, and we would hope that shareholders and prospective shareholders, in particular, can see that the exposure you get it to Anglo American is very different to other peers in the industry. And we hope that the one thing that really is coming through is that diversity as a consequence of the quality of the assets is certainly a differentiating one that if you want to push for in time.
In diamonds, we've got the ultimate luxury consumer product. With the growing middle class and a shrinking industry resource and production base, that global leadership position BEE is exceptional. And as we say, the BEE isn't really a dominant company. It's a brand that is an industry icon that really means the very best in diamonds. And when you look at our revenue per carat, and I'll show a little bit later, it's the best in the industry. We're proud of the position and certainly the industry is going through a bit of tough time. There has been a confluence of certain issues. From our point of view, we think that's not a structural change. And with the work on Lightbox, I think we're very pleased with the market's reaction to the product, 3 million to 5 million carats, very small compared to the global diamond production of 143 million carats, so not really a factor and the fact that the pricing is to other lower-valued products is really pleased us in terms of the response of the market.
As the world becomes greener clear, accommodating 9 billion people will need energy and other industrial solutions that will drive significant growth in copper, nickel, manganese and PGMs unlike we've ever seen. And as the circular economy starts to impact sourcing of bulk commodities in various forms, our focus on quality coal and quality iron, ore is, again, the differentiator in a market that will go through significant change over the next 5 to 10 years, and we've been thinking about how we position our business in where we are today, where we will be in 5 years and where we will be in 10 years, and we think those changes will play into our hands in terms of the focus on quality both through Kumba, 64.5%; Minas-Rio, 67%, again, unique assets in the world and certainly, we think we're well positioned there.
And for us, if you look at our performance on the thing we have improved our relative marginal cost position for mid-Q3 to mid-Q2 off the back of improving costs at Kumba, the good production performance at Minas-Rio and the improvement in price premiums that we've received for our products guys are doing good work along with the operators in making sure that we're delivering the right product consistently into the market and we're going to keep trying to drive that position to the left across the portfolio. There's always a debate about macro trends, and we're having the debates as you would expect and trying to think about how we position out business in those frons and again we think the focus on quality and in particular, margins going to the absolutely, critical. It's the best way to insulate yourselves from things that you might not understand or might not anticipate.
the Way we look at things, again, changes in the population, that 9 billion population will look very different as well in terms of the organization. The last few years we've seen 1.4 billion people move to cities and there is another -- there will be another  1.4 billion move to cities over the next 18 years of. So from that point of view, we look at demographics, aging population, urbanization, the rise in the middleclass, climate change, carbon reduction, the rise of renewables, transportation fuels and the circular economy and that includes recycling, and that will increase, particularly across bulks through the recycling of steel, high-quality, new business models, 50% of our portfolio by production consists of greener and consumer-facing commodities, and I think that's a unique mix in our industry and its one that we think from a strategic point of view will play out in more conversations around our sector.
And the environmental benefits that we had in the portfolio and the research work that we're doing through the R&D programs we have across precious metals, are going to be very important and certainly now with people talking about platinum palladium being used in lithium batteries, they're important developments and developments where it's the forefront of with other players investing in making sure that we create opportunities for our products. And certainly Chris is well up to speed and driving many of those changes through his leadership in the platinum of the consumer-facing entities that we work with in the PGM space.
So for us, we think strategically about the commodity mix, and we think tactically in terms of making sure, we got the best operations, and we are building a business that is resilient for the long term. It's a unique product mix, it's a high-quality product mix, and it's a one we're going to keep improving and growing as we go forward.
In terms of the focus on quality and I might just explain that, that chart actually shows on the x-axis, the volume that we produce relative to our competitors in those markets. So you will see in terms of the diamonds, we are right up there with no prices producing a few more carats. But certainly the value per carat that we produce, really doesn't set us apart. And we believe longer term, the real price activity and potential for value sits more in the high-value areas. Of course, diamonds, we think and other operations close, the prognosis for the whole diamond market is very positive, medium  to longer term. But again, we think we are placed very powerfully in the market with that quality mix.
In iron ore, again, a strong player, a strong quality player, we're not the biggest, but we'd like to think that we're heading towards being the best depending on how you measure that. We still got a long way to go, but certainly the improving cost position is improve our margins In PGM's, again, just of being the largest producer, but again, our focus on quality is about discipline, making sure we're driving returns, and certainly if you want to differentiate us, it's about that focus on margin and returns. And again in the met coal, very competitive on the cost, pretty good sized producer, but very much focus on making sure we're at the top end and demanding a product premium for our quality consistent with the value that we're delivering to our customers.
And again, its about this quality focus across the assets and across our products, it's very important, and we is a significant differentiator for us in the future.
And so to summarize our investment proposition, we've got a world-class assets, with attractive and carefully phased growth options. We're building leading capabilities in operations, new technologies and the marketing of our products for value. And our returns are underpinned by ensuring that our focus on capital discipline is maintained irrespective of where products -- product prices are on the day. And we've got to make sure we -- and we're focused with the board that we are delivering consistent returns on capital and of capital to our shareholders.
And with that, happy to take questions."

Broadly when you compare this 2015 I think people seem to forget sometimes that when there is a combination of things in the downstream and the downstream demand we shouldn't forget is still relatively robust. So if you look in the consumer markets, there are different things going on in different markets, there is a reasonable demand, it's not fantastic but it no means awful. For as long as there is downstream demand, the issues that are going on in the mainstream, all things being equal, and us being very careful with volume and price, you would expect them to play themselves out over a period of time. It really depends on consumer demand in the downstream markets and particularly in Q4 and so we will watch those carefully. But as sit here, demand isn't in a bad space. We will be spending money differently, and a bit smarter in the marketing in the second half of the year to try and help down downstream demand.
But I don't think there's any need for us at this point to change the strategy we have."

I think the big issue for us is -- has been the increase, we have seen a 14% increase in electricity prices, that's 3x inflation. Next year is likely to go down to 10%, but I think, we can pencil in higher for the next number of years, and that's also some of the reasons why Tony and myself and the group are working at seeing what else we can do our around solar generation of power ourselves.
But for now, I think we've gone through the winter months without load shedding and I think that was to be expected because we don't do any maintenance or doesn't do any maintenance in the winter periods. So expect when it comes to summer that it might actually get a bit tighter than it feels now, and that's not most folks are thinking about. So I think, Mark, nothing really new.

We'll have some maintenance and sometimes in the second half you will always have some weather disruptions towards the tail end. So if you double the first half, you could do a bit more what we are forecasting. So slightly softer volumes in the second half than  the first and that will translate a little bit into unit cost. So nothing too much to worry about, still a great performance expected. Working capital here went up by $600 million, 2 components, the first was $400 million in receivables I spoke about as good as it gets in terms of an increase because of price and because of Minas-Rio coming back on. The other $200 million was inventory, a little bit copper, PGMs, et cetera, so we would expect some of that to run out in the second half as Chris ramps his refinery up and get those volumes out to market.
And possibly offset if the softness in the diamond market continues all the way through to year-end with a little bit of build of working capital into thes."

Okay on the diamond question, making sure that could I'm always careful about talking about competitors in the diamond space.

Our partner and our shareholder the Botswana government is also very sensitive to the long-term view of the diamond. So we take positions for the long term.
Others sometimes follow, sometimes don't. We don't talk to them. Whether they let others make their judgment. From our point of view it's important we're the leader, we take the positions and what we've done in the last few years seems to have worked reasonably well, although the behavior elsewhere has been mixed.

The other one on a palladium and platinum. I'm going to be very careful here because last time I had palladium bubble. Look if I can say that the palladium price reflects demand and supply and that look, the market has appeared to being shot palladium and we're seeing in that price. Whether switching will occur over time, probably. But then we would see an improvement in the platinum price. The way we think about PGM prices is we look at rhodium being, I guess, the most reactive and the most valued in terms of end use applications, then platinum and then palladium.
And palladium has a very specific application near the engine block in terms of and performance and so it's got specific value in its own right. So it's going to move between the 3. And the thing I have learned in the business from Chris and the guys is that, they don't tend to move all down in. When the market is tough, probably there adjustments.
But we do well if you take an average price across the commodity or across the 3, we do well 900 and above, do extremely well, and at the moment, we're at about 1200 probably a bit higher.

And I just wanted to cover 2 things before I hand over to Mark. I wanted to touch, first of all, within HSE, I want to just touch on safety. Mark will cover this shortly in his presentation, so I won't duplicate. But I do want to share with you that the Board of Anglo American is very engaged in this. We are very clear that it's a journey. It's by no means a job done. There is a lot more to do. And in fact, we're pretty clear now on the things that we have to change to ensure that we continue to improve in this area, build on the improvements we are already making in the underlying measures, but of course, importantly, to eliminate fatalities And as I said, Mark will cover this again quite shortly. 
The second thing to do is simply to update you on board changes. Since we last spoke in this forum, which was the full year results in February. So since then, Jack Thompson, one of our 2 mining nonexecs retired, having term served with 9 years. And we're very pleased to been able to bring in Marcelo Bastos to get us back to 2 miners within our own nonexecs. And Marcelo, of course, is also -- he's Brazilian, but even more importantly, he has extensive mining experience in South America, an increasingly important part of our operations.
Then I don't know if you saw it, but 2 days ago, we announced then some further changes, which is that Nolitha Fakude, steps down from the Board, which is a loss, our South African nonexec director one of them. And -- but I'm pleased to say that, we're not losing her because she is stepping down because she is taking out a full-time executive role in Mark's Senior Executive team, leading down in South Africa.
We're then bringing in 2 new nonexecs, one directly replace Nolitha, and the second also South African to ensure that we sustain our target level, which is that we wish to have 2 South African nonexecs overtime in our board to, again, stress the importance of that part of our operations.
So in that respect, we're bringing on Hixonia Nyasulu and Nonkululeko Nyembezi and they both join in November and January, respectively. So that's enough from me. Thank you. I'll hand over to Mark."

And I would like to acknowledge my colleagues here in the room. And as always, we'll be available after the session for additional questions that you may have. And cer",3529,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thanks for joining us today. And I would like to acknowledge my colleagues here in the room. And as always, we'll be available after the session for additional questions that you may have. And certainly, from my point of view, I encourage you to talk to the guys and hear their version of events.
I'd also like to acknowledge both Ruben and Themba. Themba just on the GMC. So this is his first session. Themba is the CEO of Kumba. So if you've got really tough questions, we'll throw them to Themba. And Ruben has just taken over the copper business from Duncan. And we've had a good performance. Both of them are taking credit for the improving performance in copper at the moment.
So I'm sure when you talk to both of them, you'll get 2 versions of that story. For us, the order of match for today very consistent with what we've done in the past. I'll kick away with an overview of the results. Stephen will pick up the financials and really pull apart the numbers, and help give you a bit of sense of how we got there. And then, I'll add some insights in terms of where to from here. And I think that's an important point to make as we pick up conversations around buyback. If you look back at where we've come from in resetting the business, restructuring the business, there's been a lot of work done, but from our point of view, there is still a lot to do as we look forward, and we believe a lot more improvement potential, and we'll unpack that conversation as we go. And the buyback -- and part of the story around the buyback was obviously about what we think or where we think we are and where we believe we're going. And certainly, I think that's a very important part of the story and for me, probably the most important part of the conversations during the course of today.
So on the results, our financials reflect both good prices, particularly in iron ore and solid cost control across the broader business. And while volumes were down 2%, that maybe was the disappointment. The cost control work was exceptionally good. I'm very pleased with the work that's been done. Obviously, still a lot more to be done. But in the case of inflation and other process, I think that's been incredible. 
As a consequence, our EBITDA margin of 46% is right up there with the best we've ever achieved and certainly right up there with the best in the industry.
So again, it reflects both improving cost control and also improving prices or realized prices on our products. And I think one of the unsung changes in the business and transformation of the business had been the marketing story and we're proud of what Peter and the guys have achieved.
Our dividends reflect the earnings improvement. Obviously, the 40% payout ratio represents $800 million payout to shareholders. And in addition, we're announcing a $1 billion buyback. And again, we'll unpack the logic behind that and I'll leave most of that to Stephen. But from our point of view, I think it's a very clear statement about where we believe we are, the projects in control, we're investing in growth in the future. And certainly from our point of view, the prognosis going forward is we look to continue to improve this pretty solid. And so we felt that it was appropriate and it also reflects the confidence both the board and the executive has in the future of the company.
Free cash flow isn't as good as it might have been given the headline performance. We had about $600 million locked up in working capital. We should see that come out, but again Stephen will give you a much better picture on what that looks like. We have over the course of the 6 months seen some pressures in the diamond market, again, happy to unpack some of those conversations. But the real high point I think for the first half was the performance at Minas-Rio. We've adjusted up the guidance once. We've done it again today, 19 million to 21 million tonnes, really pleased with how the team has come back after the pipeline incident. Obviously, a lot of work done while the pipeline was off and that certainly gave us the running start into those, so very pleased with that work. And our return on capital employed, 22% reflects both improving margins and the continuing discipline that we have on capital allocation and again Stephen will unpack that conversation.
As Stuart flagged, safety critical issue for us. And from our point of view, it remains an absolute focus and our priority item. We reported 3 fatalities in the first 6 months: 1 at Moranbah in Australia, 1 in Los Bronces in Chile, and 1 in Quellaveco in Peru on a concrete track -- supply and concrete to the plant.
Post the results, we've had 2 bus incidents. People commuting from work to home at Collahuasi and near Los Bronces. In our case, we've extended our transportation work -- or we've extended our elimination of fatalities at work into transportation, which includes commuting off-site and with the third-party providers to make sure we pick up that element. Because when we look at the risks across the business, one thing that doesn't get picked up as well as it should be is where we have off-site commutes back to -- and whether it's San Diego. And so we're working with our third-party suppliers and contractors well to make sure that we've got that covered as well.
So that's certainly been very disappointing from our perspective, and it will be included in the [indiscernible] very important piece of work for us as we feel that responsibility not only on-site or within the mine gate, but getting people back home and helping people make sure that their homes are safer as well and that's the responsibility we take very seriously.
On health, again, continuing to improve the operations focusing on making sure where people work are in the right -- is in the right shape and certainly the progress has been significant. We'll continue to focus on that work and on the environment, the improvement in the environmental side reflects the discipline around planning, the discipline around the operations and control of each of our processes. And whilst we are not at 0, we've got to keep improving until we get to that 0 number. And certainly, we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far.
In terms of the environmental side and tailings, we continue to work on tailings and we're going through the process at Minas-Rio obviously but that facility is certainly something very new and a high-level of technical -- a high degree of technical complexity has gone into that design and is certainly a very different design to most of the tailings dams in Brazil. And it's also designed to actually manage water as well. So its actually a water containing facility. So we don't expect problems in terms of the approval, and we're on track to actually get that approval by the end of the year.
In terms of the overall challenge, we went public recently. Feedback's been very positive. We thank people that they have provided us some with -- with feedback. And we're looking at anything we can do to improve. We're working with our colleagues in the industry, particularly in the ICMM and looking at standards more broadly. We're currently operating above the ICMM standards. We have done -- in fact, we created a new set of standards back in '14.
They were used to help define the new standards for the ICMM in '16, and we're continuing to improve our facilities and the management of assets across the group. And I just want to ensure -- assure people that it really does remain a key area of focus for us in the business and very pleased with the progress we've made.
In terms of the operations, we've seen this chart a few times before. Our portfolio work has resulted in us being able to focus on the largest scale, assets and resources that we felt had a lot more potential. And our improvement focus has been around 3 areas: Firstly, we've reconfigured our technical process, and so 70% of the mining operations have been adjusted to mine the orebody more effectively than we were mining and that includes mining methods and process technologies. Our operating model is then helped us to improve the way we plan and execute work. And so we've certainly improved our consistency. We're not at where we want to be. But in terms of where we were, we're at least 20% better than where we were, and in fact each operating asset has improved 30% in the last 5 years. That's on average across the assets we have in the portfolio to date.
And we are now working on the technical and innovation platform across resource right through to delivering product to market. And Tony is here, again, to dive through any questions about progress. I'll touch a few points, but if you like a little more detail Tony sure will certainly be happy to answer a few questions. 
We have delivered, as I said, 30% more production from each asset. And more importantly, in terms of driving margins we dropped our operating cost by around 45% in real terms, were 27% normally since 2012. And so that transformation has been absolutely key in supporting our improvement in EBITDA margins or 46% EBITDA margins. And again going with the work that the marketing teams has done has certainly underpinned our improvement in margins across the business.
Now in terms of measuring that performance across the industry and in particularly talking about competitive position, we've improved -- since the last time you saw this chart we've gone from the 37% on average, that's cost position across our assets to the 36th percentile 
On balance sheet, while we're not the lowest number, we'd like to think that our debt is in a good place and that the way we think about the balance sheet and investing in growth and investing in returns to shareholders, the approach is a balanced approach. And I'm stealing Stephen's word there. I think it's a great word and I know he will unpack that a little bit more in his presentation.
And on looking forward, our suite of high quality growth options, most of those assets have EBITDA margins better than 50%. And so from our point of view, that's really important as we continue to grow the business through investment in those quality growth options. And so we think over the next 3 to 5 years, it really is an exciting time as we grow top line performance by around 20% to 25% and at the same time, we drive ourselves towards a 50% EBITDA margin and 46%. We're a little bit further ahead than we thought we'd be, but of course, iron ore has helped us get there. So pleased with where we stand and how we've positioned ourselves.
When we talk about the transformation, we talk about FutureSmart mining and the changes we've made. We do like to make the point, and I think it's very important that it's all connected to being part of our sustainability work. So the work that we're doing to reduce energy consumption, water consumption, improve our physical footprint is all about improving the business and returns, which is absolutely consistent with creating a more sustainable operation. And whether you're talking enviromental health, safety, social partnerships, they're all part of -- we saw in a lot conversations and obviously, having a much more competitive cost position is also about sustainability. So for us, our material -- or our organic improvement is built on the 3 key short-term foundations. Obviously, with the quality of the assets we have provides us with the raw materials to shape the business over the longer term and position ourselves for continuing performance improvement and growth. Our P101 program, actually, builds off the implementation of the operating model. So we've put the operating model in.
we've improved our competitive position, but every one of us, when looking at each other in the eyes, we're not yet best practice. The real drive from here is to get each part of the business to operating best practice. Now that doesn't mean every one of your processes get to that position because there are a critical points in the process that we need to be at the top to ensure that we've got best performance across the business. And so that's important for us. And the operating model and the work around the operating model has provided the platform for that next set of conversation. 
So every one of our operators knows what they have to achieve to get the best-in-class on a shovel, a truck, loaders and the plants right across the business.  And that's really generating a buzz and a conversation about how do we get there and how do we help each other get there. And the second part, the technical change. So when we talked about mining method changes and configuration changes, in taking that to it's logical next step, Tony and the team have been talking about changing the footprint, reducing energy consumption by 30%, reducing water consumption by 50%, all of those technologies and those different approaches, come off the base that we've created that is we're mining the orebodies, in our view, the best way in terms of managing short-term, medium-term and longer-term returns and looking for the right technologies to hit those critical points that improves our performance and continues to improve both the recovery of the resources, the cost position on those resources, and we've  positioned assets for the long term. Because when we look at cut-off grades and those sorts of things, we're trying to think about squaring up those 3 dimensions, short, medium and longer term and getting the best out of our assets. And I think the continuity that we've been able to achieve in our operations speaks to try to get that balance right.
On FutureSmart mining specifically, we look at the program right through the value chain, concentrated mine is around getting the mining methods right, mining the ore and only the ore and driving the process or driving the ore through the process at the highest grade possible so making sure that we're not wasting money on mining waste or processing waste through the system and that's a critical part of the process. And we've got our first ore sorter currently being commissioned at El Soldado and so far the results look pretty good.
In the Waterless Mine, we're looking at various elements of the process, being able to coarse a grind. And I talked about last time, so I won't go back through that, that's part of the process. Modern Mine is around the systems we're building and the operating model provides a very different base for us to look at, think about plan and execute work in the operation. And so from our point of view, the operating model provides the starting point. It's really an industrial model applied to the operation. And we take every person through the business. And it takes us 18 months to transform an operation from a standing start to having a very different mentality about the operation. And what I'll say it is hard work, it takes time, someplace it takes a bit longer and some places where you're working on a number of fronts, you might have some places come back a bit. And it's important and it helps us identify where that's occurring quickly, so we can go back and then address it. I think there was a good at kumba where we said we had a bit of problem with operating equipment, but Themba and the team identified the issue early. And the fact that you've got those processes in place helps you identify those sort of issues, then the reaction time is much shorter, and you're able to pull the operation up back much quicker. I think Themba did a good job explaining that in the result -- his results presentation a few days back.
And finally, on the Intelligent Mine, thinking about what we do in a very different way. Our industry, in my experience, has not been good with data, and data literacy has been fairly poor, even though we're in an industry that's a Big Data for a long period of time. And the work on understanding that data and understanding how to apply that data and working the critical pinch points and control points and opportunity points across the business are very different.
It also has gone to another level with the development of different algorithms and diagnostics across the industry. It tells us that we think the changes or the possible are much more significant that most people understand. And so we've really pushed hard into this part of the business and again, it connects to everything else that we've been doing from basically getting a better understanding of geology, the mining opportunities, the mining methods and the application of new technologies to these operations, which we think is absolutely critical, and we've been investing in this for 5 years.
So it's not we woke up last week, and said this might be a good idea. When we started to transform the business, we were investing in this thinking, 5 and 6 years ago, and we're starting to see the benefits in terms of what we believe we can achieve going forward.
I thought this is a very simple graphic. The small truck, 1,900 today, where we're actually mining or spending 16x the amount of energy, double the amount of water, about 8x the amount of ground to actually produce a pound of copper. And the trucks keep getting -- then clearly the benefits of scale have been through cost performance, but we think we're getting to not the limits, but the curve is starting to flatten off. And the opportunities to think very differently about mining using all of the tools I've just talked about is significant. And we've been a significant investor over the last 5 years in that whole thinking process. Tony has been the leader with the operating CEOs and they worked with partners in working out how those technologies can be applied in these businesses. And I think over the next 3 to 4 years the transformation in the business is going to be just as significant as the transformation we've seen in the last 3 or 4 years. And I think that's the point we were making about -- we're thinking about where we're going as a company when we look at what we should do with shareholder returns and investment in the future and getting that balance right.
Again, sustainability. I've talked to the 3 elements. I won't go back through that, but I think it's important to make the point that we connect them, and they are interconnected for us. It's all about the same conversation, and we look at both sides of that equation in everything we're doing. And again, we've been doing that for a number of years. And I think, the benefits are coming through both in the terms of the results, the relationships we have with our core stakeholders across the business, local communities, lot more to be done. But again, I think Quellaveco,is a good example of doing the right work in the community and what can be a fairly complex, social environment. And certainly I think the way Tom and the guys are handling the work in Quellaveco,has really gone well. And certainly, the feedback from the government has been exceptional.
Finally, before I hand across to Stephen, pretty simple story. 2012, 30% EBITDA margin has been an important piece for us reflecting production and the nature of the production. We've continued to grow the business. We're now at a 46% EBITDA, so an 8% production improvement won't drive that type of improvement in EBITDA because the price comparison, the price of today are actually lower still when we did these numbers.
It's been all about the transformation in the portfolio and the drive in the operating cost side. And for us, with the projects we have in place, we can see growth up to that 135 of the 100 base in 2012. And we believe, on the current prices, we can deliver a 50% margin. The 45% margin is on long-term prices. And so that's the difference that we saw. Well, that's the explanation of the range that we've shown.
So I think with that, I'll hand across to Stephen, and he can really unpack the detail behind the numbers. There we have Stephen."

As I talked through some of the numbers this morning, I really wanted to touch on 3 key themes and it sort of flows on some of the topics that Mark was talking about. So firstly, consistent delivery of the numbers is really derived from consistent delivery from the operations. And that's underpinned by the operating model and that relent focus on productivities Mark has spoken about.
Secondly, the increasing margin driven by the relentless focus on productivity and also our prices. This half have really flowed in to our improvement in our relative cost position. And thirdly, then is the disciplined use of cash. I'll try not to overuse this word this morning, but balance is my word of the reporting season. It's about how we think about that balance between the balance sheet, the capital and the way we invest in the business and returns to shareholders. And if we get that cycle right now, it allows us to set up for that next wave of growth and cash flow and investment and returns.
But obviously, the big news for this morning is the return to shareholders. So the buyback of up to USD 1 billion consistent with those 3 themes that I have, in fact, just spoken about and how we're thinking about that use and allocation of the discretionary cash flow that we generate.
And then the base dividend. 40% payout ratio, USD 0.62 per share and I'll talk to both of those components in a few slides' time.
So the numbers themselves, EBITDA $5.5 billion, earnings per share, $1.58. As Mark mentioned, the best half we've had since 2011. Free cash flow of $1.6 billion, a slight build in working capital, as we've noted in the results. If ever there was a good build in working capital from a finance director's point of view, the majority of it is this and it's in receivables because we've had increasing prices, which obviously flows through the cash flow and the return of Minas-Rio have also led to some of that build in working capital so to say. If ever there was a good build, this would have to be it.
CapEx, as usual, half 1, half 2 split and obviously then in terms of using the Mitsubishi cash we had on hand. Coming into the second half, we'll find their portion. Importantly, guidance for the year on CapEx is maintained.
And finally, effective tax rate. I know it causes you a few issues in terms of getting to your EPS and dividend number, apologies, but it really is the mix of results across the businesses that drives that to some extent. And in particular this 6 months is the return of Minas-Rio strongly in a higher iron ore price environment has meant we've been able to utilize some of those past tax losses that we've accumulated from those operation. So that's really driven us down to that 30% and our guidance going forward is 29% to 31%.
Okay. Mark often talks about the number of assets that we have in the business. I suppose another way to think about that it is, yes, we have 34 assets, but we're currently organized around 4 simple business units. Big increase in Bulks obviously driven by return of Minas-Rio on prices, PGMs nice to see [indiscernible] coming back to give us a little bit of a hand. Copper, continued great work in terms of both volumes and cost. And diamonds, even though we have seen softness in the market, particularly from quarter 2 onwards still contributes over $0.5 billions to the group result.
In each case and to pick up a big theme of Mark's, driving very healthy margins in each of those 4 business units. So as we worked through the underlying numbers period on period so as we say $5.5 billion, up 19% from the prior year. Price, largely driven by iron ore price, 62% averaged around $91 a tonne, that translates to us from a realized CFR price of about $118 a tonne, really driven by quality grade and lump product offsetting that some price weakness in thermal coal.
This period we've had a little bit of a turnaround in terms of a positive impact across FX and CPI. So currencies generally moved in our favor, offsetting about a 200 negative movement in CPI and inflation costs. As you look across the combination of currency, the impact of inflation, the Minas-Rio recovery and the cost and volume changes we've had for the period, it's a net positive when you add all of those things up and that translates to that relative improvement in our cost position across the portfolio.
As we come into half 2, some real momentum with Kumba, met coal, Minas-Rio and copper, all from a production point of view and looking to recover some of that shortfall that you saw in our quarterly that we had -- that we released the other day. As we look at cost and volume going forward, it's not always an even flow half to half, so you recall last year, we had a very strong first half and then slightly flat second half. At this time around, we're actually anticipating to see the reverse with the momentum that we have a fairly flat first half and some good momentum into the second.
If we then turn to the balance sheet, again, very consistent messages every time I get up here around the balance sheet, and that's not going to change today and it's not going to change as we go forward. So net debt, effectively flat. We had the accounting standard adjustment for operating leases, opening adjustment of 500 and then another 100 added during the 6 months mainly around shipping -- normal shipping contracts, so fairly flat period-to-period. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA, 0.3x, again, a very healthy position to take the business forward. And net gearing, which really goes to the underlying strength of the balance sheet in terms of debt to balance sheet, a very healthy 10%.
So return to shareholders. We are committed to the payout ratio. We're committed to the 40% payout ratio and that has resulted in the quite substantial increase in dividends per share for the half, again, a direct reflection of the improvement into the underlying earnings [ at ] 27 percentile.
That compares to $1 for the full year from last year, so a very good start assuming we continue with the performance, and that's roughly around a 5% yield. 
In terms of the buyback, it really is consistent with our capital allocation policy and I'll touch on the wheel that we normally talk to in a moment. And as we work through that allocation of discretionary cash flow, it reflects a confidence in our balance sheet, confidence in our near- and medium-term growth and again that balance that we have as we think about where we're taking the business today and as we go forward.
We also thought about the balance of returns to shareholders. And here, we recognize different shareholders have different preferences. But to date leading up to today and including then today's 40% buyback, that would represent $3.4 billion of dividends, and now with a buyback -- $1 billion of buybacks, so in total $4.4 billion since we started -- we restarted the dividend back in '17. So it's an 80-20 split. Again, its about balance.
Going forward, please put in your spreadsheets 40% payout policy. We will continue with that policy. I know we perhaps surprised some of you given my absolute and resolute sticking to the 40% guidance. But it's okay to reassess those things from time to time, and we will reassess those things from time to time as we go forward as well. We will always consider how we allocate the cash flow.
So how have we done? Let's look at the scorecard in terms of our capital allocation and cash flow. So $1.6 billion of sustaining cash flow, 40% dividend last year. With $700 million this year, it's $800 million, and pleased where we are from a balance sheet point of view. And you can see we're starting to allocate cash to some of the discretionary items, whether that be some smaller growth -- brownfield growth projects. Quellaveco, as I say, we will start to see our proportionate funding come through this year; and then obviously, the share buyback, which will flow between now and early next year.
So back in February, we tried to give you some really good forward information around capital spend and where we saw the capital spend journey -- our journey going. As you noted then and as you can see today, we see it peaking up a little bit through '20 and '21, and I would anticipate as we move to '21, we'll be towards the top end of that range. And that's a combination of the sustaining CapEx that we have clearly flagged; and the productivity gains and extra volumes that we will see; the Brownfield approvals, which I will touch on shortly; and then the investment in innovation and technology; and obviously, Quellaveco. 
You recall at the full year, I presented a capital efficiency slide, and nothing really has changed in that. So we're still tracking at the moment to sort of 20% to 30% capital efficiency. And if you recall, that reflects exactly the same 20% to 30% operating efficiency that we're are seeing through the operating sides of the business. You will see that fluctuate a little bit from time to time. Remember, I spoke about while it's okay for the absolute number of sustaining CapEx to go up provided on a copper-equivalent per time basis, we're spending that money more efficiently, that's exactly what we're still seeing. But as some of the businesses go through ramp-up and volume improvements, a good example is Moranbah-Grosvenor, we're seeing increased productivity rates, which means we need to step forward a little bit quicker in terms of the degassing and mine development and setting up for the next long hauls. So a good reason why that's increasing. It's driving really high-margin growth returns even though the absolute number creeps up by 0.1 or 0.2 across that time frame.
Looking at some of the options that we have across the portfolio. And as far as -- it's lovely to see that we've got a nice list in front of us and we own these options. Again, we flagged this last year and we're going to got to keep you informed in terms of how this unfolds going forward. So we can tick another one off. 
In May, we approved the marine vessel in Namibia for the Debmarine operations. And we've been being talking about the Moranbah-Grosvenor expansion, that's likely to come through, through the first half of next year, I would anticipate at this stage. With some of the improvements in the bottlenecking work that we have seen already, we are already seeing, let's call it, some of the volume benefits we thought we would have seen in the next CapEx program already coming forward to today. So we'll just feed that into the studies and see how that flows out. And probably, some of the next things you'd see would be some of the technology and innovation perhaps showing itself a little more obviously to you as we invest through that '19 and '20 period. And then you'll see some of those benefits flow out through the '21 and '22 period as it works its way through the production systems and into underlying EBITDA.
What we will guarantee is that we'll keep you posted on those things. These things will be very visible to you as we go through. They will only be approved over time and take full account with markets, balance sheet, cash flows and circumstances of the day. And we'll keep you posted through that time frame.
So just coming back to our cost and volume improvement targets. So we are targeting $400 million for this year, originally $500 million, so we have just softened that a little bit with the softness in the market that we're seeing in diamonds in particular. Yes, we're not prepared to give up on that $400 million. It will be perhaps challenging, but we have a number of initiatives building up to that and through that we will be working very hard to deliver through the year.
On the basis that we've achieve that, that will take our cost and volume benefit from this $3 billion to $4 billion to $800 million. And if you recall in that bottom section there, the operating model and sort of productivity improvements we'd flagged a $1 billion to $1.5 billion in that bucket. So over time, and we said that, that would probably be more front-end loaded than the other categories, that's what we're seeing. And we're starting to move towards that target over the next year or 2.
As I said earlier, the technology and innovation, it will seem a little more back-ended. And so we would expect to see some of those benefits flow through in that '21 and '22 period. And then obviously, there's the growth projects as well, very much a mix of the brownfields in the nearer term and then the delivery of Quellaveco towards the end of '21, '22. So those things should flow again nicely and quite visibly through the results over time. 
So very much reconfirming our target of $3 billion to $4 billion between now and the end of 2022, and you should expect to see progressive delivery against that through that time frame.
So just to wrap up for me. Where are we and where we do want to be? Obviously, growth, highly competitive and market-leading. In particular, what we're delivering adds to the margin story that Mark spoke about, underpinned by disciplined allocation of cash flow and from a strong balance sheet position. But what we do have, I suppose, is a real commitment in terms of getting the balance of these things right, whether that be around balance sheet, returns to shareholders or delivering and investing in the future of the company. 
Thank you."

Obviously, the G-word is something we're very sensitive to. And when we talk about growth, we are very specific and we try and make sure that in the business, people understand the conversation the right way given the history of the industry. The focus on quality is absolutely critical. And from our point of view, we do look at our markets. We look at the response. We test our projects against the impact we would have on those markets. That's very important to us. And we look at the absolute margin we expect to achieve after adjusting for those changes. And so it's all about quality. And as I said, almost all of those projects, we've got a better than 50% margin at long-term prices.
Driving margins is about making sure the quality is here, and if you've got a quality project, you'll get the margins, and also how we place product into the markets. And our focus on quality, which I'll pick up towards the end of the presentation, is something that we think is absolutely critical as the world evolves across mining, and then making sure that the capital discipline is right and that we've worked the projects to their potential is also important in making sure we do better than that 20% threshold return on capital employed that we've set ourselves through the cycle. And so all those pieces come together to put us into what I think is a very balanced position about what then it should look like across the business.
In terms of what we've seen in the last 6 months and to talk to the things that will continue to improve the quality of our performance and margins. 
Minas-Rio has had a very strong ramp-up in the first 6 months, as we said. We have adjusted the guidance a couple of times now, and we're very pleased with where we are in terms of the tailings program. Yes, tailings is a sensitive word in Brazil at the moment, but again, I think the technological differences we have in the dam set us apart. And by the way, the next lift is no different to the approval process that everyone else in the industry has to go through to get their next [indiscernible] tailings lift. That's part of the process in Brazil. So we're not in a unique cycle today. We're now in a normal operating process. So I think that point has to be made pretty strongly, and it is a little bit different to where we've come from in terms of our processes. So again, based on everything we've done so far, we think year-end is certainly the right expectation given the conversation. And we certainly got a lot of support from the government and the authorities in those prices.
And by the way, one thing we should remind people is we got our Step 3 license 6 months earlier than we forecast. That was a license we got in December which allowed us to open the footprint, and that's also been part of why we've done much better in the first 6 months because we've been able to blend product and get better throughputs  for the plant. So that approval is very important, and I think that's also a measure of the nature of the relationship we've built with the authorities in Brazil. So I certainly don't see the risk around that as some have been talking to it more broadly. Certainly very comfortable and very happy with where the guys are. 
In terms of projects. Quellaveco, on track. Very pleased with the progress that's been made. And certainly, from our point of view, Themba and the team have done a great job. Most complex part of the business is obviously around the social dimensions, and I think, again, the guys have done good work there. We've mobilized all the major work areas. We're pouring concrete. And certainly, the progress has been very good.
We've ordered the new ship. It's on its way. Bruce and the guys are very excited. For us, this is a really special bit of gear. Obviously technically, it's very different, but also it mines our highest-value diamonds on a per carat basis. And they're not large, but they're very high-quality, smaller diamonds, but a real good part of the business. Again, pretty rapid payback. So a good project. 
And Aquila, following Grasstree. Good piece of work. And the guys in Queensland have done a great job in the business. Again, I think Moranbah has won 5 years Best Coal Mine in Australia and also Best Mine in Australia a couple of times as well. And all of the learnings from Moranbah, Grasstree, Grosvenor will go into or gone into the design of Aquilla. So from our point of view, a good shape on the project site, and again, supporting the quality growth story that Stephen talked to.
On positioning for the future, we would argue that our portfolio is quite unique in the industry. And we would hope that shareholders and prospective shareholders, in particular, can see that the exposure you get to Anglo American is very different to other peers in the industry. And we hope that the one thing that really is coming through is that diversity, as a consequence of the quality of the assets, is certainly a differentiating factor, one that we want to push for in time.
In diamonds, we've got the ultimate luxury consumer product. With the growing middle class and shrinking industry resource and production base, our global leadership position through De Beers is exceptional. And as we say, De Beers isn't really a diamond company. It's a brand that is an industry icon that really means the very best in diamonds. And when you look at our revenue per carat, and I'll show a little bit later, it's the best in the industry. We're proud of that position. And certainly, the industry is going through a bit of tough time. There's been a confluence of certain issues. From our point of view, we think that's not a structural change. 
And with the work on Lightbox, I think we're very pleased with the market's reaction to the product, 3 million to 5 million carats, very small compared to the global diamond production of 143 million carats, so not really a factor. And the fact that the pricing is more akin to other lower-value products has really pleased us in terms of the response of the market.
As the world becomes greener, accommodating 9 billion people will need energy and other industrial solutions that will drive significant growth in copper, nickel, manganese and PGMs unlike we've ever seen. And as the circular economy starts to impact sourcing of bulk commodities in various forms, our focus on quality coal and quality iron ore is, again, a differentiator in a market that will go through significant change over the next 5 to 10 years. And we've been thinking about how we position our business in where we are today, where we will be in 5 years and where we will be in 10 years, and we think those changes will play into our hands in terms of the focus on quality, both through Kumba, 64.5% lump premium; Minas-Rio, 67%, again, unique assets in the world or the bulk worlds. And certainly, we think we're well positioned there.
And for us, if you look at our performance, and I think we've got this in the appendix, Paul, we've improved our relative margin cost position for mid-Q3 to mid-Q2 off the back of improving costs at Kumba, the good production performance at Minas-Rio and the improvement in price premiums that we've received for our products. And Peter and guys are doing good work along with the operators in making sure that we're delivering the right product consistently into the market, and we're going to keep trying to drive that position to the left across the portfolio. 
There's always a debate about macro trends. And we're having the debates, as you'd expect, and trying to think about how we position out business in those trends. Again, we think the focus on quality, and in particular margins, are going to the absolutely critical. It's the best way to insulate yourself from things that you might not understand or might not anticipate.
The way we look at things, again, changes in the population, that 9 billion population will look very different as well in terms of urbanization. The last few years, we've seen 1.4 billion people move to cities and there's another -- there will be another 1.4 billion moved to cities over the next 18 years. So from that point of view, we look at demographics, aging population, the urbanization, the rise of the middle class, climate change, carbon reduction, the rise of renewables, transportation fuels and the circular economy -- and that includes recycling, and that will increase particularly across bulks through the recycling of steel, high-quality primary feeds, new business models. 50% of our portfolio by production consists of greener and consumer-facing commodities, and I think that's a unique mix in our industry. And it's one that we think, from a strategic point of view, will play out in more conversations around our sector.
And the environmental benefits that we had in the portfolio and the research work that we're doing through the R&D programs we have across precious metals are going to be very important. And certainly now, with people talking about platinum, palladium being used in lithium batteries, they are important developments and developments we're at the forefront of with other players, investing and making sure that we create opportunities for our product. And certainly, Chris is well up to speed in driving many of those changes through his leadership in the Platinum Guild and other of the consumer-facing entities that we work with in the PGM space.
So for us, we think strategically about the commodity mix and we think tactically in terms of making sure we got the best operations, and we are building a business that is resilient for the long term. It's a unique product mix. It's a high-quality product mix. And it's one we're going to keep improving and growing as we go forward.
In terms of the focus on quality, and I might just explain that the chart actually shows, on the x-axis, the volume that we produce relative to our competitors in those markets. So you'll see in terms of diamonds, we are right up there with -- and no prices for guessing who's up there. That's ALROSA producing few more carats. But certainly, the value per carat that we produce really does set us apart. And we believe, longer term, the real price activity and potential for value sits more in the high-value areas. Of course, diamonds, we think, as [indiscernible] and other operations close, the prognosis for the whole diamond market is very positive medium to longer term. But again, we think we're placed very powerfully in the market with that quality mix.
In iron ore, again, a strong player -- a strong quality player. We're not the biggest, but we'd like to think that we're heading towards being the best depending on how you measure that. We've still got a long way to go, but certainly, the improving cost position has helped improved our margins. 
In PGMs, again, just of being the largest producer -- but again, our focus on quality is about discipline, making sure we're driving returns. And certainly, if you want to differentiate us, it's around that focus on margin and returns. 
And again in the met coal, very competitive on the cost, pretty good-sized producer, but very much focused on making sure we're at the top end and demanding a product premium for our quality, consistent with the value that we're delivering to our customers. And again, it's about this quality focus across the assets and across our products. It's very important and we think is a significant differentiator for us in the future.
And so to summarize our investment proposition. We've got world-class assets with attractive and carefully phased growth options. We are building leading capabilities in operations, new technologies and the marketing of our products for value. And our returns are underpinned by ensuring that our focus on capital discipline is maintained, irrespective of where products are -- product prices are on the day. And we've got to make sure that we -- and we're focused with the Board that we're delivering consistent returns on capital and of capital to our shareholders.
And with that, happy to take questions."

And obviously, we'll use the $1 billion in terms of the buyback. So you'll see a significant stepdown. Lovely problem to have before you're in it again. Then we consider things. 
We do have reasonable capital. We've got Venetia underground running at the moment in South Africa. Chris and the team are working through options with Mogalakwena, and while they're a little while away, that does factor into our thinking as we look forward as well."

But from our point of view, we are talking to adjust transition, so making sure that we're working with stakeholders. So the average life of their assets is 13 years, and that's South Africa. Our history has been as we get towards or get closer to a life, we have in the past dealt differently with those assets.

But certainly, we're in a process looking to continue to improve the business, but longer term, it will be less prominent in our portfolio. 
We haven't made a final call on where we will go, but certainly pretty clear where we're working ourselves towards given the shorter life of those assets. So we're extending the life, as you would expect. But at the same time, longer term, it's likely others will loan the assets.

As long as there is downstream demand, the issues that are going on in the midstream, all things being equal and us being very careful with volume and price, you would expect them to play themselves out over a period of time. It really depends on consumer demand in the downstream markets, particularly in Q4. And so we'll watch those carefully. But as we sit here, demand isn't in a bad space. We'll be spending money differently and a bit smarter in marketing in the second half of the year to try and help down downstream demand, but I don't think there's any need for us at this point to change the strategy we have."

I think we managed mostly to get through that without losing mine production. Most of the refined production has been pushed into the second half of this year, so I think we should still get most of that production this year.
I think the big issue for us is -- has been the increase. We've seen a 14% increase in electricity prices. That's 3x inflation. Next year, it's likely to go down to 10%, but I think we can pencil in higher Eskom prices for the next number of years. And that's also some of the reasons why Tony and myself and the group are working at seeing what else we can do our around solar generation of power ourselves. But for now, I think we've gone through the winter months without load shedding. And I think that was to be expected because we don't do any maintenance -- or Eskom doesn't do any maintenance in the winter periods. So expect as it comes to summer that it might actually get a bit tighter than it feels now, and that's not most what folk are thinking about. 
So I think, Mark, nothing really new. Prices are high or the charges are high. We're all managing as best we can. We're all engaging -- and one of the things also, I think, that we participate as Anglo American is in the technical assistance to Eskom. So we put in place a team to go help -- a technical team to help Eskom just to go through all of their assets. That was only ever meant to be feedback to Eskom. So we don't really have the kind of feedback that we would like, but that feedback has gone into Eskom, and I think Anglo American has played a big role in that regard."

And Chris has got more flexibility because he's also got downstream processes, both a number of smelters and refineries. So he's able to work across the process and his assets are less exposed. So if you've got an underground operation, ventilation would be 40%. Energy would be 40% -- sorry, ventilation is 40% of the energy consumption. And it's 24 hours a day. So I think we are structurally advantaged because of where and how we set the operations up. Some of that's by luck. Some of that's by design. And as well as that, Chris, Tony and the team are working on solar options and a whole range of renewable-type strategies that will reduce our dependence on time, on Eskom as well.

So if you double our first half, you'd get a bit more what we're forecasting. So slightly softer volumes in the second half than one -- the first, and that will translate a little bit into unit cost. So nothing too much to worry about. Still a great performance expected. 
Working capital, here, it went up by $600 million. Two components. The first was $400 million in receivables that I spoke about as good as it gets in terms of an increase because of price and because of Minas-Rio coming back on. The other $200 million was inventory and a little bit copper, PGMs, et cetera.

I'm always careful about talking about competitors in the diamond space. Look, from our point of view, on a value basis, we are the largest player in the diamond market. And we make judgments against what we see in the market and we take cognizance of that. Our partner and our shareholder, the Botswana Government, is also very sensitive to the long-term view of diamond. So we take care of positions for the long term. Others sometimes follow, sometimes don't. We don't talk to them. Whether they're pulling their own weight, let others make that judgment. From our point of view, it's important we're the leader. We take the positions. And what we've done in the last few years seems to have worked reasonably well, although the behavior elsewhere has been mixed. And we don't assume that it will be any different looking forward.
The other one, on palladium and platinum, I'm going to be very careful here because the last time I opened my mouth on palladium, [indiscernible] have bubbled. Look, if I can say that the palladium price reflects demand and supply and that -- look, the market has appeared to have been short of palladium and we're seeing in that price. Will the switching will occur over time? Probably. But then we would see an improvement in the platinum price. The way we think about PGM prices is we look at rhodium being, I guess, the most reactive and the most valued in terms of end-use applications, then platinum and then palladium. And palladium has a very specific application nearer the engine block in terms of speed and performance, and so it's got specific value in its own right. 
So it's going to move between the 3. And the thing I've learned in the business from Chris and the guys is that, they don't tend to move all down in one sway. When the market's tough, you might get that. Well, there will probably be adjustments. But we do well -- if you take an average price across the commodity -- or across the 3, we do well $900 and above to extremely well. And at the moment, we're at about $1,200 on the balance, but it's even probably a bit higher. And it's not going to swing away too far from that anytime soon.

We're pleased with progress, but still a lot more to be done and a lot more improvement be had. Thank you."

My name is Stuart Chambers, Chairman of Anglo American. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our 2019 half year results presentation. And I just wanted to cover 2 things before I hand over to Mark. I wanted to touch, first of all,",421,"So good morning, everyone. My name is Stuart Chambers, Chairman of Anglo American. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our 2019 half year results presentation. And I just wanted to cover 2 things before I hand over to Mark. I wanted to touch, first of all, within HSE, I want to just touch on safety. Mark will cover this shortly in his presentation, so I won't duplicate. But I do want to share with you that the Board of Anglo American is very engaged in this. We are very clear that it's a journey. It's by no means a job done. There is a lot more to do. And in fact, we're pretty clear now on the things that we have to change to ensure that we continue to improve in this area, build on the improvements we are already making in the underlying measures, but of course, importantly, to eliminate fatalities. And as I said, Mark will cover this again quite shortly. 
The second thing to do is simply to update you on board changes. Since we last spoke in this forum, which was the full year results in February. So since then, Jack Thompson, one of our 2 mining nonexecs retired, having term served with 9 years. And we're very pleased to been able to bring in Marcelo Bastos to get us back to 2 miners within our own nonexecs. And Marcelo, of course, is also -- he's Brazilian, but even more importantly, he has extensive mining experience in South America, an increasingly important part of our operations.
Then I don't know if you saw it, but 2 days ago, we announced then some further changes, which is that Nolitha Fakude, steps down from the Board, which is a loss, our South African nonexec director one of them. And -- but I'm pleased to say that, we're not losing her because she is stepping down because she is taking up a full-time executive role in Mark's Senior Executive team, leading down in South Africa.
We're then bringing in 2 new nonexecs, one directly replace Nolitha, and the second also South African to ensure that we sustain our target level, which is that we wish to have 2 South African nonexecs overtime in our Board to, again, stress the importance of that part of our operations.
So in that respect, we're bringing on Hixonia Nyasulu and Nonkululeko Nyembezi and they both join in November and January, respectively. So that's enough from me. Thank you. I'll hand over to Mark."
409115,630192747,1781277,"Anglo American plc, H1 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thanks for joining us today. And I would like to acknowledge my colleagues here in the room. And as always, we'll be available after the session for additional questions that you may have. And cer",3533,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thanks for joining us today. And I would like to acknowledge my colleagues here in the room. And as always, we'll be available after the session for additional questions that you may have. And certainly, from my point of view, I encourage you to talk to the guys and hear their version of events.
I'd also like to acknowledge both Ruben and Themba. Themba just on the GMC. So this is his first session. Themba is the CEO of Kumba. So if you've got really tough questions, we'll throw them to Themba. And Ruben has just taken over the copper business from Duncan. And we've had a good performance. Both of them are taking credit for the improving performance in copper at the moment.
So I'm sure when you talk to both of them, you'll get 2 versions of that story. For us, the order of march for today very consistent with what we've done in the past. I'll kick away with an overview of the results. Stephen will pick up the financials and really pull apart the numbers, and help give you a bit of sense of how we got there. And then, I'll add some insights in terms of where to from here. And I think that's an important point to make as we pick up conversations around buyback. If you look back at where we've come from in resetting the business, restructuring the business, there's been a lot of work done, but from our point of view, there is still a lot to do as we look forward, and we believe a lot more improvement potential, and we'll unpack that conversation as we go. And the buyback -- and part of the story around the buyback was obviously about what we think or where we think we are and where we believe we're going. And certainly, I think that's a very important part of the story and for me, probably the most important part of the conversations during the course of today.
So on the results, our financials reflect both good prices, particularly in iron ore and solid cost control across the broader business. And while volumes were down 2%, that for me was the disappointment, the cost control work was exceptionally good. I'm very pleased with the work that's been done. Obviously, still a lot more to be done. But in the case of inflation and other pressures, I think that's been credible. 
As a consequence, our EBITDA margin of 46% is right up there with the best we've ever achieved and certainly right up there with the best in the industry.
So again, it reflects both improving cost control and also improving prices or realized prices on our products. And I think one of the unsung changes in the business and transformation of the business had been the marketing story and we're proud of what Peter and the guys have achieved.
Our dividends reflect the earnings improvement. Obviously, the 40% payout ratio represents $800 million payout to shareholders. And in addition, we're announcing a $1 billion buyback. And again, we'll unpack the logic behind that and I'll leave most of that to Stephen. But from our point of view, I think it's a very clear statement about where we believe we are, the projects in control, we're investing in growth in the future. And certainly from our point of view, the prognosis going forward is we look to continue to improve this pretty solid. And so we felt that it was appropriate and it also reflects the confidence both the Board and the executive has in the future of the company.
Free cash flow isn't as good as it might have been given the headline performance. We had about $600 million locked up in working capital. We should see that come out, but again Stephen will give you a much better picture on what that looks like. We have over the course of the 6 months seen some pressures in the diamond market, again, happy to unpack some of those conversations. But the real high point I think for the first half was the performance at Minas-Rio. We've adjusted up the guidance once. We've done it again today, 19 million to 21 million tonnes, really pleased with how the team has come back after the pipeline incident. Obviously, a lot of work done while the pipeline was off and that certainly gave us the running start into the year, so very pleased with that work. And our return on capital employed, 22% reflects both improving margins and the continuing discipline that we have on capital allocation and again Stephen will unpack that conversation.
As Stuart flagged, safety critical issue for us. And from our point of view, it remains an absolute focus and our priority item. We reported 3 fatalities in the first 6 months: 1 at Moranbah in Australia, 1 in Los Bronces in Chile, and 1 in Quellaveco in Peru on a concrete truck supplying concrete to the plant.
Post the results, we've had 2 bus incidents. People commuting from work to home at Collahuasi and near Los Bronces. In our case, we've extended our transportation work -- or we've extended our elimination of fatalities work into transportation, which includes commuting off-site and with the third-party providers to make sure we pick up that element. Because when we look at the risks across the business, one thing that doesn't get picked up as well as it should be is where we have off-site commutes back to -- and whether it's San Diego. And so we're working with our third-party suppliers and contractors well to make sure that we've got that covered as well.
So that's certainly been very disappointing from our perspective, and it will be included in the [ EOF-2 ] work and is a very important piece of work for us as we feel that responsibility not only on-site or within the mine gate, but getting people back home and helping people make sure that their homes are safer as well and that's the responsibility we take very seriously.
On health, again, continuing to improve the operations focusing on making sure where people work are in the right -- is in the right shape and certainly the progress has been significant. We'll continue to focus on that work and on the environment, the improvement in the environmental side reflects the discipline around planning, the discipline around the operations and control of each of our processes. And whilst we are not at 0, we've got to keep improving until we get to that 0 number. And certainly, we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far.
In terms of the environmental side and tailings, we continue to work on tailings and we're going through the process at Minas-Rio obviously but that facility is certainly something very new and a high-level of technical -- a high degree of technical complexity has gone into that design and is certainly a very different design to most of the tailings dams in Brazil. And it's also designed to actually manage water as well. So it's actually a water containing facility. So we don't expect problems in terms of the approval, and we're on track to actually get that approval by the end of the year.
In terms of the overall tonnage, we went public recently. Feedback's been very positive. We thank people that may have provided us some with -- with feedback. And we're looking at anything we can do to improve. We're working with our colleagues in the industry, particularly in the ICMM and looking at standards more broadly. We're currently operating above the ICMM standards. We have done -- in fact, we created a new set of standards back in '14.
They were used to help define the new standards for the ICMM in '16, and we're continuing to improve our facilities and the management our facilities across the group. And I just want to ensure -- assure people that it really does remain a key area of focus for us in the business and very pleased with the progress we've made.
In terms of the operations, we've seen this chart a few times before. Our portfolio work has resulted in us being able to focus on the largest scale assets and resources that we felt had a lot more potential. And our improvement focus has been around 3 areas: Firstly, we've reconfigured our technical process, and so 70% of the mining operations have been adjusted to mine the orebody more effectively than we were mining and that includes mining methods and process technologies. Our operating model is then helped us to improve the way we plan and execute work. And so we've certainly improved our consistency. We're not at where we want to be. But in terms of where we were, we're at least 20% better than where we were, and in fact each operating asset has improved 30% in the last 5 years. That's on average across the assets we have in the portfolio to date.
And we are now working on the technical and innovation platform across resource right through to delivering product to market. And Tony is here again today if there any questions about progress. I'll touch a few points, but if you like a little more detail Tony's here and will certainly be happy to answer a few questions. 
We have delivered, as I said, 30% more production from each asset. And more importantly, in terms of driving margins we dropped our operating cost by around 45% in real terms, or 27% nominally since 2012. And so that transformation has been absolutely key in supporting our improvement in EBITDA margins, the 46% EBITDA margins. And again going with the work that the marketing teams has done has certainly underpinned our improvement in margins across the business.
Now in terms of measuring that performance across the industry and in particularly talking about competitive position, we've improved -- since the last time you saw this chart we've gone from the 37% on average, that's cost position across our assets to the 36th percentile 
On balance sheet, while we're not the lowest number, we'd like to think that our debt is in a good place and that the way we think about the balance sheet and investing in growth and investing in returns to shareholders, the approach is a balanced approach. And I'm stealing Stephen's word there. I think it's a great word and I know he will unpack that a little bit more in his presentation.
And on looking forward, our suite of high quality growth options, most of those assets have EBITDA margins better than 50%. And so from our point of view, that's really important as we continue to grow the business through investment in those quality growth options. And so we think over the next 3 to 5 years, it really is an exciting time as we grow top line performance by around 20% to 25% and at the same time, we drive ourselves towards a 50% EBITDA margin and 46%. We're a little bit further ahead than we thought we'd be, but of course, iron ore has helped us get there. So pleased with where we stand and how we've positioned ourselves.
When we talk about the transformation, we talk about FutureSmart mining and the changes we've made. We do like to make the point, and I think it's very important that it's all connected to being part of our sustainability work. So the work that we're doing to reduce energy consumption, water consumption, improve our physical footprint is all about improving the business and returns, which is absolutely consistent with creating a more sustainable operation. And whether you're talking enviromental health, safety, social partnerships, they're all part of the same lot of conversations and obviously, having a much more competitive cost position is also about sustainability. So for us, our material -- or our organic improvement is built on the 3 key short-term foundations. Obviously, with the quality of the assets we have provides us with the raw materials to shape the business over the longer term and position ourselves for continuing performance improvement and growth. Our P101 program, actually, builds off the implementation of the operating model. So we've put the operating model in.
We've improved our competitive position, but every one of us, when looking at each other in the eyes, we're not yet best practice. The real drive from here is to get each part of the business to operating best practice. Now that doesn't mean every one of your processes get to that position because there are a critical points in the process that we need to be at the top to ensure that we've got best performance across the business. And so that's important for us. And the operating model and the work around the operating model has provided the platform for that next set of conversation. 
So every one of our operators knows what they have to achieve to get the best-in-class on a shovel, a truck, loaders, in the plants right across the business.  And that's really generating a buzz and a conversation about how do we get there and how do we help each other get there. And the second part, the technical change. So when we talked about mining method changes and configuration changes, in taking that to it's logical next step, Tony and the team have been talking about changing the footprint, reducing energy consumption by 30%, reducing water consumption by 50%, all of those technologies and those different approaches, come off the base that we've created that is we're mining the orebodies, in our view, the best way in terms of managing short-term, medium-term and longer-term returns and looking for the right technologies to hit those critical points that improves our performance and continues to improve both the recovery of the resources, the cost position on those resources, and we've positioned assets for the long term. Because when we look at cut-off grades and those sorts of things, we're trying to think about squaring up those 3 dimensions, short, medium and longer term and getting the best out of our assets. And I think the continuity that we've been able to achieve in our operations speaks to trying to get that balance right.
On FutureSmart mining specifically, we look at the program right through the value chain, concentrated mine is around getting the mining methods right, mining the ore and only the ore and driving the process or driving the ore through the process at the highest grade possible so making sure that we're not wasting money on mining waste or processing waste through the system and that's a critical part of the process. And we've got our first ore sorter currently being commissioned at El Soldado and so far the results look pretty good.
In the Waterless Mine, we're looking at various elements of the process, being able to coarser grind. And I talked about last time, so I won't go back through that, that's part of the process. Modern Mine is around the systems we're building and the operating model provides a very different base for us to look at, think about plan and execute work in the operation. And so from our point of view, the operating model provides the starting point. It's really an industrial model applied to the operation. And we take every person through the business. And it takes us 18 months to transform an operation from a standing start to having a very different mentality about the operation. And what I'll say it is hard work, it takes time, someplace it takes a bit longer and some places where you're working on a number of fronts, you might have some places come back a bit. And it's important and it helps us identify where that's occurring quickly, so we can go back and then address it. I think there was a good example at Kumba where we said we had a bit of problem with operating equipment, but Themba and the team identified the issue early. And the fact that you've got those processes in place helps you identify those sort of issues, then the reaction time is much shorter, and you're able to pull the operation up back much quicker. I think Themba did a good job explaining that in the result -- his results presentation a few days back.
And finally, on the Intelligent Mine, thinking about what we do in a very different way. Our industry, in my experience, has not been good with data, and data literacy has been fairly poor, even though we're an industry that's had Big Data for a long period of time. And the work on understanding that data and understanding how to apply that data and working the critical pinch points and control points and opportunity points across the business are very different.
It also has gone to another level with the development of different algorithms and diagnostics across the industry. It tells us that we think the changes that are possible are much more significant that most people understand. And so we've really pushed hard into this part of the business and again, it connects to everything else that we've been doing from basically getting a better understanding of geology, the mining opportunities, the mining methods and the application of new technologies to these operations, which we think is absolutely critical, and we've been investing in this for 5 years.
So it's not we woke up last week, and said this might be a good idea. When we started to transform the business, we were investing in this thinking, 5 and 6 years ago, and we're starting to see the benefits in terms of what we believe we can achieve going forward.
I thought this is a very simple graphic. The small truck, 1,900 today, where we're actually mining or spending 16x the amount of energy, double the amount of water, about 8x the amount of ground to actually produce a pound of copper. And the trucks keep getting better. Clearly the benefits of scale have been through cost performance, but we think we're getting to not the limits, but the curve is starting to flatten off. And the opportunities to think very differently about mining using all of the tools I've just talked about is significant. And we've been a significant investor over the last 5 years in that whole thinking process. Tony has been the leader with the operating CEOs and they worked as partners in working out how those technologies can be applied in these businesses. And I think over the next 3 to 4 years the transformation in the business is going to be just as significant as the transformation we've seen in the last 3 or 4 years. And I think that's the point we were making about -- we're thinking about where we're going as a company when we look at what we should do with shareholder returns and investment in the future and getting that balance right.
Again, sustainability. I've talked to the key elements. I won't go back through that, but I think it's important to make the point that we connect them, and they are interconnected for us. It's all about the same conversation, and we look at both sides of that equation in everything we're doing. And again, we've been doing that for a number of years. And I think, the benefits are coming through both in the terms of the results, the relationships we have with our core stakeholders across the business, local communities, lot more to be done. But again, I think Quellaveco, is a good example of doing the right work in the community and what can be a fairly complex, social environment. And certainly I think the way Tom and the guys are handling the work in Quellaveco, has really gone well. And certainly, the feedback from the government has been exceptional.
Finally, before I hand across to Stephen, pretty simple story. 2012, 30% EBITDA margin has been an important piece for us reflecting production and the nature of the production. We've continued to grow the business. We're now at a 46% EBITDA, so an 8% production improvement won't drive that type of improvement in EBITDA because the price comparison, the price of today are actually lower still when we did these numbers.
It's been all about the transformation in the portfolio and the drive in the operating cost side. And for us, with the projects we have in place, we can see growth up to that 135 off the 100 base in 2012. And we believe, on the current prices, we can deliver a 50% margin. The 45% margin is on long-term prices. And so that's the difference that we saw. Well, that's the explanation of the range that we've shown.
So I think with that, I'll hand across to Stephen, and he can really unpack the detail behind the numbers. Go for it, Stephen."

As I talked through some of the numbers this morning, I really wanted to touch on 3 key themes and it sort of flows on some of the topics that Mark was talking about. So firstly, consistent delivery of the numbers is really derived from cons",2377,"Thanks, Mark. As I talked through some of the numbers this morning, I really wanted to touch on 3 key themes and it sort of flows on some of the topics that Mark was talking about. So firstly, consistent delivery of the numbers is really derived from consistent delivery from the operations. And that's underpinned by the operating model and that relentless focus on productivity that Mark has spoken about.
Secondly, the increasing margin driven by the relentless focus on productivity and also our prices. This half have really flowed in to our improvement in our relative cost position. And thirdly, then is the disciplined use of cash. I'll try not to overuse this word this morning, but balance is my word of the reporting season. It's about how we think about that balance between the balance sheet, the capital and the way we invest in the business and returns to shareholders. And if we get that cycle right now, it allows us to set up for that next wave of growth and cash flow and investment and returns.
But obviously, the big news for this morning is the return to shareholders. So the buyback of up to USD 1 billion consistent with those 3 themes that I have, in fact, just spoken about and how we're thinking about that use and allocation of the discretionary cash flow that we generate.
And then the base dividend. 40% payout ratio, USD 0.62 per share and I'll talk to both of those components in a few slides' time.
So the numbers themselves, EBITDA $5.5 billion, earnings per share, $1.58. As Mark mentioned, the best half we've had since 2011. Free cash flow of $1.6 billion, a slight build in working capital, as we've noted in the results. If ever there was a good build in working capital from a finance director's point of view, the majority of it is this and it's in receivables because we've had increasing prices, which obviously flows through to cash flow and the return of Minas-Rio have also led to some of that build in working capital. So as I say, if ever there was a good build, this would have to be it.
CapEx, as usual, half 1, half 2 split and obviously then in terms of using the Mitsubishi cash we had on hand. Coming into the second half, we'll fund our proportion. Importantly, guidance for the year on CapEx is maintained.
And finally, effective tax rate. I know it causes you a few issues in terms of getting to your EPS and dividend number, apologies, but it really is the mix of results across the businesses that drives that to some extent. And in particular this 6 months is the return of Minas-Rio so strongly in a high iron ore price environment has meant we've been able to utilize some of those past tax losses that we've accumulated from those operation. So that's really driven us down to that 30% and our guidance going forward is 29% to 31%.
Okay. Mark often talks about the number of assets that we have in the business. I suppose another way to think about that it is, yes, we have 34 assets, but we're currently organized around 4 simple business units. Big increase in Bulks obviously driven by return of Minas-Rio on prices, PGMs nice to see Chris -- price is coming back to give us a little bit of a hand. Copper, continued great work in terms of both volumes and cost. And diamonds, even though we have seen softness in the market, particularly from quarter 2 onwards still contributes over $0.5 billions to the group result.
In each case and to pick up a big theme of Mark's, driving very healthy margins in each of those 4 business units. So as we worked through the underlying numbers period on period so as we say $5.5 billion, up 19% from the prior year. Price, largely driven by iron ore price, 62% averaged around $91 a tonne, that translates to us from a realized CFR price of about $118 a tonne, really driven by quality grade and lump product offsetting that some price weakness in thermal coal.
This period we've had a little bit of a turnaround in terms of a positive impact across FX and CPI. So currencies generally moved in our favor, offsetting about a 200 negative movement in CPI and inflation costs. As you look across the combination of currency, the impact of inflation, the Minas-Rio recovery and the cost and volume changes we've had for the period, it's a net positive when you add all of those things up and that translates to that relative improvement in our cost position across the portfolio.
As we come into half 2, some real momentum with Kumba, met coal, Minas-Rio and copper, all from a production point of view and looking to recover some of that shortfall that you saw in our quarterly that we had -- that we released the other day. As we look at cost and volume going forward, it's not always an even flow half to half, so you recall last year, we had a very strong first half and then slightly flat second half. At this time around, we're actually anticipating to see the reverse with the momentum that we have a fairly flat first half and some good momentum into the second.
If we then turn to the balance sheet, again, very consistent messages every time I get up here around the balance sheet, and that's not going to change today and it's not going to change as we go forward. So net debt, effectively flat. We had the accounting standard adjustment for operating leases, opening adjustment of 500 and then another 100 added during the 6 months mainly around shipping -- normal shipping contracts, so fairly flat period-to-period. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA, 0.3x, again, a very healthy position to take the business forward. And net gearing, which really goes to the underlying strength of the balance sheet in terms of debt to balance sheet, a very healthy 10%.
So return to shareholders. We are committed to the payout ratio. We're committed to the 40% payout ratio and that has resulted in the quite substantial increase in dividends per share for the half, again, a direct reflection of the improvement into the underlying earnings, so 27% up.
That compares to $1 for the full year from last year, so a very good start assuming we continue with the performance, and that's roughly around a 5% yield. 
In terms of the buyback, it really is consistent with our capital allocation policy and I'll touch on the wheel that we normally talk to in a moment. And as we work through that allocation of discretionary cash flow, it reflects a confidence in our balance sheet, confidence in our near- and medium-term growth and again that balance that we have as we think about where we're taking the business today and as we go forward.
We also thought about the balance of returns to shareholders. And here, we recognize different shareholders have different preferences. But to date leading up to today and including then today's 40% buyback, that would represent $3.4 billion of dividends, and now with the buyback, $1 billion of buybacks, so in total $4.4 billion since we started -- we restarted the dividend back in '17. So it's an 80-20 split. Again, its about balance.
Going forward, please put in your spreadsheets 40% payout policy. We will continue with that policy. I know we perhaps surprised some of you given my absolute and resolute sticking to the 40% guidance. But it's okay to reassess those things from time to time, and we will reassess those things from time to time as we go forward as well. We will always consider how we allocate the cash flow.
So how have we done? Let's look at the scorecard in terms of our capital allocation and cash flow. So $1.6 billion of sustaining cash flow, 40% dividend last year. With $700 million this year, it's $800 million, and pleased where we are from a balance sheet point of view. And you can see we're starting to allocate cash to some of the discretionary items, whether that be some smaller growth -- brownfield growth projects. Quellaveco, as I say, we will start to see our proportionate funding come through this year; and then obviously, the share buyback, which will flow between now and early next year.
So back in February, we tried to give you some really good forward information around capital spend and where we saw the capital spend journey -- our journey going. As you noted then and as you can see today, we see it peaking up a little bit through '20 and '21, and I would anticipate as we move to '21, we'll be towards the top end of that range. And that's a combination of the sustaining CapEx that we have clearly flagged; and the productivity gains and extra volumes that we will see; the Brownfield approvals, which I will touch on shortly; and then the investment in innovation and technology; and obviously, Quellaveco. 
You recall at the full year, I presented a capital efficiency slide, and nothing really has changed in that. So we're still tracking at the moment to sort of 20% to 30% capital efficiency. And if you recall, that reflects exactly the same 20% to 30% operating efficiency that we're seeing through the operating sides of the business. You will see that fluctuate a little bit from time to time. Remember, I spoke about while it's okay for the absolute number of sustaining CapEx to go up provided on a copper-equivalent per ton basis, we're spending that money more efficiently, that's exactly what we're still seeing. But as some of the businesses go through ramp-up and volume improvements, a good example is Moranbah-Grosvenor, we're seeing increased productivity rates, which means we need to step forward a little bit quicker in terms of the degassing and mine development and setting up for the next long hauls. So a good reason why that's increasing. It's driving really high-margin great returns even though the absolute number creeps up by 0.1 or 0.2 across that time frame.
Looking at some of the options that we have across the portfolio. And as far as -- it's lovely to see that we've got a nice list in front of us and we own these options. Again, we flagged this last year and we're going to keep you informed in terms of how this unfolds going forward. So we can tick another one off. 
In May, we approved the marine vessel in Namibia for the Debmarine operations. And we've been talking about the Moranbah-Grosvenor expansion, that's likely to come through, through the first half of next year, I would anticipate at this stage. With some of the improvements in the debottlenecking work that we have seen already we are already seeing, let's call it, some of the volume benefits we thought we would have seen in the next CapEx program already coming forward to today. So we'll just feed that into the studies and see how that flows out. And probably, some of the next things you'd see would be some of the technology and innovation perhaps showing itself a little more obviously to you as we invest through that '19 and '20 period. And then you'll see some of those benefits flow out through the '21 and '22 period as it works its way through the production systems and into underlying EBITDA.
What we will guarantee is that we'll keep you posted on those things. These things will be very visible to you as we go through. They will only be approved over time and take full account of markets, balance sheet, cash flows and circumstances of the day. And we'll keep you posted through that time frame.
So just coming back to our cost and volume improvement targets. So we are targeting $400 million for this year, originally $500 million, so we have just softened that a little bit with the softness in the market that we're seeing in diamonds in particular. Yes, we're not prepared to give up on that $400 million. It will be perhaps challenging, but we have a number of initiatives building up to that and through that we will be working very hard to deliver through the year.
On the basis that we achieve that, that will take our cost and volume benefit from this $3 billion to $4 billion to $800 million. And if you recall in that bottom section there, the operating model and sort of productivity improvements we'd flagged a $1 billion to $1.5 billion in that bucket. So over time, and we said that, that would probably be more front-end loaded than the other categories, that's what we're seeing. And we're starting to move towards that target over the next year or 2.
As I said earlier, the technology and innovation, it will seem a little more back-ended. And so we would expect to see some of those benefits flow through in that '21 and '22 period. And then obviously, there's the growth projects as well, very much a mix of the brownfields in the nearer term and then the delivery of Quellaveco towards the end of '21, '22. So those things should flow again nicely and quite visibly through the results over time. 
So very much reconfirming our target of $3 billion to $4 billion between now and the end of 2022, and you should expect to see progressive delivery against that through that time frame.
So just to wrap up for me. Where are we and where we do want to be? Obviously, growth, highly competitive and market-leading. In particular, what we're delivering adds to the margin story that Mark spoke about, underpinned by disciplined allocation of cash flow and from a strong balance sheet position. But what we do have, I suppose, is a real commitment in terms of getting the balance of these things right, whether that be around balance sheet, returns to shareholders or delivering and investing in the future of the company. 
Thank you."

Obviously, the G-word is something we're very sensitive to. And when we talk about growth, we are very specific and we try and make sure that in the business, people understand the conversation the right way given the history of the industry. The focus on quality is absolutely critical. And from our point of view, we do look at our markets. We look at the response. We test our projects against the impact we would have on those markets. That's very important to us. And we look at the absolute margin we expect to achieve after adjusting for those changes. And so it's all about quality. And as I said, almost all of those projects, we've got a better than 50% margin at long-term prices.
Driving margins is about making sure the quality is here, and if you've got a quality project, you'll get the margins, and also how we place product into the markets. And our focus on quality, which I'll pick up towards the end of the presentation, is something that we think is absolutely critical as the world evolves across mining, and then making sure that the capital discipline is right and that we've worked the projects to their potential is also important in making sure we do better than that 20% threshold return on capital employed that we've set ourselves through the cycle. And so all those pieces come together to put us into what I think is a very balanced position about what then it should look like across the business.
In terms of what we've seen in the last 6 months and to talk to the things that will continue to improve the quality of our performance and margins. 
Minas-Rio has had a very strong ramp-up in the first 6 months, as we said. We have adjusted the guidance a couple of times now, and we're very pleased with where we are in terms of the tailings program. Yes, tailings is a sensitive word in Brazil at the moment, but again, I think the technological differences we have in the dam set us apart. And by the way, the next lift is no different to the approval process that everyone else in the industry has to go through to get their next lot of tailings lifts. That's part of the process in Brazil. So we're not in a unique cycle today. We're now in a normal operating process. So I think that point has to be made pretty strongly, and it is a little bit different to where we've come from in terms of our processes. So again, based on everything we've done so far, we think year-end is certainly the right expectation given the conversation. And we certainly got a lot of support from the government and the authorities in those processes.
And by the way, one thing we should remind people is we got our Step 3 license 6 months earlier than we forecast. That was a license we got in December which allowed us to open the footprint, and that's also been part of why we've done much better in the first 6 months because we've been able to blend product and get better throughputs through the plant. So that approval is very important, and I think that's also a measure of the nature of the relationship we've built with the authorities in Brazil. So I certainly don't see the risk around that as some have been talking to it more broadly. Certainly very comfortable and very happy with where the guys are. 
In terms of projects. Quellaveco, on track. Very pleased with the progress that's been made. And certainly, from our point of view, Tom and the team have done a great job. Most complex part of the business is obviously around the social dimensions, and I think, again, the guys have done good work there. We've mobilized all the major work areas. We're pouring concrete. And certainly, the progress has been very good.
We've ordered the new ship. It's on its way. Bruce and the guys are very excited. For us, this is a really special bit of gear. Obviously technically, it's very different, but also it mines our highest-value diamonds on a per carat basis. And they're not large, but they're very high-quality, smaller diamonds, but a real good part of the business. Again, pretty rapid payback. So a good project. 
And Aquila, following Grasstree. Good piece of work. And the guys in Queensland have done a great job in the business. Again, I think Moranbah has won 5 years Best Coal Mine in Australia and also Best Mine in Australia a couple of times as well. And all of the learnings from Moranbah, Grasstree, Grosvenor will go into or gone into the design of Aquila. So from our point of view, a good shape on the project site, and again, supporting the quality growth story that Stephen talked to.
On positioning for the future, we would argue that our portfolio is quite unique in the industry. And we would hope that shareholders and prospective shareholders, in particular, can see that the exposure you get to Anglo American is very different to other peers in the industry. And we hope that the one thing that really is coming through is that diversity, as a consequence of the quality of the assets, is certainly a differentiating factor, one that we want to push for in time.
In diamonds, we've got the ultimate luxury consumer product. With the growing middle class and shrinking industry resource and production base, our global leadership position through De Beers is exceptional. And as we say, De Beers isn't really a diamond company. It's a brand that is an industry icon that really means the very best in diamonds. And when you look at our revenue per carat, and I'll show a little bit later, it's the best in the industry. We're proud of that position. And certainly, the industry is going through a bit of tough time. There's been a confluence of certain issues. From our point of view, we think that's not a structural change. 
And with the work on Lightbox, I think we're very pleased with the market's reaction to the product, 3 million to 5 million carats, very small compared to the global diamond production of 143 million carats, so not really a factor. And the fact that the pricing is more akin to other lower-value products has really pleased us in terms of the response of the market.
As the world becomes greener, accommodating 9 billion people will need energy and other industrial solutions that will drive significant growth in copper, nickel, manganese and PGMs unlike we've ever seen. And as the circular economy starts to impact sourcing of bulk commodities in various forms, our focus on quality coal and quality iron ore is, again, a differentiator in a market that will go through significant change over the next 5 to 10 years. And we've been thinking about how we position our business in where we are today, where we will be in 5 years and where we will be in 10 years, and we think those changes will play into our hands in terms of the focus on quality, both through Kumba, 64.5% lump premium; Minas-Rio, 67%, again, unique assets in the world or the bulk worlds. And certainly, we think we're well positioned there.
And for us, if you look at our performance, and I think we've got this in the appendix, Paul, we've improved our relative margin cost position from mid-Q3 to mid-Q2 off the back of improving costs at Kumba, the good production performance at Minas-Rio and the improvement in price premiums that we've received for our products. So Peter and the guys are doing good work along with the operators in making sure that we're delivering the right product consistently into the market, and we're going to keep trying to drive that position to the left across the portfolio. 
There's always a debate about macro trends. And we're having the debates, as you'd expect, and trying to think about how we position our business in those trends. Again, we think the focus on quality, and in particular margins, are going to the absolutely critical. It's the best way to insulate yourself from things that you might not understand or might not anticipate.
The way we look at things, again, changes in population, that 9 billion population will look very different as well in terms of urbanization. The last few years, we've seen 1.4 billion people move to cities and there's another -- there will be another 1.4 billion moved to cities over the next 18 years. So from that point of view, we look at demographics, aging population, the urbanization, the rise of the middle class, climate change, carbon reduction, the rise of renewables, transportation fuels and the circular economy, and that includes recycling, and that will increase particularly across bulks through the recycling of steel, high-quality primary feeds, new business models. 50% of our portfolio by production consists of greener and consumer-facing commodities, and I think that's a unique mix in our industry. And it's one that we think, from a strategic point of view, will play out in more conversations around our sector.
And the environmental benefits that we have in the portfolio and the research work that we're doing through the R&D programs we have across precious metals are going to be very important. And certainly now, with people talking about platinum, palladium being used in lithium batteries, they are important developments and developments we're at the forefront of with other players, investing and making sure that we create opportunities for our product. And certainly, Chris is well up to speed in driving many of those changes through his leadership in the Platinum Guild and other of the consumer-facing entities that we work with in the PGM space.
So for us, we think strategically about the commodity mix and we think tactically in terms of making sure we got the best operations, and we are building a business that is resilient for the long term. It's a unique product mix. It's a high-quality product mix. And it's one we're going to keep improving and growing as we go forward.
In terms of the focus on quality, and I might just explain that the chart actually shows, on the x-axis, the volume that we produce relative to our competitors in those markets. So you'll see in terms of diamonds, we are right up there with -- and no prizes for guessing who's up there. That's ALROSA producing a few more carats. But certainly, the value per carat that we produce really does set us apart. And we believe, longer term, the real price activity and potential for value sits more in the high-value areas. Of course, diamonds, we think, as Argyle and other operations close, the prognosis for the whole diamond market is very positive medium to longer term. But again, we think we're placed very powerfully in the market with that quality mix.
In iron ore, again, a strong player -- a strong quality player. We're not the biggest, but we'd like to think that we're heading towards being the best depending on how you measure that. We've still got a long way to go, but certainly, the improving cost position has helped improved our margins. 
In PGMs, again, just off being the largest producer, but again, our focus on quality is about discipline, making sure we're driving returns. And certainly, if you want to differentiate us, it's around that focus on margin and returns. 
And again in the met coal, very competitive on the cost, pretty good-sized producer, but very much focused on making sure we're at the top end and demanding a product premium for our quality, consistent with the value that we're delivering to our customers. And again, it's about this quality focus across the assets and across our products. It's very important and we think is a significant differentiator for us in the future.
And so to summarize our investment proposition. We've got world-class assets with attractive and carefully phased growth options. We are building leading capabilities in operations, new technologies and the marketing of our products for value. And our returns are underpinned by ensuring that our focus on capital discipline is maintained, irrespective of where products are -- product prices are on the day. And we've got to make sure that we -- and we're focused with the Board that we're delivering consistent returns on capital and of capital to our shareholders.
And with that, happy to take questions."

So one is technically where it's owned from, but practically where we manage it and use it. And so the majority of that cash is, in fact, held in London in US dollars and used as part of general group liquidity. And so from a day-to-day point of view, it really has little impact on how we manage the business. Obviously, yes, we accumulated the $5.1 billion, but there's probably not many of you in the room predicting iron ore to remain at $120. And obviously, the thermal coal prices have eased through the time frame as well. 
So yes, we've had great cash flow. Lovely problem to have. To pay that $800 million for the base dividend, we'll use a little bit in excess of $1 billion given the minorities in Kumba and Platts. And obviously, we'll use the $1 billion in terms of the buyback. So you'll see a significant stepdown. Lovely problem to have before you're in it again. Then we consider things. 
We do have reasonable capital. We've got Venetia underground running at the moment in South Africa. Chris and the team are working through options with Mogalakwena, and while they're a little while away, that does factor into our thinking as we look forward as well."

We start to change the quality mix a little bit in the second quarter, but certainly, we've got at least until middle of next year to be able to operate before we have to really think about pulling things up.

In terms of net debt targets, now I wouldn't try to pinpoint today's debt as a number, tomorrow's debt as a number. It's really a holistic consideration of where we think the business is at today, how it's performed, what we have accumulated and how we see then the future both in the medium and longer term paning out.

Two, we have made it very clear that the thermal coal assets have got the shortest life in our portfolio and that we're unlikely to be investing in new thermal coal projects. So I think we've made it pretty clear that thermal coal, while still important, is reducing in significance across the portfolio. And I think EBITDA is less than 5%, partly a pricing issue, yes. 
But from our point of view, we are talking to adjust transition, so making sure that we're working with stakeholders. So the average life of our assets is 13 years, and that's South Africa. Our history has been as we get towards or get closer to a life, we have in the past dealt differently with those assets. But I think making sure that we're working with the government, working with customers, working with communities, working with employees on what that should look like. But certainly, we're in a process looking to continue to improve the business, but longer term, it will be less prominent in our portfolio. 
We haven't made a final call on where we will go, but certainly pretty clear where we're working ourselves towards given the shorter life of those assets. So we're extending the life, as you would expect. But at the same time, longer term, it's likely others will own the assets. But we certainly haven't put anything or hardwired anything at this stage."

As long as there is downstream demand, the issues that are going on in the midstream, all things being equal and us being very careful with volume and price, you would expect them to play themselves out over a period of time. It really depends on consumer demand in the downstream markets, particularly in Q4. And so we'll watch those carefully. But as we sit here, demand isn't in a bad space. We'll be spending money differently and a bit smarter in marketing in the second half of the year to try and help downstream demand, but I don't think there's any need for us at this point to change the strategy we have."

I think we managed mostly to get through that without losing mine production. Most of the refined production has been pushed into the second half of this year, so I think we should still get most of that production this year.
I think the big issue for us is -- has been the increase. We've seen a 14% increase in electricity prices. That's 3x inflation. Next year, it's likely to go down to 10%, but I think we can pencil in higher Eskom prices for the next number of years. And that's also some of the reasons why Tony and myself and the group are working at seeing what else we can do our around solar generation of power ourselves. But for now, I think we've gone through the winter months without load shedding. And I think that was to be expected because we don't do any maintenance -- or Eskom doesn't do any maintenance in the winter periods. So expect as it comes to summer that it might actually get a bit tighter than it feels now, and that's not what most folk are thinking about. 
So I think, Mark, nothing really new. Prices are high or the charges are high. We're all managing as best we can. We're all engaging, and one of the things also, I think, that we participate as Anglo American is in the technical assistance to Eskom. So we put in place a team to go help -- a technical team to help Eskom just to go through all of their assets. That was only ever meant to be feedback to Eskom. So we don't really have the kind of feedback that we would like, but that feedback has gone into Eskom, and I think Anglo American has played a big role in that regard."

And Chris has got more flexibility because he's also got downstream processes, both a number of smelters and refineries. So he's able to work across the process and his assets are less exposed. So if you've got an underground operation, ventilation would be 40%. Energy would be 40% -- sorry, ventilation is 40% of the energy consumption. And it's 24 hours a day. So I think we are structurally advantaged because of where and how we set the operations up. Some of that's by luck. Some of that's by design. And as well as that, Chris, Tony and the team are working on solar options and a whole range of renewable-type strategies that will reduce our dependence on time, on Eskom as well.

It was off the back of a lot of great work the team did while the plant was shut in terms of maintenance and getting everything ready to run as smoothly as you've seen it ramp up.

So if you double our first half, you'd get a bit more what we're forecasting. So slightly softer volumes in the second half than one -- than the first, and that will translate a little bit into unit cost. So nothing too much to worry about. Still a great performance expected. 
Working capital, here, it went up by $600 million. Two components. The first was $400 million in receivables that I spoke about as good as it gets in terms of an increase because of price and because of Minas-Rio coming back on. The other $200 million was inventory and a little bit copper, PGMs, et cetera. So we will expect some of that to run out in the second half as Chris ramps his refinery up and gets those volumes out to market and -- but possibly offset if softness in the diamond market continues all the way through to year-end with a little bit of build of working capital in De Beers."

If you said to me, is there a potential impact? Yes, it might be 5%, but I think we have to see how the balance of the next 3 or 4 months play out before we start talking about next year. But there's a lot of work going on in making sure we've got water in the right places to minimize any potential impacts. But it's not more than that from what we consider today, but let's wait and see the next 3 or 4 months.
Second point, on the 1 million tonnes, the work on the technology side, absolutely critical to making sure that we've got the water. So a 50% reduction through the implementation of coarse particle flotation, the ore sorting, coarse particle flotation and those technology changes is the key to the 1 million tonnes.

I'm always careful about talking about competitors in the diamond space. Look, from our point of view, on a value basis, we are the largest player in the diamond market. And we make judgments against what we see in the market and we take cognizance of that. Our partner and our shareholder, the Botswana Government, is also very sensitive to the long-term view of diamond. So we take positions for the long term. Others sometimes follow, sometimes don't. We don't talk to them. Whether they're pulling their own weight, let others make that judgment. From our point of view, it's important we're the leader. We take the positions. And what we've done in the last few years seems to have worked reasonably well, although the behavior elsewhere has been mixed. And we don't assume that it will be any different looking forward.
The other one, on palladium and platinum, I'm going to be very careful here because the last time I opened my mouth on palladium, recall there was a bubble. Look, if I can say that the palladium price reflects demand and supply and that -- look, the market has appeared to have been short of palladium and we're seeing in that price. Whether switching will occur over time? Probably. But then we would see an improvement in the platinum price. The way we think about PGM prices is we look at rhodium being, I guess, the most reactive and the most valued in terms of end-use applications, then platinum and then palladium. And palladium has a very specific application nearer the engine block in terms of heat and performance, and so it's got specific value in its own right. 
So it's going to move between the 3. And the thing I've learned in the business from Chris and the guys is that, they don't tend to move all down in one sway. When the market's tough, you might get that. Well, there will probably be adjustments. But we do well -- if you take an average price across the commodity -- or across the 3, we do well $900 and above to extremely well. And at the moment, we're at about $1,200 on the balance, but it's even probably a bit higher. And it's not going to swing away too far from that anytime soon.

I wanted to touch, first of all,",421,"So good morning, everyone. My name is Stuart Chambers, Chairman of Anglo American. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our 2019 half year results presentation. And I just wanted to cover 2 things before I hand over to Mark. I wanted to touch, first of all, within HSE, I want to just touch on safety. Mark will cover this shortly in his presentation, so I won't duplicate. But I do want to share with you that the Board of Anglo American is very engaged in this. We are very clear that it's a journey. It's by no means a job done. There is a lot more to do. And in fact, we're pretty clear now on the things that we have to change to ensure that we continue to improve in this area, build on the improvements we are already making in the underlying measures, but of course, importantly, to eliminate fatalities. And as I said, Mark will cover this again quite shortly. 
The second thing to do is simply to update you on board changes. Since we last spoke in this forum, which was the full year results in February. So since then, Jack Thompson, one of our 2 mining nonexecs retired, having term served with 9 years. And we're very pleased to been able to bring in Marcelo Bastos to get us back to 2 miners within our own nonexecs. And Marcelo, of course, is also -- he's Brazilian, but even more importantly, he has extensive mining experience in South America, an increasingly important part of our operations.
Then I don't know if you saw it, but 2 days ago, we announced then some further changes, which is that Nolitha Fakude, steps down from the Board, which is a loss, our South African nonexec director one of them. And -- but I'm pleased to say that, we're not losing her because she is stepping down because she is taking up a full-time executive role in Mark's Senior Executive team, leading down in South Africa.
We're then bringing in 2 new nonexecs, one directly replace Nolitha, and the second also South African to ensure that we sustain our target level, which is that we wish to have 2 South African nonexecs overtime in our Board to, again, stress the importance of that part of our operations. So in that respect, we're bringing on Hixonia Nyasulu and Nonkululeko Nyembezi and they both join in November and January, respectively. So that's enough from me. Thank you. 
I'll hand over to Mark."

And I would like to acknowledge my colleagues here in the room. And as always, we'll be available after the session for additional questions that you may have. And cer",3533,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thanks for joining us today. And I would like to acknowledge my colleagues here in the room. And as always, we'll be available after the session for additional questions that you may have. And certainly, from my point of view, I encourage you to talk to the guys and hear their version of events.
I'd also like to acknowledge both Ruben and Themba. Themba just on the GMC. So this is his first session. Themba is the CEO of Kumba. So if you've got really tough questions, we'll throw them to Themba. And Ruben has just taken over the copper business from Duncan. And we've had a good performance. Both of them are taking credit for the improving performance in copper at the moment.
So I'm sure when you talk to both of them, you'll get 2 versions of that story. For us, the order of march for today very consistent with what we've done in the past. I'll kick away with an overview of the results. Stephen will pick up the financials and really pull apart the numbers, and help give you a bit of sense of how we got there. And then, I'll add some insights in terms of where to from here. And I think that's an important point to make as we pick up conversations around buyback. If you look back at where we've come from in resetting the business, restructuring the business, there's been a lot of work done, but from our point of view, there is still a lot to do as we look forward, and we believe a lot more improvement potential, and we'll unpack that conversation as we go. And the buyback -- and part of the story around the buyback was obviously about what we think or where we think we are and where we believe we're going. And certainly, I think that's a very important part of the story and for me, probably the most important part of the conversations during the course of today.
So on the results, our financials reflect both good prices, particularly in iron ore and solid cost control across the broader business. And while volumes were down 2%, that for me was the disappointment, the cost control work was exceptionally good. I'm very pleased with the work that's been done. Obviously, still a lot more to be done. But in the case of inflation and other pressures, I think that's been credible. 
As a consequence, our EBITDA margin of 46% is right up there with the best we've ever achieved and certainly right up there with the best in the industry.
So again, it reflects both improving cost control and also improving prices or realized prices on our products. And I think one of the unsung changes in the business and transformation of the business had been the marketing story and we're proud of what Peter and the guys have achieved.
Our dividends reflect the earnings improvement. Obviously, the 40% payout ratio represents $800 million payout to shareholders. And in addition, we're announcing a $1 billion buyback. And again, we'll unpack the logic behind that and I'll leave most of that to Stephen. But from our point of view, I think it's a very clear statement about where we believe we are, the projects in control, we're investing in growth in the future. And certainly from our point of view, the prognosis going forward is we look to continue to improve this pretty solid. And so we felt that it was appropriate and it also reflects the confidence both the Board and the executive has in the future of the company.
Free cash flow isn't as good as it might have been given the headline performance. We had about $600 million locked up in working capital. We should see that come out, but again Stephen will give you a much better picture on what that looks like. We have over the course of the 6 months seen some pressures in the diamond market, again, happy to unpack some of those conversations. But the real high point I think for the first half was the performance at Minas-Rio. We've adjusted up the guidance once. We've done it again today, 19 million to 21 million tonnes, really pleased with how the team has come back after the pipeline incident. Obviously, a lot of work done while the pipeline was off and that certainly gave us the running start into the year, so very pleased with that work. And our return on capital employed, 22% reflects both improving margins and the continuing discipline that we have on capital allocation and again Stephen will unpack that conversation.
As Stuart flagged, safety critical issue for us. And from our point of view, it remains an absolute focus and our priority item. We reported 3 fatalities in the first 6 months: 1 at Moranbah in Australia, 1 in Los Bronces in Chile, and 1 in Quellaveco in Peru on a concrete truck supplying concrete to the plant.
Post the results, we've had 2 bus incidents. People commuting from work to home at Collahuasi and near Los Bronces. In our case, we've extended our transportation work -- or we've extended our elimination of fatalities work into transportation, which includes commuting off-site and with the third-party providers to make sure we pick up that element. Because when we look at the risks across the business, one thing that doesn't get picked up as well as it should be is where we have off-site commutes back to -- and whether it's San Diego. And so we're working with our third-party suppliers and contractors well to make sure that we've got that covered as well.
So that's certainly been very disappointing from our perspective, and it will be included in the [ EOF-2 ] work and is a very important piece of work for us as we feel that responsibility not only on-site or within the mine gate, but getting people back home and helping people make sure that their homes are safer as well and that's the responsibility we take very seriously.
On health, again, continuing to improve the operations focusing on making sure where people work are in the right -- is in the right shape and certainly the progress has been significant. We'll continue to focus on that work and on the environment, the improvement in the environmental side reflects the discipline around planning, the discipline around the operations and control of each of our processes. And whilst we are not at 0, we've got to keep improving until we get to that 0 number. And certainly, we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far.
In terms of the environmental side and tailings, we continue to work on tailings and we're going through the process at Minas-Rio obviously but that facility is certainly something very new and a high-level of technical -- a high degree of technical complexity has gone into that design and is certainly a very different design to most of the tailings dams in Brazil. And it's also designed to actually manage water as well. So it's actually a water containing facility. So we don't expect problems in terms of the approval, and we're on track to actually get that approval by the end of the year.
In terms of the overall tonnage, we went public recently. Feedback's been very positive. We thank people that may have provided us some with -- with feedback. And we're looking at anything we can do to improve. We're working with our colleagues in the industry, particularly in the ICMM and looking at standards more broadly. We're currently operating above the ICMM standards. We have done -- in fact, we created a new set of standards back in '14.
They were used to help define the new standards for the ICMM in '16, and we're continuing to improve our facilities and the management our facilities across the group. And I just want to ensure -- assure people that it really does remain a key area of focus for us in the business and very pleased with the progress we've made.
In terms of the operations, we've seen this chart a few times before. Our portfolio work has resulted in us being able to focus on the largest scale assets and resources that we felt had a lot more potential. And our improvement focus has been around 3 areas: Firstly, we've reconfigured our technical process, and so 70% of the mining operations have been adjusted to mine the orebody more effectively than we were mining and that includes mining methods and process technologies. Our operating model is then helped us to improve the way we plan and execute work. And so we've certainly improved our consistency. We're not at where we want to be. But in terms of where we were, we're at least 20% better than where we were, and in fact each operating asset has improved 30% in the last 5 years. That's on average across the assets we have in the portfolio to date.
And we are now working on the technical and innovation platform across resource right through to delivering product to market. And Tony is here again today if there any questions about progress. I'll touch a few points, but if you like a little more detail Tony's here and will certainly be happy to answer a few questions. 
We have delivered, as I said, 30% more production from each asset. And more importantly, in terms of driving margins we dropped our operating cost by around 45% in real terms, or 27% nominally since 2012. And so that transformation has been absolutely key in supporting our improvement in EBITDA margins, the 46% EBITDA margins. And again going with the work that the marketing teams has done has certainly underpinned our improvement in margins across the business.
Now in terms of measuring that performance across the industry and in particularly talking about competitive position, we've improved -- since the last time you saw this chart we've gone from the 37% on average, that's cost position across our assets to the 36th percentile 
On balance sheet, while we're not the lowest number, we'd like to think that our debt is in a good place and that the way we think about the balance sheet and investing in growth and investing in returns to shareholders, the approach is a balanced approach. And I'm stealing Stephen's word there. I think it's a great word and I know he will unpack that a little bit more in his presentation.
And on looking forward, our suite of high quality growth options, most of those assets have EBITDA margins better than 50%. And so from our point of view, that's really important as we continue to grow the business through investment in those quality growth options. And so we think over the next 3 to 5 years, it really is an exciting time as we grow top line performance by around 20% to 25% and at the same time, we drive ourselves towards a 50% EBITDA margin and 46%. We're a little bit further ahead than we thought we'd be, but of course, iron ore has helped us get there. So pleased with where we stand and how we've positioned ourselves.
When we talk about the transformation, we talk about FutureSmart mining and the changes we've made. We do like to make the point, and I think it's very important that it's all connected to being part of our sustainability work. So the work that we're doing to reduce energy consumption, water consumption, improve our physical footprint is all about improving the business and returns, which is absolutely consistent with creating a more sustainable operation. And whether you're talking environmental health, safety, social partnerships, they're all part of the same lot of conversations and obviously, having a much more competitive cost position is also about sustainability. So for us, our material -- or our organic improvement is built on the 3 key short-term foundations. Obviously, with the quality of the assets we have provides us with the raw materials to shape the business over the longer term and position ourselves for continuing performance improvement and growth. Our P101 program, actually, builds off the implementation of the operating model. So we've put the operating model in.
We've improved our competitive position, but every one of us, when looking at each other in the eyes, we're not yet best practice. The real drive from here is to get each part of the business to operating best practice. Now that doesn't mean every one of your processes get to that position because there are a critical points in the process that we need to be at the top to ensure that we've got best performance across the business. And so that's important for us. And the operating model and the work around the operating model has provided the platform for that next set of conversation. 
So every one of our operators knows what they have to achieve to get the best-in-class on a shovel, a truck, loaders, in the plants right across the business. And that's really generating a buzz and a conversation about how do we get there and how do we help each other get there. And the second part, the technical change. So when we talked about mining method changes and configuration changes, in taking that to its logical next step, Tony and the team have been talking about changing the footprint, reducing energy consumption by 30%, reducing water consumption by 50%, all of those technologies and those different approaches, come off the base that we've created that is we're mining the orebodies, in our view, the best way in terms of managing short-term, medium-term and longer-term returns and looking for the right technologies to hit those critical points that improves our performance and continues to improve both the recovery of the resources, the cost position on those resources, and we've positioned assets for the long term. Because when we look at cut-off grades and those sorts of things, we're trying to think about squaring up those 3 dimensions, short, medium and longer term and getting the best out of our assets. And I think the continuity that we've been able to achieve in our operations speaks to trying to get that balance right.
On FutureSmart mining specifically, we look at the program right through the value chain, concentrated mine is around getting the mining methods right, mining the ore and only the ore and driving the process or driving the ore through the process at the highest grade possible so making sure that we're not wasting money on mining waste or processing waste through the system and that's a critical part of the process. And we've got our first ore sorter currently being commissioned at El Soldado and so far the results look pretty good.
In the Waterless Mine, we're looking at various elements of the process, being able to coarser grind. And I talked about last time, so I won't go back through that, that's part of the process. Modern Mine is around the systems we're building and the operating model provides a very different base for us to look at, think about plan and execute work in the operation. And so from our point of view, the operating model provides the starting point. It's really an industrial model applied to the operation. And we take every person through the business. And it takes us 18 months to transform an operation from a standing start to having a very different mentality about the operation. And what I'll say it is hard work, it takes time, someplace it takes a bit longer and some places where you're working on a number of fronts, you might have some places come back a bit. And it's important and it helps us identify where that's occurring quickly, so we can go back and then address it. I think there was a good example at Kumba where we said we had a bit of problem with operating equipment, but Themba and the team identified the issue early. And the fact that you've got those processes in place helps you identify those sort of issues, then the reaction time is much shorter, and you're able to pull the operation up back much quicker. I think Themba did a good job explaining that in the result -- his results presentation a few days back.
And finally, on the Intelligent Mine, thinking about what we do in a very different way. Our industry, in my experience, has not been good with data, and data literacy has been fairly poor, even though we're an industry that's had Big Data for a long period of time. And the work on understanding that data and understanding how to apply that data and working the critical pinch points and control points and opportunity points across the business are very different.
It also has gone to another level with the development of different algorithms and diagnostics across the industry. It tells us that we think the changes that are possible are much more significant that most people understand. And so we've really pushed hard into this part of the business and again, it connects to everything else that we've been doing from basically getting a better understanding of geology, the mining opportunities, the mining methods and the application of new technologies to these operations, which we think is absolutely critical, and we've been investing in this for 5 years.
So it's not we woke up last week, and said this might be a good idea. When we started to transform the business, we were investing in this thinking, 5 and 6 years ago, and we're starting to see the benefits in terms of what we believe we can achieve going forward.
I thought this is a very simple graphic. The small truck, 1,900 today, where we're actually mining or spending 16x the amount of energy, double the amount of water, about 8x the amount of ground to actually produce a pound of copper. And the trucks keep getting better. Clearly the benefits of scale have been through cost performance, but we think we're getting to not the limits, but the curve is starting to flatten off. And the opportunities to think very differently about mining using all of the tools I've just talked about is significant. And we've been a significant investor over the last 5 years in that whole thinking process. Tony has been the leader with the operating CEOs and they worked as partners in working out how those technologies can be applied in these businesses. And I think over the next 3 to 4 years the transformation in the business is going to be just as significant as the transformation we've seen in the last 3 or 4 years. And I think that's the point we were making about -- we're thinking about where we're going as a company when we look at what we should do with shareholder returns and investment in the future and getting that balance right.
Again, sustainability. I've talked to the key elements. I won't go back through that, but I think it's important to make the point that we connect them, and they are interconnected for us. It's all about the same conversation, and we look at both sides of that equation in everything we're doing. And again, we've been doing that for a number of years. And I think, the benefits are coming through both in the terms of the results, the relationships we have with our core stakeholders across the business, local communities, lot more to be done. But again, I think Quellaveco, is a good example of doing the right work in the community and what can be a fairly complex, social environment. And certainly I think the way Tom and the guys are handling the work in Quellaveco, has really gone well. And certainly, the feedback from the government has been exceptional.
Finally, before I hand across to Stephen, pretty simple story. 2012, 30% EBITDA margin has been an important piece for us reflecting production and the nature of the production. We've continued to grow the business. We're now at a 46% EBITDA, so an 8% production improvement won't drive that type of improvement in EBITDA because the price comparison, the price of today are actually lower still when we did these numbers.
It's been all about the transformation in the portfolio and the drive in the operating cost side. And for us, with the projects we have in place, we can see growth up to that 135 off the 100 base in 2012. And we believe, on the current prices, we can deliver a 50% margin. The 45% margin is on long-term prices. And so that's the difference that we saw. Well, that's the explanation of the range that we've shown.
So I think with that, I'll hand across to Stephen, and he can really unpack the detail behind the numbers. Go for it, Stephen."

As I talked through some of the numbers this morning, I really wanted to touch on 3 key themes and it sort of flows on some of the topics that Mark was talking about. So firstly, consistent delivery of the numbers is really derived from consistent delivery from the operations. And that's underpinned by the operating model and that relentless focus on productivity that Mark has spoken about.
Secondly, the increasing margin driven by the relentless focus on productivity and also our prices. This half have really flowed in to our improvement in our relative cost position. And thirdly, then is the disciplined use of cash. I'll try not to overuse this word this morning, but balance is my word of the reporting season. It's about how we think about that balance between the balance sheet, the capital and the way we invest in the business and returns to shareholders. And if we get that cycle right now, it allows us to set up for that next wave of growth and cash flow and investment and returns.
But obviously, the big news for this morning is the return to shareholders. So the buyback of up to USD 1 billion consistent with those 3 themes that I have, in fact, just spoken about and how we're thinking about that use and allocation of the discretionary cash flow that we generate. And then the base dividend. 40% payout ratio, USD 0.62 per share and I'll talk to both of those components in a few slides' time.
So the numbers themselves, EBITDA $5.5 billion, earnings per share, $1.58. As Mark mentioned, the best half we've had since 2011. Free cash flow of $1.6 billion, a slight build in working capital, as we've noted in the results. If ever there was a good build in working capital from a finance director's point of view, the majority of it is this and it's in receivables because we've had increasing prices, which obviously flows through to cash flow and the return of Minas-Rio have also led to some of that build in working capital. So as I say, if ever there was a good build, this would have to be it.
CapEx, as usual, half 1, half 2 split and obviously then in terms of using the Mitsubishi cash we had on hand. Coming into the second half, we'll fund our proportion. Importantly, guidance for the year on CapEx is maintained.
And finally, effective tax rate. I know it causes you a few issues in terms of getting to your EPS and dividend number, apologies, but it really is the mix of results across the businesses that drives that to some extent. And in particular this 6 months is the return of Minas-Rio so strongly in a high iron ore price environment has meant we've been able to utilize some of those past tax losses that we've accumulated from those operation. So that's really driven us down to that 30% and our guidance going forward is 29% to 31%.
Okay. Mark often talks about the number of assets that we have in the business. I suppose another way to think about that it is, yes, we have 34 assets, but we're currently organized around 4 simple business units. Big increase in Bulks obviously driven by return of Minas-Rio on prices, PGMs nice to see Chris -- price is coming back to give us a little bit of a hand. Copper, continued great work in terms of both volumes and cost. And diamonds, even though we have seen softness in the market, particularly from quarter 2 onwards still contributes over $0.5 billion to the group result.
In each case and to pick up a big theme of Mark's, driving very healthy margins in each of those 4 business units. So as we worked through the underlying numbers period on period so as we say $5.5 billion, up 19% from the prior year. Price, largely driven by iron ore price, 62% averaged around $91 a tonne, that translates to us from a realized CFR price of about $118 a tonne, really driven by quality grade and lump product offsetting that some price weakness in thermal coal.
This period we've had a little bit of a turnaround in terms of a positive impact across FX and CPI. So currencies generally moved in our favor, offsetting about a 200 negative movement in CPI and inflation costs. As you look across the combination of currency, the impact of inflation, the Minas-Rio recovery and the cost and volume changes we've had for the period, it's a net positive when you add all of those things up and that translates to that relative improvement in our cost position across the portfolio.
As we come into half 2, some real momentum with Kumba, met coal, Minas-Rio and copper, all from a production point of view and looking to recover some of that shortfall that you saw in our quarterly that we had -- that we released the other day. As we look at cost and volume going forward, it's not always an even flow half to half, so you recall last year, we had a very strong first half and then slightly flat second half. At this time around, we're actually anticipating to see the reverse with the momentum that we have a fairly flat first half and some good momentum into the second.
If we then turn to the balance sheet, again, very consistent messages every time I get up here around the balance sheet, and that's not going to change today and it's not going to change as we go forward. So net debt, effectively flat. We had the accounting standard adjustment for operating leases, opening adjustment of 500 and then another 100 added during the 6 months mainly around shipping -- normal shipping contracts, so fairly flat period-to-period. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA, 0.3x, again, a very healthy position to take the business forward. And net gearing, which really goes to the underlying strength of the balance sheet in terms of debt to balance sheet, a very healthy 10%.
So return to shareholders. We are committed to the payout ratio. We're committed to the 40% payout ratio and that has resulted in the quite substantial increase in dividends per share for the half, again, a direct reflection of the improvement into the underlying earnings, so 27% up.
That compares to $1 for the full year from last year, so a very good start assuming we continue with the performance, and that's roughly around a 5% yield. 
In terms of the buyback, it really is consistent with our capital allocation policy and I'll touch on the wheel that we normally talk to in a moment. And as we work through that allocation of discretionary cash flow, it reflects a confidence in our balance sheet, confidence in our near- and medium-term growth and again that balance that we have as we think about where we're taking the business today and as we go forward.
We also thought about the balance of returns to shareholders. And here, we recognize different shareholders have different preferences. But to date leading up to today and including then today's 40% buyback, that would represent $3.4 billion of dividends, and now with the buyback, $1 billion of buybacks, so in total $4.4 billion since we started -- we restarted the dividend back in '17. So it's an 80-20 split. Again, it’s about balance.
Going forward, please put in your spreadsheets 40% payout policy. We will continue with that policy. I know we perhaps surprised some of you given my absolute and resolute sticking to the 40% guidance. But it's okay to reassess those things from time to time, and we will reassess those things from time to time as we go forward as well. We will always consider how we allocate the cash flow.
So how have we done? Let's look at the scorecard in terms of our capital allocation and cash flow. So $1.6 billion of sustaining cash flow, 40% dividend last year. With $700 million this year, it's $800 million, and pleased where we are from a balance sheet point of view. And you can see we're starting to allocate cash to some of the discretionary items, whether that be some smaller growth -- brownfield growth projects. Quellaveco, as I say, we will start to see our proportionate funding come through this year; and then obviously, the share buyback, which will flow between now and early next year.
So back in February, we tried to give you some really good forward information around capital spend and where we saw the capital spend journey -- our journey going. As you noted then and as you can see today, we see it peaking up a little bit through '20 and '21, and I would anticipate as we move to '21, we'll be towards the top end of that range. And that's a combination of the sustaining CapEx that we have clearly flagged; and the productivity gains and extra volumes that we will see; the Brownfield approvals, which I will touch on shortly; and then the investment in innovation and technology; and obviously, Quellaveco. 
You recall at the full year, I presented a capital efficiency slide, and nothing really has changed in that. So we're still tracking at the moment to sort of 20% to 30% capital efficiency. And if you recall, that reflects exactly the same 20% to 30% operating efficiency that we're seeing through the operating sides of the business. You will see that fluctuate a little bit from time to time. Remember, I spoke about while it's okay for the absolute number of sustaining CapEx to go up provided on a copper-equivalent per ton basis, we're spending that money more efficiently, that's exactly what we're still seeing. But as some of the businesses go through ramp-up and volume improvements, a good example is Moranbah-Grosvenor, we're seeing increased productivity rates, which means we need to step forward a little bit quicker in terms of the degassing and mine development and setting up for the next long hauls. So a good reason why that's increasing. It's driving really high-margin great returns even though the absolute number creeps up by 0.1 or 0.2 across that time frame.
Looking at some of the options that we have across the portfolio. And as far as -- it's lovely to see that we've got a nice list in front of us and we own these options. Again, we flagged this last year and we're going to keep you informed in terms of how this unfolds going forward. So we can tick another one off. 
In May, we approved the marine vessel in Namibia for the Debmarine operations. And we've been talking about the Moranbah-Grosvenor expansion, that's likely to come through, through the first half of next year, I would anticipate at this stage. With some of the improvements in the debottlenecking work that we have seen already we are already seeing, let's call it, some of the volume benefits we thought we would have seen in the next CapEx program already coming forward to today. So we'll just feed that into the studies and see how that flows out. And probably, some of the next things you'd see would be some of the technology and innovation perhaps showing itself a little more obviously to you as we invest through that '19 and '20 period. And then you'll see some of those benefits flow out through the '21 and '22 period as it works its way through the production systems and into underlying EBITDA.
What we will guarantee is that we'll keep you posted on those things. These things will be very visible to you as we go through. They will only be approved over time and take full account of markets, balance sheet, cash flows and circumstances of the day. And we'll keep you posted through that time frame.
So just coming back to our cost and volume improvement targets. So we are targeting $400 million for this year, originally $500 million, so we have just softened that a little bit with the softness in the market that we're seeing in diamonds in particular. Yes, we're not prepared to give up on that $400 million. It will be perhaps challenging, but we have a number of initiatives building up to that and through that we will be working very hard to deliver through the year.
On the basis that we achieve that, that will take our cost and volume benefit from this $3 billion to $4 billion to $800 million. And if you recall in that bottom section there, the operating model and sort of productivity improvements we'd flagged a $1 billion to $1.5 billion in that bucket. So over time, and we said that, that would probably be more front-end loaded than the other categories, that's what we're seeing. And we're starting to move towards that target over the next year or 2.
As I said earlier, the technology and innovation, it will seem a little more back-ended. And so we would expect to see some of those benefits flow through in that '21 and '22 period. And then obviously, there's the growth projects as well, very much a mix of the brownfields in the nearer term and then the delivery of Quellaveco towards the end of '21, '22. So those things should flow again nicely and quite visibly through the results over time. 
So very much reconfirming our target of $3 billion to $4 billion between now and the end of 2022, and you should expect to see progressive delivery against that through that time frame.
So just to wrap up for me. Where are we and where we do want to be? Obviously, growth, highly competitive and market-leading. In particular, what we're delivering adds to the margin story that Mark spoke about, underpinned by disciplined allocation of cash flow and from a strong balance sheet position. But what we do have, I suppose, is a real commitment in terms of getting the balance of these things right, whether that be around balance sheet, returns to shareholders or delivering and investing in the future of the company. 
Thank you."

Obviously, the G-word is something we're very sensitive to. And when we talk about growth, we are very specific and we try and make sure that in the business, people understand the conversation the right way given the history of the industry. The focus on quality is absolutely critical. And from our point of view, we do look at our markets. We look at the response. We test our projects against the impact we would have on those markets. That's very important to us. And we look at the absolute margin we expect to achieve after adjusting for those changes. And so it's all about quality. And as I said, almost all of those projects, we've got a better than 50% margin at long-term prices.
Driving margins is about making sure the quality is here, and if you've got a quality project, you'll get the margins, and also how we place product into the markets. And our focus on quality, which I'll pick up towards the end of the presentation, is something that we think is absolutely critical as the world evolves across mining, and then making sure that the capital discipline is right and that we've worked the projects to their potential is also important in making sure we do better than that 20% threshold return on capital employed that we've set ourselves through the cycle. And so all those pieces come together to put us into what I think is a very balanced position about what then it should look like across the business.
In terms of what we've seen in the last 6 months and to talk to the things that will continue to improve the quality of our performance and margins. 
Minas-Rio has had a very strong ramp-up in the first 6 months, as we said. We have adjusted the guidance a couple of times now, and we're very pleased with where we are in terms of the tailings program. Yes, tailings is a sensitive word in Brazil at the moment, but again, I think the technological differences we have in the dam set us apart. And by the way, the next lift is no different to the approval process that everyone else in the industry has to go through to get their next lot of tailings lifts. That's part of the process in Brazil. So we're not in a unique cycle today. We're now in a normal operating process. So I think that point has to be made pretty strongly, and it is a little bit different to where we've come from in terms of our processes. So again, based on everything we've done so far, we think year-end is certainly the right expectation given the conversation. And we certainly got a lot of support from the government and the authorities in those processes.
And by the way, one thing we should remind people is we got our Step 3 license 6 months earlier than we forecast. That was a license we got in December which allowed us to open the footprint, and that's also been part of why we've done much better in the first 6 months because we've been able to blend product and get better throughputs through the plant. So that approval is very important, and I think that's also a measure of the nature of the relationship we've built with the authorities in Brazil. So I certainly don't see the risk around that as some have been talking to it more broadly. Certainly very comfortable and very happy with where the guys are. 
In terms of projects. Quellaveco, on track. Very pleased with the progress that's been made. And certainly, from our point of view, Tom and the team have done a great job. Most complex part of the business is obviously around the social dimensions, and I think, again, the guys have done good work there. We've mobilized all the major work areas. We're pouring concrete. And certainly, the progress has been very good.
We've ordered the new ship. It's on its way. Bruce and the guys are very excited. For us, this is a really special bit of gear. Obviously technically, it's very different, but also it mines our highest-value diamonds on a per carat basis. And they're not large, but they're very high-quality, smaller diamonds, but a real good part of the business. Again, pretty rapid payback. So a good project. 
And Aquila, following Grasstree. Good piece of work. And the guys in Queensland have done a great job in the business. Again, I think Moranbah has won 5 years Best Coal Mine in Australia and also Best Mine in Australia a couple of times as well. And all of the learnings from Moranbah, Grasstree, Grosvenor will go into or gone into the design of Aquila. So from our point of view, a good shape on the project site, and again, supporting the quality growth story that Stephen talked to.
On positioning for the future, we would argue that our portfolio is quite unique in the industry. And we would hope that shareholders and prospective shareholders, in particular, can see that the exposure you get to Anglo American is very different to other peers in the industry. And we hope that the one thing that really is coming through is that diversity, as a consequence of the quality of the assets, is certainly a differentiating factor, one that we want to push for in time.
In diamonds, we've got the ultimate luxury consumer product. With the growing middle class and shrinking industry resource and production base, our global leadership position through De Beers is exceptional. And as we say, De Beers isn't really a diamond company. It's a brand that is an industry icon that really means the very best in diamonds. And when you look at our revenue per carat, and I'll show a little bit later, it's the best in the industry. We're proud of that position. And certainly, the industry is going through a bit of tough time. There's been a confluence of certain issues. From our point of view, we think that's not a structural change. 
And with the work on Lightbox, I think we're very pleased with the market's reaction to the product, 3 million to 5 million carats, very small compared to the global diamond production of 143 million carats, so not really a factor. And the fact that the pricing is more akin to other lower-value products has really pleased us in terms of the response of the market.
As the world becomes greener, accommodating 9 billion people will need energy and other industrial solutions that will drive significant growth in copper, nickel, manganese and PGMs unlike we've ever seen. And as the circular economy starts to impact sourcing of bulk commodities in various forms, our focus on quality coal and quality iron ore is, again, a differentiator in a market that will go through significant change over the next 5 to 10 years. And we've been thinking about how we position our business in where we are today, where we will be in 5 years and where we will be in 10 years, and we think those changes will play into our hands in terms of the focus on quality, both through Kumba, 64.5% lump premium; Minas-Rio, 67%, again, unique assets in the world or the bulk worlds. And certainly, we think we're well positioned there.
And for us, if you look at our performance, and I think we've got this in the appendix, Paul, we've improved our relative margin cost position from mid-Q3 to mid-Q2 off the back of improving costs at Kumba, the good production performance at Minas-Rio and the improvement in price premiums that we've received for our products. So Peter and the guys are doing good work along with the operators in making sure that we're delivering the right product consistently into the market, and we're going to keep trying to drive that position to the left across the portfolio. 
There's always a debate about macro trends. And we're having the debates, as you'd expect, and trying to think about how we position our business in those trends. Again, we think the focus on quality, and in particular margins, are going to the absolutely critical. It's the best way to insulate yourself from things that you might not understand or might not anticipate.
The way we look at things, again, changes in population, that 9 billion population will look very different as well in terms of urbanization. The last few years, we've seen 1.4 billion people move to cities and there's another -- there will be another 1.4 billion moved to cities over the next 18 years. So from that point of view, we look at demographics, aging population, the urbanization, the rise of the middle class, climate change, carbon reduction, the rise of renewables, transportation fuels and the circular economy, and that includes recycling, and that will increase particularly across bulks through the recycling of steel, high-quality primary feeds, new business models. 50% of our portfolio by production consists of greener and consumer-facing commodities, and I think that's a unique mix in our industry. And it's one that we think, from a strategic point of view, will play out in more conversations around our sector.
And the environmental benefits that we have in the portfolio and the research work that we're doing through the R&D programs we have across precious metals are going to be very important. And certainly now, with people talking about platinum, palladium being used in lithium batteries, they are important developments and developments we're at the forefront of with other players, investing and making sure that we create opportunities for our product. And certainly, Chris is well up to speed in driving many of those changes through his leadership in the Platinum Guild and other of the consumer-facing entities that we work with in the PGM space.
So for us, we think strategically about the commodity mix and we think tactically in terms of making sure we got the best operations, and we are building a business that is resilient for the long term. It's a unique product mix. It's a high-quality product mix. And it's one we're going to keep improving and growing as we go forward.
In terms of the focus on quality, and I might just explain that the chart actually shows, on the x-axis, the volume that we produce relative to our competitors in those markets. So you'll see in terms of diamonds, we are right up there with -- and no prizes for guessing who's up there. That's ALROSA producing a few more carats. But certainly, the value per carat that we produce really does set us apart. And we believe, longer term, the real price activity and potential for value sits more in the high-value areas. Of course, diamonds, we think, as Argyle and other operations close, the prognosis for the whole diamond market is very positive medium to longer term. But again, we think we're placed very powerfully in the market with that quality mix.
In iron ore, again, a strong player -- a strong quality player. We're not the biggest, but we'd like to think that we're heading towards being the best depending on how you measure that. We've still got a long way to go, but certainly, the improving cost position has helped improved our margins. 
In PGMs, again, just off being the largest producer, but again, our focus on quality is about discipline, making sure we're driving returns. And certainly, if you want to differentiate us, it's around that focus on margin and returns. 
And again in the met coal, very competitive on the cost, pretty good-sized producer, but very much focused on making sure we're at the top end and demanding a product premium for our quality, consistent with the value that we're delivering to our customers. And again, it's about this quality focus across the assets and across our products. It's very important and we think is a significant differentiator for us in the future.
And so to summarize our investment proposition. We've got world-class assets with attractive and carefully phased growth options. We are building leading capabilities in operations, new technologies and the marketing of our products for value. And our returns are underpinned by ensuring that our focus on capital discipline is maintained, irrespective of where products are -- product prices are on the day. And we've got to make sure that we -- and we're focused with the Board that we're delivering consistent returns on capital and of capital to our shareholders.
And with that, happy to take questions."

And so the majority of that cash is, in fact, held in London in US dollars and used as part of general group liquidity. And so from a day-to-day point of view, it really has little impact on how we manage the business. Obviously, yes, we accumulated the $5.1 billion, but there's probably not many of you in the room predicting iron ore to remain at $120. And obviously, the thermal coal prices have eased through the time frame as well. 
So yes, we've had great cash flow. Lovely problem to have. To pay that $800 million for the base dividend, we'll use a little bit in excess of $1 billion given the minorities in Kumba and Platts. And obviously, we'll use the $1 billion in terms of the buyback. So you'll see a significant stepdown. Lovely problem to have before you're in it again. Then we consider things.

We haven't made a final call on where we will go, but certainly pretty clear where we're working ourselves towards given the shorter life of those assets.

As long as there is downstream demand, the issues that are going on in the midstream, all things being equal and us being very careful with volume and price, you would expect them to play themselves out over a period of time. It really depends on consumer demand in the downstream markets, particularly in Q4. And so we'll watch those carefully. But as we sit here, demand isn't in a bad space.

I think we managed mostly to get through that without losing mine production. Most of the refined production has been pushed into the second half of this year, so I think we should still get most of that production this year.
I think the big issue for us is -- has been the increase. We've seen a 14% increase in electricity prices. That's 3x inflation. Next year, it's likely to go down to 10%, but I think we can pencil in higher Eskom prices for the next number of years. And that's also some of the reasons why Tony and myself and the group are working at seeing what else we can do our around solar generation of power ourselves. But for now, I think we've gone through the winter months without load shedding. And I think that was to be expected because we don't do any maintenance -- or Eskom doesn't do any maintenance in the winter periods. So expect as it comes to summer that it might actually get a bit tighter than it feels now, and that's not what most folk are thinking about. 
So I think, Mark, nothing really new. Prices are high or the charges are high. We're all managing as best we can. We're all engaging, and one of the things also, I think, that we participate as Anglo American is in the technical assistance to Eskom. So we put in place a team to go help -- a technical team to help Eskom just to go through all of their assets. That was only ever meant to be feedback to Eskom. So we don't really have the kind of feedback that we would like, but that feedback has gone into Eskom, and I think Anglo American has played a big role in that regard."

So if you've got an underground operation, ventilation would be 40%. Energy would be 40% -- sorry, ventilation is 40% of the energy consumption. And it's 24 hours a day. So I think we are structurally advantaged because of where and how we set the operations up. Some of that's by luck. Some of that's by design.

Working capital, here, it went up by $600 million. Two components. The first was $400 million in receivables that I spoke about as good as it gets in terms of an increase because of price and because of Minas-Rio coming back on.

But it's not more than that from what we consider today, but let's wait and see the next 3 or 4 months.
Second point, on the 1 million tonnes, the work on the technology side, absolutely critical to making sure that we've got the water. So a 50% reduction through the implementation of coarse particle flotation, the ore sorting, coarse particle flotation and those technology changes is the key to the 1 million tonnes. And we're well on track with that research work. El Soldado will be the first site that we actually do. Tony, I think we start construction towards the end of the year but it won't be until next year before we see it commission."

I'm just wondering what you're seeing amongst your competitors there. Is there a similar sort of response to the weakness in the market? Or are you sort of going it alone or are you doing all the heavy lifting for the market? 
The second question was on the sort of PGM price. So I know iron ore is at extraordinary levels, but then, at the same time, if you look sort of platinum-to-palladium ratio, that's a kind of mirror image story to the other side. I mean should we be expecting that likewise to renormalize at some point? Or has that been a sort of real -- or is this sort of shift that we've seen in the market now again, should we regard that as the new normal? 
And then the sort of last question is, it's just -- I'm just struggling on sort of Slide 26 with the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 at the bottom of the cycle. I mean given we've got $3.4 billion of net debt, should I imply that you think bottom-of-the-cycle EBITDA is about $2.3 billion? Or how should I -- elsewise should I think about that slide?"

I'm always careful about talking about competitors in the diamond space. Look, from our point of view, on a value basis, we are the largest player in the diamond market. And we make judgments against what we see in the market and we take cognizance of that. Our partner and our shareholder, the Botswana Government, is also very sensitive to the long-term view of diamond. So we take positions for the long term. Others sometimes follow, sometimes don't. We don't talk to them. Whether they're pulling their own weight, let others make that judgment. From our point of view, it's important we're the leader. We take the positions. And what we've done in the last few years seems to have worked reasonably well, although the behavior elsewhere has been mixed. And we don't assume that it will be any different looking forward.
The other one, on palladium and platinum, I'm going to be very careful here because the last time I opened my mouth on palladium, recall there was a bubble. Look, if I can say that the palladium price reflects demand and supply and that -- look, the market has appeared to have been short of palladium and we're seeing in that price. Whether switching will occur over time? Probably. But then we would see an improvement in the platinum price. The way we think about PGM prices is we look at rhodium being, I guess, the most reactive and the most valued in terms of end-use applications, then platinum and then palladium. And palladium has a very specific application nearer the engine block in terms of heat and performance, and so it's got specific value in its own right. 
So it's going to move between the 3. And the thing I've learned in the business from Chris and the guys is that, they don't tend to move all down in one sway. When the market's tough, you might get that. Well, there will probably be adjustments. But we do well -- if you take an average price across the commodity -- or across the 3, we do well $900 and above to extremely well. And at the moment, we're at about $1,200 on the balance, but it's even probably a bit higher. And it's not going to swing away too far from that anytime soon.
