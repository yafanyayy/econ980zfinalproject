Allegion saw another quarter of strong top line revenue growth with strength across all regions. 
The Americas saw strong volumes in the nonresidential business as end-market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. 
EMEIA and Asia Pacific saw organic growth rates in the mid-single digits. Acquisitions continue to be to contribute to the total company revenue growth. Our electronics growth moderated in the fourth quarter with the Americas seeing approximately 7% growth. 
Residential electronics performed well. However, the nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to the timing of large orders. 
We had full year electronics growth of high-teens in the Americas with strength in both parts of the business. We see the electronics outlook continue to be a long-term positive trend as more and more products become connected for ease of access. 
As I stated earlier, nonresidential U.S. end markets remain healthy with particular strength in institutional verticals. We do see residential new construction softening that we expect us to be mitigated by electronics and channel initiatives to drive above-market growth. 
The quartersaw continued inflationary pressures, which we believe will ease in 2019. Commodities have leveled off, and we project have another solid year in the price realization with particular strength in our Americas nonresidential businesses. In the fourth quarter, we delivered nearly 10% adjusted EPS growth, bringing the full year expansion to approximately 14% as we drove a robust 37% increase in available cash flow, which totaled more than $400 million for the year.
Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the revenue performance in both the quarter and the full year. Additionally, while operating margins could have been better, I'm satisfied with the growth in EPS that we delivered in the quarter and the full year.
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk through the fourth quarter financial summary. 
In Q4, Allegion delivered strong top line revenue growth. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $702.4 million, an increase of 12.4%, inclusive of organic growth of 6.7%. Acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact.
All regions grew organically. Americas has led the way with organic growth of 7.6% in the quarter, driven by strength in our nonresidential business. The EMEIA region saw organic growth of 4.3%, driven by performance in the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. Asia Pacific had a nice quarter of organic growth coming in at 4.6% against the tough comparables.
Adjusted operating margin decreased by 130 basis points due to the dilution related to the acquisitions made in 2018. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, the base operating margins were up 20 basis points. 
Inflationary headwinds continue to pressure margins and exceeded price and productivity in the quarter. The company is committed to driving price realization and productivity actions, such that for 2019, the price productivity inflation dynamic is expected to be positive, helping to drive margin expansion across all regions of the business.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 increased $0.11 or nearly 10% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by higher operating income, along with a favorable year-over-year tax rate. Available cash flow for the year came in over $408 million, an increase of 31% over prior year. Increased earnings and the nonrecurring 2017 discretionary pension funding drove the increase. Please go to Slide 6.
Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to talk a little about some of the things we're doing in the Connected Home Space. In 2015, Schlage with the first Smart Locks to respond to open my watch. include is the with the key by Amazon have and ring devices without even WiFi. It's built right into the lock. With Schlage Encode, we took a different approach to development. Starting first with the connected home platform and developing the lock around the desired user experience. The user first approach is part of our strategic plan to develop and integrate with leaders in connected home platforms. 
In addition, we recently announced the Schlage Connect Z-Wave plus enhancement and its compatibility with the room and Schlage Connect Zigbee-certified locks with support home automation systems. 
Our deep experience in connected home security has made us go-to partner for a wide variety of platforms and home automation solutions, including Amazon, Ring, alarm.com, Google and Apple. We will continue to build relationships to benefit consumers and accelerate adoptions of Schlage Smart Locks. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our full year 2019 outlook."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2018. Our focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 6.7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which delivered 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets. 
EMEIA and Asia Pacific saw our continued momentum with mid-single digit organic growth. Pricing for Allegion in the quarter came in at 1.5%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and any additional tariff impacts. Also, during the fourth quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 7% growth, and foreign currency was a slight headwind in all 3 regions.
With the fourth quarter performance, you can see where we ended up for the full year on revenue growth. We delivered more than 13% total revenue growth with double-digit top line growth in all 3 regions. Organic growth came in at 6%, led by the Americas at nearly 7%. 
Please go to Slide #8.
Reported net revenues for the fourth quarter were $702.4 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 12.7% versus the prior year, up 6.7% on an organic basis. 
Our adjusted operating income of $145.2 million, increased nearly 6% over the same time frame from last year. 
Adjusted operating margin of 20.7% decreased 130 basis points with a decrease driven by dilution from acquisitions. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margin on the base business was up 20 basis points year-over-year.
Total inflation exceeded price plus productivity by approximately $2.5 million and was dilutive to our adjusted operating margins by 70 basis points. We are committed to driving the price, productivity, inflation dynamics positive in 2019 to the following actions: price realization, improved productivity and operational efficiencies, acquisition integration performance, and softening inflation during the year. 
Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 40 basis points impact on adjusted operating margins. As discussed, these incremental investments accelerate top line growth.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, reported earnings per share was $0.10. Adjusting $1.01 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration costs related acquisitions, charges related to U.S. Tax Reform and debt refinancing, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.11. 
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as variable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impact.
Favorable year-over-year tax rate drove another $0.07 with the variability driven primarily by lower tax rate associated with tax reform, along with favorable discrete items. 
Acquisitions were a $0.01 drag in the quarter reflecting anticipated performance associated with QMI acquisition in Europe. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending continue to drive above-market growth and are providing solid returns on our investment. The combination of interest expense other income and noncontrolling expenses decreased earnings per share by $0.03. These results in adjusted fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.22, an increase of $0.11 or nearly 10% compared to the prior year period.
Lastly, we have a $0.17 per share benefit, primarily driven by adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform, which more than offset reductions for charges related to acquisition and restructuring. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at fourth quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.39.
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $492.7 million, up 13% on a reported basis, and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong volume in the nonresidential business as well as continued pricing benefits. The net earnings growth for the quarter was approximately 7%. Residential Electronics in the quarter performed well. However, nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to timing of large orders. For the full year, growth in electronics products were solid coming in at high-teens with the strength of both residential and nonresidential products. Price realization in the quarter was 1.5%. Pricing in the nonresidential business was strong, offset by residential promotional activities.
The nonresidential business grew low double digits excluding acquisitions. Residential growth was flat in the quarter with strength in electronics, offset by some cannibalization of the mechanical business. Acquisitions added nearly 6% to total revenue.
Americas adjusted operating income of $131.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 190 basis points. The 2018 acquisitions continue to be dilutive as expected, and had a 120 basis point impact. Inflation incremental investments exceeded price plus productivity in the quarter. Strong volume leverage and positive earnings partially offset these impacts.
Pleased go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $157.4 million, up 4.4% and up 4.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter and strength in electronics led by the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The impact of acquisitions offset currency headwinds.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $22.5 million decreased approximately 10% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 230 basis points, driven primarily by dilution from acquisitions. 
As stated earlier, the poor acquisition performance was driven by our QMI business, which experienced reduced revenues in a challenging market environment, a significant mix shift to lower-margin business, along with some operational inefficiencies.
We have identified areas of opportunity and have commenced plans to get the QMI business back to profitability. Operational performance improvement will gradually occur throughout the course of 2019. 
In addition, inflation and incremental investments slightly exceeded price plus productivity. Strong volume leverage offsets these some of these unfavorable impact. 
Please go to Slide #12.
Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $52.3 million, up 44.9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue continue to rebound, growing nicely at 4.6% against a tough comparable. Total revenue growth was driven by the GWA door and access business acquisition. Foreign currency was a headwind for the quarter. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $6.5 million, an increase of nearly $2 million with adjusted operating margins down 60 basis points versus the prior year period. Dilution from acquisitions drove the margin decline. The base business adjusted operating margins were up 120 basis points with price and productivity more than offsetting the unfavorable impacts from inflation, and incremental investments.
Good volume leverage was able to offset negative mix. Please go to Slide #13.
Available cash flow for 2018 came in at $408.7 million, which is an increase of $110.8 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher net earnings, along with the nonrecurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017. 
Available cash flow continues to remain strong and exceeded prior estimates. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in fourth quarter 2018, when compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to the recently acquired businesses. And while working capital as a percent of revenue saw slight increase, we did see a reduction in the cash conversion cycle. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. 
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for review our full year 2019 outlook."

We continue to see favorable trends on our primary end markets in 2019. And as our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute will, again, deliver better than market growth. We also believe the electronic portfolio will continue to outpace mechanical in all regions, and we're well positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by the institutional markets. We expect the general trend toward electronic products to continue, which help mitigate the softening that we are expecting in residential new construction. 
With these expectations, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6%. We are projecting Americas total revenue expansion to also be 5% to 6% with any remaining impact from the 2018 acquisitions to be offset by currency headwinds.
For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronics business to more than offset weaknesses in southern Europe and the United Kingdom. 
For the region, we project organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Currency headwinds are expected to more than offset acquisition benefits, bringing expected total revenue in EMEIA region to flat to 2%. 
In Asia Pacific, we continued to see a healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. 
Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 4% to 6%, and total revenue growth is estimated to be 22% to 24%, reflecting the full year impact of the acquisition of Gainsborough Hardware and API. 
All in, we are projecting total growth of the company at 5% to 6% and our organic growth also of 5% to 6%. Please go to Slide 15.
Our 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.75 to $4.90, an increase of approximately 6% to 9%. 
As indicated, the earnings increase is driven by revenue growth and operational improvements as adjusted operating earnings are expected to increase 10% to 14%. 
Inflationary pressures will continue to be a headwind in the first half of the year, but we anticipate pricing and productivity actions to help drive margin expansion for 2019.
Incremental investments continue to be a headwind as we continue to focus on accelerating new product development and channel initiatives, which we believe, enable us to keep delivery above-market growth and allowing us to take advantage of the shifting customer preference is to electronic products.
Other expenses are expected to be a drag on EPS, primarily driven by pension expense. Our outlook assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 16%, an increase from 13.5% in 2018, an outstanding diluted shares of approximately 95.5 million. 
The outlook also includes a $0.15 per share impact from restructuring charges and acquisition-related cost during the year. 
As a result, reporting EPS is estimated to be $4.60 million to $4.70. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2019 to be in the $430 million to $450 million range. Please go to Slide 16.
We are very pleased with our 2018 top line growth delivered organic revenue expansion of 6%, driven by electronics which you see is a positive trend for us in the future. While operating margin could have been better, we did deliver full year adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14% in 2018, and we saw a robust 37% increase in available cash flow to more than $400 million.
As we look to 2019, we expect to drive continued organic growth of above market. We also expect to deliver solid growth in adjusted EPS and generate substantial available cash flow. We are well positioned for 2019 and are committed to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive.
I want to finish by saying that 2018 also marks the Allegion's first 5 years as an independent company. 
From the beginning, we told customers, shareholders and employees we would deliver sustained profitable growth and greater value. We have delivered industry-leading organic growth at our 5-year CAGR of 5.6%. 
We had industry-leading margins. We have focused on the safety of our employees, health of our employees and employee engagement. We've invested in the business, especially in electronics and are positioned nicely for the future. Allegion is a company, our shareholders can be proud to own. Now Patrick, and I will be happy to take your questions."

Pricing and residential was lower than it's anticipated, primarily due to promotional activities and some rebates and those types of things, and that ebbs and flows during the course of the year occasionally. So a little bit lower pricing than anticipated in the residential slide. On the productivity, continue to get good productivity, particularly on materials. Inflation was more than anticipated, not so much on the raw materials, but more on the nonmaterial side. So inefficiencies associated with nonmaterials on manufacturing, those type of things. As we look forward to 2019, we believe, we have a very strong pipeline in terms of productivity, on both material and productivity projects from a manufacturing perspective. The dynamic will become positive in 2019, and it will continue to get better during the course of the year, particularly on the inflation side, where as you know, the commodities have kind of stabilized today relative to where they were in Q3. But it starts almost become deflation in the second half of the year. So that will benefit us as we progress throughout 2019."

So the expectation was that the pricing was going to come down sequentially. 1.5% is still pretty strong. When we look at how the rest of the market is performing. Commercial, we continue to perform extremely well, very pleased with how the team is pushing price there and remaining competitive on bid code activity. Decline may be a little bit lighter than expected, and again, it relates to the residential business on the promotional activities and the sell-through to the consumer. So I don't look at that as a necessary a longer-term impact going to 2019 would expect pricing to remain robust and would expect us to be able to deliver kind of the 1.5% increase year-over-year in 2019 relative to 2018."

So I'm just wondering how much of what you're seeing is response to the new market versus some channel fill by some other folks. Just trying to get my hands around how much of this is short-term noise versus something that's more of a market-driven weakness over time?"

Should we think about that as kind of the catch up from 4Q, if I were to include that in 4Q and say that price cost or some of the other irritation items wouldn't have happened, you would have had a more normal incremental in 4Q, it looks like you're touching that rapid '19.

The inflation dynamic is subsiding, particularly on the material side. That will benefit us as well. We've got a strong pipeline of productivity actions that we're going to implement. We've got some areas of opportunity for improvement, I call it self-help on the M&A integration that we performed lower than anticipated. And then we initiated some restructuring activities that will help reduce our cost base as well. So collectively, when you add all that together, I think, we're well positioned to execute on margin improvements across all regions of the business.

I think we're well positioned there. If you look at our capital allocation strategy, 3 pillars; organic investment, M&A, shareholder distribution. On the organic investments, we talked about that we're going to continue to invest in the business opportunities that will expand our channel presence, getting more of the world from our distribution base as well as expanding new products through R&D efforts and those types of things, promotional items, demand creation. That's baked in our earnings per share, and we'll continue to manage that with nice earnings growth going forward. So your question on the M&A, I mean, as Dave mentioned, we executed a lot of acquisitions in 2018. There is opportunities to continue to drive performance in those and spend maybe a little bit more time, continued to integrate those. And if you look at our history, in terms of acquisition performance, they really start perform nicely in kind of 2 to 3 years out you have to look at this from a long-term basis, and we'll continue to drive that execution. Having said that, we will continue to remain active and looking at opportunities to expand our business either through new products or geographic expansion. Our pipeline remains robust. But the key is will be discipline. And we will only do transactions that we believe will provide a good return on invested capital going forward for us. Shareholder distribution, we're not going to forecast. We've already said, we're going to said utilize the capital that we generate to either do M&A or shareholder distributions through the incremental dividend. You mentioned 29% increase this year, and you can probably see us being more active on share buyback right now, and we're going to execute our capital allocation strategy to provide the best return we can for our shareholders going forward. That could be either M&A or shareholder distribution or a combination of there."

We'll see where it goes going forward, but I think we're okay for '19. And as it relates to interest deductibility, relative to the U.S. tax reform in 2017, that does impact us a little bit from a cash tax perspective, and that's baked in our available cash flow numbers. So our cash taxes because of some of the limitation will always be higher than our book provision."

Allegion saw another quarter of strong top line revenue growth with strength across all regions. The Americas saw strong volumes in the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. EMEIA and Asia Pacific saw organic growth rates in the mid-single digits. Acquisitions continue to be -- to contribute to the total company revenue growth.
Electronics growth moderated in the fourth quarter, with the Americas seeing approximately 7% growth. Residential electronics performed well. However, the nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to the timing of large orders. We had full year electronics growth of high-teens in the Americas, with strength in both parts of the business. We see the electronics outlook continue to be a long-term positive trend as more and more products become connected for ease of access.
As I stated earlier, nonresidential U.S. end markets remain healthy with particular strength in institutional verticals. We do see residential new construction softening, but we expect this to be mitigated by electronics and channel initiatives to drive above-market growth.
The quarter saw continued inflationary pressures, which we believe will ease in 2019. Commodities have leveled off, and we project to have another solid year in price realization with particular strength in our Americas nonresidential businesses. In the fourth quarter, we delivered nearly 10% adjusted EPS growth, bringing the full year expansion to approximately 14%, as we drove a robust 37% increase in available cash flow, which totaled more than $400 million for the year.
Overall, I am extremely pleased with the revenue performance in both the quarter and the full year. Additionally, while operating margin could have been better, I'm satisfied with the growth in EPS that we delivered in the quarter and the full year.
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk through the fourth quarter financial summary. In Q4, Allegion delivered strong top line revenue growth. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $702.4 million, an increase of 12.4% (sic) [ 12.7% ] inclusive of organic growth of 6.7%. Acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact. All regions grew organically. Americas led the way with organic growth of 7.6% in the quarter, driven by strength in our nonresidential business. The EMEIA region saw organic growth of 4.3%, driven by performance in the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. Asia Pacific had a nice quarter of organic growth coming in at 4.6% against a tough comparable.
Adjusted operating margin decreased by 130 basis points due to the dilution related to acquisitions made in 2018. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, the base operating margins were up 20 basis points.
Inflationary headwinds continued to pressure margins and exceeded price and productivity in the quarter. The company is committed to driving price realization and productivity actions, such that for 2019 the price productivity inflation dynamic is expected to be positive, helping to drive margin expansion across all regions of the business.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 increased $0.11 or nearly 10% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by higher operating income along with a favorable year-over-year tax rate. Available cash flow for the year came in over $408 million, an increase of more than 37% versus prior year. Increased earnings and the nonrecurring 2017 discretionary pension funding drove the increase.
Please go to Slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to talk a little about some of the things we are doing in the Connected Home space. In 2015, Schlage with the first smart lock to respond to ""hey Siri, open my lock."" Now Schlage Encode is the first lock to work with the Key by Amazon app and Ring devices without needing a Wi-Fi hub. It's built right into the lock. With Schlage Encode, we took a different approach to development, starting first with the Connected Home platform and developing the lock around the desired user experience. The user-first approach is part of our strategic plan to develop and integrate with leaders in Connected Home platforms.
In addition, we recently announced the Schlage Connect Z-Wave Plus enhancement and its compatibility with Ring, and Schlage Connect Zigbee-certified locks with support home automation systems.
Our deep experience in connected home security has made us a go-to partner for a wide variety of platforms and home automation solutions, including Amazon, Ring, Alarm.com, Google and Apple. We will continue to build relationships to benefit consumers and accelerate adoption of Schlage smart products.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our full year 2019 outlook."

Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please, go to Slide #7, this slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2018.

If you would, please, go to Slide #7, this slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2018. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 6.7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which delivered 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets.
EMEIA and Asia Pacific saw continued momentum with mid-single digit organic growth. Pricing for Allegion in the quarter came in at 1.5%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and any additional tariff impacts. Also during the fourth quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 7% growth, and foreign currency was a slight headwind in all 3 regions.
With the fourth quarter performance, you can see where we ended up for the full year on revenue growth. We delivered more than 13% total revenue growth, with double-digit top line growth in all 3 regions. Organic growth came in at 6%, led by the Americas at nearly 7%. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the fourth quarter were $702.4 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 12.7% versus the prior year, up 6.7% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $145.2 million increased nearly 6% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 20.7% decreased 130 basis points with a decrease driven by dilution from acquisitions. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margin on the base business was up 20 basis points year-over-year.
Total inflation exceeded price plus productivity by approximately $2.5 million and was dilutive to adjusted operating margins by 70 basis points. We are committed to driving the price, productivity, inflation dynamic positive in 2019 through the following actions: price realization; improve productivity and operational efficiencies; acquisition integration performance; and softening inflation during the year.
Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. As discussed, these incremental investments accelerate top line growth.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, reported earnings per share was $0.10. Adjusting $1.01 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration costs related to acquisitions, charges related to U.S. Tax Reform and debt refinancing, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.11.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impact.
Favorable year-over-year tax rate drove another $0.07 with the favorability driven primarily by lower tax rates associated with tax reform along with favorable discrete items.
Acquisitions were a $0.01 drag in the quarter, reflecting worse-than-anticipated performance associated with the QMI acquisition in Europe. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending continue to drive above-market growth and are providing solid returns on our investment. The combination of interest expense, other income and noncontrolling interest decreased earnings per share by $0.03. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.22, an increase of $0.11 or nearly 10% compared to the prior year period.
Lastly, we have a $0.17 per share benefit primarily driven by adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform, which more than offset reductions for charges related to acquisitions and restructuring. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at fourth quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.39.
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $492.7 million, up 13% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong volume in the nonresidential business as well as continued pricing benefit. The electronics growth for the quarter was approximately 7%. Residential electronics in the quarter performed well. However, nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to timing of large orders. For the full year, growth in electronic products was solid coming in at high-teens, with strength of both residential and nonresidential products. Price realization in the quarter was 1.5%. Pricing in the nonresidential business was strong, offset by residential promotional activities. The nonresidential business grew low double digits excluding acquisitions. Residential growth was flat in the quarter with strength in electronics, offset by some cannibalization of the mechanical business. Acquisitions added nearly 6% to total revenue.
Americas adjusted operating income of $131.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 190 basis points. The 2018 acquisitions continue to be dilutive, as expected, and had a 120 basis point impact. Inflation and incremental investments exceeded price plus productivity in the quarter. Strong volume leverage and positive mix partially offset these impacts.
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $157.4 million, up 4.4% and up 4.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter and strength in electronics led by the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The impact of acquisitions offset currency headwinds. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $22.5 million decreased approximately 10% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 230 basis points, driven primarily by dilution from acquisitions. As stated earlier, the poor acquisition performance was driven by our QMI business, which experienced reduced revenues in a challenging market environment, a significant mix shift to lower-margin business along with some operational inefficiencies. We have identified areas of opportunity and have commenced plans to get the QMI business back to profitability. Operational performance improvement will gradually occur throughout the course of 2019. In addition, inflation and incremental investments slightly exceeded price plus productivity. Strong volume leverage offsets some of these unfavorable impacts.
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $52.3 million, up 44.9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue continued to rebound, growing nicely at 4.6% against a tough comparable. Total revenue growth was driven by the GWA Door & Access business acquisition. Foreign currency was a headwind for the quarter.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $6.5 million, an increase of nearly $2 million with adjusted operating margins down 60 basis points versus the prior year period. Dilution from acquisitions drove the margin decline. The base business adjusted operating margins were up 120 basis points with price and productivity more than offsetting the unfavorable impacts from inflation and incremental investments. Good volume leverage was able to offset negative mix.
Please go to Slide #13. Available cash flow for 2018 came in at $408.7 million, which is an increase of $110.8 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher net earnings along with the nonrecurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017. Available cash flow continues to remain strong and exceeded prior estimates. Working capital, as a percent of revenues, increased slightly in fourth quarter 2018 when compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to the recently acquired businesses. And while working capital, as a percent of revenue, saw a slight increase, we did see a reduction in the cash conversion cycle. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for review on our full year 2019 outlook."

We continue to see favorable trends in our primary end markets in 2019. And it's our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will, again, deliver better-than-market growth. We also believe the electronic portfolio will continue to outpace mechanical in all regions, and we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by the institutional markets. We expect the general trend toward electronic products to continue, which will help mitigate the softening that we are expecting in residential new construction.
With these expectations, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6%. We are projecting Americas total revenue expansion to also be 5% to 6% with any remaining impact from the 2018 acquisitions to be offset by currency headwinds.
For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronics business to more than offset weaknesses in Southern Europe and the United Kingdom. For the region, we project organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Currency headwinds are expected to more than offset acquisition benefits, bringing expected total revenue growth in EMEIA region to flat to 2%.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see a healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 4% to 6%, and total revenue growth is estimated to be 22% to 24%, reflecting the full year impact of the acquisition of Gainsborough Hardware and API.
All in, we are projecting total growth of the company at 5% to 6% and organic growth also at 5% to 6%. 
Please go to Slide 15. Our 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.75 to $4.90, an increase of approximately 6% to 9%. As indicated, the earnings increase is driven by revenue growth and operational improvements as adjusted operating earnings are expected to increase 10% to 14%. Inflationary pressures will continue to be a headwind in the first half of the year, but we anticipate pricing and productivity actions to help drive margin expansion for 2019. Incremental investments continue to be a headwind as we continue to focus on accelerating new product development and channel initiatives, which, we believe, enable us to keep delivering above-market growth and allowing us to take advantage of the shifting customer preferences to electronic products.
Other expense is expected to be a drag on EPS, primarily driven by pension expense. Our outlook assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 16%, an increase from 13.5% in 2018, and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 95.5 million. The outlook also includes a $0.15 per share impact from restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs during the year. As a result, reported EPS is estimated to be $4.60 million to $4.75. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2019 to be in the $430 million to $450 million range.
Please go to Slide 16. We are very pleased with our 2018 top line growth that delivered organic revenue expansion of 6%, driven by electronics, which we see is a positive trend for us in the future. While operating margin could have been better, we did deliver full year adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14% in 2018, and we saw a robust 37% increase in available cash flow to more than $400 million.
As we look to 2019, we expect to drive continual organic growth above market. We also expect to deliver solid growth in adjusted EPS and generate substantial available cash flow. We are well positioned for 2019 and are committed to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive.
I want to finish by saying that 2018 also marks Allegion's first 5 years as an independent company. From the beginning, we told customers, shareholders and employees we would deliver sustained profitable growth and greater value. We have delivered industry-leading organic growth at a 5-year CAGR of 5.6%. We had industry-leading margins. We have focused on the safety of our employees, health of our employees and employee engagement. We invested in the business, especially in electronics, and are positioned nicely for the future. Allegion is a company our shareholders can be proud to own.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

So Josh, I would characterize it as follows; we commented really good strength in pricing in the commercial area. Pricing on residential was lower than it's anticipated, primarily due to promotional activities and some rebates and those types of things, and that ebbs and flows during the course of the year occasionally. So a little bit lower pricing than anticipated in the residential side. On the productivity, continue to get good productivity, particularly on materials. Inflation was more than anticipated, not so much on the raw materials, but more on the nonmaterial side. So inefficiencies associated with nonmaterials on manufacturing, those type of things. As we look forward to 2019, we believe, we have a very strong pipeline in terms of productivity, on both material and productivity projects from a manufacturing perspective. The dynamic will become positive in 2019 and it will continue to get better during the course of the year, particularly on the inflation side, where, as you know, the commodities have kind of stabilized today relative to where they were in Q3. But the -- it starts to almost become deflation in the second half of the year. So that will benefit us as we progress throughout 2019."

And the reason for that is, because in Q3, we basically had the effect of 2 price increases. And then remember, we pulled forward the price increase at the beginning of the quarter; in 2017, you had a price increase that went into effect in August, and so you had effect of 2 price increases, if you will, for one of the months in the quarter. So the expectation was that the pricing was going to come down sequentially. 1.5% is still pretty strong, when we look at how the rest of the market is performing. Commercial, we continue to perform extremely well, very pleased with how the team is pushing price there and remaining competitive on bid quote activity. The decline may be a little bit lighter than expected, and again, it relates to the residential business on the promotional activities and the sell-through to the consumer. So I don't look at that as necessarily a longer-term impact. Going into 2019, would expect pricing to remain robust and would expect us to be able to deliver kind of the 1.5% increase year-over-year in 2019 relative to 2018."

We've got some areas of opportunity for improvement, I'd call self-help, on the M&A integration that we performed lower than anticipated. And then we've initiated some restructuring activities that will help reduce our cost base as well. So collectively, when you add all that together, I think we're well positioned to execute on margin improvement across all regions of the business.

So you know I would start off by saying from a capital structure perspective, as you guys know, we ended the year in the best position since spin in terms of our leverage ratio, which provides us with a lot of optionality and flexibility going forward. I just think we're well positioned there. If you look at our capital allocation strategy, 3 pillars: organic investments; M&A; shareholder distribution. On the organic investments, we talked about that, we're going to continue to invest in the business for opportunities that will expand our channel presence, getting more of the wallet from our distribution base as well as expanding new products through R&D efforts and those type of things, promotional items, demand creation. That's baked in our earnings per share, and we'll continue to manage that with nice earnings growth going forward. So your question on the M&A, I mean, as Dave mentioned, we executed a lot of acquisitions in 2018. There's opportunities to continue to drive performance in those and spend maybe a little bit more time continuing to integrate those. And if you look at our history, in terms of acquisition performance, they really start to perform nicely kind of 2 to 3 years out, so you have to look at these more on a long-term basis, and we'll continue to drive that execution. Having said that, we will continue to remain active and looking at opportunities to expand our business either through new products or geographic expansion. Our pipeline remains robust. But the key is we'll be disciplined. And we'll only do transactions that we believe will provide a good return on invested capital going forward, of course. Shareholder distribution, we're not going to forward cash. And we've always said, we're going to utilize the capital that we generate to either do M&A or shareholder distributions through the incremental dividend. You mentioned 29% increase this year, and you can probably see us being more active on share buyback right now, and we're going to execute our capital allocation strategy to provide the best return we can for our shareholders going forward, and that could be either M&A or shareholder distribution or a combination of there -- of those."

Allegion saw another quarter of strong top line revenue growth with strength across all regions. The Americas saw strong volumes in the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. EMEIA and Asia Pacific saw organic growth rates in the mid-single digits. Acquisitions continue to contribute to total company revenue growth.
Electronics growth moderated in the fourth quarter, with the Americas seeing approximately 7% growth. Residential electronics performed well. However, the nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to the timing of large orders. We had full year electronics growth of high-teens in the Americas with strength in both parts of the business. We see the electronics outlook continue to be a long-term positive trend as more and more products become connected for ease of access.
As I stated earlier, nonresidential U.S. end markets remain healthy with particular strength in institutional verticals. We do see residential new construction softening, but we expect this to be mitigated by electronics and channel initiatives to drive above-market growth.
The quarter saw continued inflationary pressures, which we believe will ease in 2019. Commodities have leveled off, and we project to have another solid year in price realization with particular strength in our Americas nonresidential businesses. In the fourth quarter, we delivered nearly 10% adjusted EPS growth, bringing the full year expansion to approximately 14% as we drove a robust 37% increase in available cash flow, which totaled more than $400 million for the year.
Overall, I am extremely pleased with the revenue performance in both the quarter and the full year. Additionally, while operating margin could have been better, I'm satisfied with the growth in EPS that we delivered in the quarter and the full year.
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk through the fourth quarter financial summary. In Q4, Allegion delivered strong top line revenue growth. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $702.4 million, an increase of 12.4% (sic) [ 12.7% ] inclusive of our organic growth of 6.7%. Acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact. 
All regions grew organically. Americas led the way with organic growth of 7.6% in the quarter, driven by strength in our nonresidential business. The EMEIA region saw organic growth of 4.3%, driven by performance in the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. Asia Pacific had a nice quarter of organic growth, coming in at 4.6% against a tough comparable.
Adjusted operating margin decreased by 130 basis points due to the dilution related to acquisitions made in 2018. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, the base operating margins were up 20 basis points.
Inflationary headwinds continued to pressure margins and exceeded price and productivity in the quarter. The company is committed to driving price realization and productivity actions, such that, for 2019, the price productivity inflation dynamic is expected to be positive, helping to drive margin expansion across all regions of the business.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 increased $0.11 or nearly 10% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by higher operating income along with a favorable year-over-year tax rate. Available cash flow for the year came in over $408 million, an increase of more than 37% versus prior year. Increased earnings and the nonrecurring 2017 discretionary pension funding drove the increase.
Please go to Slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to talk a little about some of the things we are doing in the Connected Home space. In 2015, Schlage was the first smart lock to respond to ""Hey Siri, open my lock."" Now Schlage Encode is the first lock to work with the Key by Amazon app and Ring devices without needing a WiFi hub. It's built right into the lock. 
With Schlage Encode, we took a different approach to development, starting first with the Connected Home platform and developing the lock around the desired user experience. The user-first approach is part of our strategic plan to develop and integrate with leaders in Connected Home platforms.
In addition, we recently announced the Schlage Connect Z-Wave Plus enhancement and its compatibility with Ring, and Schlage Connect Zigbee-certified locks with support home automation systems.
Our deep experience in connected home security has made us a go-to partner for a wide variety of platforms and home automation solutions, including Amazon, Ring, Alarm.com, Google and Apple. We will continue to build relationships to benefit consumers and accelerate adoption of Schlage smart products.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our full year 2019 outlook."

Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please, go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2018. I'll focus on the t",1299,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please, go to Slide #7. 
This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2018. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 6.7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which delivered 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets.
EMEIA and Asia Pacific saw continued momentum with mid-single-digit organic growth. Pricing for Allegion in the quarter came in at 1.5%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and any additional tariff impacts. Also during the fourth quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 7% growth, and foreign currency was a slight headwind in all 3 regions. 
With the fourth quarter performance, you can see where we ended up for the full year on revenue growth. We delivered more than 13% total revenue growth with double-digit top line growth in all 3 regions. Organic growth came in at 6%, led by the Americas at nearly 7%. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the fourth quarter were $702.4 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 12.7% versus the prior year, up 6.7% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $145.2 million increased nearly 6% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 20.7% decreased 130 basis points with the decrease driven by dilution from acquisitions. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margin on the base business was up 20 basis points year-over-year.
Total inflation exceeded price plus productivity by approximately $2.5 million and was dilutive to adjusted operating margins by 70 basis points. We are committed to driving the price, productivity, inflation dynamic positive in 2019 through the following actions: price realization; improve productivity and operational efficiencies; acquisition integration performance; and softening inflation during the year.
Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. As discussed, these incremental investments accelerate top line growth.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, reported earnings per share was $0.10. Adjusting $1.01 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration costs related to acquisitions, charges related to U.S. Tax Reform and debt refinancing, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.11.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impact. Favorable year-over-year tax rate drove another $0.07 with the favorability driven primarily by lower tax rates associated with tax reform along with favorable discrete items.
Acquisitions were a $0.01 drag in the quarter, reflecting worse-than-anticipated performance associated with the QMI acquisition in Europe. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending continue to drive above-market growth and are providing solid returns on our investment. 
The combination of interest expense, other income and noncontrolling interest decreased earnings per share by $0.03. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.22, an increase of $0.11 or nearly 10% compared to the prior year period.
Lastly, we have a $0.17 per share benefit primarily driven by adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform, which more than offset reductions for charges related to acquisitions and restructuring. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at fourth quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.39.
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $492.7 million, up 13% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong volume in the nonresidential business as well as continued pricing benefits. 
The electronics growth for the quarter was approximately 7%. Residential electronics in the quarter performed well. However, nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to timing of large orders. For the full year, growth in electronic products was solid coming in at high teens with strength in both residential and nonresidential products. 
Price realization in the quarter was 1.5%. Pricing in the nonresidential business was strong, offset by residential promotional activities. The nonresidential business grew low double digits excluding acquisitions. Residential growth was flat in the quarter with strength in electronics, offset by some cannibalization of the mechanical business. Acquisitions added nearly 6% to total revenue.
Americas adjusted operating income of $131.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 190 basis points. The 2018 acquisitions continue to be dilutive, as expected, and had a 120 basis point impact. Inflation and incremental investments exceeded price plus productivity in the quarter. Strong volume leverage and positive mix partially offset these impacts.
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $157.4 million, up 4.4% and up 4.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter and strength in electronics led by the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The impact of acquisitions offset currency headwinds. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $22.5 million decreased approximately 10% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 230 basis points, driven primarily by dilution from acquisitions. As stated earlier, the poor acquisition performance was driven by our QMI business, which experienced reduced revenues in a challenging market environment, a significant mix shift to lower-margin business along with some operational inefficiencies. 
We have identified areas of opportunity and have commenced plans to get the QMI business back to profitability. Operational performance improvement will gradually occur throughout the course of 2019. In addition, inflation and incremental investments slightly exceeded price plus productivity. Strong volume leverage offsets some of these unfavorable impacts.
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $52.3 million, up 44.9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue continued to rebound, growing nicely at 4.6% against a tough comparable. Total revenue growth was driven by the GWA Door & Access business acquisition. Foreign currency was a headwind for the quarter.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $6.5 million, an increase of nearly $2 million with adjusted operating margins down 60 basis points versus the prior year period. Dilution from acquisitions drove the margin decline. 
The base business adjusted operating margins were up 120 basis points with price and productivity more than offsetting the unfavorable impacts from inflation and incremental investments. Good volume leverage was able to offset negative mix.
Please go to Slide #13. Available cash flow for 2018 came in at $408.7 million, which is an increase of $110.8 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher net earnings along with the nonrecurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017. 
Available cash flow continues to remain strong and exceeded prior estimates. Working capital, as a percent of revenues increased slightly in fourth quarter 2018 when compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses. And while working capital, as a percent of revenue, saw a slight increase, we did see a reduction in the cash conversion cycle. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for review on our full year 2019 outlook."

We continue to see favorable trends in our primary end markets in 2019. And it's our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will, again, deliver better-than-market grow",722,"Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide #14. 
We continue to see favorable trends in our primary end markets in 2019. And it's our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will, again, deliver better-than-market growth. We also believe the electronic portfolio will continue to outpace mechanical in all regions, and we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend. 
In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by the institutional markets. We expect the general trend toward electronic products to continue, which will help mitigate the softening that we are expecting in residential new construction.
With these expectations, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6%. We are projecting Americas total revenue expansion to also be 5% to 6% with any remaining impact from the 2018 acquisitions to be offset by currency headwinds.
For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronics business to more than offset weaknesses in Southern Europe and the United Kingdom. For the region, we project organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Currency headwinds are expected to more than offset acquisition benefits, bringing expected total revenue growth in EMEIA region to flat to 2%.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 4% to 6%, and total revenue growth is estimated to be 22% to 24%, reflecting the full year impact of the acquisition of Gainsborough Hardware and API. All in, we are projecting total growth of the company at 5% to 6% and organic growth also at 5% to 6%. 
Please go to Slide 15. Our 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.75 to $4.90, an increase of approximately 6% to 9%. As indicated, the earnings increase is driven by revenue growth and operational improvements as adjusted operating earnings are expected to increase 10% to 14%. Inflationary pressures will continue to be a headwind in the first half of the year, but we anticipate pricing and productivity actions to help drive margin expansion for 2019. 
Incremental investments continue to be a headwind as we continue to focus on accelerating new product development and channel initiatives, which we believe enable us to keep delivering above-market growth and allowing us to take advantage of the shifting customer preferences to electronic products.
Other expense is expected to be a drag on EPS primarily driven by pension expense. Our outlook assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 16%, an increase from 13.5% in 2018, and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 95.5 million. 
The outlook also includes a $0.15 per-share impact from restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs during the year. As a result, reported EPS is estimated to be $4.60 to $4.75. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2019 to be in the $430 million to $450 million range.
Please go to Slide 16. We are very pleased with our 2018 top line growth that delivered organic revenue expansion of 6%, driven by electronics, which we see as a positive trend for us in the future. While operating margin could have been better, we did deliver full year adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14% in 2018, and we saw a robust 37% increase in available cash flow to more than $400 million.
As we look to 2019, we expect to drive continual organic growth above market. We also expect to deliver solid growth in adjusted EPS and generate substantial available cash flow. We are well positioned for 2019 and are committed to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive.
I want to finish by saying that 2018 also marks Allegion's first 5 years as an independent company. From the beginning, we told customers, shareholders and employees we would deliver sustained profitable growth and greater value. We have delivered industry-leading organic growth at a 5-year CAGR of 5.6%. We have industry-leading margins. We have focused on the safety of our employees, health of our employees and employee engagement. We invested in the business, especially in electronics, and are positioned nicely for the future. Allegion is a company our shareholders can be proud to own.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

So Josh, I would characterize it as follows: We commented really good strength in pricing in the commercial area. Pricing on residential was lower than it's anticipated primarily due to promotional activities and some rebates and those type of things, and that ebbs and flows during the course of the year occasionally. So a little bit lower pricing than anticipated on residential side. On the productivity, continue to get good productivity, particularly on materials. Inflation was more than anticipated not so much on the raw materials but more on the nonmaterial side. So inefficiencies associated with nonmaterials on manufacturing, those type of things. As we look forward to 2019, we believe we have a very strong pipeline in terms of productivity, on both material and productivity projects from a manufacturing perspective. The dynamic will become positive in 2019, and it will continue to get better during the course of the year, particularly on the inflation side, where, as you know, the commodities have kind of stabilized today relative to where they were in Q3. But the -- it starts to almost become deflation in the second half of the year. So that will benefit us as we progress throughout 2019."

I think that's going to go well for us this year. We've got some other things in the pipeline going forward. So think we're well positioned to continue to take advantage of this trend.

And the reason for that is, because in Q3, we basically had the effect of 2 price increases in there.

So the expectation was that the pricing was going to come down sequentially. 1.5% is still pretty strong when we look at how the rest of the market is performing. Commercial, we continue to perform extremely well, very pleased with how the team is pushing price there and remaining competitive on bid/quote activity. The decline may be a little bit lighter than expected, and again, it relates to the residential business on the promotional activities and the sell-through to the consumer. So I don't look at that as necessarily a longer-term impact. Kind of going into 2019, would expect pricing to remain robust and would expect us to be able to deliver kind of the 1.5% increase year-over-year in 2019 relative to 2018."

So you know I would start off by saying, from a capital structure perspective, as you guys know, we ended the year in the best position since spin in terms of our leverage ratio, which provides us with a lot of optionality and flexibility going forward. I just think we're well positioned there. If you look at our capital allocation strategy, 3 pillars: organic investments; M&A; shareholder distribution. On the organic investments, we talked about that, we're going to continue to invest in the business for opportunities that will expand our channel presence, getting more of the wallet from our distribution base as well as expanding new products through R&D efforts and those type of things, promotional items, demand creation. That's baked in our earnings per share, and we'll continue to manage that with nice earnings growth going forward. So your question on the M&A, I mean, as Dave mentioned, we executed a lot of acquisitions in 2018. There's opportunities to continue to drive performance in those and spend maybe a little bit more time continuing to integrate those. And if you look at our history, in terms of acquisition performance, they really start to perform nicely kind of 2 to 3 years out, so you have to look at these more on a long-term basis, and we'll continue to drive that execution. Having said that, we will continue to remain active and looking at opportunities to expand our business either through new products or geographic expansion. Our pipeline remains robust. But the key is we'll be disciplined. And we'll only do transactions that we believe will provide a good return on invested capital going forward, of course. Shareholder distribution. We're not going to hoard cash. And we've always said, we're going to utilize the capital that we generate to either do M&A or shareholder distributions through the incremental dividend. You mentioned 29% increase this year, and you can probably see us being more active on share buyback right now, and we're going to execute our capital allocation strategy to provide the best return we can for our shareholders going forward, and that could be either M&A or shareholder distribution or a combination of there -- of those."

We'll see where it goes going forward, but I think we're okay for '19. And as it relates to interest deductibility, relative to the U.S. tax reform in 2017, that does impact us a little bit from a cash tax perspective, and that's baked in our available cash flow numbers.

Allegion saw another quarter of strong top line revenue growth with strength across all regions. The Americas saw strong volumes in the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. EMEIA and Asia Pacific saw organic growth rates in the mid-single digits. Acquisitions continue to contribute to total company revenue growth.
Electronics growth moderated in the fourth quarter, with the Americas seeing approximately 7% growth. Residential electronics performed well. However, the nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to the timing of large orders. We had full year electronics growth of high-teens in the Americas with strength in both parts of the business. We see the electronics outlook continue to be a long-term positive trend as more and more products become connected for ease of access.
As I stated earlier, nonresidential U.S. end markets remain healthy with particular strength in institutional verticals. We do see residential new construction softening, but we expect this to be mitigated by electronics and channel initiatives to drive above-market growth.
The quarter saw continued inflationary pressures, which we believe will ease in 2019. Commodities have leveled off, and we project to have another solid year in price realization with particular strength in our Americas nonresidential businesses. In the fourth quarter, we delivered nearly 10% adjusted EPS growth, bringing the full year expansion to approximately 14% as we drove a robust 37% increase in available cash flow, which totaled more than $400 million for the year.
Overall, I am extremely pleased with the revenue performance in both the quarter and the full year. Additionally, while operating margin could have been better, I'm satisfied with the growth in EPS that we delivered in the quarter and the full year.
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk through the fourth quarter financial summary. In Q4, Allegion delivered strong top line revenue growth. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $702.4 million, an increase of 12.4% (sic) [ 12.7% ] inclusive of our organic growth of 6.7%. Acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact. 
All regions grew organically. Americas led the way with organic growth of 7.6% in the quarter, driven by strength in our nonresidential business. The EMEIA region saw organic growth of 4.3%, driven by performance in the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. Asia Pacific had a nice quarter of organic growth, coming in at 4.6% against a tough comparable.
Adjusted operating margin decreased by 130 basis points due to the dilution related to acquisitions made in 2018. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, the base operating margins were up 20 basis points.
Inflationary headwinds continued to pressure margins and exceeded price and productivity in the quarter. The company is committed to driving price realization and productivity actions, such that, for 2019, the price productivity inflation dynamic is expected to be positive, helping to drive margin expansion across all regions of the business.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 increased $0.11 or nearly 10% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by higher operating income along with a favorable year-over-year tax rate. Available cash flow for the year came in over $408 million, an increase of more than 37% versus prior year. Increased earnings and the nonrecurring 2017 discretionary pension funding drove the increase.
Please go to Slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to talk a little about some of the things we are doing in the Connected Home space. In 2015, Schlage was the first smart lock to respond to ""Hey Siri, open my lock."" Now Schlage Encode is the first lock to work with the Key by Amazon app and Ring devices without needing a WiFi hub. It's built right into the lock. 
With Schlage Encode, we took a different approach to development, starting first with the Connected Home platform and developing the lock around the desired user experience. The user-first approach is part of our strategic plan to develop and integrate with leaders in Connected Home platforms.
In addition, we recently announced the Schlage Connect Z-Wave Plus enhancement and its compatibility with Ring, and Schlage Connect Zigbee-certified locks with support home automation systems.
Our deep experience in connected home security has made us a go-to partner for a wide variety of platforms and home automation solutions, including Amazon, Ring, Alarm.com, Google and Apple. We will continue to build relationships to benefit consumers and accelerate adoption of Schlage smart products.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our full year 2019 outlook."

Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please, go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2018.

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2018. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 6.7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which delivered 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets.
EMEIA and Asia Pacific saw continued momentum with mid-single-digit organic growth. Pricing for Allegion in the quarter came in at 1.5%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and any additional tariff impacts. Also during the fourth quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 7% growth, and foreign currency was a slight headwind in all 3 regions. 
With the fourth quarter performance, you can see where we ended up for the full year on revenue growth. We delivered more than 13% total revenue growth with double-digit top line growth in all 3 regions. Organic growth came in at 6%, led by the Americas at nearly 7%. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the fourth quarter were $702.4 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 12.7% versus the prior year, up 6.7% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $145.2 million increased nearly 6% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 20.7% decreased 130 basis points with the decrease driven by dilution from acquisitions. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margin on the base business was up 20 basis points year-over-year.
Total inflation exceeded price plus productivity by approximately $2.5 million and was dilutive to adjusted operating margins by 70 basis points. We are committed to driving the price, productivity, inflation dynamic positive in 2019 through the following actions: price realization; improve productivity and operational efficiencies; acquisition integration performance; and softening inflation during the year.
Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. As discussed, these incremental investments accelerate top line growth.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, reported earnings per share was $0.10. Adjusting $1.01 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration costs related to acquisitions, charges related to U.S. Tax Reform and debt refinancing, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.11.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impact. Favorable year-over-year tax rate drove another $0.07 with the favorability driven primarily by lower tax rates associated with tax reform along with favorable discrete items.
Acquisitions were a $0.01 drag in the quarter, reflecting worse-than-anticipated performance associated with the QMI acquisition in Europe. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending continue to drive above-market growth and are providing solid returns on our investment. 
The combination of interest expense, other income and noncontrolling interest decreased earnings per share by $0.03. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.22, an increase of $0.11 or nearly 10% compared to the prior year period.
Lastly, we have a $0.17 per share benefit primarily driven by adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform, which more than offset reductions for charges related to acquisitions and restructuring. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at fourth quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.39.
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $492.7 million, up 13% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong volume in the nonresidential business as well as continued pricing benefits. 
The electronics growth for the quarter was approximately 7%. Residential electronics in the quarter performed well. However, nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to timing of large orders. For the full year, growth in electronic products was solid coming in at high teens with strength in both residential and nonresidential products. 
Price realization in the quarter was 1.5%. Pricing in the nonresidential business was strong, offset by residential promotional activities. The nonresidential business grew low double digits excluding acquisitions. Residential growth was flat in the quarter with strength in electronics, offset by some cannibalization of the mechanical business. Acquisitions added nearly 6% to total revenue.
Americas adjusted operating income of $131.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 190 basis points. The 2018 acquisitions continue to be dilutive, as expected, and had a 120 basis point impact. Inflation and incremental investments exceeded price plus productivity in the quarter. Strong volume leverage and positive mix partially offset these impacts.
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $157.4 million, up 4.4% and up 4.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter and strength in electronics led by the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The impact of acquisitions offset currency headwinds. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $22.5 million decreased approximately 10% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 230 basis points, driven primarily by dilution from acquisitions. As stated earlier, the poor acquisition performance was driven by our QMI business, which experienced reduced revenues in a challenging market environment, a significant mix shift to lower-margin business along with some operational inefficiencies. 
We have identified areas of opportunity and have commenced plans to get the QMI business back to profitability. Operational performance improvement will gradually occur throughout the course of 2019. In addition, inflation and incremental investments slightly exceeded price plus productivity. Strong volume leverage offsets some of these unfavorable impacts.
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $52.3 million, up 44.9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue continued to rebound, growing nicely at 4.6% against a tough comparable. Total revenue growth was driven by the GWA Door & Access business acquisition. Foreign currency was a headwind for the quarter.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $6.5 million, an increase of nearly $2 million with adjusted operating margins down 60 basis points versus the prior year period. Dilution from acquisitions drove the margin decline. 
The base business adjusted operating margins were up 120 basis points with price and productivity more than offsetting the unfavorable impacts from inflation and incremental investments. Good volume leverage was able to offset negative mix.
Please go to Slide #13. Available cash flow for 2018 came in at $408.7 million, which is an increase of $110.8 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher net earnings along with the nonrecurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017. 
Available cash flow continues to remain strong and exceeded prior estimates. Working capital, as a percent of revenues, increased slightly in fourth quarter 2018 when compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses. And while working capital, as a percent of revenue, saw a slight increase, we did see a reduction in the cash conversion cycle. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for review on our full year 2019 outlook."

We continue to see favorable trends in our primary end markets in 2019. And it's our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will, again, deliver better-than-market grow",723,"Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide #14. 
We continue to see favorable trends in our primary end markets in 2019. And it's our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will, again, deliver better-than-market growth. We also believe the electronic portfolio will continue to outpace mechanical in all regions, and we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend. 
In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by the institutional markets. We expect the general trend toward electronic products to continue, which will help mitigate the softening that we are expecting in residential new construction.
With these expectations, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6%. We are projecting Americas total revenue expansion to also be 5% to 6% with any remaining impact from the 2018 acquisitions to be offset by currency headwinds.
For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronics business to more than offset weaknesses in Southern Europe and the United Kingdom. For the region, we project organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Currency headwinds are expected to more than offset acquisition benefits, bringing expected total revenue growth in EMEIA region to flat to 2%.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 4% to 6%, and total revenue growth is estimated to be 22% to 24%, reflecting the full year impact of the acquisition of Gainsborough Hardware and API. All in, we are projecting total growth of the company at 5% to 6% and organic growth also at 5% to 6%. 
Please go to Slide 15. Our 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.75 to $4.90, an increase of approximately 6% to 9%. As indicated, the earnings increase is driven by revenue growth and operational improvements as adjusted operating earnings are expected to increase 10% to 14%. Inflationary pressures will continue to be a headwind in the first half of the year, but we anticipate pricing and productivity actions to help drive margin expansion for 2019. 
Incremental investments continue to be a headwind as we continue to focus on accelerating new product development and channel initiatives, which we believe enable us to keep delivering above-market growth and allowing us to take advantage of the shifting customer preferences to electronic products.
Other expense is expected to be a drag on EPS primarily driven by pension expense. Our outlook assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 16%, an increase from 13.5% in 2018, and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 95.5 million. 
The outlook also includes a $0.15 per share impact from restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs during the year. As a result, reported EPS is estimated to be $4.60 to $4.75. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2019 to be in the $430 million to $450 million range.
Please go to Slide 16. We are very pleased with our 2018 top line growth that delivered organic revenue expansion of 6%, driven by electronics, which we see as a positive trend for us in the future. While operating margin could have been better, we did deliver full year adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14% in 2018, and we saw a robust 37% increase in available cash flow to more than $400 million.
As we look to 2019, we expect to drive continual organic growth above market. We also expect to deliver solid growth in adjusted EPS and generate substantial available cash flow. We are well positioned for 2019 and are committed to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive.
I want to finish by saying that 2018 also marks Allegion's first 5 years as an independent company. From the beginning, we told customers, shareholders and employees we would deliver sustained profitable growth and greater value. We have delivered industry-leading organic growth at a 5-year CAGR of 5.6%. We have industry-leading margins. We have focused on the safety of our employees, health of our employees and employee engagement. We invested in the business, especially in electronics, and are positioned nicely for the future. Allegion is a company our shareholders can be proud to own.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

So Josh, I would characterize it as follows: We commented really good strength in pricing in the commercial area. Pricing on residential was lower than it's anticipated primarily due to promotional activities and some rebates and those type of things, and that ebbs and flows during the course of the year occasionally. So a little bit lower pricing than anticipated on residential side. On the productivity, continue to get good productivity, particularly on materials. Inflation was more than anticipated not so much on the raw materials but more on the nonmaterial side. So inefficiencies associated with nonmaterials on manufacturing, those type of things. As we look forward to 2019, we believe we have a very strong pipeline in terms of productivity, on both material and productivity projects from a manufacturing perspective. The dynamic will become positive in 2019, and it will continue to get better during the course of the year, particularly on the inflation side, where, as you know, the commodities have kind of stabilized today relative to where they were in Q3. But the -- it starts to almost become deflation in the second half of the year. So that will benefit us as we progress throughout 2019."

So the expectation was that the pricing was going to come down sequentially. 1.5% is still pretty strong when we look at how the rest of the market is performing. Commercial, we continue to perform extremely well, very pleased with how the team is pushing price there and remaining competitive on bid/quote activity. The decline may be a little bit lighter than expected, and again, it relates to the residential business on the promotional activities and the sell-through to the consumer. So I don't look at that as necessarily a longer-term impact. Kind of going into 2019, would expect pricing to remain robust and would expect us to be able to deliver kind of the 1.5% increase year-over-year in 2019 relative to 2018."

I just think we're well positioned there. If you look at our capital allocation strategy, 3 pillars: organic investments; M&A; shareholder distribution. On the organic investments, we talked about that, we're going to continue to invest in the business for opportunities that will expand our channel presence, getting more of the wallet from our distribution base as well as expanding new products through R&D efforts and those type of things, promotional items, demand creation. That's baked in our earnings per share, and we'll continue to manage that with nice earnings growth going forward. So your question on the M&A, I mean, as Dave mentioned, we executed a lot of acquisitions in 2018. There's opportunities to continue to drive performance in those and spend maybe a little bit more time continuing to integrate those. And if you look at our history, in terms of acquisition performance, they really start to perform nicely kind of 2 to 3 years out, so you have to look at these more on a long-term basis, and we'll continue to drive that execution. Having said that, we will continue to remain active and looking at opportunities to expand our business either through new products or geographic expansion. Our pipeline remains robust. But the key is we'll be disciplined. And we'll only do transactions that we believe will provide a good return on invested capital going forward, of course. Shareholder distribution. We're not going to hoard cash. And we've always said, we're going to utilize the capital that we generate to either do M&A or shareholder distributions through the incremental dividend. You mentioned 29% increase this year, and you can probably see us being more active on share buyback right now, and we're going to execute our capital allocation strategy to provide the best return we can for our shareholders going forward, and that could be either M&A or shareholder distribution or a combination of there -- of those."

Or was that -- is that so much of a one-off that it is not indicative of the dynamics of the door manufacturing market either in EMEIA or in the United States?"

Allegion got off the starting gate with a good quarter that has positioned us to deliver on our 2019 commitments. We have a solid top line revenue growth in the first quarter, which benefited from strength in the Americas and from the Gainsborough acquisition in the Asia Pacific region. 
The Americas' growth was driven by the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in the institutional verticals. Pricing was also strong for the company, led by the Americas region. Electronics growth at almost 10% for the quarter, which was lower than the growth rates experienced in 2018. While growth improved sequentially from the last quarter, our product portfolio and new market partnerships will drive even better growth in the coming quarters.
Allegion's combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships and continuously evolving channel relationships give us a great opportunity to take advantage of this market as it develops. For the full year 2019, we expect the Americas electronics growth rate to be similar to historic levels, which is supported by the healthy demand of the recently launched Schlage in code residential lock that is ramping up in Q2. 
Looking at the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the substantial inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase for the total company and in each of the individual regions. 
In the first quarter, we delivered a 10% increase in adjusted EPS, driven primarily from our operations. This performance highlights our continued focus on accelerating growth, margin improvement and driving increase shareholder value. Last, we are reaffirming our outlooks for 2019 revenue and EPS. We project total and organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%. 
For reported EPS, the range continues to be $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS remains at $4.75 to $4.90. Slide #5 and I'll walk you through the first quarter financial summary. In Q1, Allegion delivered good top line revenue performance. Revenue for the first quarter was $655 million, an increase of 6.8%, inclusive of 5.8% organic growth. 
Allegion also contributed to the top line revenue expansion -- acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas led the way with organic growth of nearly 8% in the quarter, a strong pricing and solid volume in the nonresidential business. 
The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 10 basis points, aided by price and productivity more than offsetting significant inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization productivity savings to combat inflationary pressures.  Adjusted earnings per share of $0.88, increased $0.08 or 10% versus the prior year. 
As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, reduced share count and a slightly lower tax rate with other income providing the small benefit to EPS growth. 
Year-to-date, available cash flow is down approximately $6 million, the decrease is related to increased working capital and higher capital expenditures that were offset slightly by increased earnings.
Please go to Slide 6. When Allegion was founded, we put together a sound strategy, values and strategic pillars for our company, and they have allowed us to deliver industry-leading results, including industry-leading organic growth and operating margins. 
As we move into the next 5 years, we made some nice adjustments to the strategy. In March, we shared our refresh corporate strategy with you. Our vision of seamless access and a safer world is aligned with electronic trends and security and access. It also recognize the enhanced capabilities of technology, edge devices and our unique ownership of the opening to provide layers of authentication and enhance safety to increase human productivity. 
We believe the 5 strategic pillars Allegion has laid out are the foundation for our future. Our pillars include expansion in core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. Being the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means, we are intend on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others.
Driving value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience with access and working with partners to create unique solutions that increase their safety and speed up their productivity. We're also intend on bringing new products to the market faster through modular, global, scalable platforms. 
Capital allocation, Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, when expands organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
And last enterprise excellence. As you have seen in our Q1, our ability to drive results through productivity and continuous improvement is a strength of our company. Allegion is committed to create value with excellent customer experience and with the culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of our company's history for over 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2019 outlook."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 5.8% organic growth in Q1. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which includes 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets and returns on our channel initiatives.
Pricing in the quarter was strong at 2.1%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions that help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. Also during the first quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 3% growth, offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the first quarter were $655 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 6.8% versus the prior year, up 5.8% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $112.1 million increased nearly 8% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 17.1% increased 10 basis points. Price realization and productivity action outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating incoming increase and solid volume leverage contributed to the margin expansion. 
Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions. Each of the region saw expansion in operating margin, which offsets the corporate expense related to deferred compensation plans due to favorable financial markets and accelerated investing of stock-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees. The incremental cost associated with deferred compensation plans will offset in other income, below operating income such as it had no impact on earnings per share.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2018, reported earnings per share was $0.75. Adjusting $0.05 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost-related acquisitions, the Q1 2018 adjusted EPS was $0.80.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.09 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count grow another $.0.01 as we executed more than $63 million of share buyback in the quarter. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. Collectively, these incremental investment enable regions to accelerate growth, particularly in electronics. The combination of interest expense, other income, noncontrolling interest and tax rate offset each other have no impact on year-over-year earnings per share growth.
This results in adjusted first quarter 2019 earnings per share of $0.88, an increase of $0.08 or 10% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we have a $0.04 per share reduction for charges related acquisitions of restructuring. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the first quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $0.84.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $475.3 million, up 8.2% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by low double-digit increase in the nonresidential business. Pricing was strong in Americas region, coming in at 2.6% in the quarter, while the nonresidential business grew nicely to residential business was essentially flat in the quarter when compared to Q1 of last year. 
Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas and came in at nearly 10%. Americas adjusted operating income of $123.1 million increased 8.5% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by volume leverage. Additionally, price and productivity exceeded the significant inflationary pressures observed in the region and contributed to the operating income increase. Incremental investments were 30 basis point drag on margins.
Please go to Slide #11. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.9 million, down 4.9% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by pricing and favorable volume in our SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weaknesses in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.7 million increased 30% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points, driven by a price and productivity exceeding moderate inflation. The region also saw volume leverage and favorable mix, which partially offset currency pressures. Incremental investments were a 30 basis points headwind operating margin.
Please go to Slide #12. First quarter revenues for Asia-Pacific region were $36.8 million, up 55% versus the prior year. Organic revenue declined 2.2%, driven by an internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 63%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by nearly 6%.
Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $0.7 million, an improvement of $0.3 million with adjusted operating margins improving 230 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity, inflation dynamic was positive in the region and the Gainsborough acquisition was accretive to operating margin in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2019 was negative $24.9 million, which is a decrease of $6.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by higher working capital requirements and increased capital spending, partially offset by higher net earnings.
Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the first quarter, while the cash conversion cycle was down. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. 
Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. 
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue remains at a range of 5% to 6%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to be strong throughout 2019. We expect the general trend toward electronic progress to continue, and we are positioned to take advantage of this trend. 
For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronics business led by our SimonsVoss and Interflex to more than offset weaknesses that we are experiencing in Southern Europe. However, total revenue will be negatively affected by currency headwinds. 
In Asia-Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. The total revenue growth reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which has another quarter before we pass the anniversary date. We're also affirming our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at the range of $4.60 and $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.75 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 6% to 9%. 
As Patrick stated, we are also affirming our cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. The outlook assumes no change in the previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately $0.16 -- 16% with an anticipated higher rate in the first half of the year than in the second half. We're updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately $95 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed in Q1. 
Please go to Slide 15. As a summary of Allegion's Q1 performance, total revenue grew nearly 7%, organic revenue grew almost 6%, adjusted operating margins were up 10 basis points, and we are up in all regions. Adjusted EPS saw 10% growth in the quarter. Access has been an important part of our past and will be more important part of the future, as we connect the world through seamless access and smart devices. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

Allegion got out of the starting gate with a good quarter that has positioned us to deliver on our 2019 commitments. We have a solid top line revenue growth in the first quarter, which benefited from strength in the Americas and from the Gainsborough acquisition in the Asia Pacific region. 
The Americas' growth was driven by the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. Pricing was also strong for the company, led by the Americas region. Electronics growth at almost 10% for the quarter, which was lower than the growth rates we experienced in 2018. While growth improved sequentially from the last quarter, our product portfolio and new market partnerships will drive even better growth in the coming quarters.
Allegion's combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships and continuously evolving channel relationships give us a great opportunity to take advantage of this market as it develops.
For the full year 2019, we expect the Americas electronics growth rate to be similar to historic levels, which is supported by the healthy demand of the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock that is ramping up in Q2. 
Looking at the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the substantial inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase for the total company and in each of the individual regions. 
In the first quarter, we delivered a 10% increase in adjusted EPS, driven primarily from operations. This performance highlights our continued focus on accelerating growth, margin improvement and driving increased shareholder value. Last, we are reaffirming our outlooks for 2019 revenue and EPS. We project total and organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%. 
For reported EPS, the range continues to be $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS remains at $4.75 to $4.90.
We will go to Slide #5 and I'll walk you through the first quarter financial summary. In Q1, Allegion delivered good top line revenue performance. Revenue for the first quarter was $655 million, an increase of 6.8%, inclusive of 5.8% organic growth. 
Allegion also contributed to the top line revenue expansion -- excuse me, acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas led the way with organic growth of nearly 8% in the quarter, a strong pricing and solid volume in the nonresidential business. 
The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 10 basis points, aided by price and productivity more than offsetting significant inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization, productivity savings, to combat inflationary pressures.  Adjusted earnings per share of $0.88, increased $0.08 or 10% versus the prior year. 
As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, reduced share count and a slightly lower tax rate with the other income providing the small benefit to EPS growth. 
Year-to-date, available cash flow is down approximately $6 million, the decrease is related to increased working capital and higher capital expenditures that were offset slightly by increased earnings.
Please go to Slide 6. When Allegion was founded, we put together a sound strategy, values and strategic pillars for our company, and they have allowed us to deliver industry-leading results, including industry-leading organic growth and operating margins. 
As we move into the next 5 years, we made some nice adjustments to the strategy. In March, we shared our refresh corporate strategy with you. Our vision of seamless access in a safer world is aligned with electronic trends and security and access. It also recognized the enhanced capabilities of technology, edge devices and our unique ownership of the opening to provide layers of authentication and enhanced safety to increased human productivity. 
We believe the 5 strategic pillars Allegion has laid out are the foundation for our future. Our pillars include expansion in core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. Being the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we are intend on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others.
Driving value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience with access and working with partners to create unique solutions that increase their safety and speed up their productivity. We're also intend on bringing new products to the market faster through modular, global, scalable platforms. 
Capital allocation, Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment one that expands organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
And last, enterprise excellence. As you have seen in our Q1, our ability to drive results through productivity and continuous improvement is a strength of our company. Allegion is committed to create value with excellent customer experience and with a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of our company's history for over 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2019 outlook."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 5.8% organic growth in Q1. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which includes 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets and returns on our channel initiatives.
Pricing in the quarter was strong at 2.1%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. Also during the first quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 3% growth, offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the first quarter were $655 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 6.8% versus the prior year, up 5.8% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $112.1 million increased nearly 8% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 17.1% increased 10 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating incoming increase and solid volume leverage contributed to the margin expansion. 
Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions. Each of the region saw expansion in operating margin, which offsets the corporate expense related to deferred compensation plans due to favorable financial markets and accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees. The incremental cost associated with deferred compensation plans will offset in other income, below operating income such as it had no impact on earnings per share.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2018, reported earnings per share was $0.75. Adjusting $0.05 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost-related acquisitions, the Q1 2018 adjusted EPS was $0.80.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.09 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $.0.01 as we executed more than $63 million in share buyback in the quarter. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. Collectively, these incremental investments enable Allegion to accelerate growth, particularly in electronics. The combination of interest expense, other income, noncontrolling interest and tax rate offset each other to have no impact on year-over-year earnings per share growth.
This results in adjusted first quarter 2019 earnings per share of $0.88, an increase of $0.08 or 10% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we have a $0.04 per share reduction for charges related acquisitions of restructuring. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the first quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $0.84.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $475.3 million, up 8.2% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by low double-digit increase in the nonresidential business. Pricing was strong in Americas region, coming in at 2.6% in the quarter, while the nonresidential business grew nicely, the residential business was essentially flat in the quarter when compared to Q1 of last year. 
Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas and came in at nearly 10%. Americas adjusted operating income of $123.1 million increased 8.5% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by volume leverage. Additionally, price and productivity exceeded the significant inflationary pressures observed in the region and contributed to the operating income increase. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point drag on margins.
Please go to Slide #11. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.9 million, down 4.9% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by pricing and favorable volume in our SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weaknesses in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.7 million increased 30% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points, driven by price and productivity exceeding moderate inflation. The region also saw volume leverage and favorable mix, which partially offset currency pressures. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point headwind to operating margin.
Please go to Slide #12. First quarter revenues for Asia-Pacific region were $36.8 million, up 55% versus the prior year. Organic revenue declined 2.2%, driven by an internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 63%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by nearly 6%.
Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $0.7 million, an improvement of $0.3 million with adjusted operating margins improving 230 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity, inflation dynamic was positive in the region and the Gainsborough acquisition was accretive to operating margin in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2019 was negative $24.9 million, which is a decrease of $6.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by higher working capital requirements and increased capital spending, partially offset by higher net earnings.
Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the first quarter, while the cash conversion cycle was down. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and will continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. 
Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. 
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

Please go to Slide #14. As noted on the slide, we are affirming our revenue outlook. The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue remains at a range of 5% to 6%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to be strong throughout 2019. We expect the general trend toward electronic progress to continue, and we are positioned to take advantage of this trend. 
For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronic businesses led by SimonsVoss and Interflex to more than offset weaknesses that we are experiencing in Southern Europe. However, total revenue will be negatively affected by currency headwinds. 
In Asia-Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. The total revenue growth reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which has another quarter before we pass the anniversary date. We're also affirming our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at the range of $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.75 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 6% to 9%. 
As Patrick stated, we are also affirming our cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. The outlook assumes no change in the previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately $0.16 -- 16% with an anticipated higher rate in the first half of the year than in the second half. We're updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately $95 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed in Q1. 
Please go to Slide 15. As a summary of Allegion's Q1 performance, total revenue grew nearly 7%, organic revenue grew almost 6%, adjusted operating margins were up 10 basis points, and we are up in all regions. Adjusted EPS saw 10% growth in the quarter. Access has been an important part of our past and will be more important part of the future, as we connect the world through seamless access and smart devices. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I think, as you look at the macro on new build, I think, we're going to continue for single family in North America around 850, a relatively flat market. I think multifamily continues to be robust, that surprises me, but people are moving into the inner cities. These projects tend to be more price competitive, especially on the traditional mechanical hardware. We do like the trend that these are becoming more electronic. We have, over the last 2 years, had a focused effort around this, and we think it will give us some lift. The strength of our company continues to be on the retrofit fit side of this. So I like our opportunities as we go into res, and it will advance -- our growth will advance beyond what we saw in Q1."

Allegion got out of the starting gate with a good quarter that has positioned us to deliver on our 2019 commitments. We had solid top line revenue growth in the first quarter, which benefited from strength in the Americas and from the Gainsborough acquisition in the Asia Pacific region. 
The Americas' growth was driven by the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. Pricing was also strong for the company, led by the Americas region. Electronics growth at almost 10% for the quarter, which was lower than the growth rates we experienced in 2018. While growth improved sequentially from the last quarter, our product portfolio and new market partnerships will drive even better growth in the coming quarters.
Allegion's combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships and continuously evolving channel relationships give us a great opportunity to take advantage of this market as it develops.
For the full year 2019, we expect the Americas electronics growth rate to be similar to historic levels, which is supported by the healthy demand of the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock that is ramping up in Q2. 
Moving down the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the substantial inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase for the total company and in each of the individual regions. 
In the first quarter, we delivered a 10% increase of adjusted EPS, driven primarily from operations. This performance highlights our continued focus on accelerating growth, margin improvement and driving increased shareholder value. Last, we are affirming our outlooks for 2019 revenue and EPS. We project total and organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%. 
For reported EPS, the range continues to be $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS remains at $4.75 to $4.90.
Please go to Slide #5 and I'll walk through the first quarter financial summary. In Q1, Allegion delivered good top line revenue performance. Revenue for the first quarter was $655 million, an increase of 6.8%, inclusive of 5.8% organic growth. 
Allegion also contributed to the top line revenue expansion -- excuse me, acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas led the way with organic growth of nearly 8% in the quarter, a strong pricing and solid volume in the nonresidential business. 
The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 10 basis points, aided by price and productivity more than offsetting significant inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization, productivity savings, to combat the inflationary pressures.  Adjusted earnings per share of $0.88, increased $0.08 or 10% versus the prior year. 
As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, reduced share count and a slightly lower tax rate with the other income providing the small benefit to EPS growth. 
Year-to-date, available cash flow is down approximately $6 million, the decrease is related to increased working capital and higher capital expenditures that were offset slightly by increased earnings.
Please go to Slide 6. When Allegion was founded, we put together a sound strategy, values and strategic pillars for our company, and they have allowed us to deliver industry-leading results, including industry-leading organic growth and operating margins. 
As we move into the next 5 years, we made some nice adjustments to the strategy. In March, we shared our refresh corporate strategy with you. Our vision of seamless access in a safer world is aligned with electronic trends and security and access. It also recognized the enhanced capabilities of technology, edge devices and our unique ownership of the opening to provide layers of authentication and enhanced safety to increase human productivity. 
We believe the 5 strategic pillars Allegion has laid out are the foundation for our future. Our pillars include expansion in core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. Being the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we are intent on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others.
Driving value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience with access and working with partners to create unique solutions that increase their safety and speed up their productivity. We're also intent on bringing new products to the market faster through modular, global, scalable platforms. 
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment one that expands organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
And last, enterprise excellence. As you have seen in our Q1, our ability to drive results through productivity and continuous improvement is a strength of our company. Allegion is committed to create value with excellent customer experience and with a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of our company's history for over 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2019 outlook."
241782379,607941856,1705646,"Allegion plc, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Allegion plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone.

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 5.8% organic growth in Q1. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which includes 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets and returns on our channel initiatives.
Pricing in the quarter was strong at 2.1%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. Also during the first quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 3% growth, offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the first quarter were $655 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 6.8% versus the prior year, up 5.8% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $112.1 million increased nearly 8% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 17.1% increased 10 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating incoming increase and solid volume leverage contributed to the margin expansion. 
Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions. Each of the regions saw expansion in operating margin, which offsets the corporate expense related to deferred compensation plans due to favorable financial markets and accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees. The incremental cost associated with deferred compensation plans will offset in other income, below operating income such as it had no impact on earnings per share.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2018, reported earnings per share was $0.75. Adjusting $0.05 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost-related acquisitions, the Q1 2018 adjusted EPS was $0.80.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.09 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $.0.01 as we executed more than $63 million in share buyback in the quarter. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. Collectively, these incremental investments enable Allegion to accelerate growth, particularly in electronics. The combination of interest expense, other income, noncontrolling interest and tax rate offset each other to have no impact on year-over-year earnings per share growth.
This results in adjusted first quarter 2019 earnings per share of $0.88, an increase of $0.08 or 10% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we have a $0.04 per share reduction for charges related acquisitions of restructuring. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the first quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $0.84.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $475.3 million, up 8.2% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by low double-digit increase in the nonresidential business. Pricing was strong in Americas region, coming in at 2.6% in the quarter, while the nonresidential business grew nicely, the residential business was essentially flat in the quarter when compared to Q1 of last year. 
Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas and came in at nearly 10%. Americas adjusted operating income of $123.1 million increased 8.5% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by volume leverage. Additionally, price and productivity exceeded the significant inflationary pressures observed in the region and contributed to the operating income increase. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point drag on margins.
Please go to Slide #11. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.9 million, down 4.9% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by pricing and favorable volume in our SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weaknesses in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.7 million increased 30% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points, driven by price and productivity exceeding moderate inflation. The region also saw volume leverage and favorable mix, which partially offset currency pressures. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point headwind operating margin.
Please go to Slide #12. First quarter revenues for Asia-Pacific region were $36.8 million, up 55% versus the prior year. Organic revenue declined 2.2%, driven by an internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 63%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by nearly 6%.
Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $0.7 million, an improvement of $0.3 million with adjusted operating margins improving 230 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity, inflation dynamic was positive in the region and the Gainsborough acquisition was accretive to operating margin in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2019 was negative $24.9 million, which is a decrease of $6.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by higher working capital requirements and increased capital spending, partially offset by higher net earnings.
Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the first quarter, while the cash conversion cycle was down. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and will continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. 
Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. 
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

Please go to Slide #14. As noted on the slide, we are affirming our revenue outlook. The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue remains at a range of 5% to 6%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to be strong throughout 2019. We expect the general trend toward electronic progress to continue, and we are positioned to take advantage of this trend. 
For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronic businesses led by SimonsVoss and Interflex to more than offset weaknesses that we are experiencing in Southern Europe. However, total revenue will be negatively affected by currency headwinds. 
In Asia-Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. The total revenue growth reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which has another quarter before we pass the anniversary date. We're also affirming our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at the range of $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.75 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 6% to 9%. 
As Patrick stated, we are also affirming our cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. The outlook assumes no change in the previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately $0.16 -- 16% with an anticipated higher rate in the first half of the year than in the second half. We're updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately $95 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed in Q1. 
Please go to Slide 15. As a summary of Allegion's Q1 performance, total revenue grew nearly 7%, organic revenue grew almost 6%, adjusted operating margins were up 10 basis points, and were up in all regions. Adjusted EPS saw 10% growth in the quarter. Access has been an important part of our past and will be more important part of the future, as we connect the world through seamless access and smart devices. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

These projects tend to be more price competitive, especially on the traditional mechanical hardware. We do like the trend that these are becoming more electronic. We have, over the last 2 years, had a focused effort around this, and we think it will give us some lift. The strength of our company continues to be on the retrofit fit side of this.

Allegion got out of the starting gate with a good quarter that has positioned us to deliver on our 2019 commitments. We had solid top line revenue growth in the first quarter, which benefited from strength in the Americas and from the Gainsborough acquisition in the Asia Pacific region. 
The Americas' growth was driven by the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. Pricing was also strong for the company, led by the Americas region. Electronics growth at almost 10% for the quarter, which was lower than the growth rates we experienced in 2018. While growth improved sequentially from the last quarter, our product portfolio and new market partnerships will drive even better growth in the coming quarters.
Allegion's combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships and continuously evolving channel relationships give us a great opportunity to take advantage of this market as it develops.
For the full year 2019, we expect the Americas electronics growth rate to be similar to historic levels, which is supported by the healthy demand of the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock that is ramping up in Q2. 
Moving down the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the substantial inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase for the total company and in each of the individual regions. 
In the first quarter, we delivered a 10% increase of adjusted EPS, driven primarily from operations. This performance highlights our continued focus on accelerating growth, margin improvement and driving increased shareholder value. Last, we are affirming our outlooks for 2019 revenue and EPS. We project total and organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%. 
For reported EPS, the range continues to be $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS remains at $4.75 to $4.90.
Please go to Slide #5 and I'll walk through the first quarter financial summary. In Q1, Allegion delivered good top line revenue performance. Revenue for the first quarter was $655 million, an increase of 6.8%, inclusive of 5.8% organic growth. 
Allegion also contributed to the top line revenue expansion -- excuse me, acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas led the way with organic growth of nearly 8% in the quarter, a strong pricing and solid volume in the nonresidential business. 
The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 10 basis points, aided by price and productivity more than offsetting significant inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization, productivity savings, to combat the inflationary pressures. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.88, increased $0.08 or 10% versus the prior year. 
As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, reduced share count and a slightly lower tax rate with the other income providing the small benefit to EPS growth. 
Year-to-date, available cash flow is down approximately $6 million, the decrease is related to increased working capital and higher capital expenditures that were offset slightly by increased earnings.
Please go to Slide 6. When Allegion was founded, we put together a sound strategy, values and strategic pillars for our company, and they have allowed us to deliver industry-leading results, including industry-leading organic growth and operating margins. 
As we move into the next 5 years, we made some nice adjustments to the strategy. In March, we shared our refresh corporate strategy with you. Our vision of seamless access in a safer world is aligned with electronic trends and security and access. It also recognized the enhanced capabilities of technology, edge devices and our unique ownership of the opening to provide layers of authentication and enhanced safety to increase human productivity. 
We believe the 5 strategic pillars Allegion has laid out are the foundation for our future. Our pillars include expansion in core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. Being the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we are intent on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others.
Driving value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience with access and working with partners to create unique solutions that increase their safety and speed up their productivity. We're also intent on bringing new products to the market faster through modular, global, scalable platforms. 
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment one that expands organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
And last, enterprise excellence. As you have seen in our Q1, our ability to drive results through productivity and continuous improvement is a strength of our company. Allegion is committed to create value with excellent customer experience and with a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of our company's history for over 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2019 outlook."
241782379,607941856,1708802,"Allegion plc, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Allegion plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone.

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 5.8% organic growth in Q1. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which includes 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets and returns on our channel initiatives.
Pricing in the quarter was strong at 2.1%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. Also during the first quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 3% growth, offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the first quarter were $655 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 6.8% versus the prior year, up 5.8% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $112.1 million increased nearly 8% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 17.1% increased 10 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating incoming increase and solid volume leverage contributed to the margin expansion. 
Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions. Each of the regions saw expansion in operating margin, which offsets the corporate expense related to deferred compensation plans due to favorable financial markets and accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees. The incremental cost associated with deferred compensation plans will offset in other income, below operating income such as it had no impact on earnings per share.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2018, reported earnings per share was $0.75. Adjusting $0.05 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost-related acquisitions, the Q1 2018 adjusted EPS was $0.80.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.09 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $.0.01 as we executed more than $63 million in share buyback in the quarter. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. Collectively, these incremental investments enable Allegion to accelerate growth, particularly in electronics. The combination of interest expense, other income, noncontrolling interest and tax rate offset each other to have no impact on year-over-year earnings per share growth.
This results in adjusted first quarter 2019 earnings per share of $0.88, an increase of $0.08 or 10% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we have a $0.04 per share reduction for charges related acquisitions of restructuring. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the first quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $0.84.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $475.3 million, up 8.2% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by low double-digit increase in the nonresidential business. Pricing was strong in Americas region, coming in at 2.6% in the quarter, while the nonresidential business grew nicely, the residential business was essentially flat in the quarter when compared to Q1 of last year. 
Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas and came in at nearly 10%. Americas adjusted operating income of $123.1 million increased 8.5% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by volume leverage. Additionally, price and productivity exceeded the significant inflationary pressures observed in the region and contributed to the operating income increase. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point drag on margins.
Please go to Slide #11. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.9 million, down 4.9% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by pricing and favorable volume in our SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weaknesses in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.7 million increased 30% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points, driven by price and productivity exceeding moderate inflation. The region also saw volume leverage and favorable mix, which partially offset currency pressures. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point headwind operating margin.
Please go to Slide #12. First quarter revenues for Asia-Pacific region were $36.8 million, up 55% versus the prior year. Organic revenue declined 2.2%, driven by an internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 63%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by nearly 6%.
Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $0.7 million, an improvement of $0.3 million with adjusted operating margins improving 230 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity, inflation dynamic was positive in the region and the Gainsborough acquisition was accretive to operating margin in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2019 was negative $24.9 million, which is a decrease of $6.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by higher working capital requirements and increased capital spending, partially offset by higher net earnings.
Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the first quarter, while the cash conversion cycle was down. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and will continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. 
Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. 
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

Please go to Slide #14. As noted on the slide, we are affirming our revenue outlook. The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue remains at a range of 5% to 6%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to be strong throughout 2019. We expect the general trend toward electronic progress to continue, and we are positioned to take advantage of this trend. 
For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronic businesses led by SimonsVoss and Interflex to more than offset weaknesses that we are experiencing in Southern Europe. However, total revenue will be negatively affected by currency headwinds. 
In Asia-Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. The total revenue growth reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which has another quarter before we pass the anniversary date. We're also affirming our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at the range of $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.75 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 6% to 9%. 
As Patrick stated, we are also affirming our cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. The outlook assumes no change in the previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately $0.16 -- 16% with an anticipated higher rate in the first half of the year than in the second half. We're updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately $95 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed in Q1. 
Please go to Slide 15. As a summary of Allegion's Q1 performance, total revenue grew nearly 7%, organic revenue grew almost 6%, adjusted operating margins were up 10 basis points, and were up in all regions. Adjusted EPS saw 10% growth in the quarter. Access has been an important part of our past and will be more important part of the future, as we connect the world through seamless access and smart devices. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I think multifamily continues to be robust, that surprises me, but people are moving into the inner cities. These projects tend to be more price competitive, especially on the traditional mechanical hardware. We do like the trend that these are becoming more electronic. We have, over the last 2 years, had a focused effort around this, and we think it will give us some lift. The strength of our company continues to be on the retrofit fit side of this.

Channel development, continued investment in the channel, underserved market opportunities around the globe, we'll continue to do that. And then demand creation as related to trying to accelerate adoption, centered around electronics. Those are kind of the 3 primary categories, all kind of front-end loaded in terms of revenue, driving growth and we'll continue to do that and again it will expand during the course of the year."

We had modest top line revenue growth in the second quarter, and we saw strength in our Americas nonresidential business. Our residential business in the Americas was flat driven by challenging new construction markets. We also experienced currency pressures in our European and Asian businesses. Although our Americas business growth was lower sequentially in the second quarter, overall growth in the first half of the year was strong at 5.7%.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to see healthy end markets in our nonresidential business, particularly in institutional verticals. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of these healthy markets in the second half of 2019. We also expect our residential markets should start to improve versus what we have seen in the first half of the year. 
Americas electronics growth was approximately 9% for the quarter, which was slightly lower than our historical growth rates. Our electronic growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by a slower-than-expected ramp-up in the new residential construction market and focused channel actions that we started in Q1 to drive more consistency and better alignment with our existing partners.
We believe that with these efforts now complete, we are positioned nicely and expect to accelerate electronics growth during the remainder of the year. This is further supported by the healthy demand for the recently launched Schlage residential lock, renewed efforts with existing partners and the benefit of new partners including Lennar. Allegion's combination of brands, expanded portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large install base provide us a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow.
Moving now to Slide. Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase again this quarter. 
During the quarter, the company closed its production facility in Turkey. Some products formerly produced at this site for brands in the EMEIA region are in the process of being transferred to other manufacturing locations in Europe. We continuously look for ways to improve Allegion's supply chain. This action will help us to streamline our operational footprint in Europe, which is necessary to maintain sustainable and profitable long-term growth in the region. It's also a normal part of our enterprise excellence strategy focused on driving cost competitive positions in all elements of our supply chain.
In the second quarter, we delivered a slight increase in adjusted EPS driven primarily from operations, which was offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate. We're updating the full year revenue outlook. We are now projecting total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I'll speak to the individual regions later in the presentation.
Lastly, we are lowering the outlook for reported EPS to a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share down from $4.60 to $4.75 reflecting the impact of the exiting of the Turkey operations. 
We are also tightening the range and raising the midpoint for 2019 adjusted EPS outlook from a range of $4.75 to $4.90 per share to revise outlook of $4.80 to $4.90 per share.
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. Revenue for the second quarter was $731.2 million, an increase of 3.8% inclusive of 3% organic growth. Acquisitions contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas organic growth came in at 3.3% in the quarter driven by strong price realization.
The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth, and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points, aided by price and productivity, which more than offset inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization and productivity savings to combat inflationary pressures. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, increased by $0.01 versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate.
Year-to-date available cash flow is down approximately $20 million. The decrease in cash is related to increased capital expenditures and increased working capitals of build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure.
Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, and we touched on it again in our first quarter call. We chosen to include it again this quarter to highlight our belief that the 5 strategic pillars that Allegion has laid out as a foundation of our future. The pillars that guide Allegion are: Expanding core markets, we continue to broaden the core business to existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. 
To be the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms to integrate well with others. 
Delivering new value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity, we are also intent on bringing new products to market faster. 
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. 
Access has been a part of our company's history from 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Please go to Slide 7. With this continued focus on Allegion's strategic pillars that support our vision and our growth strategy, we are excited about the partnership opportunities for the Connected Home. To us, this means being recognized as experts with innovative products in open standards, ultimately allowing for seamless integration with best-in-class players.
You might remember from our Investor Day event that we showcased a variety of our partners for the U.S. residential market, again highlighted on this slide. Our strong presence with our retailers, e-commerce and home builders position us well in the Connected Home space. 
Schlage Encode, our first ever Wi-Fi enabled is providing -- is proving to be an essential part of our portfolio and working with our partners. Schlage Encode was launched late in Q1, works directly with the Key by Amazon app and Ring devices and is a market-leading part of the Schlage home experience. It will also be part of the Lennar standard home automation offering. 
Our work with these partners through innovations like Schlage Encode is a prime example of how we will increase electronic adoptions in the residential market space.
In addition to accelerating electronic adoptions, strategic partnerships will continue to help drive our vision of seamless actions and a safer world.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss the full year 2019 outlook."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on the respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 3% organic growth in the second quarter. Strong price realization of 2.2% drove the organic increase this quarter. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures moving forward. 
Also during the second quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 2% growth offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced in both the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions.
Please go to Slide #9. Reported net revenues for the second quarter were $731.2 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 3.8% versus the prior year, up 3% on an organic basis. 
Adjusted operating income of $157.3 million, increased nearly 5% over the same timeframe last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% increased 20 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating income increase. Leverage on the incremental volume also contributed to the margin expansion.
Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 70 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions.
Please go to Slide #10. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was $1.19. Adjusting $0.06 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost related to acquisitions, the Q2 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.25.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. 
Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.01cent increase as, we executed nearly $70 million in share buyback in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest drove a $0.02 reduction, which is mostly impacted by favorable other income in 2018 that did not repeat.
The year-over-year increase in the tax rate had a $0.04 unfavorable impact primarily driven by the unfavorable mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.04 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. This resulted in adjusted second quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of $0.01 compared to the prior year.
Lastly, we had a $0.10 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring and acquisitions. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.16.
Please go to Slide #11. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $545.1 million, up 3.5% on a reported basis and 3.3% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong price realization of 2.5%. When compared to Q2 of last year, we experienced mid-single digit growth in the nonresidential business and residential was essentially flat.
Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas region coming in at approximately 9%. On a year-to-date basis, the Americas has delivered total growth of 5.7% and organic growth of 5.3%. Americas adjusted operating income of $162.4 million increased 4.2% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Additionally, leverage on the incremental volumes contributed to the increase. Inflationary pressures are expected to ease during the second half of 2019. Combined with our pipeline of the productivity actions, this should position us for increased margin expansion throughout the remainder of the year. Incremental investments were 60 basis points decrease on operating margins.
Please go to Slide #12. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.2 million, down 3.8% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven primarily by pricing and favorable volume in our portable security, SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weakness in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds.
As Dave mentioned earlier on the call, we reported we closed our manufacturing operations in Turkey. There was minimal impact to revenue and adjusted operating income in the quarter. Dave will discuss the full year impacts related to this closure when he discusses the outlook later in the call.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.4 million decreased 5.8% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 20 basis points. Excluding currency impacts, the region would have seen a 10 basis point increase in margins driven by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 60 basis point headwind to operating margin.
Please go to Slide #13. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $43.9 million, up 45.8% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 4.7%. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 47%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 6%.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.8 million, an increase of $1 million with adjusted operating margins improving 140 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity and inflation dynamic was positive in the region. Incremental investments were 120 basis points decline on adjusted operating margins. We are pleased with the continued progress in the Asia Pacific region as the strategy and restructuring initiatives began to drive operational improvements.
Please go to Slide #14. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2019 was $77.7 million, which is a decrease of $28.1million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by increased capital spending and higher working capital requirements to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure.
Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the second quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly high. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.
Lastly, we are updating our full year available cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million. Reduction from the prior outlook is inclusive of the closure of operations in Turkey.
I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue is now at the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will remain strong throughout 2019. In residential, we expect markets to improve versus what we experienced in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend.
For the European region, we expect continued strength in our electronic businesses led by SimonsVoss and Interflex. We expect this will more than offset weaknesses we are experiencing in Southern Europe leading to positive organic growth for the region. However, total revenue will be negatively impacted by currency headwinds.
In addition, we have reduced our revenue outlook for the EMEIA region to account for the impacts of our decision to exit operations in Turkey.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand, particularly around residential end markets. The total revenue outlook reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which passed its 1-year anniversary on June 30. 
We are also updating our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.80 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 7% to 9%.
As Patrick stated, we are updating our cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million with the reduction from prior outlook inclusive of our closure of our Turkey operations. 
The outlook assumes no change in the previous -- previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately 16%. 
We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately [ 94 ] million, reflecting the buyback activity completed during the first half of the year and including expected share repurchases for the back half of 2019.
The closure of our Turkey operations is expected to have $0.14 to $0.17 impact on the reported EPS, some of which has been seen in Q2 and a $0.02 impact to adjusted EPS in the third quarter.
Please go to Slide 16. A brief summary of Allegion's Q2 performance. Total revenue grew 3.8% in the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. Organic revenue growth grew 3% in Q2 and 4.3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins were up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was up slightly.

So on the pricing front, as indicated in our comments, really strong price realization in Q2. And just remember relative to our pricing actions, you may recall last year, we implemented the price increase in beginning of July. This year, we pulled it forward to May. So in effect, you had the impact of 2 price increases for this quarter year-over-year. So that's why sequentially and for the quarter year-over-year, you have really strong price realization. As we look forward to the second half, we still anticipate good price realization, but sequentially will be down relative to what you saw in Q2. You're probably looking at an overall impact, we'll call it around 1.5% kind of going forward. 
As it relates to the nonresi, resi area in terms of pricing, most of the price realization is coming from nonresidential markets given the strengths there and our ability to pass it on to offset inflationary headwinds. So we will continue to see that. You may recall last year, we had some choppiness in the residential segment associated with pricing as related to rebates, promotions, those types of things. A lot of that is subsided, and I'd say as anticipated kind of a flattish pricing environment as it relates to residential and to the extent, we can push, we will, but it's improvement on a net basis after taking into consideration some of those promos and rebates."

So we call relative to the inflation we are getting to easier comps starting here in Q3 as it relates to commodity cost and then pricing and that type of thing. And you may recall our methodology is try to hedge inflation in terms of -- not financial hedges but contracts with suppliers. So we lock into prices on an outward to perhaps 12 months. And as inflation subsides, we see that perhaps later than other people might. So we're going to start reaping the benefits in the second half as it relates to the reduction in commodity costs. That can be a big driver. And then the continued volume leverage and the margin accretion associated with that is the big driver as well. And we had a couple of one-off type of things that are nonrecurring as well. So that collectively will serve to improve the operating margin performance. And I'll just say as a collective company for the full year and we communicated this at the beginning of the year, the objective is to get close to 100 basis points improvement for the full year, which gets us back to kind of the 2017 levels and still feel like we have good visibility into that relative to the improvement in the price, productivity, inflation dynamic as well as the leverage on incremental volume."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We had modest top line revenue growth in the second quarter, and we saw strength in our Americas nonresidential business. Our residential business in the Americas was flat driven by challengi",1198,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We had modest top line revenue growth in the second quarter, and we saw strength in our Americas nonresidential business. Our residential business in the Americas was flat driven by challenging new construction markets. We also experienced currency pressures in our European and Asian businesses. Although our Americas business growth was lower sequentially in the second quarter, overall growth in the first half of the year was strong at 5.7%.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to see healthy end markets in our nonresidential business, particularly in institutional verticals. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of these healthy markets in the second half of 2019. We also expect that residential markets should start to improve versus what we have seen in the first half of the year. 
Americas electronics growth was approximately 9% for the quarter, which was slightly lower than our historical growth rates. Our electronic growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by a slower-than-expected ramp-up in the new residential construction market and focused channel actions that we started in Q1 to drive more consistency and better alignment with our existing partners.
We believe that with these efforts now complete, we are positioned nicely and expect to accelerate electronics growth during the remainder of the year. This is further supported by the healthy demand for the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock, renewed efforts with existing partners and the benefit of new partners including Lennar. Allegion's combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large installed base provide us a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow.
Moving now the Slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase again this quarter. 
During the quarter, the company closed its production facility in Turkey. Some products formerly produced at this site for brands in the EMEIA region are in the process of being transferred to other manufacturing locations in Europe. We continuously look for ways to improve Allegion's supply chain. This action will help us to streamline our operational footprint in Europe, which is necessary to maintain sustainable and profitable long-term growth in the region. It's also a normal part of our enterprise excellence strategy focused on driving cost competitive positions in all elements of our supply chain.
In the second quarter, we delivered a slight increase in adjusted EPS driven primarily from operations, which was offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate. We're updating the full year revenue outlook. We are now projecting total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I'll speak to the individual regions later in the presentation.
Lastly, we are lowering the outlook for reported EPS to a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share down from $4.60 to $4.75 reflecting the impact of the exiting of the Turkey operations. 
We are also tightening the range and raising the midpoint for 2019 adjusted EPS outlook from a range of $4.75 to $4.90 per share to a revised outlook of $4.80 to $4.90 per share.
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. Revenue for the second quarter was $731.2 million, an increase of 3.8% inclusive of 3% organic growth. Acquisitions contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas organic growth came in at 3.3% in the quarter driven by strong price realization.
The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth, and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points, aided by price and productivity, which more than offset inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization and productivity savings to combat inflationary pressures. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, increased by $0.01 versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate.
Year-to-date available cash flow is down approximately $20 million. The decrease in cash is related to increased capital expenditures and increased working capital to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure.
Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, and we touched on it again in our first quarter call. We've chosen to include it again this quarter to highlight our belief that the 5 strategic pillars that Allegion has laid out are the foundation of our future. The pillars that guide Allegion are: Expanding core markets, we continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. 
To be the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we're intent on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms to integrate well with others. 
Delivering new value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity, we are also intent on bringing new products to market faster. 
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. 
Access has been a part of our company's history from 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Please go to Slide 7. With this continued focus on Allegion's strategic pillars that support our vision and growth strategy, we are excited about the partnership opportunities for the Connected Home. To us, this means being recognized as experts with innovative products in open standards, ultimately allowing for seamless integration with best-in-class players.
You might remember from our Investor Day event that we showcased a variety of our partners for the U.S. residential market, again highlighted on this slide. Our strong presence with retailers, e-commerce and home builders position us well in the Connected Home space. 
Schlage Encode, our first ever Wi-Fi enabled Deadbolt is providing -- is proving to be an essential part of our portfolio and working with our partners. Schlage Encode was launched in late Q1, works directly with the Key by Amazon app and Ring devices and is a market-leading part of the Schlage home experience. It will also be part of the Lennar standard home automation offering. 
Our work with these partners through innovations like Schlage Encode is a prime example of how we will increase electronic adoptions in the residential market space.
In addition to accelerating electronic adoptions, strategic partnerships will continue to help drive our vision of seamless access in a safer world.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss the full year 2019 outlook."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 3% organic growth in the second quarter. Strong price realization of 2.2% drove the organic increase this quarter. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures moving forward. 
Also during the second quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 2% growth offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced in both the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions.
Please go to Slide #9. Reported net revenues for the second quarter were $731.2 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 3.8% versus the prior year, up 3% on an organic basis. 
Adjusted operating income of $157.3 million, increased nearly 5% over the same timeframe last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% increased 20 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating income increase. Leverage on the incremental volume also contributed to the margin expansion.
Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 70 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions.
Please go to Slide #10. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was $1.19. Adjusting $0.06 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost related to acquisitions, the Q2 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.25.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. 
Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.01 increase as we executed nearly $70 million in share buyback in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest drove a $0.02 reduction, which is mostly impacted by favorable other income in 2018 that did not repeat.
The year-over-year increase in the tax rate had a $0.04 unfavorable impact primarily driven by the unfavorable mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.04 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. This resulted in adjusted second quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of $0.01 compared to the prior year.
Lastly, we had a $0.10 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring and acquisitions. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.16.
Please go to Slide #11. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $545.1 million, up 3.5% on a reported basis and 3.3% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong price realization of 2.5%. When compared to Q2 of last year, we experienced mid-single digit growth in the nonresidential business and residential was essentially flat.
Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas region coming in at approximately 9%. On a year-to-date basis, the Americas has delivered total growth of 5.7% and organic growth of 5.3%. Americas adjusted operating income of $162.4 million increased 4.2% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Additionally, leverage on the incremental volumes contributed to the increase. Inflationary pressures are expected to ease during the second half of 2019. Combined with our pipeline of the productivity actions, this should position us for increased margin expansion throughout the remainder of the year. Incremental investments were a 60 basis points decrease on operating margins.
Please go to Slide #12. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.2 million, down 3.8% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven primarily by pricing and favorable volume in our portable security, SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weakness in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds.
As Dave mentioned earlier on the call, during the quarter we closed our manufacturing operations in Turkey. There was minimal impact to revenue and adjusted operating income in the quarter. Dave will discuss the full year impacts related to this closure when he discusses the outlook later in the call.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.4 million decreased 5.8% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 20 basis points. Excluding currency impacts, the region would have seen a 10 basis point increase in margins driven by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 60 basis point headwind to operating margin.
Please go to Slide #13. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $43.9 million, up 45.8% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 4.7%. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 47%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 6%.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.8 million, an increase of $1 million with adjusted operating margins improving 140 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity and inflation dynamic was positive in the region. Incremental investments were a 120 basis point decline on adjusted operating margins. We are pleased with the continued progress in the Asia Pacific region as the strategy and restructuring initiatives begin to drive operational improvements.
Please go to Slide #14. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2019 was $77.7 million, which is a decrease of $20.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by increased capital spending and higher working capital requirements to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure.
Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the second quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.
Lastly, we are updating our full year available cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million. Reduction from the prior outlook is inclusive of the closure of operations in Turkey.
I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue is now at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will remain strong throughout 2019. In residential, we expect markets to improve versus what we experienced in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend.
For the European region, we expect continued strength in our electronic business led by SimonsVoss and Interflex. We expect this will more than offset weaknesses we are experiencing in Southern Europe leading to positive organic growth for the region. However, total revenue will be negatively impacted by currency headwinds.
In addition, we have reduced our revenue outlook for the EMEIA region to account for the impacts of our decision to exit operations in Turkey.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand, particularly around residential end markets. The total revenue outlook reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which passed its 1-year anniversary on June 30. 
We are also updating our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.80 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 7% to 9%.
As Patrick stated, we are updating our cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million with the reduction from prior outlook inclusive of our closure of our Turkey operations. 
The outlook assumes no change in the previous -- in previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately 16%. 
We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately 94 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed during the first half of the year and including expected share repurchases for the back half of 2019.
The closure of our Turkey operations is expected to have $0.14 to $0.17 impact on the reported EPS, some of which has been seen in Q2 and a $0.02 impact to adjusted EPS in the third quarter.
Please go to Slide 16. A brief summary of Allegion's Q2 performance. Total revenue grew 3.8% in the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. Organic revenue growth grew 3% in Q2 and 4.3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins were up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was up slightly.

So on the pricing front, as indicated in our comments, really strong price realization in Q2. And just remember relative to our pricing actions, you may recall last year, we implemented the price increase in beginning of July. This year, we pulled it forward to May. So in effect, you had the impact of 2 price increases for this quarter year-over-year. So that's why sequentially and for the quarter year-over-year, you had really strong price realization. As we look forward to the second half, we still anticipate good price realization, but sequentially will be down relative to what you saw in Q2. You're probably looking at an overall impact, we'll call it around 1.5% kind of going forward. 
As it relates to the nonresi, resi area in terms of pricing, most of the price realization is coming from nonresidential markets given the strength there and our ability to pass it on to offset inflationary headwinds. So we will continue to see that. You may recall last year, we had some choppiness in the residential segment associated with pricing as related to rebates, promotions, those types of things. A lot of that is subsided, and I'd say as anticipated kind of a flattish pricing environment as it relates to residential and to the extent, we can push, we will, but it's improvement on a net basis after taking into consideration some of those promos and rebates."

Feel really good about where we are as we look forward to those opportunities. The price, productivity, inflation dynamic will continue to improve there. So recall relative to the inflation we are getting to easier comps starting here in Q3 as it relates to commodity cost and then pricing and that type of thing. And you may recall our methodology is try to hedge inflation in terms of -- not financial hedges but contracts with suppliers. So we lock into prices on an outward to perhaps 12 months. And as inflation subsides, we see that perhaps later than other people might. So we're going to start reaping the benefits in the second half as it relates to the reduction in commodity costs. That can be a big driver. And then the continued volume leverage and the margin accretion associated with that is a big driver as well. And we had a couple of one-off type of things that are nonrecurring as well. So that collectively will serve to improve the operating margin performance. And I'd just say as a collective company for the full year and we communicated this at the beginning of the year, the objective is to get close to 100 basis points improvement for the full year, which gets us back to kind of like the 2017 levels and still feel like we have good visibility to that relative to the improvement in the price, productivity, inflation dynamic as well as the leverage on the incremental volume."

It's more of a, I'd say, a risk mitigation activity than a significant payback on a cash basis. Right thing to do, as Dave mentioned, to serve our customers with expedited supply chain capability. And so there are some benefits throughout the supply chain, not so much from a labor arbitrage, but it's definitely the right thing to do and we'll continue to look at opportunities to leverage our footprint going forward."

We had modest top line revenue growth in the second quarter, and we saw strength in our Americas nonresidential business. Our residential business in the Americas was flat driven by challenging new construction markets. We also experienced currency pressures in our European and Asian businesses. Although our Americas business growth was lower sequentially in the second quarter, overall growth in the first half of the year was strong at 5.7%.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to see healthy end markets in our nonresidential business, particularly in institutional verticals. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of these healthy markets in the second half of 2019. We also expect that residential markets should start to improve versus what we have seen in the first half of the year. 
Americas electronics growth was approximately 9% for the quarter, which was slightly lower than our historical growth rates. Our electronic growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by a slower-than-expected ramp-up in the new residential construction market and focused channel actions that we started in Q1 to drive more consistency and better alignment with our existing partners.
We believe that with these efforts now complete, we are positioned nicely and expect to accelerate electronics growth during the remainder of the year. This is further supported by the healthy demand for the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock, renewed efforts with existing partners and the benefit of new partners including Lennar. Allegion's combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large installed base provide us a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow.
Moving now the Slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase again this quarter. 
During the quarter, the company closed its production facility in Turkey. Some products formerly produced at this site for brands in the EMEIA region are in the process of being transferred to other manufacturing locations in Europe. We continuously look for ways to improve Allegion's supply chain. This action will help us to streamline our operational footprint in Europe, which is necessary to maintain sustainable and profitable long-term growth in the region. It's also a normal part of our enterprise excellence strategy focused on driving cost competitive positions in all elements of our supply chain.
In the second quarter, we delivered a slight increase in adjusted EPS driven primarily from operations, which was offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate. We're updating the full year revenue outlook. We are now projecting total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I'll speak to the individual regions later in the presentation.
Lastly, we are lowering the outlook for reported EPS to a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share down from $4.60 to $4.75 reflecting the impact of the exiting of the Turkey operations. 
We are also tightening the range and raising the midpoint for 2019 adjusted EPS outlook from a range of $4.75 to $4.90 per share to a revised outlook of $4.80 to $4.90 per share.
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. Revenue for the second quarter was $731.2 million, an increase of 3.8% inclusive of 3% organic growth. Acquisitions contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas organic growth came in at 3.3% in the quarter driven by strong price realization.
The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth, and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points, aided by price and productivity, which more than offset inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization and productivity savings to combat inflationary pressures. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, increased by $0.01 versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate.
Year-to-date available cash flow is down approximately $20 million. The decrease in cash is related to increased capital expenditures and increased working capital to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure.
Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, and we touched on it again in our first quarter call. We've chosen to include it again this quarter to highlight our belief that the 5 strategic pillars that Allegion has laid out are the foundation of our future. The pillars that guide Allegion are: Expanding core markets, we continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. 
To be the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we're intent on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms to integrate well with others. 
Delivering new value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity, we are also intent on bringing new products to market faster. 
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. 
Access has been a part of our company's history from 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Please go to Slide 7. With this continued focus on Allegion's strategic pillars that support our vision and growth strategy, we are excited about the partnership opportunities for the Connected Home. To us, this means being recognized as experts with innovative products in open standards, ultimately allowing for seamless integration with best-in-class players.
You might remember from our Investor Day event that we showcased a variety of our partners for the U.S. residential market, again highlighted on this slide. Our strong presence with retailers, e-commerce and home builders position us well in the Connected Home space. 
Schlage Encode, our first ever Wi-Fi enabled Deadbolt is providing -- is proving to be an essential part of our portfolio and working with our partners. Schlage Encode was launched in late Q1, works directly with the Key by Amazon app and Ring devices and is a market-leading part of the Schlage home experience. It will also be part of the Lennar standard home automation offering. 
Our work with these partners through innovations like Schlage Encode is a prime example of how we will increase electronic adoptions in the residential market space.
In addition to accelerating electronic adoptions, strategic partnerships will continue to help drive our vision of seamless access in a safer world.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss the full year 2019 outlook."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 3% organic growth in the second quarter. Strong price realization of 2.2% drove the organic increase this quarter. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures moving forward. 
Also during the second quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 2% growth offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced in both the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions.
Please go to Slide #9. Reported net revenues for the second quarter were $731.2 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 3.8% versus the prior year, up 3% on an organic basis. 
Adjusted operating income of $157.3 million, increased nearly 5% over the same timeframe last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% increased 20 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating income increase. Leverage on the incremental volume also contributed to the margin expansion.
Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 70 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions.
Please go to Slide #10. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was $1.19. Adjusting $0.06 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost related to acquisitions, the Q2 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.25.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. 
Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.01 increase as we executed nearly $70 million in share buyback in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest drove a $0.02 reduction, which is mostly impacted by favorable other income in 2018 that did not repeat.
The year-over-year increase in the tax rate had a $0.04 unfavorable impact primarily driven by the unfavorable mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.04 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. This resulted in adjusted second quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of $0.01 compared to the prior year.
Lastly, we had a $0.10 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring and acquisitions. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.16.
Please go to Slide #11. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $545.1 million, up 3.5% on a reported basis and 3.3% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong price realization of 2.5%. When compared to Q2 of last year, we experienced mid-single digit growth in the nonresidential business and residential was essentially flat.
Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas region coming in at approximately 9%. On a year-to-date basis, the Americas has delivered total growth of 5.7% and organic growth of 5.3%. Americas adjusted operating income of $162.4 million increased 4.2% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Additionally, leverage on the incremental volumes contributed to the increase. Inflationary pressures are expected to ease during the second half of 2019. Combined with our pipeline of the productivity actions, this should position us for increased margin expansion throughout the remainder of the year. Incremental investments were a 60 basis points decrease on operating margins.
Please go to Slide #12. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.2 million, down 3.8% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven primarily by pricing and favorable volume in our portable security, SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weakness in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds.
As Dave mentioned earlier on the call, during the quarter we closed our manufacturing operations in Turkey. There was minimal impact to revenue and adjusted operating income in the quarter. Dave will discuss the full year impacts related to this closure when he discusses the outlook later in the call.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.4 million decreased 5.8% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 20 basis points. Excluding currency impacts, the region would have seen a 10 basis point increase in margins driven by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 60 basis point headwind to operating margin.
Please go to Slide #13. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $43.9 million, up 45.8% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 4.7%. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 47%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 6%.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.8 million, an increase of $1 million with adjusted operating margins improving 140 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity and inflation dynamic was positive in the region. Incremental investments were a 120 basis point decline on adjusted operating margins. We are pleased with the continued progress in the Asia Pacific region as the strategy and restructuring initiatives begin to drive operational improvements.
Please go to Slide #14. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2019 was $77.7 million, which is a decrease of $20.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by increased capital spending and higher working capital requirements to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure.
Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the second quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.
Lastly, we are updating our full year available cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million. Reduction from the prior outlook is inclusive of the closure of operations in Turkey.
I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will remain strong throughout 2019. In residential, we expect markets to improve versus what we experienced in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend.
For the European region, we expect continued strength in our electronic business led by SimonsVoss and Interflex. We expect this will more than offset weaknesses we are experiencing in Southern Europe leading to positive organic growth for the region. However, total revenue will be negatively impacted by currency headwinds.
In addition, we have reduced our revenue outlook for the EMEIA region to account for the impacts of our decision to exit operations in Turkey.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand, particularly around residential end markets. The total revenue outlook reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which passed its 1-year anniversary on June 30. 
We are also updating our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.80 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 7% to 9%.
As Patrick stated, we are updating our cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million with the reduction from prior outlook inclusive of our closure of our Turkey operations. 
The outlook assumes no change in the previous -- in previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately 16%. 
We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately 94 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed during the first half of the year and including expected share repurchases for the back half of 2019.
The closure of our Turkey operations is expected to have $0.14 to $0.17 impact on the reported EPS, some of which has been seen in Q2 and a $0.02 impact to adjusted EPS in the third quarter.
Please go to Slide 16. A brief summary of Allegion's Q2 performance. Total revenue grew 3.8% in the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. Organic revenue growth grew 3% in Q2 and 4.3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins were up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was up slightly.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I think it's pretty widely seen that there were some challenges in new construction including we expected acceleration with Lennar. That's progressing, but those were the factors that we went in and worked, and we think it positions us nicely for the second half."

So on the pricing front, as indicated in our comments, really strong price realization in Q2. And just remember relative to our pricing actions, you may recall last year, we implemented the price increase in beginning of July. This year, we pulled it forward to May. So in effect, you had the impact of 2 price increases for this quarter year-over-year. So that's why sequentially and for the quarter year-over-year, you had really strong price realization. As we look forward to the second half, we still anticipate good price realization, but sequentially will be down relative to what you saw in Q2. You're probably looking at an overall impact, we'll call it around 1.5% kind of going forward. 
As it relates to the nonresi, resi area in terms of pricing, most of the price realization is coming from nonresidential markets given the strength there and our ability to pass it on to offset inflationary headwinds. So we will continue to see that. You may recall last year, we had some choppiness in the residential segment associated with pricing as related to rebates, promotions, those types of things. A lot of that is subsided, and I'd say as anticipated kind of a flattish pricing environment as it relates to residential and to the extent, we can push, we will, but it's improvement on a net basis after taking into consideration some of those promos and rebates."

Feel really good about where we are as we look forward to those opportunities. The price, productivity, inflation dynamic will continue to improve there. So recall relative to the inflation we are getting to easier comps starting here in Q3 as it relates to commodity cost and then pricing and that type of thing. And you may recall our methodology is try to hedge inflation in terms of -- not financial hedges but contracts with suppliers. So we lock into prices on an outward to perhaps 12 months. And as inflation subsides, we see that perhaps later than other people might. So we're going to start reaping the benefits in the second half as it relates to the reduction in commodity costs. That can be a big driver. And then the continued volume leverage and the margin accretion associated with that is a big driver as well. And we had a couple of one-off type of things that are nonrecurring as well. So that collectively will serve to improve the operating margin performance. And I'd just say as a collective company for the full year and we communicated this at the beginning of the year, the objective is to get close to 100 basis points improvement for the full year, which gets us back to kind of like the 2017 levels and still feel like we have good visibility to that relative to the improvement in the price, productivity, inflation dynamic as well as the leverage on the incremental volume."

We had modest top line revenue growth in the second quarter, and we saw strength in our Americas nonresidential business. Our residential business in the Americas was flat driven by challenging new construction markets. We also experienced currency pressures in our European and Asian businesses. Although our Americas business growth was lower sequentially in the second quarter, overall growth in the first half of the year was strong at 5.7%.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to see healthy end markets in our nonresidential business, particularly in institutional verticals. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of these healthy markets in the second half of 2019. We also expect that residential markets should start to improve versus what we have seen in the first half of the year. 
Americas electronics growth was approximately 9% for the quarter, which was slightly lower than our historical growth rates. Our electronic growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by a slower-than-expected ramp-up in the new residential construction market and focused channel actions that we started in Q1 to drive more consistency and better alignment with our existing partners.
We believe that with these efforts now complete, we are positioned nicely and expect to accelerate electronics growth during the remainder of the year. This is further supported by the healthy demand for the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock, renewed efforts with existing partners and the benefit of new partners including Lennar. Allegion's combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large installed base provide us a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow.
Moving now the Slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase again this quarter. 
During the quarter, the company closed its production facility in Turkey. Some products formerly produced at this site for brands in the EMEIA region are in the process of being transferred to other manufacturing locations in Europe. We continuously look for ways to improve Allegion's supply chain. This action will help us to streamline our operational footprint in Europe, which is necessary to maintain sustainable and profitable long-term growth in the region. It's also a normal part of our enterprise excellence strategy focused on driving cost competitive positions in all elements of our supply chain.
In the second quarter, we delivered a slight increase in adjusted EPS driven primarily from operations, which was offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate. We're updating the full year revenue outlook. We are now projecting total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I'll speak to the individual regions later in the presentation.
Lastly, we are lowering the outlook for reported EPS to a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share down from $4.60 to $4.75 reflecting the impact of the exiting of the Turkey operations. 
We are also tightening the range and raising the midpoint for 2019 adjusted EPS outlook from a range of $4.75 to $4.90 per share to a revised outlook of $4.80 to $4.90 per share.
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. Revenue for the second quarter was $731.2 million, an increase of 3.8% inclusive of 3% organic growth. Acquisitions contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas organic growth came in at 3.3% in the quarter driven by strong price realization.
The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth, and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points, aided by price and productivity, which more than offset inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization and productivity savings to combat inflationary pressures. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, increased by $0.01 versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate.
Year-to-date available cash flow is down approximately $20 million. The decrease in cash is related to increased capital expenditures and increased working capital to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure.
Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, and we touched on it again in our first quarter call. We've chosen to include it again this quarter to highlight our belief that the 5 strategic pillars that Allegion has laid out are the foundation of our future. The pillars that guide Allegion are: Expanding core markets, we continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. 
To be the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we're intent on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms to integrate well with others. 
Delivering new value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity, we are also intent on bringing new products to market faster. 
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. 
Access has been a part of our company's history from 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Please go to Slide 7. With this continued focus on Allegion's strategic pillars that support our vision and growth strategy, we are excited about the partnership opportunities for the Connected Home. To us, this means being recognized as experts with innovative products in open standards, ultimately allowing for seamless integration with best-in-class players.
You might remember from our Investor Day event that we showcased a variety of our partners for the U.S. residential market, again highlighted on this slide. Our strong presence with retailers, e-commerce and home builders position us well in the Connected Home space. 
Schlage Encode, our first ever Wi-Fi enabled Deadbolt is providing -- is proving to be an essential part of our portfolio and working with our partners. Schlage Encode was launched in late Q1, works directly with the Key by Amazon app and Ring devices and is a market-leading part of the Schlage home experience. It will also be part of the Lennar standard home automation offering. 
Our work with these partners through innovations like Schlage Encode is a prime example of how we will increase electronic adoptions in the residential market space.
In addition to accelerating electronic adoptions, strategic partnerships will continue to help drive our vision of seamless access in a safer world.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss the full year 2019 outlook."

As indicated, we delivered 3% organic growth in the second quarter. Strong price realization of 2.2% drove the organic increase this quarter. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures moving forward. 
Also during the second quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 2% growth offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced in both the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions.
Please go to Slide #9. Reported net revenues for the second quarter were $731.2 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 3.8% versus the prior year, up 3% on an organic basis. 
Adjusted operating income of $157.3 million, increased nearly 5% over the same timeframe last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% increased 20 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating income increase. Leverage on the incremental volume also contributed to the margin expansion.
Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 70 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions.
Please go to Slide #10. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was $1.19. Adjusting $0.06 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost related to acquisitions, the Q2 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.25.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. 
Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.01 increase as we executed nearly $70 million in share buyback in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest drove a $0.02 reduction, which is mostly impacted by favorable other income in 2018 that did not repeat.
The year-over-year increase in the tax rate had a $0.04 unfavorable impact primarily driven by the unfavorable mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.04 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. This resulted in adjusted second quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of $0.01 compared to the prior year.
Lastly, we had a $0.10 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring and acquisitions. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.16.
Please go to Slide #11. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $545.1 million, up 3.5% on a reported basis and 3.3% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong price realization of 2.5%. When compared to Q2 of last year, we experienced mid-single digit growth in the nonresidential business and residential was essentially flat.
Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas region coming in at approximately 9%. On a year-to-date basis, the Americas has delivered total growth of 5.7% and organic growth of 5.3%. Americas adjusted operating income of $162.4 million increased 4.2% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Additionally, leverage on the incremental volumes contributed to the increase. Inflationary pressures are expected to ease during the second half of 2019. Combined with our pipeline of the productivity actions, this should position us for increased margin expansion throughout the remainder of the year. Incremental investments were a 60 basis points decrease on operating margins.
Please go to Slide #12. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.2 million, down 3.8% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven primarily by pricing and favorable volume in our portable security, SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weakness in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds.
As Dave mentioned earlier on the call, during the quarter we closed our manufacturing operations in Turkey. There was minimal impact to revenue and adjusted operating income in the quarter. Dave will discuss the full year impacts related to this closure when he discusses the outlook later in the call.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.4 million decreased 5.8% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 20 basis points. Excluding currency impacts, the region would have seen a 10 basis point increase in margins driven by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 60 basis point headwind to operating margin.
Please go to Slide #13. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $43.9 million, up 45.8% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 4.7%. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 47%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 6%.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.8 million, an increase of $1 million with adjusted operating margins improving 140 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity and inflation dynamic was positive in the region. Incremental investments were a 120 basis point decline on adjusted operating margins. We are pleased with the continued progress in the Asia Pacific region as the strategy and restructuring initiatives begin to drive operational improvements.
Please go to Slide #14. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2019 was $77.7 million, which is a decrease of $20.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by increased capital spending and higher working capital requirements to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure.
Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the second quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.
Lastly, we are updating our full year available cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million. Reduction from the prior outlook is inclusive of the closure of operations in Turkey.
I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue is now at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will remain strong throughout 2019. In residential, we expect markets to improve versus what we experienced in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend.
For the European region, we expect continued strength in our electronic business led by SimonsVoss and Interflex. We expect this will more than offset weaknesses we are experiencing in Southern Europe leading to positive organic growth for the region. However, total revenue will be negatively impacted by currency headwinds.
In addition, we have reduced our revenue outlook for the EMEIA region to account for the impacts of our decision to exit operations in Turkey.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand, particularly around residential end markets. The total revenue outlook reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which passed its 1-year anniversary on June 30. 
We are also updating our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.80 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 7% to 9%.
As Patrick stated, we are updating our cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million with the reduction from prior outlook inclusive of our closure of our Turkey operations. 
The outlook assumes no change in the previous -- in previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately 16%. 
We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately 94 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed during the first half of the year and including expected share repurchases for the back half of 2019.
The closure of our Turkey operations is expected to have $0.14 to $0.17 impact on the reported EPS, some of which has been seen in Q2 and a $0.02 impact to adjusted EPS in the third quarter.
Please go to Slide 16. A brief summary of Allegion's Q2 performance. Total revenue grew 3.8% in the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. Organic revenue growth grew 3% in Q2 and 4.3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins were up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was up slightly.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I think it's pretty widely seen that there were some challenges in new construction including we expected acceleration with Lennar. That's progressing, but those were the factors that we went in and worked, and we think it positions us nicely for the second half."

So on the pricing front, as indicated in our comments, really strong price realization in Q2. And just remember relative to our pricing actions, you may recall last year, we implemented the price increase in beginning of July. This year, we pulled it forward to May. So in effect, you had the impact of 2 price increases for this quarter year-over-year. So that's why sequentially and for the quarter year-over-year, you had really strong price realization. As we look forward to the second half, we still anticipate good price realization, but sequentially will be down relative to what you saw in Q2. You're probably looking at an overall impact, we'll call it around 1.5% kind of going forward. 
As it relates to the nonresi, resi area in terms of pricing, most of the price realization is coming from nonresidential markets given the strength there and our ability to pass it on to offset inflationary headwinds. So we will continue to see that. You may recall last year, we had some choppiness in the residential segment associated with pricing as related to rebates, promotions, those types of things. A lot of that is subsided, and I'd say as anticipated kind of a flattish pricing environment as it relates to residential and to the extent, we can push, we will, but it's improvement on a net basis after taking into consideration some of those promos and rebates."

Feel really good about where we are as we look forward to those opportunities. The price, productivity, inflation dynamic will continue to improve there. So recall relative to the inflation we are getting to easier comps starting here in Q3 as it relates to commodity cost and then pricing and that type of thing. And you may recall our methodology is try to hedge inflation in terms of -- not financial hedges but contracts with suppliers. So we lock into prices on an outward to perhaps 12 months. And as inflation subsides, we see that perhaps later than other people might. So we're going to start reaping the benefits in the second half as it relates to the reduction in commodity costs. That can be a big driver. And then the continued volume leverage and the margin accretion associated with that is a big driver as well. And we had a couple of one-off type of things that are nonrecurring as well. So that collectively will serve to improve the operating margin performance.

Top line revenue growth was strong in the third quarter, particularly in the Americas and EMEA regions. In the Americas, both nonresidential and residential businesses saw high single-digit growth. In EMEIA, we saw solid volume increases across most of the region.
The Americas delivered electronics growth of 10% in the quarter, which was a notable performance considering the challenging comparable from prior year were we grew nearly 30%. Strong market acceptance of our new highly rated Schlage Encode residential continues to be robust and help drive the electronics performance in the quarter. We were the first major manufacturer to bring a smart WiFi to the market and it has a lot of momentum in the residential channel.
We believe our brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships, and a large installed base provide us with a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow.
Moving now to the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which significantly outpaced inflation. I'm proud of the performance as we saw substantial operating margin expansion up 220 basis points this quarter. 
In the third quarter, we delivered robust adjusted EPS growth at nearly 20% driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and tax rate impact. We are affirming the full year revenue outlook in which we continue to project total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I'll speak to the individual region outlooks later in the presentation.
Last, we are tightening the outlook for a reported EPS going from a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share to revised outlook of $4.55 to $4.65 per share. The adjusted EPS outlook is also being tightened by the raising the low end of the range and going from $4.80 to $4.90 per share to a revised outlook of $4.85 to $4.90 per share. 
Please go to Slide 5. Revenue for the third quarter was $748.3 million an increase of 5.2% inclusive of 6.4% organic growth. Currency headwinds offset some of the organic growth.
The Americas and EMEIA region were responsible for the organic growth results, Patrick will share more detail on this. Adjusted operating margin increased by 220 basis points, aided by a substantial contribution from price and productivity outpacing inflation. Solid leverage on incremental volume also provided benefits to the margin expansion.
Adjusted earnings per share of a $1.47 increased by nearly 20% versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and a lower tax rate.
Year-to-date, available cash flow is up slightly with the increased earnings, we have experienced this year being mostly offset by increased capital expenditures.
Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refresh corporate strategy with you, which centers on our vision of access. Since that time momentum and market acceptance continues to build. For instance, smartphones and connectivity are the norm. This translates the pressure from our customers to the end users demand for a mobile connected life, while ensuring security.
Allegion is well positioned to meet this demand. We see strong uptake with our seamless ID solutions for universities in edge devices, in adoption to Schlage Encode in an emerging technologies and venturing opportunities.
We are confident in the long-term electronic opportunity and see that seamless access and safety, we have solid foundation for our future.
As a reminder, our 5 strategic pillars that guide Allegion are expanding core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through existing the new channel relationships, digital demand creation, and leading products. To be the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means, we're intent on leveraging partners, and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others.
Delivering new value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity. We are also intent on bringing new products to market faster.
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement.
Access has been a part of the company's heritage for 100 years. And seamless access will define our company going forward.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss the 2019 outlook."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth from the third quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 6.4% organic growth in Q3. We saw strong volumes and solid price realization drive the organic increase this quarter. Led by both the Americas and EMEIA regions. Volumes recovered nicely from Q2 levels as market demand was strong.
Also, during the third quarter, EMEIA and Asia Pacific continue to be a headwind on total revenue growth. Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the third quarter were $748.3 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 5.2% versus the prior year, up 6.4% on an organic basis.
Adjusted operating income of $173 million increase more than 16% over the same time frame last year. Adjusted operating margin of 23.1% increased 220 basis points. And represents our highest quarterly adjusted operating margins since then. Leverage on incremental volumes, price realization and substantial productivity drove the operating income increase in margin expansion. During the quarter, all regions contributed sizable margin improvements.
Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 30 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was a $1.21. Adjusted $0.02 for the prior year restructuring and acquisition charges as well as adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform. The Q3 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.23. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.24 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency.
Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.03 increase as we have executed nearly $180 million in share buyback so far this year. A decrease in the year-over-year tax rate improved earnings per share by $0.02. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction.
The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest had a negative $0.03 impact, which was driven mostly by favorable other income in 2018.
This results in adjusted third quarter 2019 earnings per share $1.47 an increase of $0.24 or nearly 20% compared to the prior year period.
Lastly, we had a $0.07 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, acquisitions and debt refinancing. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the third quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.40.
Please go to Slide #10. This quarter revenues for the Americas region where $567.8 million, up 7.1% on a reported basis, and 7.2% organically. Organic growth was driven by strong volume, along with continued price realization. When compared to Q3 of last year, we experienced high single-digit growth in both nonresidential and residential, as nonresidential market demand remains strong and residential rebounded nicely from a sluggishness we experienced in the first half of the year.
Electronics growth for the quarter came in at 10%. As Dave mentioned earlier, we are pleased with this electronics performance given that the quarter was going up against a nearly 30% growth rate compared to last year. Americas adjusted operating income of $175.6 million increased 13.8% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased a 180 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by leverage on incremental volume, along with price and productivity significantly exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 50 basis point decrease on operating margins. 
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $137.8 million, up 2.5% and up 6.9% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by increased volume across most products, along with solid price realization. Total revenue growth continues to be reduced by significant currency headwinds.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $12 million increased 17.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased a 110 basis points. With price and leverage on incremental volume contributing to the increase. The timing of year-over-year investments benefited operating margins by 80 basis points as stronger costs incurred in 2018 related to our new polling facility to not repeat this year.
Please go to Slide #12. Third quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $42.7 million, down 9.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue decreased 4.8%. The organic revenue decline was driven by softer residential markets in Australia, along with internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Foreign currency was again a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 4%.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $4.4 million, an increase of 37.5% with adjusted operating margins improving 350 basis points versus the prior year period.
The regions saw strong productivity, the results of restructuring actions taken last year, an acquisition integration, which offset the 70 basis point headwind from incremental investments.
Of note, 2019 Q3 operating income includes a $1.1 million favorable recovery of previously remitted nonincome tax, which had a 260 basis point favorable impact on Asia Pacific margins in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date, available cash flow for the third quarter 2019 was $230 million, which is an increase of $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is driven by increased net earnings, mostly offset by increased capital spending. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased in the third quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.
Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. I'll now hand because the back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

As you can see on the slide and was mentioned earlier, we are affirming our revenue outlook for the total company.

As you can see on the slide and was mentioned earlier, we are affirming our revenue outlook for the total company. The consolidated outlook for total and organic revenue remains at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Although, we are adjusting within the regions. In the Americas, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to remain solid for the near-term future. In residential, we saw Q3 rebound from the sluggishness we experienced during the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend.
Therefore, we are slightly increasing the revenue outlooks for Americas.
For the EMEIA region, we expect continued currency process for the remainder of the year and have taken down our outlook for total revenue. However, organic revenue remains unchanged. In Asia Pacific, we expect the softness in the Australian markets to continue, particularly, around residential end markets. We also expect unfavorable currency impacts to continue. As such, we are leading the outlook for both reported and organic growth in the region.
We are also updating earnings per share outlook raising the low end of both our reported and adjusted EPS ranges. Our reported EPS outlook is now at a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share with adjusted EPS at a range of $4.85 to $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 8% to 9%.
As Patrick stated, we are affirming our cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. The outlook updates the expected investments spend to a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is being updated to approximately 15.5%. With the favorability experienced in Q3 mostly offset in Q4.
We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares for the full year to approximately $94.3 million reflecting the buyback activity completed so far this year, and including expected share repurchases for Q4.
Please go to Slide 15. As a brief summary of Allegion's Q3 performance total revenue grew 5.2%, organic revenue grew 6.4%, adjusted operating margins were up 220 basis points, adjusted EPS was up nearly 20%. In Q3, we delivered our highest quarterly revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. Allegion has an operating system of operations that continue to strengthen the foundational element for both safety and innovation. The system, combined with strong brands and channel relationships has been a hallmark of our performance and spend and certainly helped us deliver the third quarter results.
Thank you, of the Allegion team, your commitment to excellence, strengthens our future. Now Patrick, and I will be happy to take your questions."

And so still expect a good Q4, going forward and we'll finish the year strong relative to top line performance."

And so the comparisons were easier if you will in that GAAP was extremely favorable and the reported results in Q3 this year. We won't see that favorability as much reflected in Q4, and therefore, the margin profile expansion won't be as strong in Q3. However, I would say just given the anticipated continued strength in the overall markets, revenue growth, et cetera, we will have good operating margin improvement year-over-year with margins continue to expand. And our full year expectation, again, is like an 80 to 100 basis points margin improvement full year. So still anticipate strong operational performance in Q4 and throughout the year."

Good Morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered great results in Q3. I'm extremely pleased with the revenue growth and operational performance which have positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 commitments.Top line r",808,"Thanks, Mike. Good Morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered great results in Q3. I'm extremely pleased with the revenue growth and operational performance which have positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 commitments.
Top line revenue growth was strong in the third quarter, particularly in the Americas and EMEIA regions. In the Americas, both nonresidential and residential businesses saw high single-digit growth. In EMEIA, we saw solid volume increases across most of the region.
The Americas delivered electronics growth of 10% in the quarter, which was a notable performance considering the challenging comparable from prior year where we grew nearly 30%. Strong market acceptance of our new highly rated Schlage Encode residential lock continues to be robust and helped drive the electronics performance in the quarter. We were the first major manufacturer to bring a smart WiFi Deadbolt to the market and it has a lot of momentum in the residential channel.
We believe our brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large install base provide us with a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow.
Moving down the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which significantly outpaced inflation. I'm proud of the performance as we saw substantial operating margin expansion up 220 basis points this quarter. In the third quarter, we delivered robust adjusted EPS growth at nearly 20% driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and tax rate impact. We are affirming the full year revenue outlook, in which we continue to project total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I'll speak to the individual region outlooks later in the presentation.
Last, we are tightening the outlook for a reported EPS going from a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share to a revised outlook of $4.55 to $4.65 per share. The adjusted EPS outlook is also being tightened by raising the low end of the range and going from $4.80 to $4.90 per share to a revised outlook of $4.85 to $4.90 per share. 
Please go to Slide 5. Revenue for the third quarter was $748.3 million, an increase of 5.2% inclusive of 6.4% organic growth. Currency headwinds offset some of the organic growth. The Americas and EMEIA region were responsible for the organic growth results. Patrick will share more detail on this. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 220 basis points, aided by substantial contribution from price and productivity outpacing inflation. Solid leverage on incremental volume also provided benefit to the margin expansion.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 increased by nearly 20% versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and a lower tax rate. Year-to-date, available cash flow is up slightly with the increased earnings we have experienced this year, being mostly offset by increased capital expenditures.
Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, which centers on our vision of seamless access. Since that time, momentum and market acceptance continues to build. For instance, smartphones and connectivity are the norm. This translates to pressure from our customers to the end users demand for a mobile connected life while ensuring security. Allegion is well positioned to meet this demand. We see strong uptake with our seamless ID solutions for universities in edge devices and adoption of Schlage Encode in emerging -- and in emerging technologies and venturing opportunities. We're confident in the long-term electronic opportunity and see that seamless access and safety lay solid a foundation for our future.
As a reminder, our 5 strategic pillars that guide Allegion are expanding core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. 
Be the partner of choice. Delivering seamless access means, we're intent on leveraging partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others.
Delivering new value and access. Our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity. We're also intent on bringing new products to market faster.
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of the company's heritage for a 100 years, and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss the 2019 outlook."

I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 6.4% organic growth in Q3. We saw strong volumes and solid price realization drive the organic increase this quarter, led by both the Americas and EMEIA regions. Volumes recovered nicely from Q2 levels as market demand was strong. Also, during the third quarter, currency in EMEIA and Asia Pacific continue to be a headwind on total revenue growth. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the third quarter were $748.3 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 5.2% versus the prior year, up 6.4% on an organic basis.
Adjusted operating income of $173 million increase more than 16% over the same time frame last year. Adjusted operating margin of 23.1% increased 220 basis points. And represents our highest quarterly adjusted operating margin since then. Leverage on incremental volumes, price realization and substantial productivity drove the operating income increase and margin expansion. During the quarter, all regions contributed sizable margin improvements. Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 30 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. 
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was a $1.21. Adjusting $0.02 for the prior year restructuring and acquisition charges as well as adjustments to provisions related to the enactment of tax reform, the Q3 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.23. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.24 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.03 increase as we have executed nearly $180 million in share buyback so far this year. A decrease in the year-over-year tax rate improved earnings per share by $0.02. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest had a negative $0.03 impact, which was driven mostly by favorable other income in 2018. This results in adjusted third quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.47, an increase of $0.24 or nearly 20% compared to the prior year period.
Lastly, we had a $0.07 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, acquisitions and debt refinancing. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the third quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.40.
Please go to Slide #10. This quarter revenues for the Americas region were $567.8 million, up 7.1% on a reported basis and 7.2% organically. Organic growth was driven by strong volume along with continued price realization. When compared to Q3 of last year, we experienced high single-digit growth in both nonresidential and residential, as nonresidential market demand remain strong and residential rebounded nicely from a sluggishness we experienced in the first half of the year. Electronics growth for the quarter came in at 10%. As Dave mentioned earlier, we are pleased with this electronics performance given that the quarter was going up against a nearly 30% growth rate compared to last year. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $175.6 million increased 13.8% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by leverage on incremental volume, along with price and productivity significantly exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 50 basis point decrease on operating margins. 
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $137.8 million, up 2.5% and up 6.9% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by increased volume across most products, along with solid price realization. Total revenue growth continues to be reduced by significant currency headwinds.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $12 million increased 17.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased a 110 basis points, with price and leverage on incremental volume contributing to the increase. Timing of year-over-year investments benefited operating margins by 80 basis points as start-up costs incurred in 2018 related to our new Poland facility did not repeat this year.
Please go to Slide #12. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $42.7 million, down 9.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue decreased 4.8%. The organic revenue decline was driven by softer residential markets in Australia, along with internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Foreign currency was again a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 4%.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $4.4 million, an increase of 37.5%, with adjusted operating margins improving 350 basis points versus the prior year period.The region saw strong productivity, the results of restructuring actions taken last year, and acquisition integration, which offset the 70 basis point headwind from incremental investments. Of note, 2019 Q3 operating income includes a $1.1 million favorable recovery of previously remitted nonincome tax, which had a 260 basis point favorable impact on Asia Pacific margins in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2019 was $230 million, which is an increase of $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is driven by increased net earnings, mostly offset by increased capital spending. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased in the third quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. 
I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

As you can see on the slide and was mentioned earlier, we are affirming our revenue outlook for the total company. The consolidated outlook for total and organic revenue remains at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%, although we're adjusting within the regions. In the Americas, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to remain solid for the near-term future. In residential, we saw Q3 rebound from the sluggishness we experienced during the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend. Therefore, we are slightly increasing the revenue outlooks for Americas.
For the EMEIA region, we expect continued currency pressures for the remainder of the year and have taken down our outlook for total revenue. However, organic revenue remains unchanged. In Asia Pacific, we expect the softness in the Australian markets to continue, particularly, around residential end markets. We also expect unfavorable currency impacts to continue. As such, we're lowering the outlook for both reported and organic growth in the region.
We are also updating the earnings per share outlook, raising the low end of both our reported and adjusted EPS ranges. Our reported EPS outlook is now at a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share with adjusted EPS at a range of $4.85 to $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 8% to 9%.
As Patrick stated, we're affirming our cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. The outlook updates the expected investment spend to a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is being updated to approximately 15.5%, with the favorability experienced in Q3 mostly offset in Q4. We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares for the full year to approximately 94.3 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed so far this year and including expected share repurchases for Q4.
Please go to Slide 15. As a brief summary of Allegion's Q3 performance, total revenue grew 5.2%, organic revenue grew 6.4%, adjusted operating margins were up 220 basis points, adjusted EPS was up nearly 20%. In Q3, we delivered our highest quarterly revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. 
Allegion has an operating system of operations that continue to strengthen the foundational elements of both safety and innovation. The system, combined with strong brands and channel relationships has been a hallmark of our performance in spend and certainly helped us deliver the third quarter results. Thank you to every member of the Allegion team, your commitment to excellence, strengthens our future. 
Now Patrick, and I will be happy to take your questions."

But just as a reminder, we did increase our full year guide on organic revenue growth given the Q3 performance, and so that's based in there. Our year-to-date organic growth of Americas is at 6% and our full year guide is kind of within that range. And so still expect a good Q4 going forward, and we'll finish the year strong relative to top line performance."

And so the comparisons were easier if you will and that gap was extremely favorable in the reported results in Q3 this year. We won't see that favorability as much reflected in Q4, and therefore, the margin profile expansion won't be as strong in Q3. However, I would say just given the anticipated continued strength in the overall markets, revenue growth, et cetera, we will have good operating margin improvement year-over-year with margins continuing to expand. And our full year expectation, again, is like an 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement full year. So still anticipate strong operational performance in Q4 to finish out the year."

I'd like to think that from when we first work with an architect, when we install, we can be the best provider through that stream. And it's -- anytime you've got an industry like ours that's got a mechanical heritage and we're introducing electronics and connectivity to high role, there's opportunity to differentiate ourselves.

Good Morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered great results in Q3. I'm extremely pleased with the revenue growth and operational performance which have positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 commitments.Top line r",809,"Thanks, Mike. Good Morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered great results in Q3. I'm extremely pleased with the revenue growth and operational performance which have positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 commitments.
Top line revenue growth was strong in the third quarter, particularly in the Americas and EMEIA regions. In the Americas, both nonresidential and residential businesses saw high single-digit growth. In EMEIA, we saw solid volume increases across most of the region.
The Americas delivered electronics growth of 10% in the quarter, which was a notable performance considering the challenging comparable from prior year where we grew nearly 30%. Strong market acceptance of our new highly rated Schlage Encode residential lock continues to be robust and helped drive the electronics performance in the quarter. We were the first major manufacturer to bring a smart WiFi Deadbolt to the market and it has a lot of momentum in the residential channel.
We believe our brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large install base provide us with a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow.
Moving down the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which significantly outpaced inflation. I'm proud of the performance as we saw substantial operating margin expansion up 220 basis points this quarter. In the third quarter, we delivered robust adjusted EPS growth at nearly 20% driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and tax rate impact. We are affirming the full year revenue outlook, in which we continue to project total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I'll speak to the individual region outlooks later in the presentation.
Last, we are tightening the outlook for a reported EPS going from a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share to a revised outlook of $4.55 to $4.65 per share. The adjusted EPS outlook is also being tightened by raising the low end of the range and going from $4.80 to $4.90 per share to a revised outlook of $4.85 to $4.90 per share. 
Please go to Slide 5. Revenue for the third quarter was $748.3 million, an increase of 5.2% inclusive of 6.4% organic growth. Currency headwinds offset some of the organic growth. The Americas and EMEIA region were responsible for the organic growth results. Patrick will share more detail on this. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 220 basis points, aided by substantial contribution from price and productivity outpacing inflation. Solid leverage on incremental volume also provided benefit to the margin expansion.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 increased by nearly 20% versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and a lower tax rate. Year-to-date, available cash flow is up slightly with the increased earnings we have experienced this year, being mostly offset by increased capital expenditures.
Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, which centers on our vision of seamless access. Since that time, momentum and market acceptance continues to build. For instance, smartphones and connectivity are the norm. This translates to pressure from our customers to meet end users demand for a mobile connected life while ensuring security. Allegion is well positioned to meet this demand. We see strong uptake with our seamless ID solutions for universities in edge devices and adoption of Schlage Encode in emerging -- and in emerging technologies and venturing opportunities. We're confident in the long-term electronic opportunity and see that seamless access and safety lay a solid foundation for our future.
As a reminder, our 5 strategic pillars that guide Allegion are expand in core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. 
Be the partner of choice. Delivering seamless access means, we're intent on leveraging partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others.
Delivering new value and access. Our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity. We're also intent on bringing new products to market faster.
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of the company's heritage for a 100 years, and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss the 2019 outlook."

I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 6.4% organic growth in Q3. We saw strong volumes and solid price realization drive the organic increase this quarter, led by both the Americas and EMEIA regions. Volumes recovered nicely from Q2 levels as market demand was strong. Also, during the third quarter, currency in EMEIA and Asia Pacific continued to be a headwind on total revenue growth. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the third quarter were $748.3 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 5.2% versus the prior year, up 6.4% on an organic basis.
Adjusted operating income of $173 million increased more than 16% over the same time frame last year. Adjusted operating margin of 23.1% increased 220 basis points. And represents our highest quarterly adjusted operating margin since then. Leverage on incremental volumes, price realization and substantial productivity drove the operating income increase and margin expansion. During the quarter, all regions contributed sizable margin improvements. Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 30 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. 
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was a $1.21. Adjusting $0.02 for the prior year restructuring and acquisition charges as well as adjustments to provisions related to the enactment of tax reform, the Q3 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.23. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.24 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.03 increase as we have executed nearly $180 million in share buybacks so far this year. A decrease in the year-over-year tax rate improved earnings per share by $0.02. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest had a negative $0.03 impact, which was driven mostly by favorable other income in 2018. This results in adjusted third quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.47, an increase of $0.24 or nearly 20% compared to the prior year period.
Lastly, we had a $0.07 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, acquisitions and debt refinancing. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the third quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.40.
Please go to Slide #10. This quarter revenues for the Americas region were $567.8 million, up 7.1% on a reported basis and 7.2% organically. Organic growth was driven by strong volume along with continued price realization. When compared to Q3 of last year, we experienced high single-digit growth in both nonresidential and residential, as nonresidential market demand remained strong and residential rebounded nicely from the sluggishness we experienced in the first half of the year. Electronics growth for the quarter came in at 10%. As Dave mentioned earlier, we are pleased with this electronics performance given that the quarter was going up against a nearly 30% growth rate compared to last year. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $175.6 million increased 13.8% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by leverage on incremental volume, along with price and productivity significantly exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 50 basis point decrease on operating margins. 
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $137.8 million, up 2.5% and up 6.9% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by increased volume across most products, along with solid price realization. Total revenue growth continues to be reduced by significant currency headwinds.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $12 million increased 17.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased a 110 basis points, with price and leverage on incremental volume contributing to the increase. Timing of year-over-year investments benefited operating margins by 80 basis points as start-up costs incurred in 2018 related to our new Poland facility did not repeat this year.
Please go to Slide #12. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $42.7 million, down 9.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue decreased 4.8%. The organic revenue decline was driven by softer residential markets in Australia, along with an internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Foreign currency was again a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 4%.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $4.4 million, an increase of 37.5%, with adjusted operating margins improving 350 basis points versus the prior year period.The region saw strong productivity, the results of restructuring actions taken last year, and acquisition integration, which offset the 70 basis point headwind from incremental investments. Of note, 2019 Q3 operating income includes a $1.1 million favorable recovery of previously remitted nonincome tax, which had a 260 basis point favorable impact on Asia Pacific margins in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2019 was $230 million, which is an increase of $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is driven by increased net earnings, mostly offset by increased capital spending. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased in the third quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. 
I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

As you can see on the slide and was mentioned earlier, we are affirming our revenue outlook for the total company. The consolidated outlook for total and organic revenue remains at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%, although we're adjusting within the regions. In the Americas, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to remain solid for the near-term future. In residential, we saw Q3 rebound from the sluggishness we experienced during the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend. Therefore, we are slightly increasing the revenue outlooks for Americas.
For the EMEIA region, we expect continued currency pressures for the remainder of the year and have taken down our outlook for total revenue. However, organic revenue remains unchanged. In Asia Pacific, we expect the softness in the Australian markets to continue, particularly, around residential end markets. We also expect unfavorable currency impacts to continue. As such, we're lowering the outlook for both reported and organic growth in the region.
We are also updating the earnings per share outlook, raising the low end of both our reported and adjusted EPS ranges. Our reported EPS outlook is now at a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share with adjusted EPS at a range of $4.85 to $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 8% to 9%.
As Patrick stated, we're affirming our cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. The outlook updates the expected investment spend to a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is being updated to approximately 15.5%, with the favorability experienced in Q3 mostly offset in Q4. We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares for the full year to approximately 94.3 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed so far this year and including expected share repurchases for Q4.
Please go to Slide 15. As a brief summary of Allegion's Q3 performance, total revenue grew 5.2%, organic revenue grew 6.4%, adjusted operating margins were up 220 basis points, adjusted EPS was up nearly 20%. In Q3, we delivered our highest quarterly revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. 
Allegion has an operating system of operations that continues to strengthen the foundational elements of both safety and innovation. The system, combined with strong brands and channel relationships has been a hallmark of our performance in spend and certainly helped us deliver the third quarter results. Thank you to every member of the Allegion team, your commitment to excellence, strengthens our future. 
Now Patrick, and I will be happy to take your questions."

Our year-to-date organic growth of Americas is at 6% and our full year guide is kind of within that range. And so still expect a good Q4 going forward, and we'll finish the year strong relative to top line performance."

And so the comparisons were easier if you will and that gap was extremely favorable in the reported results in Q3 this year. We won't see that favorability as much reflected in Q4, and therefore, the margin profile expansion won't be as strong in Q3. However, I would say just given the anticipated continued strength in the overall markets, revenue growth, et cetera, we will have good operating margin improvement year-over-year with margins continuing to expand. And our full year expectation, again, is like an 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement full year. So still anticipate strong operational performance in Q4 to finish out the year."

I'd like to think that from when we first work with an architect to when we install, we can be the best provider through that stream. And it's -- anytime you've got an industry like ours that's got a mechanical heritage and we're introducing electronics and connectivity to high role, there's opportunity to differentiate ourselves.

Good Morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered great results in Q3. I'm extremely pleased with the revenue growth and operational performance which have positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 commitments.Top line r",809,"Thanks, Mike. Good Morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered great results in Q3. I'm extremely pleased with the revenue growth and operational performance which have positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 commitments.
Top line revenue growth was strong in the third quarter, particularly in the Americas and EMEIA regions. In the Americas, both nonresidential and residential businesses saw high single-digit growth. In EMEIA, we saw solid volume increases across most of the region.
The Americas delivered electronics growth of 10% in the quarter, which was a notable performance considering the challenging comparable from prior year where we grew nearly 30%. Strong market acceptance of our new highly rated Schlage Encode residential lock continues to be robust and helped drive the electronics performance in the quarter. We were the first major manufacturer to bring a smart WiFi Deadbolt to the market and it has a lot of momentum in the residential channel.
We believe our brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large install base provide us with a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow.
Moving down the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which significantly outpaced inflation. I'm proud of the performance as we saw substantial operating margin expansion up 220 basis points this quarter. In the third quarter, we delivered robust adjusted EPS growth at nearly 20% driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and tax rate impact. We are affirming the full year revenue outlook, in which we continue to project total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I'll speak to the individual region outlooks later in the presentation.
Last, we are tightening the outlook for a reported EPS going from a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share to a revised outlook of $4.55 to $4.65 per share. The adjusted EPS outlook is also being tightened by raising the low end of the range and going from $4.80 to $4.90 per share to a revised outlook of $4.85 to $4.90 per share. 
Please go to Slide 5. Revenue for the third quarter was $748.3 million, an increase of 5.2% inclusive of 6.4% organic growth. Currency headwinds offset some of the organic growth. The Americas and EMEIA region were responsible for the organic growth results. Patrick will share more detail on this. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 220 basis points, aided by substantial contribution from price and productivity outpacing inflation. Solid leverage on incremental volume also provided benefit to the margin expansion.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 increased by nearly 20% versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and a lower tax rate. Year-to-date, available cash flow is up slightly with the increased earnings we have experienced this year, being mostly offset by increased capital expenditures.
Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, which centers on our vision of seamless access. Since that time, momentum and market acceptance continues to build. For instance, smartphones and connectivity are the norm. This translates to pressure from our customers to meet end users demand for a mobile connected life while ensuring security. Allegion is well positioned to meet this demand. We see strong uptake with our seamless ID solutions for universities in edge devices and adoption of Schlage Encode in emerging -- and in emerging technologies and venturing opportunities. We're confident in the long-term electronic opportunity and see that seamless access and safety lay a solid foundation for our future.
As a reminder, our 5 strategic pillars that guide Allegion are expand in core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. 
Be the partner of choice. Delivering seamless access means, we're intent on leveraging partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others.
Delivering new value and access. Our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity. We're also intent on bringing new products to market faster.
Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. 
Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of the company's heritage for a 100 years, and seamless access will define our company going forward.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss the 2019 outlook."

Volumes recovered nicely from Q2 levels as market demand was strong. Also, during the third quarter, currency in EMEIA and Asia Pacific continued to be a headwind on total revenue growth. 
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the third quarter were $748.3 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 5.2% versus the prior year, up 6.4% on an organic basis.
Adjusted operating income of $173 million increased more than 16% over the same time frame last year. Adjusted operating margin of 23.1% increased 220 basis points. And represents our highest quarterly adjusted operating margin since then. Leverage on incremental volumes, price realization and substantial productivity drove the operating income increase and margin expansion. During the quarter, all regions contributed sizable margin improvements. Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 30 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. 
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was a $1.21. Adjusting $0.02 for the prior year restructuring and acquisition charges as well as adjustments to provisions related to the enactment of tax reform, the Q3 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.23. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.24 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.03 increase as we have executed nearly $180 million in share buybacks so far this year. A decrease in the year-over-year tax rate improved earnings per share by $0.02. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest had a negative $0.03 impact, which was driven mostly by favorable other income in 2018. This results in adjusted third quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.47, an increase of $0.24 or nearly 20% compared to the prior year period.
Lastly, we had a $0.07 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, acquisitions and debt refinancing. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the third quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.40.
Please go to Slide #10. This quarter revenues for the Americas region were $567.8 million, up 7.1% on a reported basis and 7.2% organically. Organic growth was driven by strong volume along with continued price realization. When compared to Q3 of last year, we experienced high single-digit growth in both nonresidential and residential, as nonresidential market demand remained strong and residential rebounded nicely from the sluggishness we experienced in the first half of the year. Electronics growth for the quarter came in at 10%. As Dave mentioned earlier, we are pleased with this electronics performance given that the quarter was going up against a nearly 30% growth rate compared to last year. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $175.6 million increased 13.8% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by leverage on incremental volume, along with price and productivity significantly exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 50 basis point decrease on operating margins. 
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $137.8 million, up 2.5% and up 6.9% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by increased volume across most products, along with solid price realization. Total revenue growth continues to be reduced by significant currency headwinds.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $12 million increased 17.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased a 110 basis points, with price and leverage on incremental volume contributing to the increase. Timing of year-over-year investments benefited operating margins by 80 basis points as start-up costs incurred in 2018 related to our new Poland facility did not repeat this year.
Please go to Slide #12. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $42.7 million, down 9.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue decreased 4.8%. The organic revenue decline was driven by softer residential markets in Australia, along with an internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Foreign currency was again a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 4%.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $4.4 million, an increase of 37.5%, with adjusted operating margins improving 350 basis points versus the prior year period. The region saw strong productivity, the results of restructuring actions taken last year, and acquisition integration, which offset the 70 basis point headwind from incremental investments. Of note, 2019 Q3 operating income includes a $1.1 million favorable recovery of previously remitted nonincome tax, which had a 260 basis point favorable impact on Asia Pacific margins in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2019 was $230 million, which is an increase of $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is driven by increased net earnings, mostly offset by increased capital spending. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased in the third quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. 
I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook."

As you can see on the slide and was mentioned earlier, we are affirming our revenue outlook for the total company. The consolidated outlook for total and organic revenue remains at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%, although we're adjusting within the regions. In the Americas, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to remain solid for the near-term future. In residential, we saw Q3 rebound from the sluggishness we experienced during the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend. Therefore, we are slightly increasing the revenue outlooks for Americas.
For the EMEIA region, we expect continued currency pressures for the remainder of the year and have taken down our outlook for total revenue. However, organic revenue remains unchanged. In Asia Pacific, we expect the softness in the Australian markets to continue, particularly, around residential end markets. We also expect unfavorable currency impacts to continue. As such, we're lowering the outlook for both reported and organic growth in the region.
We are also updating the earnings per share outlook, raising the low end of both our reported and adjusted EPS ranges. Our reported EPS outlook is now at a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share with adjusted EPS at a range of $4.85 to $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 8% to 9%.
As Patrick stated, we're affirming our cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. The outlook updates the expected investment spend to a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is being updated to approximately 15.5%, with the favorability experienced in Q3 mostly offset in Q4. We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares for the full year to approximately 94.3 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed so far this year and including expected share repurchases for Q4.
Please go to Slide 15. As a brief summary of Allegion's Q3 performance, total revenue grew 5.2%, organic revenue grew 6.4%, adjusted operating margins were up 220 basis points, adjusted EPS was up nearly 20%. In Q3, we delivered our highest quarterly revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. 
Allegion has an operating system of operations that continues to strengthen the foundational elements of both safety and innovation. The system, combined with strong brands and channel relationships has been a hallmark of our performance in spend and certainly helped us deliver the third quarter results. Thank you to every member of the Allegion team, your commitment to excellence, strengthens our future. 
Now Patrick, and I will be happy to take your questions."

And so the comparisons were easier if you will and that gap was extremely favorable in the reported results in Q3 this year. We won't see that favorability as much reflected in Q4, and therefore, the margin profile expansion won't be as strong in Q3. However, I would say just given the anticipated continued strength in the overall markets, revenue growth, et cetera, we will have good operating margin improvement year-over-year with margins continuing to expand. And our full year expectation, again, is like an 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement full year. So still anticipate strong operational performance in Q4 to finish out the year."

Working with people, the big integrators whether it's CBORD, whether it's Bosch, Siemens, we think we bring a unique approach to that. I think, second, is our heavy focus on customer satisfaction and quality through the value stream. I'd like to think that from when we first work with an architect to when we install, we can be the best provider through that stream. And it's -- anytime you've got an industry like ours that's got a mechanical heritage and we're introducing electronics and connectivity to high role, there's opportunity to differentiate ourselves. 
And I'm confident Brad talked about this, but it's really around customer satisfaction and partnering with tools like Overtur, making sure our connected devices install seamlessly on the customer campus or activity with the best products. This is our strategy."
