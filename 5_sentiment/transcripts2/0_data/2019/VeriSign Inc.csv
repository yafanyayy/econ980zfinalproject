36216,596879661,1650417,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2019",2019-02-07,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2010 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable",665,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2010 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 2018 was marked by a strong financial performance during which we generated revenues of $1,215,000,000, $661 million in free cash flow and 2018 full year non-GAAP operating margin of 67.5%.
2018 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as the company processed 38.2 million registrations and finished the year with 153 million names. During the year, we marked more than 21 years of uninterrupted availability of VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.
As we announced on November 1 last year, VeriSign and the Department of Commerce entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement. The amendment, among other things, permits VeriSign without further approval of the DOC to engage with ICANN to change the .com Registry Agreement, to increase wholesale prices for .com domain name registrations and renewals by up to 7% in each of the last 4 years of each 6-year period. Amendment 35 also clarifies that the vertical integration restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement on VeriSign's ability to own an ICANN accredited registrar apply only as of the .com TLD and not to other services offered by VeriSign. Additionally, Amendment 35 also removes certain unnecessary burdensome regulations, so that any future renewal of the .com Registry Agreement can occur without DOC approval unless VeriSign work to seek tediously in certain key provisions such as further changes to pricing. Any change in a Cooperative Agreement can only be made by mutual agreement of VeriSign and the DOC except that the DOC can terminate the Cooperative Agreement at any time with 120 days notice prior to the expiration of the term.
As another update, the company completed the sale of the VeriSign Security Services customer contracts on December 5, 2018. These contracts are related primarily to our DDoS and Managed DNS customers. As discussed last quarter, the sale of these noncore customer contracts will enable us to focus solely on supporting our core mission, ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure. Of course, the sale of these customer contracts will be a slight drag on revenue in 2019, but our continued organic revenue growth from our core domain name business is expected to offset this decrease.
At the end of December, the name domain name base in .com and .net totaled 153 million, consistent of 139 million names for .com and 14 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.5%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.29 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2019, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.25% and 4.25% for full year 2019. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.2 million shares of common stock for $175 million. During the full year 2018, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $600 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $603 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program which has no expiration.
Our financial position remains strong with $1.27 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the company generated revenue of $1,215,000,000, up 4.3% from 2017 and delivered GAAP operating income of $767 million, up 8.4% from $708 million in 2017. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $307 million, up 4% year-over-year and up by 5.5% sequentially. 
As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $194 million compared with $176 million in the fourth quarter 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.1% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $182 million compared to $103 million a year earlier which produced dilutive earnings per share of $1.50 in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $0.83 for the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, we recorded a $54.8 million pretax gain related to the sale of VeriSign Security Services customer contracts. This gain increased GAAP net income by $52 million and GAAP earnings per share by $0.43.
As of December 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liability of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $504 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million compared to $96 million last quarter and $106 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 66.7% compared to 68.7% last quarter and 64.1% in the same quarter of 2017.
During the fourth quarter, our sales and marketing expense increased sequentially as we had additional spend on programs in the market.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $191 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 121.3 million shares. This compares to $1.23 last quarter and $0.96 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The game related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts increased non-GAAP net income by $42.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.36 during the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $219 million, and free cash flow was $211 million compared with $199 million and $190 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year.
Now I'd like to provide our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,215,000,000 to $1,235,000,000. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 2.25% and 4.25% being partially offset by the loss of our revenue associated with the sale of our security service customer contracts.
Non-GAAP operating margin is between 67.5% to 68.5% and will continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consist primarily of net interest expense partially offset by payments collected as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $95 million and $115 million.
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate solid financial performance in 2018 during the fourth quarter and for the full year. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are we're allowed to increase prices for the .com. We have more flexibility on vertical integration for services that are not .com services and there is reduced regulatory burden for both VeriSign and the government. I think your question is in practice what will be different for us, VeriSign. So our contrast process before and after Amendment 35. But let me start with what will not change. Every 6 years, we engage with ICANN on a .com Registry Agreement renewal, for presumptive right of renewal. That is not changed and the next renewal of the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN will occur in November of 2024. Some parts of the agreement may be changed in that process through negotiation. However, I note that ICANN has not historically negotiated pricing with us referring to DOC on pricing and prior renewals. That process, that ICANN process is unchanged. Prior to -- to pick up there, prior to Amendment 35, the process that followed that renewal with ICANN was that we would present the .com Registry Agreement as negotiated by us, VeriSign and ICANN to DOC. DOC would then review it based on a two-pronged test of, 1, our performance and security and stability and 2, a review of letter we will provide register services on reasonable prices, terms and conditions. And a standard apply for these tests it was called the public interest standard. And the DOC's consent to the .com Registry Agreement renewal following this review was required, so they have to consent what we have done with ICANN. Amendment 35 founded in the public interest of the following: First 1, for us to raise .com registration and renewal process 7% in the back 4 years of each 6-year period; 2, that the restriction on vertical integration was only intended to apply the .com; 3, that the review process is now streamlined such that any NTIA review, any DOC review and consent is no longer required provided that .com registry agreement has not changed pricing from what's not now are allowed, specifically the 7% I noted a minute ago, and also that the performance suspects our SLAs in the .com registry agreement that we have to perform to have not been changed and also that we have not changed the vertical integration restriction on .com and that we have not changed the renewal or termination terms of the .com registry agreement; and 5, that there's been no changes to the WHOIS services. Given all of those then consent from the NTIA DOC today and will of .com Registry Agreement is not required if these terms are not change. So further in such a case and absent any VeriSign and DOC between agreed changes, the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew, again without reviewing consent as is for another 6-year term. So 1 can see that Cooperative Agreement now as Evergreen without further review by giving the terms see the same. NTIA is also have a right to terminate the Cooperative Agreement on 120 days notice before the end of the term. So there is 1 other change, which is that VeriSign agrees to ""continue to operate the .com registry in a content neutral manner"" which of course, we've always done. Say that's basically Amendment 35 and what will be different for us, although, of course, parts of the Cooperative Agreement, including earlier amendment have to be modified or deleted to make Amendment 35 work were also changed. But essentially, that's it. Long answer that but..."

There's a process for moving changes from the DOC to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com registry agreement. ICANN has historically, as I mentioned, referencing related to neocon pricing but ICANN and VeriSign had an agreement to cooperate integration of this agreement to operate, cooperate and negotiate with agreement in good faith to amend the .com registry as may be necessary for consistency with changes to the Cooperative Agreement. So we have begun that process with ICANN to amend the agreement, to make these changes, including pricing. I don't think I can comment further to the process. We've been through it a few times. It may take a number of months to work through it but we'll update you as appropriate."

First of all, the update that I can offer since we last spoke on the process towards a delegation of .web is that one of the losing bidders into .web auction from a company named Affiliates is one of our competitors has filed an arbitration against ICANN, trying to continue to delay the process. We are not parties to the at arbitration yet but we are actively seeking to join and participate in it. About your question about pricing and what we might do, 2 parts of that answer. Number one is yes, .web is not a regulated TLD like .com is or even like .net. It's a TLD that would be operating under the new form, the new so called new gTLD registry agreement and those agreements do not limit pricing similar to our IDNs, which are also signed up to the same form agreement. They only require 6-month notice for any price change but they provide complete pricing for activity. As to what we would do, how we would premium pricing, how we would price.web, how we are thinking about it, I think it's very premature at this stage we are to say anything. And it's just through that back to Sterling's second question, he asked about how we would use a vertical integration just to be complete. That ICANN process of incorporating all the Amendment 35 changes into the .com Registry Agreement, pricing, et cetera, also placed her these are the changes. The clarification of what vertical integration restriction actually exists, et cetera. So all that subject to completing this process with ICANN that I described earlier. And apologize, I'd like to tell you more about .web but it's just premature to talk about what we would do or how we're thinking about that at this point. But your assumptions about flexibility that .web would offer based on the agreement it would operate under are correct. It would not be restricted and we have flexibility to price premiums or whichever way we chose."

I am pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable",665,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 2018 was marked by strong financial performance during which we generated revenues of $1,215,000,000, $661 million in free cash flow and 2018 full year non-GAAP operating margin of 67.5%.
2018 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as the company processed 38.2 million registrations and finished the year with 153 million names. During the year, we marked more than 21 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.
As we announced on November 1 last year, VeriSign and the Department of Commerce entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement. The amendment, among other things, permits VeriSign without further approval of the DOC to engage with ICANN to change the .com Registry Agreement, to increase wholesale prices for .com domain name registrations and renewals by up to 7% in each of the last 4 years of each 6-year period. Amendment 35 also clarifies that the vertical integration restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement on VeriSign's ability to own an ICANN-accredited registrar apply only as to the .com TLD and not to other services offered by VeriSign. Additionally, Amendment 35 also removes certain unnecessary and burdensome regulations, so that any future renewal of the .com Registry Agreement can occur without DOC approval unless VeriSign were to seek changes to certain key provisions, such as further changes to pricing. Any change to the Cooperative Agreement can only be made by mutual agreement of VeriSign and the DOC, except that the DOC can terminate the Cooperative Agreement at any time with 120 days' notice prior to the expiration of the term.
As another update, the company completed the sale of the Verisign Security Services customer contracts on December 5, 2018. These contracts are related primarily to our DDoS and Managed DNS customers. As discussed last quarter, the sale of these noncore customer contracts will enable us to focus solely on supporting our core mission, ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure. Of course, the sale of these customer contracts will be a slight drag on revenue in 2019, but our continued organic revenue growth from our core domain name business is expected to offset this decrease.
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 153 million, consisting of 139 million names for .com and 14 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.5%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.29 million names. Although the renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2019, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.25% and 4.25% for full year 2019. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.2 million shares of common stock for $175 million. During the full year 2018, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $600 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $603 million, to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial position remains strong, with $1.27 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the company generated revenue of $1,215,000,000, up 4.3% from 2017 and delivered GAAP operating income of $767 million, up 8.4% from $708 million in 2017. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $307 million, up 4% year-over-year, and up by 5.5% sequentially. 
As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $194 million compared with $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.1% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $182 million compared to $103 million a year earlier, which produced dilutive earnings per share of $1.50 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.83 for the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, we recorded a $54.8 million pretax gain related to the sale of Verisign Security Services customer contracts. This gain increased GAAP net income by $52 million and GAAP earnings per share by $0.43.
As of December 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $504 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million compared to $96 million last quarter and $106 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 66.7% compared to 68.7% last quarter and 64.1% in the same quarter of 2017.
During the fourth quarter, our sales and marketing expense increased sequentially as we had additional spend on programs in the market.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $191 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 121.3 million shares. This compares to $1.23 last quarter and $0.96 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts increased non-GAAP net income by $42.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.36 during the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $219 million, and free cash flow was $211 million compared with $199 million and $190 million respectively for the fourth quarter last year.
Now I'd like to provide our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,215,000,000 to $1,235,000,000. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 2.25% and 4.25%, being partially offset by the loss of our revenue associated with the sale of our Security Service customer contracts.
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5% and will continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for Security Service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consist primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by payments collected as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $95 million and $115 million.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate solid financial performance in 2018 during the fourth quarter and for the full year. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are that we're allowed to increase prices for .com.

I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are that we're allowed to increase prices for .com. We have more flexibility on vertical integration for services that are not .com services, and there is reduced regulatory burden for both VeriSign and the government. I think your question is, in practice, what will be different for us, VeriSign. So I'll contrast a process before and after Amendment 35. But let me just -- let me start with what will not change. Every 6 years, we engage with ICANN on a .com Registry Agreement renewal, for which there's a presumptive right of renewal. That is not changed, and the next renewal of the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN will occur in November of 2024. Some parts of the agreement may be changed in that process through a negotiation. However, I'd note that ICANN has not historically negotiated pricing with us, deferring to DOC on pricing in prior renewals. That process, that ICANN process is unchanged. Prior to -- to pick up there, prior to Amendment 35, the process that followed that renewal with ICANN was that we would present the .com Registry Agreement as negotiated by us, VeriSign and ICANN, to the DOC. DOC would then review it based on a 2-pronged test of, one, our performance on security and stability, and two, a review of whether we were ""providing registry services on reasonable prices, terms and conditions."" And a standard applied for these tests was called the public interest standard, and then DOC's consent to the com Registry Agreement renewal following this review was required. So they have to consent to what we had done with ICANN. Amendment 35 founded in the public interest to allow the following: first, one, for us to raise .com registration and renewal prices 7% in the back 4 years of each 6-year period; two, that the restriction on vertical integration was only intended to apply the .com; three, that the review process is now streamlined such that any NTIA review, any DOC review and consent is no longer required provided that the com Registry Agreement has not changed pricing from what's now allowed, specifically the 7% noted -- I noted a minute ago, also that the performance specs or SLAs in the com Registry Agreement that we have to perform to have not been changed and also that we have not changed the vertical integration restriction on com and that we have not changed the renewal or termination terms of the com Registry Agreement; and five, that there's been no changes to the Whois services. Given all of those, then consent from the NTIA or DOC, to the renewal of the com Registry Agreement, is not required if these terms are not changed. So further in such a case and absent any VeriSign and DOC mutually agreed changes, the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew, again without reviewing consent as is for another 6-year term. So one could see the Cooperative Agreement now as evergreen without further review, given the terms stay the same. NTIA has also a right to terminate the Cooperative Agreement on 120 days' notice before the end of the term. So there is one other change, which is that VeriSign agrees to ""continue to operate the .com registry in a content-neutral manner,"" which, of course, we've always done. So that's basically Amendment 35 and what will be different for us, although, of course, parts of the Cooperative Agreement, including earlier amendments that had to be modified or deleted to make Amendment 35 work were also changed. But essentially, that's it. Long answer, sorry about that, but..."

The first one is, so the Cooperative Agreement has changed, but I haven't seen any news. Do you have to go back and actually refresh or change the .com Registry Agreement to now incorporate the same pricing parameters that's there in Item 35? Or is that kind of already de facto happened because of what you did with Item 35?"

There's a process for moving changes from the DOC to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com Registry Agreement. ICANN has historically, as I mentioned, deferred to the U.S. government on matters relating to com pricing. But ICANN and VeriSign have an agreement to cooperate and negotiate -- there's a written agreement to operate -- cooperate and negotiate in good faith to amend the com registry as may be necessary for consistency with changes to the Cooperative Agreement. So we have begun that process with ICANN to amend the agreement, to make these changes, including pricing. And I don't think I can comment further to process. We've been through it a few times. It may take a number of months to work through it, but we'll update you as appropriate."

Number one is, yes, .web is not a regulated TLD like .com is or even like .net is. It's a TLD that would be operating under the new form, the new so-called new gTLD Registry Agreement. And those agreements do not limit pricing, similar to our IDNs, which are also signed up to the same form of agreement. They only require 6-month notice for any price change, but they provide complete pricing flexibility. As to what we would do, how we would do premium pricing, how we would price .web, how we're thinking about it, I think it's very premature at this stage really to say anything. And just a comment or 2, that back to Sterling's second question, he asked about how we would use vertical integration just to be complete. That ICANN process of incorporating all the Amendment 35 changes into the .com Registry Agreement, pricing, et cetera, also applies to these other changes, the clarification of what vertical integration restriction actually exists, et cetera. So all that is subject to completing this process with ICANN that I described earlier. And I apologize, I'd like to tell you more about .web, but it's just premature to talk about what we would do or how we're thinking about that at this point. But your assumptions about the flexibility that .web would offer based on the agreement it would operate under are correct. It would not be restricted, and we'd have flexibility to price premiums or whichever way we chose."

I am pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable",665,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 2018 was marked by strong financial performance during which we generated revenues of $1,215,000,000, $661 million in free cash flow and 2018 full year non-GAAP operating margin of 67.5%.
2018 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as the company processed 38.2 million registrations and finished the year with 153 million names. During the year, we marked more than 21 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.
As we announced on November 1 last year, VeriSign and the Department of Commerce entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement. The amendment, among other things, permits VeriSign without further approval of the DOC to engage with ICANN to change the .com Registry Agreement, to increase wholesale prices for .com domain name registrations and renewals by up to 7% in each of the last 4 years of each 6-year period. Amendment 35 also clarifies that the vertical integration restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement on VeriSign's ability to own an ICANN-accredited registrar apply only as to the .com TLD and not to other services offered by VeriSign. Additionally, Amendment 35 also removes certain unnecessary and burdensome regulations, so that any future renewal of the .com Registry Agreement can occur without DOC approval unless VeriSign were to seek changes to certain key provisions, such as further changes to pricing. Any change to the Cooperative Agreement can only be made by mutual agreement of VeriSign and the DOC, except that the DOC can terminate the Cooperative Agreement at any time with 120 days' notice prior to the expiration of the term.
As another update, the company completed the sale of the Verisign Security Services customer contracts on December 5, 2018. These contracts are related primarily to our DDoS and Managed DNS customers. As discussed last quarter, the sale of these noncore customer contracts will enable us to focus solely on supporting our core mission, ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure. Of course, the sale of these customer contracts will be a slight drag on revenue in 2019, but our continued organic revenue growth from our core domain name business is expected to offset this decrease.
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 153 million, consisting of 139 million names for .com and 14 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.5%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.29 million names. Although the renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2019, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.25% and 4.25% for full year 2019. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.2 million shares of common stock for $175 million. During the full year 2018, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $600 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $603 million, to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial position remains strong, with $1.27 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $307 million, up 4% year-over-year, and up by 5.5% sequentially. 
As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $194 million compared with $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.1% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $182 million compared to $103 million a year earlier, which produced dilutive earnings per share of $1.50 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.83 for the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, we recorded a $54.8 million pretax gain related to the sale of Verisign Security Services customer contracts. This gain increased GAAP net income by $52 million and GAAP earnings per share by $0.43.
As of December 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $504 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million compared to $96 million last quarter and $106 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 66.7% compared to 68.7% last quarter and 64.1% in the same quarter of 2017.
During the fourth quarter, our sales and marketing expense increased sequentially as we had additional spend on programs in the market.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $191 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 121.3 million shares. This compares to $1.23 last quarter and $0.96 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts increased non-GAAP net income by $42.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.36 during the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $219 million, and free cash flow was $211 million compared with $199 million and $190 million respectively for the fourth quarter last year.
Now I'd like to provide our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,215,000,000 to $1,235,000,000. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 2.25% and 4.25%, being partially offset by the loss of our revenue associated with the sale of our Security Service customer contracts.
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5% and will continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for Security Service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consist primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by payments collected as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $95 million and $115 million.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate solid financial performance in 2018 during the fourth quarter and for the full year. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are that we're allowed to increase prices for .com. We have more flexibility on vertical integration for services that are not .com services, and there is reduced",613,"Sure, Sterling. I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are that we're allowed to increase prices for .com. We have more flexibility on vertical integration for services that are not .com services, and there is reduced regulatory burden for both VeriSign and the government. I think your question is, in practice, what will be different for us, VeriSign. So I'll contrast a process before and after Amendment 35. But let me just -- let me start with what will not change. Every 6 years, we engage with ICANN on a .com Registry Agreement renewal, for which there's a presumptive right of renewal. That is not changed, and the next renewal of the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN will occur in November of 2024. Some parts of the agreement may be changed in that process through a negotiation. However, I'd note that ICANN has not historically negotiated pricing with us, deferring to DOC on pricing in prior renewals. That process, that ICANN process is unchanged. Prior to -- to pick up there, prior to Amendment 35, the process that followed that renewal with ICANN was that we would present the .com Registry Agreement as negotiated by us, VeriSign and ICANN, to the DOC. DOC would then review it based on a 2-pronged test of, one, our performance on security and stability, and two, a review of whether we were ""providing registry services on reasonable prices, terms and conditions."" And a standard applied for these tests was called the public interest standard, and then DOC's consent to the com Registry Agreement renewal following this review was required. So they have to consent to what we had done with ICANN. Amendment 35 founded in the public interest to allow the following: first, one, for us to raise .com registration and renewal prices 7% in the back 4 years of each 6-year period; two, that the restriction on vertical integration was only intended to apply the .com; three, that the review process is now streamlined such that any NTIA review, any DOC review and consent is no longer required provided that the com Registry Agreement has not changed pricing from what's now allowed, specifically the 7% noted -- I noted a minute ago, also that the performance specs or SLAs in the com Registry Agreement that we have to perform to have not been changed and also that we have not changed the vertical integration restriction on com and that we have not changed the renewal or termination terms of the com Registry Agreement; and five, that there's been no changes to the Whois services. Given all of those, then consent from the NTIA or DOC, to the renewal of the com Registry Agreement, is not required if these terms are not changed. So further in such a case and absent any VeriSign and DOC mutually agreed changes, the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew, again without reviewing consent as is for another 6-year term. So one could see the Cooperative Agreement now as evergreen without further review, given the terms stay the same. NTIA has also a right to terminate the Cooperative Agreement on 120 days' notice before the end of the term. So there is one other change, which is that VeriSign agrees to ""continue to operate the .com registry in a content-neutral manner,"" which, of course, we've always done. So that's basically Amendment 35 and what will be different for us, although, of course, parts of the Cooperative Agreement, including earlier amendments that had to be modified or deleted to make Amendment 35 work were also changed.

There's a process for moving changes from the DOC to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com Registry Agreement. ICANN has historically, as I mentioned, deferred to the U.S. government on matters relating to com pricing. But ICANN and VeriSign have an agreement to cooperate and negotiate -- there's a written agreement to operate -- cooperate and negotiate in good faith to amend the com registry as may be necessary for consistency with changes to the Cooperative Agreement. So we have begun that process with ICANN to amend the agreement, to make these changes, including pricing. And I don't think I can comment further. It's a process. We've been through it a few times. It may take a number of months to work through it, but we'll update you as appropriate."

So first of all, the update that I can offer since we last spoke on the process towards delegation of .web is that one of the losing bidders in the .web auction, a company named Afilias, who is one of our competitors, has filed an arbitration against ICANN, trying to continue to delay the process. We are not parties to that arbitration yet, but we are actively seeking to join and participate in it. About your question about pricing and what we might do, 2 parts to that answer. Number one is, yes, .web is not a regulated TLD like .com is or even like .net is. It's a TLD that would be operating under the new form, the new so-called new gTLD Registry Agreement. And those agreements do not limit pricing, similar to our IDNs, which are also signed up to the same form of agreement. They only require 6-month notice for any price change, but they provide complete pricing flexibility. As to what we would do, how we would do premium pricing, how we would price .web, how we're thinking about it, I think it's very premature at this stage really to say anything. And just occurs to me too, that back to Sterling's second question, he asked about how we would use vertical integration just to be complete. That ICANN process of incorporating all the Amendment 35 changes into the .com Registry Agreement, pricing, et cetera, also applies to these other changes, the clarification of what vertical integration restriction actually exists, et cetera. So all that is subject to completing this process with ICANN that I described earlier. And I apologize, I'd like to tell you more about .web, but it's just premature to talk about what we would do or how we're thinking about that at this point. But your assumptions about the flexibility that .web would offer based on the agreement it would operate under are correct. It would not be restricted, and we'd have flexibility to price premiums or whichever way we chose."

Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable",665,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 2018 was marked by strong financial performance during which we generated revenues of $1,215,000,000, $661 million in free cash flow and 2018 full year non-GAAP operating margin of 67.5%.
2018 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as the company processed 38.2 million registrations and finished the year with 153 million names. During the year, we marked more than 21 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.
As we announced on November 1 last year, VeriSign and the Department of Commerce entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement. The amendment, among other things, permits VeriSign without further approval of the DOC to engage with ICANN to change the .com Registry Agreement, to increase wholesale prices for .com domain name registrations and renewals by up to 7% in each of the last 4 years of each 6-year period. Amendment 35 also clarifies that the vertical integration restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement on VeriSign's ability to own an ICANN-accredited registrar apply only as to the .com TLD and not to other services offered by VeriSign. Additionally, Amendment 35 also removes certain unnecessary and burdensome regulations, so that any future renewal of the .com Registry Agreement can occur without DOC approval unless VeriSign were to seek changes to certain key provisions, such as further changes to pricing. Any change to the Cooperative Agreement can only be made by mutual agreement of VeriSign and the DOC, except that the DOC can terminate the Cooperative Agreement at any time with 120 days' notice prior to the expiration of the term.
As another update, the company completed the sale of the Verisign Security Services customer contracts on December 5, 2018. These contracts are related primarily to our DDoS and Managed DNS customers. As discussed last quarter, the sale of these noncore customer contracts will enable us to focus solely on supporting our core mission, ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure. Of course, the sale of these customer contracts will be a slight drag on revenue in 2019, but our continued organic revenue growth from our core domain name business is expected to offset this decrease.
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 153 million, consisting of 139 million names for .com and 14 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.5%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.29 million names. Although the renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2019, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.25% and 4.25% for full year 2019. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.2 million shares of common stock for $175 million. During the full year 2018, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $600 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $603 million, to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial position remains strong, with $1.27 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $307 million, up 4% year-over-year, and up by 5.5% sequentially. 
As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $194 million compared with $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.1% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $182 million compared to $103 million a year earlier, which produced dilutive earnings per share of $1.50 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.83 for the same quarter last year.
In the quarter, we recorded a $54.8 million pretax gain related to the sale of Verisign Security Services customer contracts. This gain increased GAAP net income by $52 million and GAAP earnings per share by $0.43.
As of December 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $504 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million compared to $96 million last quarter and $106 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 66.7% compared to 68.7% last quarter and 64.1% in the same quarter of 2017.
During the fourth quarter, our sales and marketing expense increased sequentially as we had additional spend on programs in the market.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $191 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 121.3 million shares. This compares to $1.23 last quarter and $0.96 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts increased non-GAAP net income by $42.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.36 during the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $219 million, and free cash flow was $211 million compared with $199 million and $190 million respectively for the fourth quarter last year.
Now I'd like to provide our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,215,000,000 to $1,235,000,000. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 2.25% and 4.25%, being partially offset by the loss of our revenue associated with the sale of our Security Service customer contracts.
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5% and will continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for Security Service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consist primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by payments collected as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $95 million and $115 million.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate solid financial performance in 2018 during the fourth quarter and for the full year. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are that we're allowed to increase prices for .com.

I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are that we're allowed to increase prices for .com. We have more flexibility on vertical integration for services that are not .com services, and there is reduced regulatory burden for both VeriSign and the government. I think your question is, in practice, what will be different for us, VeriSign. So I'll contrast a process before and after Amendment 35. But let me just -- let me start with what will not change. Every 6 years, we engage with ICANN on a .com Registry Agreement renewal, for which there's a presumptive right of renewal. That is not changed, and the next renewal of the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN will occur in November of 2024. Some parts of the agreement may be changed in that process through a negotiation. However, I'd note that ICANN has not historically negotiated pricing with us, deferring to DOC on pricing in prior renewals. That process, that ICANN process is unchanged. Prior to -- to pick up there, prior to Amendment 35, the process that followed that renewal with ICANN was that we would present the .com Registry Agreement as negotiated by us, VeriSign and ICANN, to the DOC. DOC would then review it based on a 2-pronged test of, one, our performance on security and stability, and two, a review of whether we were ""providing registry services on reasonable prices, terms and conditions."" And a standard applied for these tests was called the public interest standard, and then DOC's consent to the com Registry Agreement renewal following this review was required. So they have to consent to what we had done with ICANN. Amendment 35 founded in the public interest to allow the following: first, one, for us to raise .com registration and renewal prices 7% in the back 4 years of each 6-year period; two, that the restriction on vertical integration was only intended to apply the .com; three, that the review process is now streamlined such that any NTIA review, any DOC review and consent is no longer required provided that the com Registry Agreement has not changed pricing from what's now allowed, specifically the 7% noted -- I noted a minute ago, also that the performance specs or SLAs in the com Registry Agreement that we have to perform to have not been changed and also that we have not changed the vertical integration restriction on com and that we have not changed the renewal or termination terms of the com Registry Agreement; and five, that there's been no changes to the Whois services. Given all of those, then consent from the NTIA or DOC, to the renewal of the com Registry Agreement, is not required if these terms are not changed. So further in such a case and absent any VeriSign and DOC mutually agreed changes, the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew, again without reviewing consent as is for another 6-year term. So one could see the Cooperative Agreement now as evergreen without further review, given the terms stay the same. NTIA has also a right to terminate the Cooperative Agreement on 120 days' notice before the end of the term. So there is one other change, which is that VeriSign agrees to ""continue to operate the .com registry in a content-neutral manner,"" which, of course, we've always done. So that's basically Amendment 35 and what will be different for us, although, of course, parts of the Cooperative Agreement, including earlier amendments that had to be modified or deleted to make Amendment 35 work were also changed. But essentially, that's it. Long answer, sorry about that, but..."

The first one is, so the Cooperative Agreement has changed, but I haven't seen any news. Do you have to go back and actually refresh or change the .com Registry Agreement to now incorporate the same pricing parameters that's there in Item 35? Or is that kind of already de facto happened because of what you did with Item 35?"

There's a process for moving changes from the DOC to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com Registry Agreement. ICANN has historically, as I mentioned, deferred to the U.S. government on matters relating to com pricing. But ICANN and VeriSign have an agreement to cooperate and negotiate -- there's a written agreement to operate -- cooperate and negotiate in good faith to amend the com registry as may be necessary for consistency with changes to the Cooperative Agreement. So we have begun that process with ICANN to amend the agreement, to make these changes, including pricing. And I don't think I can comment further. It's a process. We've been through it a few times. It may take a number of months to work through it, but we'll update you as appropriate."

But that clarification is now made and the vertical integration restriction only applies to .com. And you're right, we did have both when we acquired Network Solutions in June of 2000. And then I think it was in 2003 or early 2004, we sold off the registrar. But I think at that time, the agreement read that VeriSign couldn't be vertically integrated.

So first of all, the update that I can offer since we last spoke on the process towards delegation of .web is that one of the losing bidders in the .web auction, a company named Afilias, who is one of our competitors, has filed an arbitration against ICANN, trying to continue to delay the process. We are not parties to that arbitration yet, but we are actively seeking to join and participate in it. About your question about pricing and what we might do, 2 parts to that answer. Number one is, yes, .web is not a regulated TLD like .com is or even like .net is. It's a TLD that would be operating under the new form, the new so-called new gTLD Registry Agreement. And those agreements do not limit pricing, similar to our IDNs, which are also signed up to the same form of agreement. They only require 6-month notice for any price change, but they provide complete pricing flexibility. As to what we would do, how we would do premium pricing, how we would price .web, how we're thinking about it, I think it's very premature at this stage really to say anything. And just occurs to me too, that back to Sterling's second question, he asked about how we would use vertical integration just to be complete. That ICANN process of incorporating all the Amendment 35 changes into the .com Registry Agreement, pricing, et cetera, also applies to these other changes, the clarification of what vertical integration restriction actually exists, et cetera. So all that is subject to completing this process with ICANN that I described earlier. And I apologize, I'd like to tell you more about .web, but it's just premature to talk about what we would do or how we're thinking about that at this point. But your assumptions about the flexibility that .web would offer based on the agreement it would operate under are correct. It would not be restricted, and we'd have flexibility to price premiums or whichever way we chose."

At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 154.8 million, consisting of 141 million names for .com and 13.8 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.4%. During the first quarter, we processed 9.8 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.82 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2019 will be approximately 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.3% achieved in the first quarter of 2018.
For 2019, full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.5% and 4.25%. Last quarter, we said that we'll begin the process with ICANN to incorporate features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms. Into the .com Registry Agreement. There are no updates to share at this time, but we continue to be engaged in this process that may take some number of months to complete. Just to remind those not familiar with this process, under the 2016 amendment that extended term of the .com Registry Agreement, we also agreed to negotiate in good faith the flow-through changes made in the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and to preserve and enhance the security and stability of .com or the Internet. We are negotiating these items now and we'll update you as appropriate.
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 point million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.25 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
And I would like to turn the call over to George."

First quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 2.4% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $106 million compared to $114 million last quarter and $113 million in the first quarter a year ago.",663,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 2.4% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $106 million compared to $114 million last quarter and $113 million in the first quarter a year ago. -- In the quarter were lower sequentially primarily due to the elimination of approximately $3 million of costs associated with our Security Services sale last quarter and the seasonal timing of marketing program spread.
Operating income totaled $200 million compared with $185 million in the first quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.4% compared to 62% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $163 million compared to $134 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.35 in the quarter this year compared to $1.09 for the same quarter last year.
As of March 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.25 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $685 million were domestically with the remainder held abroad.
During the quarter, we repatriated $249 million from our international entities net of withholding taxes.
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which includes non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $94 million compared to $102 million last quarter and $101 million in the first quarter a year ago.
Operating margin for the first quarter was 69.4% compared to 66.7% last quarter and 66.3% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $158 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 120.3 million shares. This compares to $1.58 last quarter and $1.07 in the first quarter of 2018. Last quarter's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included a $0.36 benefit due to the gain related to the state of our Security Services customer contracts.
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $187 million, and free cash flow was $178 million compared to with $90 million and $82 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. Last year's first quarter 2018 cash flow included higher cash taxes related to international withholding taxes associated with last year's repatriation activities as well as higher cash interests related to our convertible debentures before they were retired.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.220 billion to $1.235 billion now from the $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call.
Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 2.5% and 4.25% being partially offset by the loss of revenue associated with the sale of our Security Services customer contracts.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5%, and we'll continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for these security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are expected to be between $45 million to $55 million, and cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $105 million, lowered from the $95 million to $115 million range provided on our last call. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate solid financial performance during the first quarter of 2019.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 154.8 million, consisting of 141 million names for .com and 13.8 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.4%.

Operating expense totaled $106 million compared to $114 million last quarter and $113 million in the first quarter a year ago",668,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. 
First quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 2.4% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $106 million compared to $114 million last quarter and $113 million in the first quarter a year ago. [ Expenses ] in the quarter were lower sequentially primarily due to the elimination of approximately $3 million of costs associated with our Security Services sale last quarter and the seasonal timing of marketing program spend.
Operating income totaled $200 million compared with $185 million in the first quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.4% compared to 62% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $163 million compared to $134 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.35 in the quarter this year compared to $1.09 for the same quarter last year.
As of March 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.25 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $685 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. During the quarter, we repatriated $249 million from our international entities net of withholding taxes.
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $94 million compared to $102 million last quarter and $101 million in the first quarter a year ago.
Operating margin for the first quarter was 69.4% compared to 66.7% last quarter and 66.3% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $158 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 120.3 million shares. This compares to $1.58 last quarter and $1.07 in the first quarter of 2018. Last quarter's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included a $0.36 benefit due to the gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts.
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $187 million, and free cash flow was $178 million compared to -- with $90 million and $82 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. Last year's first quarter 2018 cash flow included higher cash taxes related to international withholding taxes associated with last year's repatriation activities as well as higher cash interest related to our convertible debentures before they were retired.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.220 billion to $1.235 billion now from the $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call.  Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 2.5% and 4.25% being partially offset by the loss of revenue associated with the sale of our Security Services customer contracts.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5%, and we'll continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for the security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million to $55 million, and cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $105 million, lowered from the $95 million to $115 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2019.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Good afternoon, everyone. 
I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 154.8 million, consisting of 141 million names for .com and 13.8 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.4%. During the first quarter, we processed 9.8 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.82 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2019 will be approximately 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.3% achieved in the first quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.5% and 4.25%. 
Last quarter, we said that we began the process with ICANN to incorporate features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms, into the .com Registry Agreement. There are no updates to share at this time, but we continue to be engaged in this process that may take some number of months to complete. Just to remind those not familiar with this process, under the 2016 amendment that extended the term of the .com Registry Agreement, we also agreed to negotiate in good faith the flow-through changes made in the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and to preserve and enhance the security and stability of .com or the Internet. We are negotiating these items now, and we'll update you as appropriate.
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.0 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.25 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.

I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $94 million compared to $102 million last quarter and $101 million in the first quarter a year ago.
Operating margin for the first quarter was 69.4% compared to 66.7% last quarter and 66.3% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $158 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 120.3 million shares. This compares to $1.58 last quarter and $1.07 in the first quarter of 2018. Last quarter's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included a $0.36 benefit due to the gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts.
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $187 million, and free cash flow was $178 million compared to -- with $90 million and $82 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. Last year's first quarter 2018 cash flow included higher cash taxes related to international withholding taxes associated with last year's repatriation activities as well as higher cash interest related to our convertible debentures before they were retired.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.220 billion to $1.235 billion now from the $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call.  Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 2.5% and 4.25% being partially offset by the loss of revenue associated with the sale of our Security Services customer contracts.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5%, and we'll continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for the security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million to $55 million, and cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $105 million, lowered from the $95 million to $115 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2019.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Good afternoon, everyone. 
I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 154.8 million, consisting of 141 million names for .com and 13.8 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.4%. During the first quarter, we processed 9.8 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.82 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2019 will be approximately 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.3% achieved in the first quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.5% and 4.25%. 
Last quarter, we said that we began the process with ICANN to incorporate features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms, into the .com Registry Agreement. There are no updates to share at this time, but we continue to be engaged in this process that may take some number of months to complete. Just to remind those not familiar with this process, under the 2016 amendment that extended the term of the .com Registry Agreement, we also agreed to negotiate in good faith the flow-through changes made in the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and to preserve and enhance the security and stability of .com or the Internet. We are negotiating these items now, and we'll update you as appropriate.
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.0 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.25 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.

First quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 2.4% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $106 million compared to $114 million last quarter and $113 million in the first quarter a year ago. [ Expenses ] in the quarter were lower sequentially primarily due to the elimination of approximately $3 million of costs associated with our Security Services sale last quarter and the seasonal timing of marketing program spend.
Operating income totaled $200 million compared with $185 million in the first quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.4% compared to 62% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $163 million compared to $134 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.35 in the quarter this year compared to $1.09 for the same quarter last year.
As of March 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.25 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $685 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. During the quarter, we repatriated $249 million from our international entities net of withholding taxes.
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $94 million compared to $102 million last quarter and $101 million in the first quarter a year ago.
Operating margin for the first quarter was 69.4% compared to 66.7% last quarter and 66.3% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $158 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 120.3 million shares. This compares to $1.58 last quarter and $1.07 in the first quarter of 2018. Last quarter's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included a $0.36 benefit due to the gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts.
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $187 million, and free cash flow was $178 million compared to -- with $90 million and $82 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. Last year's first quarter 2018 cash flow included higher cash taxes related to international withholding taxes associated with last year's repatriation activities as well as higher cash interest related to our convertible debentures before they were retired.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.220 billion to $1.235 billion now from the $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 2.5% and 4.25% being partially offset by the loss of revenue associated with the sale of our Security Services customer contracts.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5%, and we'll continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for the security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million to $55 million, and cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $105 million, lowered from the $95 million to $115 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2019.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 156.1 million, consisting of 142.5 million names for .com and 13.6 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.3%. During the second quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.34 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2019 will be approximately 74%. This preliminary rate compares to 75% achieved in the second quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3% and 4.25%, narrowed from our previous range of 2.5% to 4.25%.
As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into the .com Registry Agreement. For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 amendment to the .com registry agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the .com registry, we -- agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to flow through any changes that will be made to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and in addition, to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry over the Internet. These discussions with ICANN are ongoing and at this time, there are no further details to share. Of course, when appropriate, we will update you.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 0.9 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.22 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Second quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $105 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $109 million in the second quarter a year ago",613,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $105 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $109 million in the second quarter a year ago. Operating income totaled $202 million compared with $193 million in the second quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.9% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $128 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.24 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.04 for the same quarter last year.
As of June 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $582 million are held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter non-GAAP expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $91 million compared to $94 million last quarter and $96 million in the second quarter a year ago. The slight year-over-year decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of lower expenses as a result of the sale of our security services business as well as the timing of spend related to the periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 70.1% compared to 69.4% last quarter and 68.2% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $159 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.33 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 119.4 million shares. This compares to $1.31 last quarter and $1.18 in the second quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $165 million, and free cash flow was $154 million compared with $202 million and $191 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decline was a result of the timing of cash tax payments, which were predominantly made in Q1 last year versus occurring in the second quarter this year.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.235 billion, narrowed from the $1.220 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 3% and 4.25%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%, increased from the 67.5% to 68.5% range provided on our last call and will continue to include certain immaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services or security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $100 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $105 million range provided previously.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2019.

Lastly, the company marked 22 years of 100% availability in the .com and .net domain name system. This achievement is a result of the dedication of expertise of our team and our specialized infrastructure. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 156.1 million, consisting of 142.5 million names for .com and 13.6 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.3%. During the second quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.34 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2019 will be approximately 74%. This preliminary rate compares to 75% achieved in the second quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3% and 4.25%, narrowed from our previous range of 2.5% to 4.25%.
As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into the .com registry agreement. 
For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 amendment to the .com registry agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the .com registry, we -- agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to flow through any changes that would be made to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and, in addition, to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry over the Internet. These discussions with ICANN are ongoing, and, at this time, there are no further details to share. Of course, when appropriate, we will update you.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 0.9 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.22 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Second quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $105 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $109 million in the second quarter a year ago",609,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $105 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $109 million in the second quarter a year ago. Operating income totaled $202 million compared with $193 million in the second quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.9% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $128 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.24 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.04 for the same quarter last year.
As of June 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $582 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $91 million compared to $94 million last quarter and $96 million in the second quarter a year ago. The slight year-over-year decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of lower expenses as a result of the sale of our security services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 70.1% compared to 69.4% last quarter and 68.2% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $159 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.33 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 119.4 million shares. This compares to $1.31 last quarter and $1.18 in the second quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $165 million, and free cash flow was $154 million compared with $202 million and $191 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decline was a result of the timing of cash tax payments, which were predominantly made in Q1 last year versus occurring in the second quarter this year.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,225,000,000 to $1,235,000,000, narrowed from the $1,220,000,000 to $1.235,000,000 range provided on our last call. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 3% and 4.25%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%, increased from the 67.5% to 68.5% range provided on our last call and will continue to include certain immaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $100 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $105 million range provided previously.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2019. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

We continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
Lastly, the company marked 22 years of 100% availability in the .com and .net domain name system. This achievement is a result of the dedication and expertise of our team and our specialized infrastructure.

So as far as our renewal rates, our -- as you know, our preliminary renewal rate is estimated at 74%, which is down about 1% year-over-year. I'd say one of the prime contributors is a slightly lower first-time renewal rate, which is being driven by a higher proportion of names coming up for renewal from our Chinese registrars. As we talked before historically, China, like other emerging domain name markets, have lower renewal rates more than, say, mature markets like the U.S. and Europe. And so accordingly, what we're seeing is that the first-time renewal rate is being impacted by this weighted average effect of more Chinese names coming up for renewal."

And the 2 big causes there of being down year-over-year, one is about $2.5 million of costs associated with VSS. We, again, sold that business last year. And then the remaining $2 million of that variance is really related to the timing of investments in telco and networking in our network. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. As we go forward here, we -- and as we say in our Q that's filed this afternoon, we expect that we will have slight increases as a percent of revenue for both sales and marketing, for cost of goods sold and for G&A as well.

Well, these new agreements that ICANN negotiated are more likely the generic TLD program agreements, in that they no longer have price caps, but they do have to practice uniform pricing and provide customary advance notices of any changes to pricing. So implementing that pricing features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement for us simply restores the pricing flexibility that formerly existed for .com domains from 2006 to 2012, the ability to unilaterally increase prices by up to 7% 4x during the 6-year term of the registry agreement. So the ICANN registry agreements for .org and .biz, by the way, were renewed late June, and they completely listed their price caps. So we can't speculate if a similar approach will be used for the next renewal of .net..

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 156.1 million, consisting of 142.5 million names for .com and 13.6 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.3%. During the second quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.34 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2019 will be approximately 74%. This preliminary rate compares to 75% achieved in the second quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3% and 4.25%, narrowed from our previous range of 2.5% to 4.25%.
As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into the .com registry agreement. 
For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 amendment to the .com registry agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the .com registry, we -- agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to flow through any changes that would be made to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and, in addition, to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry over the Internet. These discussions with ICANN are ongoing, and, at this time, there are no further details to share. Of course, when appropriate, we will update you.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 0.9 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.22 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Second quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $105 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $109 million in the second quarter a year ago",609,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $105 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $109 million in the second quarter a year ago. Operating income totaled $202 million compared with $193 million in the second quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.9% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $128 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.24 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.04 for the same quarter last year.
As of June 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $582 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $91 million compared to $94 million last quarter and $96 million in the second quarter a year ago. The slight year-over-year decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of lower expenses as a result of the sale of our security services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 70.1% compared to 69.4% last quarter and 68.2% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $159 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.33 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 119.4 million shares. This compares to $1.31 last quarter and $1.18 in the second quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $165 million, and free cash flow was $154 million compared with $202 million and $191 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decline was a result of the timing of cash tax payments, which were predominantly made in Q1 last year versus occurring in the second quarter this year.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,225,000,000 to $1,235,000,000, narrowed from the $1,220,000,000 to $1.235,000,000 range provided on our last call. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 3% and 4.25%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%, increased from the 67.5% to 68.5% range provided on our last call and will continue to include certain immaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $100 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $105 million range provided previously.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2019. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

So as far as our renewal rates, our -- as you know, our preliminary renewal rate is estimated at 74%, which is down about 1% year-over-year. I'd say one of the prime contributors is a slightly lower first-time renewal rate, which is being driven by a higher proportion of names coming up for renewal from our Chinese registrars. As we talked before historically, China, like other emerging domain name markets, have lower renewal rates more than, say, mature markets like the U.S. and Europe. And so accordingly, what we're seeing is that the first-time renewal rate is being impacted by this weighted average effect of more Chinese names coming up for renewal."

And the 2 big causes there of being down year-over-year, one is about $2.5 million of costs associated with VSS. We, again, sold that business last year. And then the remaining $2 million of that variance is really related to the timing of investments in telco and networking in our network. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. As we go forward here, we -- and as we say in our Q that's filed this afternoon, we expect that we will have slight increases as a percent of revenue for both sales and marketing, for cost of goods sold and for G&A as well.

Well, these new agreements that ICANN negotiated are more likely the generic TLD program agreements, in that they no longer have price caps, but they do have to practice uniform pricing and provide customary advance notices of any changes to pricing. So implementing that pricing features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement for us simply restores the pricing flexibility that formerly existed for .com domains from 2006 to 2012, the ability to unilaterally increase prices by up to 7% 4x during the 6-year term of the registry agreement. So the ICANN registry agreements for .org and .biz, by the way, were renewed late June, and they completely listed their price caps. So we can't speculate if a similar approach will be used for the next renewal of .net..

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 156.1 million, consisting of 142.5 million names for .com and 13.6 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.3%. During the second quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.34 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2019 will be approximately 74%. This preliminary rate compares to 75% achieved in the second quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3% and 4.25%, narrowed from our previous range of 2.5% to 4.25%.
As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into the .com registry agreement. 
For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 amendment to the .com registry agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the .com registry, we -- agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to flow through any changes that would be made to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and, in addition, to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry over the Internet. These discussions with ICANN are ongoing, and, at this time, there are no further details to share. Of course, when appropriate, we will update you.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 0.9 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.22 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.

Second quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $105 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $109 million in the second quarter a year ago. Operating income totaled $202 million compared with $193 million in the second quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.9% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $128 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.24 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.04 for the same quarter last year.
As of June 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $582 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $91 million compared to $94 million last quarter and $96 million in the second quarter a year ago. The slight year-over-year decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of lower expenses as a result of the sale of our security services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 70.1% compared to 69.4% last quarter and 68.2% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $159 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.33 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 119.4 million shares. This compares to $1.31 last quarter and $1.18 in the second quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $165 million, and free cash flow was $154 million compared with $202 million and $191 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decline was a result of the timing of cash tax payments, which were predominantly made in Q1 last year versus occurring in the second quarter this year.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,225,000,000 to $1,235,000,000, narrowed from the $1,220,000,000 to $1.235,000,000 range provided on our last call. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 3% and 4.25%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%, increased from the 67.5% to 68.5% range provided on our last call and will continue to include certain immaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $100 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $105 million range provided previously.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2019. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

So as far as our renewal rates, our -- as you know, our preliminary renewal rate is estimated at 74%, which is down about 1% year-over-year. I'd say one of the prime contributors is a slightly lower first-time renewal rate, which is being driven by a higher proportion of names coming up for renewal from our Chinese registrars. As we talked before historically, China, like other emerging domain name markets, have lower renewal rates more than, say, mature markets like the U.S. and Europe. And so accordingly, what we're seeing is that the first-time renewal rate is being impacted by this weighted average effect of more Chinese names coming up for renewal."

And the 2 big causes there of being down year-over-year, one is about $2.5 million of costs associated with VSS. We, again, sold that business last year. And then the remaining $2 million of that variance is really related to the timing of investments in telco and networking in our network. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. As we go forward here, we -- and as we say in our Q that's filed this afternoon, we expect that we will have slight increases as a percent of revenue for both sales and marketing, for cost of goods sold and for G&A as well. But we continue to invest in our network.

Well, these new agreements that ICANN negotiated are more likely the generic TLD program agreements, in that they no longer have price caps, but they do have to practice uniform pricing and provide customary advance notices of any changes to pricing. So implementing that pricing features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement for us simply restores the pricing flexibility that formerly existed for .com domains from 2006 to 2012, the ability to unilaterally increase prices by up to 7% 4x during the 6-year term of the registry agreement. So the ICANN registry agreements for .org and .biz, by the way, were renewed late June, and they completely listed their price caps. So we can't speculate if a similar approach will be used for the next renewal of .net..

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 156.1 million, consisting of 142.5 million names for .com and 13.6 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.3%. During the second quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.34 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2019 will be approximately 74%. This preliminary rate compares to 75% achieved in the second quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3% and 4.25%, narrowed from our previous range of 2.5% to 4.25%.
As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into the .com registry agreement. 
For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 amendment to the .com registry agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the .com registry, we -- agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to flow through any changes that would be made to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and, in addition, to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry over the Internet. These discussions with ICANN are ongoing, and, at this time, there are no further details to share. Of course, when appropriate, we will update you.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 0.9 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.22 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.

As of June 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $582 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $91 million compared to $94 million last quarter and $96 million in the second quarter a year ago. The slight year-over-year decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of lower expenses as a result of the sale of our security services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 70.1% compared to 69.4% last quarter and 68.2% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $159 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.33 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 119.4 million shares. This compares to $1.31 last quarter and $1.18 in the second quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $165 million, and free cash flow was $154 million compared with $202 million and $191 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decline was a result of the timing of cash tax payments, which were predominantly made in Q1 last year versus occurring in the second quarter this year.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1,225,000,000 to $1,235,000,000, narrowed from the $1,220,000,000 to $1,235,000,000 range provided on our last call. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 3% and 4.25%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%, increased from the 67.5% to 68.5% range provided on our last call and will continue to include certain immaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for security service customers.
Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $100 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $105 million range provided previously.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2019. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

So as far as our renewal rates, our -- as you know, our preliminary renewal rate is estimated at 74%, which is down about 1% year-over-year. I'd say one of the prime contributors is a slightly lower first-time renewal rate, which is being driven by a higher proportion of names coming up for renewal from our Chinese registrars. As we talked before historically, China, like other emerging domain name markets, have lower renewal rates more than, say, mature markets like the U.S. and Europe. And so accordingly, what we're seeing is that the first-time renewal rate is being impacted by this weighted average effect of more Chinese names coming up for renewal."

And the 2 big causes there of being down year-over-year, one is about $2.5 million of costs associated with VSS. We, again, sold that business last year. And then the remaining $2 million of that variance is really related to the timing of investments in telco and networking in our network. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. As we go forward here, we -- and as we say in our Q that's filed this afternoon, we expect that we will have slight increases as a percent of revenue for both sales and marketing, for cost of goods sold and for G&A as well. But we continue to invest in our network. We'll probably still spend some more money in sales and marketing next year, and we'll continue to invest in our cyber activities throughout the year, which falls into G&A."

Well, these new agreements that ICANN negotiated are more likely the generic TLD program agreements, in that they no longer have price caps, but they do have to practice uniform pricing and provide customary advance notices of any changes to pricing. So implementing that pricing features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement for us simply restores the pricing flexibility that formerly existed for .com domains from 2006 to 2012, the ability to unilaterally increase prices by up to 7% 4x during the 6-year term of the registry agreement. So the ICANN registry agreements for .org and .biz, by the way, were renewed late June, and they completely listed their price caps. So we can't speculate if a similar approach will be used for the next renewal of .net.. And as you know, the pricing for .com is regulated by the Cooperative Agreement, so that's really a different animal in that process."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Our results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 157.4 million, consisting of 144 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the third quarter, we processed 9.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.27 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.6%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.8% achieved in the third quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3.2% and 3.7%.
As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate the terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including pricing terms into our .com Registry Agreement. For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 Amendment to .com Registry Agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to do 2 things. First, we agreed to reflect changes to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com agreement, including pricing terms. Second, we agreed to amend the com agreement to include terms to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry or the Internet. We believe these discussions with ICANN or nearly complete. While it will be appropriate to at this time to provide more details, I can say that we are satisfied with the results so far.
As noted, this is an ICANN process and we expect that before long, ICANN will be publishing for public comment the documents we have been discussing.
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares of common stock for $194 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.23 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.

Third quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $308 million, up.[Audio Gap] Operating expense totaled $103 million compared to $105 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter a year ago. Th",687,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $308 million, up.
[Audio Gap] 
Operating expense totaled $103 million compared to $105 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter a year ago. The small sequential quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of the timing of spend related to some sales and marketing programs. Year-over-year, the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the sale of our Security Services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. 
Operating income totaled $206 million compared with $195 million in the third quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 66.7% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $154 million compared with $138 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.30 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.13 for the same quarter last year. As of September 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $511 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $90 million compared to $91 million last quarter and $96 million in the third quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 70.8% compared to 70.1% last quarter and 68.7% in the same quarter of 2018.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $161 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.36 and based on a weighted average diluted share count of 118.6 million shares. This compares to $1.33 last quarter and $1.23 in the third quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $208 million and free cash flow was $197 million compared with the $187 million and $177 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Beginning with the first quarter 2020 earnings results, we plan to eliminate our discussion and presentation of non-GAAP measures with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA on which we will continue to report. As a result, our full year 2020 guidance, which we'll provide on our next call, will only include GAAP metrics. This change is the combination of the declining trend and influence of our non-GAAP adjustments over the last several years and is consistent with the evolving trends and best practices in financial reporting. 
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.228 billion to $1.233 billion, narrowed from the $1.225 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. This revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 3.2% and 3.7%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 69.5% and 70%, increased and narrowed from the 68% to 69% range provided on our last call. Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $44 million to $49 million, narrowed from the $42 million to $49 million range provided on our last call.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $95 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $100 million range provided previously.
To recap, VeriSign continued to demonstrate solid financial performance during the third quarter of 2019.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

There's typical in a short period where they review the comments and then after that, it's normally expected that an action will be taken approval on that process. Again, it's ICANN process. I can't tell you with certainty but that's typically what they do and that's basically expectation based on what they've done in the past. In terms of any price increases, we don't guide to pricing.

We're not a party to that arbitration but we have filed a request asking to participate in that arbitration as an interested party, which is allowed by ICANN's rules. So the update is that since last quarter, kind of a significant update I guess, that an arbitration panel has been appointed, convened then actually held a hearing just very recently, a couple of weeks ago.

But generally, I can tell you that this business has shifted steadily over the years. You probably remember to us to go with Google is making changes to its algorithm that affected the way that people monetize domains, that affected registrar buying habits. Geography can play a role as well. People buy the rates for different purposes and different geographies. So it's were there are many purposes obviously from branding yourself and building businesses. People buy domains for defensive registration purposes. There are lots of different reasons to buy them. They vary over time. Other external factors that influence them. Geography such kind of hard to generalize. I can't think of any standout change or shift that I can point to that indicates any specifics change or aspect of our business. As George said, this was a record Q3 with a 9.9 million gross and so demand is good for the product. Whatever the mix maybe that's a subject for publication some data in the future.

Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.
In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Our results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 157.4 million, consisting of 144 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the third quarter, we processed 9.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.27 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.6%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.8% achieved in the third quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3.2% and 3.7%.
As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate the terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into our .com Registry Agreement. For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 Amendment to our .com Registry Agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to do 2 things. First, we agreed to reflect changes to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com agreement, including pricing terms. Second, we agreed to amend the. com agreement to include terms to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry or the Internet. We believe these discussions with ICANN are nearly complete. While it will be inappropriate at this time to provide more details, I can say that we are satisfied with the results so far. As noted, this is an ICANN process and we expect that before long, ICANN will be publishing for public comment the documents we have been discussing.
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares of common stock for $194 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.23 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Third quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $308 million, up 0.9% year-over-year.Operating expense totaled $103 million compared to $105 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter a year a",686,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $308 million, up 0.9% year-over-year.
Operating expense totaled $103 million compared to $105 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter a year ago. The small sequential quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of the timing of spend related to some sales and marketing programs. Year-over-year, the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the sale of our Security Services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. 
Operating income totaled $206 million compared with $195 million in the third quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 66.7% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $154 million compared to $138 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.30 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.13 for the same quarter last year. As of September 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $511 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $90 million compared to $91 million last quarter and $96 million in the third quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 70.8% compared to 70.1% last quarter and 68.7% in the same quarter of 2018.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $161 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.36 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 118.6 million shares. This compares to $1.33 last quarter and $1.23 in the third quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $208 million, and free cash flow was $197 million compared with the $187 million and $177 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Beginning with the first quarter 2020 earnings results, we plan to eliminate our discussion and presentation of non-GAAP measures with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA on which we will continue to report. As a result, our full year 2020 guidance, which we'll provide on our next call, will only include GAAP metrics. This change is the culmination of the declining trend and influence of our non-GAAP adjustments over the last several years and is consistent with the evolving trends and best practices in financial reporting. 
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.228 billion to $1.233 billion, narrowed from the $1.225 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. This revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 3.2% and 3.7%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 69.5% and 70%, increased and narrowed from the 68% to 69% range provided on our last call. Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $44 million to $49 million, narrowed from the $42 million to $49 million range provided on our last call.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $95 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $100 million range provided previously.
To recap, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2019.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

As I mentioned, we will expect them to shortly publish these documents for a comment period. ICANN's comment periods are typically about 40 days. There's typically a short period where they review the comments. And then after that, it's normally expected that some action would be taken an approval on, on that process. Again, it's ICANN process. I can't tell you with certainty, but that's typically what they do and that's basically an expectation based on what they've done in the past. 
In terms of any price increases, we don't guide to pricing. We need to finalize this ICANN process first. So I can't offer you any details on that, but hopefully that answered your question."

And as a reminder, ICANN filed a response to the complaint. We're not a party to that arbitration, but we have filed a request asking to participate in that arbitration as an interested party, which is allowed by ICANN's rules. So the update is that since last quarter, kind of a significant update, I guess, is that an arbitration panel has been appointed, convened, that actually held a hearing just very recently, a couple of weeks ago, on our request to participate. That hearing was held, and we expect a ruling on that issue of our participation before the end of the year."

And while there's a variety of factors that can influence that, it -- for us, it's really been a geographic mix in the quarter, as we previously mentioned. China registrars, first-time renewal rate as well as what we call the emerging markets at historically lower first-time renewal rates than, let's say, more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe. And as China has continued to grow for us in 2018 and again in 2019, it's really this change in geographic mix which is causing a little bit of downward pressure on the first-time renewal rate."

But generally, I can tell you that this business has shifted steadily over the years. You probably remember a few years ago when Google was making changes to its search algorithm and affected the way that people monetized domains, that affected registrar buying habits. Geography can play a role as well. People buy domains for different purposes in different geographies. So it's -- there are many purposes, obviously, from branding yourself and building businesses. People buy domains for defensive registration purposes. There are lots of different reasons to buy them. They vary over time. Other external factors that influence them, geography. So it's kind of hard to generalize. I can't think of any standout change or shift that I can point to that indicates any specific change or aspect of our business.

Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Our results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 157.4 million, consisting of 144 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the third quarter, we processed 9.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.27 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.6%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.8% achieved in the third quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3.2% and 3.7%.
As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate the terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into our .com Registry Agreement. For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 Amendment to our .com Registry Agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to do 2 things.
First, we agreed to reflect changes to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com agreement, including pricing terms. Second, we agreed to amend the. com agreement to include terms to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry or the Internet.
We believe these discussions with ICANN are nearly complete. While it would be inappropriate at this time to provide more details, I can say that we are satisfied with the results so far. As noted, this is an ICANN process and we expect that before long, ICANN will be publishing for public comment the documents we have been discussing.
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares of common stock for $194 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.23 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Third quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $308 million, up 0.9% year-over-year.
Operating expense totaled $103 million compared to $105 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter a year ago. The small sequential quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of the timing of spend related to some sales and marketing programs. Year-over-year, the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the sale of our Security Services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure.
Operating income totaled $206 million compared with $195 million in the third quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 66.7% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $154 million compared to $138 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.30 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.13 for the same quarter last year. As of September 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $511 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $90 million compared to $91 million last quarter and $96 million in the third quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 70.8% compared to 70.1% last quarter and 68.7% in the same quarter of 2018.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $161 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.36 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 118.6 million shares. This compares to $1.33 last quarter and $1.23 in the third quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $208 million, and free cash flow was $197 million compared with the $187 million and $177 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Beginning with the first quarter 2020 earnings results, we plan to eliminate our discussion and presentation of non-GAAP measures with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA on which we will continue to report. As a result, our full year 2020 guidance, which we'll provide on our next call, will only include GAAP metrics. This change is the culmination of the declining trend and influence of our non-GAAP adjustments over the last several years and is consistent with the evolving trends and best practices in financial reporting.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.228 billion to $1.233 billion, narrowed from the $1.225 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. This revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 3.2% and 3.7%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 69.5% and 70%, increased and narrowed from the 68% to 69% range provided on our last call. Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $44 million to $49 million, narrowed from the $42 million to $49 million range provided on our last call.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $95 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $100 million range provided previously.
To recap, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2019.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Yes, let me explain how -- what we expect in the public comment period with the caveat that this is an ICANN process so I can't speak with certainty and I don't speak for ICANN, but I kind of tell you what the expectation is and what they typically do.
As I mentioned, we will expect them to shortly publish these documents for a comment period. ICANN's comment periods are typically about 40 days. There's typically a short period where they review the comments. And then after that, it's normally expected that some action would be taken, an approval on that process. Again, it's ICANN process. So I can't tell you with certainty, but that's typically what they do and that's basically an expectation based on what they've done in the past.
In terms of any price increases, we don't guide to pricing. We need to finalize this ICANN process first. So can't offer you any details on that, but hopefully that answered your question."

And one of the losing bidders, a company called Afilias, a competitor of ours, filed what is a form of an arbitration proceeding called an IRP in November of 2018 that's against ICANN. And as a reminder, ICANN filed a response to the complaint. We're not a party to that arbitration, but we have filed a request asking to participate in that arbitration as an interested party, which is allowed by ICANN's rules.
So the update is that since last quarter, kind of a significant update, I guess, is that an arbitration panel has been appointed, convened. It actually held a hearing just very recently, a couple of weeks ago, on our request to participate. That hearing was held, and we expect a ruling on that issue of our participation before the end of the year."

And while there's a variety of factors that can influence that, it -- for us, it's really been a geographic mix in the quarter, as we previously mentioned. China registrars, first-time renewal rate as well as what we call the emerging markets at historically lower first-time renewal rates than, let's say, more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe. And as China has continued to grow for us in 2018 and again in 2019, it's really this change in geographic mix which is causing a little bit of downward pressure on the first-time renewal rate."

You probably remember a few years ago when Google was making changes to its search algorithm. That affected the way that people monetized domains, that affected registrant buying habits. Geography can play a role as well. People buy domains for different purposes in different geographies.
So it's -- there are many purposes, obviously, from branding yourself and building businesses. People buy domains for defensive registration purposes. There are lots of different reasons to buy them. They vary over time. Other external factors that influence them, geography. So it's kind of hard to generalize. I can't think of any standout change or shift that I can point to that indicates any specific change or aspect of our business.
As George said, this was a record Q3 with 9.9 million gross adds and so demand is good for the product. Whatever the mix may be, that's a subject for publication of some data in the future. We might look at that. That's a good question, but it's really hard to sort of give you a detailed, sort of granular answer to that. There's just so much activity and so many different reasons that people buy domains and so many different types of monetization as well."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Our results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 157.4 million, consisting of 144 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the third quarter, we processed 9.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.27 million names.
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.6%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.8% achieved in the third quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3.2% and 3.7%.
As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate the terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into our .com Registry Agreement. For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 Amendment to our .com Registry Agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to do 2 things.
First, we agreed to reflect changes to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com agreement, including pricing terms. Second, we agreed to amend the. com agreement to include terms to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry or the Internet.
We believe these discussions with ICANN are nearly complete. While it would be inappropriate at this time to provide more details, I can say that we are satisfied with the results so far. As noted, this is an ICANN process and we expect that before long, ICANN will be publishing for public comment the documents we have been discussing.
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares of common stock for $194 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.23 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Third quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $308 million, up 0.9% year-over-year.
Operating expense totaled $103 million compared to $105 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter a year ago. The small sequential quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of the timing of spend related to some sales and marketing programs. Year-over-year, the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the sale of our Security Services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure.
Operating income totaled $206 million compared with $195 million in the third quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 66.7% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $154 million compared to $138 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.30 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.13 for the same quarter last year. As of September 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $511 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $90 million compared to $91 million last quarter and $96 million in the third quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 70.8% compared to 70.1% last quarter and 68.7% in the same quarter of 2018.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $161 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.36 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 118.6 million shares. This compares to $1.33 last quarter and $1.23 in the third quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $208 million, and free cash flow was $197 million compared with the $187 million and $177 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Beginning with the first quarter 2020 earnings results, we plan to eliminate our discussion and presentation of non-GAAP measures with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA on which we will continue to report. As a result, our full year 2020 guidance, which we'll provide on our next call, will only include GAAP metrics. This change is the culmination of the declining trend and influence of our non-GAAP adjustments over the last several years and is consistent with the evolving trends and best practices in financial reporting.
Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.228 billion to $1.233 billion, narrowed from the $1.225 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. This revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 3.2% and 3.7%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 69.5% and 70%, increased and narrowed from the 68% to 69% range provided on our last call. Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $44 million to $49 million, narrowed from the $42 million to $49 million range provided on our last call.
Capital expenditures in 2019 are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $95 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $100 million range provided previously.
To recap, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2019.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

As I mentioned, we will expect them to shortly publish these documents for a comment period. ICANN's comment periods are typically about 40 days. There's typically a short period where they review the comments. And then after that, it's normally expected that some action would be taken, an approval on that process. Again, it's ICANN process. So I can't tell you with certainty, but that's typically what they do and that's basically an expectation based on what they've done in the past.
In terms of any price increases, we don't guide to pricing. We need to finalize this ICANN process first. So can't offer you any details on that, but hopefully that answered your question."

And as a reminder, ICANN filed a response to the complaint. We're not a party to that arbitration, but we have filed a request asking to participate in that arbitration as an interested party, which is allowed by ICANN's rules.
So the update is that since last quarter, kind of a significant update I guess is that an arbitration panel has been appointed, convened. It actually held a hearing just very recently, a couple of weeks ago, on our request to participate. That hearing was held, and we expect a ruling on that issue of our participation before the end of the year."

And while there's a variety of factors that can influence that, it -- for us, it's really been a geographic mix in the quarter, as we previously mentioned. China registrars, first-time renewal rate as well as what we call the emerging markets at historically lower first-time renewal rates than, let's say, more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe. And as China has continued to grow for us in 2018 and again in 2019, it's really this change in geographic mix which is causing a little bit of downward pressure on the first-time renewal rate."

I think there's a number of investors that just felt like, well, why isn't this just a slam dunk, quick, put in Item 35 and you're done. I think from some of the comments that you've made in the earnings calls, it does seem to be more of a negotiation, and negotiation usually means both sides want something. There has been some question that I get from investors as to whether the ICANN fee would go up or what other elements we might actually see.

There's also an obligation resulting from the 2016 extension to provide the security and stability.

You probably remember a few years ago when Google was making changes to its search algorithm. That affected the way that people monetized domains, that affected registrant buying habits. Geography can play a role as well. People buy domains for different purposes in different geographies.
So it's -- there are many purposes, obviously, from branding yourself and building businesses. People buy domains for defensive registration purposes. There are lots of different reasons to buy them. They vary over time. Other external factors that influence them, geography. So it's kind of hard to generalize. I can't think of any standout change or shift that I can point to that indicates any specific change or aspect of our business.
As George said, this was a record Q3 with 9.9 million gross adds and so demand is good for the product. Whatever the mix may be, that's a subject for publication of some data in the future. We might look at that. That's a good question, but it's really hard to sort of give you a detailed, sort of granular answer to that. There's just so much activity and so many different reasons that people buy domains and so many different types of monetization as well."
