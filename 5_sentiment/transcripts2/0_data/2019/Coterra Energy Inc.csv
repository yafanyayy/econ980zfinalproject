Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are several executive members of team Cabot. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forwar",2041,"Thank you, Allison, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are several executive members of team Cabot. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.
As some of you may recall, this time last year, we laid out a strategy for 2018 that was focused on, first: Delivering production and reserves per debt adjusted share, while generating positive free cash flow; secondly, generating and improving return on capital employed that exceeds our cost to capital; third, increasing our return on capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and fourth, maintaining a strong balance sheet to maximize financial flexibility. I'm very happy to report that we have successfully delivered on all the strategies that we had laid out for 2018. For the year, we delivered growth in production and reserves per debt adjusted share of 12% and 25%, respectively. Most importantly, the company generated $297 million of free cash flow, a 92% increase relative to prior year. 
I would highlight that this is the third consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation during a period in which the company generated an adjusted earnings per share CAGR in excess of 100%.
The company generated a 15.9% return on capital employed for the year, borrowed feeding weighted average cost of capital and representing improvement relative to prior year of 860 basis points. This 15.9% return on capital compares favorably to the average S&P 500 return on capital, highlighting that there is a company in the E&P sector that can in fact deliver returns that are competitive across the broad equity market.
Additionally, we exceeded our initial expectations by returning over $1 billion of capital to shareholders, including increasing our quarterly dividend twice and repurchasing over 38 million shares in 2018. 
This represented over a 9% shareholder yield to equity holders. Also, we have now reduced our shares outstanding by over 9%, since restarting our share repurchase program in 2017. 
Lastly, we demonstrated our continued commitment to maintain strong balance sheet by reducing debt levels of -- by approximately $300 million, resulting in our year-end debt to EBITDAx ratio of 1x. When considering the combination of cash dividends, stock repurchases and debt reduction, the company delivered a total stakeholder yield of over 12% for the year. 
In addition to these highlights, we delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share by 125%.
Our results for the year demonstrate that despite the negative sentiment around the energy sector, and specifically as it relates to natural gas to base, Cabot is generating a compelling combination of growth, free cash flow, return on capital, return of capital, while maintaining investment grade balance sheet. As it relates specifically to the fourth quarter of 2018, the company generated net income of $275 million or $0.64 per share and adjusted net income of $236 million or $0.55 per share. 
Cabot's cash from operating cash activity in fourth quarter was $316 million, while discretionary cash flow in the fourth quarter was $493 million. Cabot also delivered $241 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2018, exceeding our previous expectation of $200 million.
All of these improvements relative to the fourth quarter of '17 were driven by higher production, stronger natural gas price realizations and a significant improvement in our cost structure. 
In fact, 2018 represented that the company's lowest unit cost in history. One specific operating expense I want to highlight is the exploratory dry well costs were incurred in the fourth quarter, resulting from unsuccessful drilling results in our second exploratory area. 
As a result, we do not expect to allocate an incremental capital to exploration at this time.
Let's move on to reserve discussion, Cabot reported year-end improved reserves of 11.6 [indiscernible] cubic foot, an increase of 19% over year-end 2017, despite the divestiture of our Eagle Ford property in 2018. Cabot's total company oil source, refining and development costs were $0.30 per MCF year, while our Marcellus only all source refining and development cost were $0.26 per MCF. These results reaffirm our acreage position in Susquehanna County as the lowest cost natural gas assets in North America. As many of you are aware, we tested a sample of Upper Marcellus wells during 2018 with our generation 5 completion design to further demonstrate the resource potential of this distinctive incremental reservoir. Based on the production history today, the Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells placed on production during 2018 have outperformed the average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.9 from our earlier generation Upper Marcellus completions. To answer several questions regarding the Upper Marcellus, these results reconfirm our previous Upper Marcellus well results demonstrated, which is: While the Upper Marcellus reservoir has its own distinctive characteristics relative to Lower Marcellus, it remains one of the most economic reservoirs in North America. Our plan is to continue to drill and complete and small sample of Upper Marcellus wells each year, to build of a larger population of Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells. Once again, these results, coupled with our previous Upper Marcellus completions, have extensive production history, reconfirming our conviction on the distinct nature of this reservoir and reinforce our views on the multi-decade inventory life remaining from this world-class asset.
All right. Moving to the marketing and pricing update. Much of the -- our success for the fourth quarter and full year was driven by the long-awaited addition of new takeaway capacity in the basin. Demand projects that have been work -- we've been working on for years. Cabot's realized natural gas prices before hedges improved by 50% relative to the prior year comparable quarter, driven by a combination of higher NYMEX prices and a significant improvement in differentials, which came in at $0.42 below NYMEX, our lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2013. And the exposure we now have to highly seasonal markets in the mid-Atlantic, we expect our first quarter 2019 price realizations to be flat too or even a slight premium to NYMEX. For the full year, we still expect our weighted average differential before the impact of hedges to be $0.30. On the hedging front, we utilized the short-lived winter Ally to layer in NYMEX and basis hedges, which we posted on our website this morning. We anticipate these hedges will generate over $55 million of our additional revenue this year, based on the current forward curve. We will continue to be opportunistic and layering in hedges during market rallies in order to protect our anticipated free cash flow for the year.
Now I'll provide commentary for 2019. For the full year, we updated our 2019 capital budget to $800 million, resulting in production growth of 20% or 27% on a debt adjusted per share basis. Our decision to target the lower end of our preliminary capital guidance range is the direct result of current market conditions, feedback from shareholders, and the broader investment community, and our continued strategic focus on returns and free cash flow over top line production growth. 
We believe that we have an industry leader and -- we have been an industry leader and deemphasizing growth for the sake of it, and prioritizing return of and on capital, while maximizing the free cash flow. Our updated program for the year reaffirms our commitment to this philosophy and echoes our commentary from the third quarter earnings call last October.
We've certainly heard data points from the appellation peers that apply more rational approach to capital allocation in 2019, and Cabot fully supports the rationalization of capital to bring stability to the market. 
With that said, we have actually witnessed a slight increase in the rig count in the Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville since our call last October, meanwhile, despite early winner-related rally, the NYMEX strip remains in backwardation. While we are cautiously optimistic on the supply, demand outlook for the next 24 months, due in large part significant demand growth and material-based declines across the U.S., we believe it is prudent for us to plan more conservatively and utilize an incremental free cash flow, resulting from higher prices for our additional returns of capital to shareholders as opposed to funding additional outsized production growth. As a result, we are using to a 275 NYMEX assumption for budgeting purposes in 2019, which is below the current strip of approximately $2.90 when taking in consideration account -- and account for actual NYMEX settlements for January and February. 
Under this more conservative price assumption, we expect to generate between $600 million and $650 million of free cash flow, implying a [ 6% ] free cash flow yield. I would highlight this differ slightly from $650 million to $700 million of expected free cash flow that we discussed on the third quarter call, which was based on a higher NYMEX assumption of $2.85 million instead of the $2.75 we are using. As highlighted on the third quarter call, we plan to return at least 50% of this free cash flow to shareholders annually through the combination of growing dividend and share repurchases, resulting in a minimum total shareholder yield of 3%. 
At $2.75 NYMEX, our 2019 program is expected to deliver between 40% and 55% growth and adjusted earnings per share and between a 21% and 23% return on capital employed. Even under a $2.50 NYMEX assumption, which some of the sales side [indiscernible] our program would deliver between $475 million and [ $525 million ] in free cash flow, which implies a 5% free cash flow yield at midpoint. Also, between 20% and 35% growth in adjusted earnings per share and return on capital employed between 19% and 21%. We believe these metrics are very compelling relative to the broader equity market, especially at these trough commodity prices assumptions. I think it is also important to highlight that we are going to generate this type of free cash flow, while continuing to reinvest the disciplined growth of our assets via drillbit. We will -- we have been numerous -- excuse me, we have seen numerous 2019 budgets released across the sector that imply significant reduction in capital spending of year-over-year in order target free cash flow neutrality. 
However, for some, the limited capital investment there could be a day of reckoning in 2020. In contrast, assuming price realizations are flat to 2019, our program for 2020 is designed, first and foremost, to deliver an improving return on capital employed and to generate strong free cash flow for the 5th consecutive year from a capital program that is lower than 2019, all while maintaining a balance sheet. We expect to continue to deliver growth in cash flow and earnings per share and 2020, driven by disciplined capital allocation, resulting in measured production growth. Additionally, the continued reduction in our shares outstanding, resulting from our buyback program, should further accrete per share metrics. 
Our [indiscernible] to be more disciplined with our capital allocation for the year and deliver more measured growth will only do so much to help balance the market. We believe it is important to send a message to investors, both energy specialists and generalists alike, that there is a company in the industry that is committed to discipline capital allocation and has the assets that can generate a compelling combination of returns and growth in per share financial metrics, even under a much lower natural gas prices assumptions and a reduced capital program. In summary, I believe our strategic effort has continued to create incremental value for our shareholders, as we have transformed Cabot into the lowest cost producer in the industry with the lowest headcount and capital intensity, the highest capital efficiency and ultimately, resulting in return on capital employed free cash flow and per share growth metrics that are not only industry-leading, but also extremely competitive when compared to all other sectors across the S&P 500. So with that, Allison I will be more than happy to open it up to questions"

Right now, with the free cash flow generation that we anticipate in '19, we kind of layered in a basin assumption, Brian, at the $2.75, and plus would come, if in fact, we realize the $2.90, which the strips its at today, we realize the $2.90 or something above that, then we are going to do what we've done in the past, and that is to deliver some of the funds back to the shareholder.

Experiencing the farm where it is starting to hurt small businesses, it's starting to hurt the development of new housing. I think it's clear that businesses are going to be turning away from New York.

And with that -- that improved -- not only did we have an improvement by the gas that we moved on the new infrastructures and to the power plants, but that dramatic improvement in the basis also enhanced every other molecule that we were still selling into the basin.

On the other hand, the other half, I guess, Atlantic Sunrise, these volumes were being delivered into the volume system directly. And so what we saw was a large amount of gas leaving the lighting system as well as Cabot gas leaving the [indiscernible] system but that influence in the lighting bases felt that into the other pipelines as well. And then along at the same time, we had a number of in basin projects, not just Cabot related but other producer-related projects. So it was somewhat of a perfect storm in a very good way, this fall for the pricing and the basis in the Northeast PPA."

First, I'll make a comment regarding our comfort level since we received a number of -- not a number, but a couple of questions regarding our Upper Marcellus and how do you know it's distinctive. And I will just give 1 example. We have a number of examples that we could give to you, but I'll give you 1 example that most people are not going to have any problems understanding how we have the conviction we do. We've laid in this -- recently, we laid to Upper Marcellus wells in an area that we had prior completions on our -- in the Lower Marcellus. And in this specific example I'll give you, we had 2 Lower Marcellus wells that had been producing for an extended period of time. We put 2 Upper Marcellus wells 400 feet -- and get that context, 400 feet from to Lower Marcellus wells that produced a long time. And we completed those 2 Upper Marcellus wells that were 400 feet of these 2 Lower Marcellus wells. It just to happen to be to lower Marcellus wells that we chose to do this experiment on have each exhume over 20 Bcf. Okay. So we laid 2 Upper Marcellus wells, 400 feet from 2 wells that exhumed each 28 BCF. Those Upper Marcellus wells came on normally, as you might expect, the early time production from those Upper Marcellus wells have actually been a curve. And again I'm going to caution the comment here on a curve fit with very little data, but those 2 Upper Marcellus wells came on fitting a curve of 3.3 Bcf per 1,000 and 2.7 Bcf per 1,000. I'm not saying that that's what we're going to go to don't take it and I hope nobody comes and asked about what about the 3.3, 3.7 Bcf, [ 5,000 EUR ] That might be a poster child from this point forward. I'm just giving you an example of our confidence level, if there's any place we would have seen some issues, it would've been where we had produced over 40 Bcf, 400 something feet away from a couple of Upper Marcellus. So that's the commentary. And what was the rest of your question? Scott has been raising his hand so."

The other thing that plays into that is what is the Takeaway capacity in that part of our field that this point in time? What we wouldn't want to do is do all of the lowers and uppers and then be constrained because we wouldn't be able to get that gas to market. And in addition to the most efficient to the lowers than the uppers and come back into the uppers later. And Dan's example right now highlights that there is no degradation when we came back. That's still the primary focus of how we're going to do it. It really only downside is that mode cost you mentioned because we're building the patch where we can come back on them, and all that kind of stuff. So there's not a lot of cost efficiency what we don't want to do is instruct Liam to put a huge pipe out there that will never be filled up again after the initial production. That's just not efficient from that side of the equation. So that's kind of the dynamic. We will do some science, just like Dan highlighted earlier, where we'll do -- we have 10 or 15 we would -- I think that's the latest number in the '19 program. We did 9 in the '18 program. We'll continue to do it -- a few handfuls of these as part of the size project going forward but in terms of full develop cash flow pad outside of maybe 1 or 2 for science purposes, it still most efficient to do what we're doing."

And I think there is signs that rationalization is taking place, even though from October to current, there seems to be more rigs working today than they were back in October. We did see, and December and January, a little bit of reduction in at least the population area, inflecting or reduction in production up in that area. So that would be helpful. But in looking at the demand side of the equation, I'm optimistic that there is going to be another 3 Bcf or 4 Bcf a day going offshore by commissioning of the LNG facilities. We're seeing incremental demand as is needed up in New York and up in the Boston area. When utilities now in Boston are talking about not taking application for new natural gas hookups. That means that demand is increasing and there is a need for additional natural gas out there. So I'm encouraged by incremental demand out there in that particular area. And I also think it's proven from your side of the equation, Doug, that in fact there is reward on value and there is expectation that value would be returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks, of dividends and that's meaningful, then that is going to help assist with the market as opposed to some that focus on growth at the -- at our cost. And so I think all of this is part of the forward-looking on natural gas but I also think that natural gas plays a role where any of the renewable footprint out there, natural gas better be part of the equation. Otherwise, your responsiveness to the insecurity of a delivery of energy is going to be challenged."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are several executive members of team Cabot.

Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.
As some of you may recall, this time last year, we laid out a strategy for 2018 that was focused on: first, delivering growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share while generating positive free cash flow; secondly, generating and improving return on capital employed that exceeds our cost to capital; third, increasing our return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and fourth, maintaining a strong balance sheet to maximize financial flexibility. I'm very happy to report that we have successfully delivered on all the strategies that we had laid out for 2018. For the year, we delivered growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share of 12% and 25%, respectively. Most importantly, the company generated $297 million of free cash flow, a 92% increase relative to prior year.
I would highlight that this is the third consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation during a period in which the company generated an adjusted earnings per share CAGR in excess of 100%.
The company generated a 15.9% return on capital employed for the year, far exceeding our weighted average cost of capital and representing an improvement relative to prior year of 860 basis points. This 15.9% return on capital compares favorably to the average S&P 500 return on capital, highlighting that there is a company in the E&P sector that can in fact deliver returns that are competitive across the broad equity market.
Additionally, we exceeded our initial expectations by returning over $1 billion of capital to shareholders, including increasing our quarterly dividend twice and repurchasing over 38 million shares in 2018.
This represented over a 9% shareholder yield to equity holders. Also, we have now reduced our shares outstanding by over 9% since restarting our share repurchase program in 2017.
Lastly, we demonstrated our continued commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet by reducing debt levels of -- by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year-end debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1x. When considering the combination of cash dividends, stock repurchases and debt reduction, the company delivered a total stakeholder yield of over 12% for the year.
In addition to these highlights, we delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share by 125%.
Our results for the year demonstrate that despite the negative sentiment around the energy sector and specifically as it relates to natural gas base, Cabot is generating a compelling combination of growth, free cash flow, return on capital, return of capital, while maintaining investment-grade balance sheet. As it relates specifically to the fourth quarter of 2018, the company generated net income of $275 million or $0.64 per share and adjusted net income of $236 million or $0.55 per share.
Cabot's cash from operating activity in the fourth quarter was $316 million, while discretionary cash flow in the fourth quarter was $493 million. Cabot also delivered $241 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2018, exceeding our previous expectation of $200 million.
All of these improvements relative to the fourth quarter of '17 were driven by higher production, stronger natural gas price realizations and a significant improvement in our cost structure. 
In fact, 2018 represented the company's lowest unit cost in history. One specific operating expense I want to highlight is the exploratory dry hole cost we incurred in the fourth quarter, resulting from unsuccessful drilling results in our second exploratory area. As a result, we do not expect to allocate any incremental capital to exploration at this time.
Let's move on to reserve discussion, Cabot reported year-end improved reserves of 11.6 trillion cubic foot equivalent, an increase of 19% over year-end 2017, despite the divestiture of our Eagle Ford property in 2018. Cabot's total company all-source finding and development cost were $0.30 per MCF year, while our Marcellus-only all-source finding and development cost were $0.26 per MCF. These results reaffirm our acreage position in Susquehanna County as the lowest-cost natural gas asset in North America. As many of you are aware, we tested a sample of Upper Marcellus wells during 2018 with our generation-5 completion design to further demonstrate the resource potential of this distinctive incremental reservoir. Based on the production history today, the Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells placed on production during 2018 have outperformed the average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.9 from our earlier-generation Upper Marcellus completions. To answer several questions regarding the Upper Marcellus, these results reconfirm our previous Upper Marcellus wells results demonstrated, which is: While the Upper Marcellus reservoir has its own distinctive characteristics relative to the Lower Marcellus, it remains one of the most economic reservoirs in North America. Our plan is to continue to drill and complete a small sample of Upper Marcellus wells each year, to build a larger population of Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells. Once again, these results, coupled with our previous Upper Marcellus completions, have extensive production history, reconfirming our conviction on the distinct nature of this reservoir and reinforce our views on the multi-decade inventory life remaining from this world-class asset.
All right. Move to the marketing and pricing update. Much of the -- our success for the fourth quarter and full year was driven by the long-awaited addition of new takeaway capacity in the basin, demand projects that have been work -- we've been working on for years. Cabot's realized natural gas prices before hedges improved by 50% relative to the prior year comparable quarter, driven by a combination of higher NYMEX prices and a significant improvement in differentials, which came in at $0.42 below NYMEX, our lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2013. The exposure we now have to highly seasonal markets in the Mid-Atlantic, we expect our first quarter 2019 price realizations to be flat to or even a slight premium to NYMEX. For the full year, we still expect our weighted average differential before the impact of hedges to be $0.30. On the hedging front, we utilized the short-lived winter rally to layer in NYMEX and basis hedges, which we posted on our website this morning. We anticipate these hedges will generate over $55 million of our additional revenue this year, based on the current forward curve. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering and hedges during market rallies in order to protect our anticipated free cash flow for the year.
Now I'll provide commentary for 2019. For the full year, we updated our 2019 capital budget to $800 million, resulting in production growth of 20% or 27% on a debt-adjusted per share basis. Our decision to target the lower end of our preliminary capital guidance range is the direct result of current market conditions, feedback from shareholders and the broader investment community and our continued strategic focus on returns and free cash flow over top line production growth.
We believe that we have an industry leader and -- we have been an industry leader in deemphasizing growth for the sake of it and prioritizing return of and on capital, while maximizing the free cash flow. Our updated program for the year reaffirms our commitment to this philosophy and echoes our commentary from the third quarter earnings call last October.
We have certainly heard data points from the appellation peers that imply a more rational approach to capital allocation in 2019, and Cabot fully supports the rationalization of capital to bring stability to the market.
With that said, we have actually witnessed a slight increase in the rig count in the Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville since our call last October, meanwhile, despite early winter-related rally, the NYMEX strip remains in backwardation. While we are cautiously optimistic on the supply -- demand outlook for the next 24 months, due in large part to significant demand growth and material-based declines across the U.S., we believe it is prudent for us to plan more conservatively and utilize an incremental free cash flow, resulting from higher prices for our additional returns of capital to shareholders as opposed to funding additional outsized production growth. As a result, we are using to a $2.75 NYMEX assumption for budgeting purposes in 2019, which is below the current strip of approximately $2.90 when taking in consideration -- account -- and account for actual NYMEX settlements for January and February.
Under this more conservative price assumption, we expect to generate between $600 million and $650 million of free cash flow, implying a 6% free cash flow yield. I would highlight, this differs slightly from $650 million to $700 million of expected free cash flow that we discussed on the third quarter call, which was based on a higher NYMEX assumption of $2.85 million instead of the $2.75 we are using. As we highlighted on our third quarter call, we plan to return at least 50% of this free cash flow to shareholders annually through the combination of growing dividend and share repurchase, resulting in a minimum total shareholder yield of 3%.
At $2.75 NYMEX, our 2019 program is expected to deliver between 40% and 55% growth in adjusted earnings per share and between a 21% and 23% return on capital employed. Even under a $2.50 NYMEX assumption, which some of the sell side are calling for, our program would deliver between $475 million and $525 million of free cash flow, which implies a 5% free cash flow yield at the midpoint, also, between 20% and 35% growth in adjusted earnings per share and a return on capital employed between 19% and 21%. We believe these metrics are very compelling relative to the broader equity market, especially at these trough commodity prices assumptions. I think it is also important to highlight that we are going to generate this type of free cash flow, while continuing to reinvest in the disciplined growth of our assets via the drill bit. We will -- we have been numerous -- excuse me, we have seen numerous 2019 budgets released across the sector that imply significant reduction in capital spending year-over-year in order to target free cash flow neutrality.
However, for some, the limited capital investment, there could be a day of reckoning in 2020. In contrast, assuming price realizations are flat to 2019, our program for 2020 is designed, first and foremost, to deliver an improving return on capital employed and to generate strong free cash flow for the 5th consecutive year from a capital program that is lower than 2019, all while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. We expect to continue to deliver growth in cash flow and earnings per share in 2020, driven by disciplined capital allocation, resulting in measured production growth. Additionally, the continued reduction in our shares outstanding, resulting from our buyback program, should further accrete per share metrics.
Our decision to be more disciplined with our capital allocation for the year and deliver more measured growth will only do so much to help balance the market. We believe it is important to send a message to investors, both energy specialists and generalists alike, that there is a company in the industry that is committed to disciplined capital allocation and has the assets that can generate a compelling combination of returns and growth in per share financial metrics, even under much lower natural gas price assumptions and a reduced capital program. In summary, I believe our strategic effort have continued to create incremental value for our shareholders as we have transformed Cabot into the lowest-cost producer in the industry, with the lowest headcount and capital intensity, the highest capital efficiency and ultimately resulting in return on capital employed, free cash flow and per share growth metrics that are not only industry-leading but also extremely competitive when compared to all other sectors across the S&P 500. So with that, Allison, I'd be more than happy to open it up to questions."

I think it's clear that businesses are going to be turning away from New York.

So we're doing that. On the question about backfilling. We saw contemporaneous with the commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise and these power plants. We saw a fairly drastic narrowing of the differential. And with that -- that improved -- not only did we have an improvement by the gas that we moved on the new infrastructures and to the power plants, but that dramatic improvement in the basis also enhanced every other molecule that we were still selling into the basin. So with that uplift and the rest of our gas, we feel comfortable that maintaining that volumes we're producing and having just a measured growth by our capital allocation and allocating back some of our free cash and buying back shares and having a per share metric component to growth, we think that fits what we're trying to accomplish on improving realizations throughout not only the basin but also where we're moving gas outside the basin."

And in this specific example I'll give you, we had 2 Lower Marcellus wells that had been producing for an extended period of time. We put 2 Upper Marcellus wells 400 feet, get that context, 400 feet from 2 Lower Marcellus wells that had produced a long time. And we completed those 2 Upper Marcellus wells that were 400 feet from these 2 Lower Marcellus wells. It just so happened to be the 2 Lower Marcellus wells that we chose to do this experiment on have each cum-ed over 20 Bcf. Okay, so we laid 2 Upper Marcellus wells, 400 feet from 2 wells that had cum-ed each 20 bcf. Those Upper Marcellus wells came on normally as you might expect. The early time production from those Upper Marcellus wells have actually fit a curve. And again I'm going to caution the comment here on a curve fit with very little data, but those 2 Upper Marcellus wells came on fitting a curve of 3.3 Bcf per 1,000 and 3.7 Bcf per 1,000. I'm not saying that that's what we're going to go to. So don't take it, and I hope nobody comes and ask about what about the 3.3, 3.7 Bcf, 5,000 EUR. That might be our poster, Charles, from this point forward. I'm just giving you an example of our confidence level. If there's any place we would have seen some issues, it would've been where we had produced over 40 Bcf, 400-something feet away from a couple of Upper Marcellus. So that's -- so box commentary in that. What was the rest of your question?"

The other thing that plays into that is what is the takeaway capacity in that part of our field at this point in time? What we wouldn't want to do is do all of the lowers and the uppers and then be constrained because we wouldn't be able to get that gas to market. And while -- in addition to being the most efficient to the lowers then the uppers and come back, do -- and do the uppers later. And Dan's example right now highlights that there is no degradation when we came back. That's still the primary focus of how we're going to do it. The really only downside is the mold cost you mentioned because we're building the pads where we can come back on them and all that kind of stuff. So there's not a lot of lost efficiency. What we don't want to do is instruct Williams to put a huge pipe out there that will never be filled again after the initial production. That's just not efficient from that side of the equation. So that's kind of the dynamic. We will do some science test, like Dan highlighted earlier, where we'll do -- we had 10 or 15 that we think -- I think that's the latest number in the '19 program. We did 9 in the '18 program. We'll continue to do a few handfuls of these as part of the science project going forward. But in terms of full develop -- the full pad outside and maybe 1 or 2 for science purposes, it's still most efficient to do what we're doing."

But a couple of moving parts in the way I look at it is, one, I think it is imperative that our industry rationalized the market in a way that is prudent for all shareholders. And I think there's -- there are signs that rationalization is taking place, even though from October to current, there's -- seems to be more rigs working today than there were back in October. We did see in December and January, a little bit of reduction in -- at least up in the Appalachia area, a flattening or a reduction in production up in that area. So that would be helpful. But in looking at the demand side of the equation, I'm optimistic that there is going to be another 3 or 4 Bcf a day going offshore by commissioning of the LNG facilities. We're seeing incremental demand that is needed up in the -- up in New York and up in the Boston area. When utilities now in Boston are talking about not taking application for new natural gas hookups. That means that demand is increasing, and there's a need for additional natural gas up there. So I'm encouraged by incremental demand up there in that particular area. So -- and I also think that it's proven from your side of the equation, Doug, that if in fact there's reward on value and there is expectation that value would be returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks, of dividends and that's meaningful, then that is going to help assist with the market as opposed to some that keep focused on growth at the -- at all cost. And so I think all of this is part of the forward look on natural gas. But I also think that natural gas plays a role on any of the renewable footprint out there, natural gas better be part of the equation. Otherwise, your responsiveness to the insecurity of a delivery of energy is going to be challenged."

I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forwar",2032,"Thank you, Allison, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are several executive members of team Cabot. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.
As some of you may recall, this time last year, we laid out a strategy for 2018 that was focused on: first, delivering growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share while generating positive free cash flow; secondly, generating and improving return on capital employed that exceeds our cost to capital; third, increasing our return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and fourth, maintaining a strong balance sheet to maximize financial flexibility. I'm very happy to report that we have successfully delivered on all the strategies that we had laid out for 2018. For the year, we delivered growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share of 12% and 25%, respectively. Most importantly, the company generated $297 million of free cash flow, a 92% increase relative to prior year.
I would highlight that this is the third consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation during a period in which the company generated an adjusted earnings per share CAGR in excess of 100%.
The company generated a 15.9% return on capital employed for the year, far exceeding our weighted average cost of capital and representing an improvement relative to prior year of 860 basis points. This 15.9% return on capital compares favorably to the average S&P 500 return on capital, highlighting that there is a company in the E&P sector that can in fact deliver returns that are competitive across the broad equity market.
Additionally, we exceeded our initial expectations by returning over $1 billion of capital to shareholders, including increasing our quarterly dividend twice and repurchasing over 38 million shares in 2018.
This represented over a 9% shareholder yield to equity holders. Also, we have now reduced our shares outstanding by over 9% since restarting our share repurchase program in 2017.
Lastly, we demonstrated our continued commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet by reducing debt levels of -- by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year-end debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1x. When considering the combination of cash dividends, stock repurchases and debt reduction, the company delivered a total stakeholder yield of over 12% for the year.
In addition to these highlights, we delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share by 125%.
Our results for the year demonstrate that despite the negative sentiment around the energy sector and specifically as it relates to natural gas space, Cabot is generating a compelling combination of growth, free cash flow, return on capital, return of capital, while maintaining investment-grade balance sheet. As it relates specifically to the fourth quarter of 2018, the company generated net income of $275 million or $0.64 per share, and adjusted net income of $236 million or $0.55 per share.
Cabot's cash from operating activity in the fourth quarter was $316 million, while discretionary cash flow in the fourth quarter was $493 million. Cabot also delivered $241 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2018, exceeding our previous expectation of $200 million.
All of these improvements relative to the fourth quarter of '17 were driven by higher production, stronger natural gas price realizations and a significant improvement in our cost structure. 
In fact, 2018 represented the company's lowest unit cost in history. One specific operating expense I want to highlight is the exploratory dry hole cost we incurred in the fourth quarter, resulting from unsuccessful drilling results in our second exploratory area. As a result, we do not expect to allocate any incremental capital to exploration at this time.
Let's move on to reserve discussion, Cabot reported year-end improved reserves of 11.6 trillion cubic foot equivalent, an increase of 19% over year-end 2017, despite the divestiture of our Eagle Ford property in 2018. Cabot's total company all-source finding and development cost were $0.30 per Mcfe, while our Marcellus-only all-source finding and development cost were $0.26 per Mcf. These results reaffirm our acreage position in Susquehanna County as the lowest-cost natural gas asset in North America. As many of you are aware, we tested a sample of Upper Marcellus wells during 2018 with our generation-5 completion design to further demonstrate the resource potential of this distinctive incremental reservoir. Based on the production history today, the Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells placed on production during 2018 have outperformed the average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.9 from our earlier-generation Upper Marcellus completions. To answer several questions regarding the Upper Marcellus, these results reconfirm our previous Upper Marcellus well results demonstrated, which is: While the Upper Marcellus reservoir has its own distinctive characteristics relative to the Lower Marcellus, it remains one of the most economic reservoirs in North America. Our plan is to continue to drill and complete a small sample of Upper Marcellus wells each year, to build a larger population of Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells. Once again, these results, coupled with our previous Upper Marcellus completions, have extensive production history, reconfirming our conviction on the distinct nature of this reservoir and reinforce our views on the multi-decade inventory life remaining from this world-class asset.
All right. Move to the marketing and pricing update. Much of the -- our success for the fourth quarter and full year was driven by the long-awaited addition of new takeaway capacity in the basin, demand projects that have been work -- we've been working on for years. Cabot's realized natural gas prices before hedges improved by 50% relative to the prior year comparable quarter, driven by a combination of higher NYMEX prices and a significant improvement in differentials, which came in at $0.42 below NYMEX, our lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2013. Given the exposure we now have to highly seasonal markets in the Mid-Atlantic, we expect our first quarter 2019 price realizations to be flat to or even a slight premium to NYMEX. For the full year, we still expect our weighted average differential before the impact of hedges to be $0.30. On the hedging front, we utilized the short-lived winter rally to layer in NYMEX and basis hedges, which we posted on our website this morning. We anticipate these hedges will generate over $55 million of additional revenue this year, based on the current forward curve. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering in hedges during market rallies in order to protect our anticipated free cash flow for the year.
Now I'll provide commentary for 2019. For the full year, we updated our 2019 capital budget to $800 million, resulting in production growth of 20% or 27% on a debt-adjusted per share basis. Our decision to target the lower end of our preliminary capital guidance range is the direct result of current market conditions, feedback from shareholders and the broader investment community and our continued strategic focus on returns and free cash flow over top line production growth.
We believe that we have an industry leader and -- we have been an industry leader in deemphasizing growth for the sake of it and prioritizing return of and on capital, while maximizing free cash flow. Our updated program for the year reaffirms our commitment to this philosophy and echoes our commentary from the third quarter earnings call last October.
We have certainly heard data points from the Appalachian peers that imply a more rational approach to capital allocation in 2019, and Cabot fully supports the rationalization of capital to bring stability to the market.
With that said, we have actually witnessed a slight increase in the rig count in the Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville since our call last October, meanwhile, despite early winter-related rally, the NYMEX strip remains in backwardation. While we are cautiously optimistic on the supply-demand outlook for the next 24 months, due in large part to significant demand growth and material-based declines across the U.S., we believe it is prudent for us to plan more conservatively and utilize an incremental free cash flow, resulting from higher prices for additional returns of capital to shareholders as opposed to funding additional outsized production growth. As a result, we are using a $2.75 NYMEX assumption for budgeting purposes in 2019, which is below the current strip of approximately $2.90 when taking in consideration -- account -- and account for actual NYMEX settlements for January and February.
Under this more conservative price assumption, we expect to generate between $600 million and $650 million of free cash flow, implying a 6% free cash flow yield. I would highlight this differs slightly from $650 million to $700 million of expected free cash flow that we discussed on the third quarter call, which was based on a higher NYMEX assumption of $2.85 instead of the $2.75 we are using. As we highlighted on our third quarter call, we plan to return at least 50% of this free cash flow to shareholders annually through the combination of growing dividend and share repurchase, resulting in a minimum total shareholder yield of 3%.
At $2.75 NYMEX, our 2019 program is expected to deliver between 40% and 55% growth in adjusted earnings per share and between a 21% and 23% return on capital employed. Even under a $2.50 NYMEX assumption, which some of the sell side are calling for, our program would deliver between $475 million and $525 million of free cash flow, which implies a 5% free cash flow yield at the midpoint, also, between 20% and 35% growth in adjusted earnings per share and a return on capital employed between 19% and 21%. We believe these metrics are very compelling relative to the broader equity market, especially at these trough commodity price assumptions. I think it is also important to highlight that we are going to generate this type of free cash flow while continuing to reinvest in the disciplined growth of our assets via the drill bit. We will -- we have been numerous -- excuse me, we have seen numerous 2019 budgets released across the sector that imply significant reduction in capital spending year-over-year in order to target free cash flow neutrality.
However, for some, the limited capital investment, there could be a day of reckoning in 2020. In contrast, assuming price realizations are flat to 2019, our program for 2020 is designed, first and foremost, to deliver an improving return on capital employed and to generate strong free cash flow for the 5th consecutive year from a capital program that is lower than 2019, all while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. We expect to continue to deliver growth in cash flow and earnings per share in 2020, driven by disciplined capital allocation, resulting in measured production growth. Additionally, the continued reduction in our shares outstanding, resulting from our buyback program, should further accrete per share metrics.
Our decision to be more disciplined with our capital allocation for the year and deliver more measured growth will only do so much to help balance the market. We believe it is important to send a message to investors, both energy specialists and generalists alike, that there is a company in the industry that is committed to disciplined capital allocation and has the assets that can generate a compelling combination of returns and growth in per share financial metrics, even under much lower natural gas price assumptions and a reduced capital program. In summary, I believe our strategic effort have continued to create incremental value for our shareholders as we have transformed Cabot into the lowest-cost producer in the industry, with the lowest headcount and capital intensity, the highest capital efficiency and ultimately resulting in return on capital employed, free cash flow and per share growth metrics that are not only industry-leading but also extremely competitive when compared to all other sectors across the S&P 500. So with that, Allison, I'd be more than happy to open it up to questions."

So we're doing that. On the question about backfilling. We saw contemporaneous -- with the commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise and these power plants, we saw a fairly drastic narrowing of the differential. And with that -- that improved -- not only did we have it improve by the gas that we moved on the new infrastructures and to the power plants, but that dramatic improvement in the basis also enhanced every other molecule that we were still selling into the basin. So with that uplift and the rest of our gas, we feel comfortable that maintaining that volumes we're producing and having just a measured growth by our capital allocation and allocating back some of our free cash and buying back shares and having a per share metric component to growth, we think that fits what we're trying to accomplish on improving realizations throughout not only the basin but also where we're moving gas outside of the basin."

We have a number of examples that we could give to you, but I'll give you one example that most people are not going to have any problems understanding how we have the conviction that we do. We laid 2 -- this -- recently, we laid 2 Upper Marcellus wells in an area that we had prior completions on our -- in our -- in the Lower Marcellus. And in this specific example I'll give you, we had 2 Lower Marcellus wells that had been producing for an extended period of time. We put 2 Upper Marcellus wells 400 feet, get that context, 400 feet from 2 Lower Marcellus wells that had produced a long time. And we completed those 2 Upper Marcellus wells that were 400 feet from these 2 Lower Marcellus wells. It just so happened to be the 2 Lower Marcellus wells that we chose to do this experiment on have each cum-ed over 20 Bcf. Okay, so we laid 2 Upper Marcellus wells, 400 feet from 2 wells that had cum-ed each 20 Bcf. Those Upper Marcellus wells came on normally as you might expect. The early time production from those Upper Marcellus wells have actually fit a curve. And again I'm going to caution the comment here on a curve fit with very little data, but those 2 Upper Marcellus wells came on fitting a curve of 3.3 Bcf per 1,000 and 3.7 Bcf per 1,000. I'm not saying that that's what we're going to go to. So don't take it, and I hope nobody comes and ask about what about the 3.3, 3.7 Bcf-type thousand EUR. That might be our poster child from this point forward. I'm just giving you an example of our confidence level. If there's any place we would have seen some issues, it would've been where we had produced over 40 Bcf, 400-something feet away from a couple of Upper Marcellus. So that's that soapbox commentary on that. What was the rest of your question?"

The other thing that plays into that is what is the takeaway capacity in that part of our field at this point in time? What we wouldn't want to do is do all of the lowers and the uppers and then be constrained because we wouldn't be able to get that gas to market. And while -- in addition to being the most efficient to the lowers then the uppers and come back and do the uppers later. And Dan's example right now highlights that there is no degradation when we came back. That's still the primary focus of how we're going to do it. The really only downside is the [ mob ] cost you mentioned because we're building the pads where we can come back on them and all that kind of stuff. So there's not a lot of lost efficiency. What we don't want to do is instruct Williams to put a huge pipe out there that will never be filled again after the initial production. That's just not efficient from that side of the equation. So that's kind of the dynamic. We will do some science test, like Dan highlighted earlier, where we'll do -- we got 10 or 15 that we think -- I think that's the latest number in the '19 program. We did 9 in the '18 program. We'll continue to do a few handfuls of these as part of the science project going forward. But in terms of full develop -- the full pad outside and maybe 1 or 2 for science purposes, it's still most efficient to do what we're doing."

But a couple of moving parts in the way I look at it is, one, I think it is imperative that our industry rationalize the market in a way that is prudent for all shareholders. And I think there's -- there are signs that, that rationalization is taking place, even though from October to current, there's -- seems to be more rigs working today than there were back in October. We did see in December and January, a little bit of reduction in -- at least up in the Appalachia area, a flattening or a reduction in production up in that area. So that would be helpful. But in looking at the demand side of the equation, I'm optimistic that there is going to be another 3 or 4 Bcf a day going offshore by commissioning of the LNG facilities. We're seeing incremental demand that is needed up in the -- up in New York and up in the Boston area. When utilities now in Boston are talking about not taking application for new natural gas hookups. That means that demand is increasing, and there's a need for additional natural gas up there. So I'm encouraged by incremental demand up there in that particular area. So -- and I also think that it's proven from your side of the equation, Doug, that if in fact there's reward on value and there is expectation that value would be returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks, of dividends and that's meaningful, then that is going to help assist with the market as opposed to some that keep focused on growth at the -- at all cost. And so I think all of this is part of the forward look on natural gas. But I also think that natural gas plays a role on any of the renewable footprint out there, natural gas better be part of the equation. Otherwise, your responsiveness to the insecurity of a delivery of energy is going to be challenged."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are several executive members of team Cabot. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forwar",2032,"Thank you, Allison, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are several executive members of team Cabot. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.
As some of you may recall, this time last year, we laid out a strategy for 2018 that was focused on: first, delivering growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share while generating positive free cash flow; secondly, generating and improving return on capital employed that exceeds our cost to capital; third, increasing our return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and fourth, maintaining a strong balance sheet to maximize financial flexibility. I'm very happy to report that we have successfully delivered on all the strategies that we had laid out for 2018. For the year, we delivered growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share of 12% and 25%, respectively. Most importantly, the company generated $297 million of free cash flow, a 92% increase relative to prior year.
I would highlight that this is the third consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation during a period in which the company generated an adjusted earnings per share CAGR in excess of 100%.
The company generated a 15.9% return on capital employed for the year, far exceeding our weighted average cost of capital and representing an improvement relative to prior year of 860 basis points. This 15.9% return on capital compares favorably to the average S&P 500 return on capital, highlighting that there is a company in the E&P sector that can in fact deliver returns that are competitive across the broad equity market.
Additionally, we exceeded our initial expectations by returning over $1 billion of capital to shareholders, including increasing our quarterly dividend twice and repurchasing over 38 million shares in 2018.
This represented over a 9% shareholder yield to equity holders. Also, we have now reduced our shares outstanding by over 9% since restarting our share repurchase program in 2017.
Lastly, we demonstrated our continued commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet by reducing debt levels of -- by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year-end debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1x. When considering the combination of cash dividends, stock repurchases and debt reduction, the company delivered a total stakeholder yield of over 12% for the year.
In addition to these highlights, we delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share by 125%.
Our results for the year demonstrate that despite the negative sentiment around the energy sector and specifically as it relates to natural gas space, Cabot is generating a compelling combination of growth, free cash flow, return on capital, return of capital, while maintaining investment-grade balance sheet. As it relates specifically to the fourth quarter of 2018, the company generated net income of $275 million or $0.64 per share, and adjusted net income of $236 million or $0.55 per share.
Cabot's cash from operating activity in the fourth quarter was $316 million, while discretionary cash flow in the fourth quarter was $493 million. Cabot also delivered $241 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2018, exceeding our previous expectation of $200 million.
All of these improvements relative to the fourth quarter of '17 were driven by higher production, stronger natural gas price realizations and a significant improvement in our cost structure. 
In fact, 2018 represented the company's lowest unit cost in history. One specific operating expense I want to highlight is the exploratory dry hole cost we incurred in the fourth quarter, resulting from unsuccessful drilling results in our second exploratory area. As a result, we do not expect to allocate any incremental capital to exploration at this time.
Let's move on to reserve discussion, Cabot reported year-end improved reserves of 11.6 trillion cubic foot equivalent, an increase of 19% over year-end 2017, despite the divestiture of our Eagle Ford property in 2018. Cabot's total company all-source finding and development cost were $0.30 per Mcfe, while our Marcellus-only all-source finding and development cost were $0.26 per Mcf. These results reaffirm our acreage position in Susquehanna County as the lowest-cost natural gas asset in North America. As many of you are aware, we tested a sample of Upper Marcellus wells during 2018 with our generation-5 completion design to further demonstrate the resource potential of this distinctive incremental reservoir. Based on the production history today, the Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells placed on production during 2018 have outperformed the average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.9 from our earlier-generation Upper Marcellus completions. To answer several questions regarding the Upper Marcellus, these results reconfirm our previous Upper Marcellus well results demonstrated, which is: While the Upper Marcellus reservoir has its own distinctive characteristics relative to the Lower Marcellus, it remains one of the most economic reservoirs in North America. Our plan is to continue to drill and complete a small sample of Upper Marcellus wells each year, to build a larger population of Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells. Once again, these results, coupled with our previous Upper Marcellus completions, have extensive production history, reconfirming our conviction on the distinct nature of this reservoir and reinforce our views on the multi-decade inventory life remaining from this world-class asset.
All right. Move to the marketing and pricing update. Much of the -- our success for the fourth quarter and full year was driven by the long-awaited addition of new takeaway capacity in the basin, demand projects that have been work -- we've been working on for years. Cabot's realized natural gas prices before hedges improved by 50% relative to the prior year comparable quarter, driven by a combination of higher NYMEX prices and a significant improvement in differentials, which came in at $0.42 below NYMEX, our lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2013. Given the exposure we now have to highly seasonal markets in the Mid-Atlantic, we expect our first quarter 2019 price realizations to be flat to or even a slight premium to NYMEX. For the full year, we still expect our weighted average differential before the impact of hedges to be $0.30. On the hedging front, we utilized the short-lived winter rally to layer in NYMEX and basis hedges, which we posted on our website this morning. We anticipate these hedges will generate over $55 million of additional revenue this year, based on the current forward curve. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering in hedges during market rallies in order to protect our anticipated free cash flow for the year.
Now I'll provide commentary for 2019. For the full year, we updated our 2019 capital budget to $800 million, resulting in production growth of 20% or 27% on a debt-adjusted per share basis. Our decision to target the lower end of our preliminary capital guidance range is the direct result of current market conditions, feedback from shareholders and the broader investment community and our continued strategic focus on returns and free cash flow over top line production growth.
We believe that we have an industry leader and -- we have been an industry leader in deemphasizing growth for the sake of it and prioritizing return of and on capital, while maximizing free cash flow. Our updated program for the year reaffirms our commitment to this philosophy and echoes our commentary from the third quarter earnings call last October.
We have certainly heard data points from the Appalachian peers that imply a more rational approach to capital allocation in 2019, and Cabot fully supports the rationalization of capital to bring stability to the market.
With that said, we have actually witnessed a slight increase in the rig count in the Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville since our call last October, meanwhile, despite early winter-related rally, the NYMEX strip remains in backwardation. While we are cautiously optimistic on the supply-demand outlook for the next 24 months, due in large part to significant demand growth and material-based declines across the U.S., we believe it is prudent for us to plan more conservatively and utilize an incremental free cash flow, resulting from higher prices for additional returns of capital to shareholders as opposed to funding additional outsized production growth. As a result, we are using a $2.75 NYMEX assumption for budgeting purposes in 2019, which is below the current strip of approximately $2.90 when taking in consideration -- account -- and account for actual NYMEX settlements for January and February.
Under this more conservative price assumption, we expect to generate between $600 million and $650 million of free cash flow, implying a 6% free cash flow yield. I would highlight this differs slightly from $650 million to $700 million of expected free cash flow that we discussed on the third quarter call, which was based on a higher NYMEX assumption of $2.85 instead of the $2.75 we are using. As we highlighted on our third quarter call, we plan to return at least 50% of this free cash flow to shareholders annually through the combination of growing dividend and share repurchase, resulting in a minimum total shareholder yield of 3%.
At $2.75 NYMEX, our 2019 program is expected to deliver between 40% and 55% growth in adjusted earnings per share and between a 21% and 23% return on capital employed. Even under a $2.50 NYMEX assumption, which some of the sell side are calling for, our program would deliver between $475 million and $525 million of free cash flow, which implies a 5% free cash flow yield at the midpoint, also, between 20% and 35% growth in adjusted earnings per share and a return on capital employed between 19% and 21%. We believe these metrics are very compelling relative to the broader equity market, especially at these trough commodity price assumptions. I think it is also important to highlight that we are going to generate this type of free cash flow while continuing to reinvest in the disciplined growth of our assets via the drill bit. We will -- we have been numerous -- excuse me, we have seen numerous 2019 budgets released across the sector that imply significant reduction in capital spending year-over-year in order to target free cash flow neutrality.
However, for some, the limited capital investment, there could be a day of reckoning in 2020. In contrast, assuming price realizations are flat to 2019, our program for 2020 is designed, first and foremost, to deliver an improving return on capital employed and to generate strong free cash flow for the 5th consecutive year from a capital program that is lower than 2019, all while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. We expect to continue to deliver growth in cash flow and earnings per share in 2020, driven by disciplined capital allocation, resulting in measured production growth. Additionally, the continued reduction in our shares outstanding, resulting from our buyback program, should further accrete per share metrics.
Our decision to be more disciplined with our capital allocation for the year and deliver more measured growth will only do so much to help balance the market. We believe it is important to send a message to investors, both energy specialists and generalists alike, that there is a company in the industry that is committed to disciplined capital allocation and has the assets that can generate a compelling combination of returns and growth in per share financial metrics, even under much lower natural gas price assumptions and a reduced capital program. In summary, I believe our strategic effort have continued to create incremental value for our shareholders as we have transformed Cabot into the lowest-cost producer in the industry, with the lowest headcount and capital intensity, the highest capital efficiency and ultimately resulting in return on capital employed, free cash flow and per share growth metrics that are not only industry-leading but also extremely competitive when compared to all other sectors across the S&P 500. So with that, Allison, I'd be more than happy to open it up to questions."

So we're doing that. On the question about backfilling. We saw contemporaneous -- with the commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise and these power plants, we saw a fairly drastic narrowing of the differential. And with that -- that improved -- not only did we have it improve by the gas that we moved on the new infrastructures and to the power plants, but that dramatic improvement in the basis also enhanced every other molecule that we were still selling into the basin. So with that uplift and the rest of our gas, we feel comfortable that maintaining that volumes we're producing and having just a measured growth by our capital allocation and allocating back some of our free cash and buying back shares and having a per share metric component to growth, we think that fits what we're trying to accomplish on improving realizations throughout not only the basin but also where we're moving gas outside of the basin."

We have a number of examples that we could give to you, but I'll give you one example that most people are not going to have any problems understanding how we have the conviction that we do. We laid 2 -- this -- recently, we laid 2 Upper Marcellus wells in an area that we had prior completions on our -- in our -- in the Lower Marcellus. And in this specific example I'll give you, we had 2 Lower Marcellus wells that had been producing for an extended period of time. We put 2 Upper Marcellus wells 400 feet, get that context, 400 feet from 2 Lower Marcellus wells that had produced a long time. And we completed those 2 Upper Marcellus wells that were 400 feet from these 2 Lower Marcellus wells. It just so happened to be the 2 Lower Marcellus wells that we chose to do this experiment on have each cum-ed over 20 Bcf. Okay, so we laid 2 Upper Marcellus wells, 400 feet from 2 wells that had cum-ed each 20 Bcf. Those Upper Marcellus wells came on normally as you might expect. The early time production from those Upper Marcellus wells have actually fit a curve. And again I'm going to caution the comment here on a curve fit with very little data, but those 2 Upper Marcellus wells came on fitting a curve of 3.3 Bcf per 1,000 and 3.7 Bcf per 1,000. I'm not saying that that's what we're going to go to. So don't take it, and I hope nobody comes and ask about what about the 3.3, 3.7 Bcf-type thousand EUR. That might be our poster child from this point forward. I'm just giving you an example of our confidence level. If there's any place we would have seen some issues, it would've been where we had produced over 40 Bcf, 400-something feet away from a couple of Upper Marcellus.

The other thing that plays into that is what is the takeaway capacity in that part of our field at this point in time? What we wouldn't want to do is do all of the lowers and the uppers and then be constrained because we wouldn't be able to get that gas to market. And while -- in addition to being the most efficient to the lowers then the uppers and come back and do the uppers later. And Dan's example right now highlights that there is no degradation when we came back. That's still the primary focus of how we're going to do it. The really only downside is the [ mob ] cost you mentioned because we're building the pads where we can come back on them and all that kind of stuff. So there's not a lot of lost efficiency. What we don't want to do is instruct Williams to put a huge pipe out there that will never be filled again after the initial production. That's just not efficient from that side of the equation. So that's kind of the dynamic. We will do some science test, like Dan highlighted earlier, where we'll do -- we got 10 or 15 that we think -- I think that's the latest number in the '19 program. We did 9 in the '18 program. We'll continue to do a few handfuls of these as part of the science project going forward. But in terms of full develop -- the full pad outside and maybe 1 or 2 for science purposes, it's still most efficient to do what we're doing."

But a couple of moving parts in the way I look at it is, one, I think it is imperative that our industry rationalize the market in a way that is prudent for all shareholders. And I think there's -- there are signs that, that rationalization is taking place, even though from October to current, there's -- seems to be more rigs working today than there were back in October. We did see in December and January, a little bit of reduction in -- at least up in the Appalachia area, a flattening or a reduction in production up in that area. So that would be helpful. But in looking at the demand side of the equation, I'm optimistic that there is going to be another 3 or 4 Bcf a day going offshore by commissioning of the LNG facilities. We're seeing incremental demand that is needed up in the -- up in New York and up in the Boston area. When utilities now in Boston are talking about not taking application for new natural gas hookups. That means that demand is increasing, and there's a need for additional natural gas up there. So I'm encouraged by incremental demand up there in that particular area. So -- and I also think that it's proven from your side of the equation, Doug, that if in fact there's reward on value and there is expectation that value would be returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks, of dividends and that's meaningful, then that is going to help assist with the market as opposed to some that keep focused on growth at the -- at all cost. And so I think all of this is part of the forward look on natural gas. But I also think that natural gas plays a role on any of the renewable footprint out there, natural gas better be part of the equation. Otherwise, your responsiveness to the insecurity of a delivery of energy is going to be challenged."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are several executive members of team Cabot. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forwar",2032,"Thank you, Allison, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are several executive members of team Cabot. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.
As some of you may recall, this time last year, we laid out a strategy for 2018 that was focused on: first, delivering growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share while generating positive free cash flow; secondly, generating and improving return on capital employed that exceeds our cost to capital; third, increasing our return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and fourth, maintaining a strong balance sheet to maximize financial flexibility. I'm very happy to report that we have successfully delivered on all the strategies that we had laid out for 2018. For the year, we delivered growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share of 12% and 25%, respectively. Most importantly, the company generated $297 million of free cash flow, a 92% increase relative to prior year.
I would highlight that this is the third consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation during a period in which the company generated an adjusted earnings per share CAGR in excess of 100%.
The company generated a 15.9% return on capital employed for the year, far exceeding our weighted average cost of capital and representing an improvement relative to prior year of 860 basis points. This 15.9% return on capital compares favorably to the average S&P 500 return on capital, highlighting that there is a company in the E&P sector that can in fact deliver returns that are competitive across the broad equity market.
Additionally, we exceeded our initial expectations by returning over $1 billion of capital to shareholders, including increasing our quarterly dividend twice and repurchasing over 38 million shares in 2018.
This represented over a 9% shareholder yield to equity holders. Also, we have now reduced our shares outstanding by over 9% since restarting our share repurchase program in 2017.
Lastly, we demonstrated our continued commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet by reducing debt levels of -- by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year-end debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1x. When considering the combination of cash dividends, stock repurchases and debt reduction, the company delivered a total stakeholder yield of over 12% for the year.
In addition to these highlights, we delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share by 125%.
Our results for the year demonstrate that despite the negative sentiment around the energy sector and specifically as it relates to natural gas space, Cabot is generating a compelling combination of growth, free cash flow, return on capital, return of capital, while maintaining investment-grade balance sheet. As it relates specifically to the fourth quarter of 2018, the company generated net income of $275 million or $0.64 per share, and adjusted net income of $236 million or $0.55 per share.
Cabot's cash from operating activity in the fourth quarter was $316 million, while discretionary cash flow in the fourth quarter was $493 million. Cabot also delivered $241 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2018, exceeding our previous expectation of $200 million.
All of these improvements relative to the fourth quarter of '17 were driven by higher production, stronger natural gas price realizations and a significant improvement in our cost structure. 
In fact, 2018 represented the company's lowest unit cost in history. One specific operating expense I want to highlight is the exploratory dry hole cost we incurred in the fourth quarter, resulting from unsuccessful drilling results in our second exploratory area. As a result, we do not expect to allocate any incremental capital to exploration at this time.
Let's move on to reserve discussion, Cabot reported year-end improved reserves of 11.6 trillion cubic foot equivalent, an increase of 19% over year-end 2017, despite the divestiture of our Eagle Ford property in 2018. Cabot's total company all-source finding and development cost were $0.30 per Mcfe, while our Marcellus-only all-source finding and development cost were $0.26 per Mcf. These results reaffirm our acreage position in Susquehanna County as the lowest-cost natural gas asset in North America. As many of you are aware, we tested a sample of Upper Marcellus wells during 2018 with our generation-5 completion design to further demonstrate the resource potential of this distinctive incremental reservoir. Based on the production history today, the Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells placed on production during 2018 have outperformed the average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.9 from our earlier-generation Upper Marcellus completions. To answer several questions regarding the Upper Marcellus, these results reconfirm our previous Upper Marcellus well results demonstrated, which is: While the Upper Marcellus reservoir has its own distinctive characteristics relative to the Lower Marcellus, it remains one of the most economic reservoirs in North America. Our plan is to continue to drill and complete a small sample of Upper Marcellus wells each year, to build a larger population of Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells. Once again, these results, coupled with our previous Upper Marcellus completions, have extensive production history, reconfirming our conviction on the distinct nature of this reservoir and reinforce our views on the multi-decade inventory life remaining from this world-class asset.
All right. Move to the marketing and pricing update. Much of the -- our success for the fourth quarter and full year was driven by the long-awaited addition of new takeaway capacity in the basin, demand projects that have been work -- we've been working on for years. Cabot's realized natural gas prices before hedges improved by 50% relative to the prior year comparable quarter, driven by a combination of higher NYMEX prices and a significant improvement in differentials, which came in at $0.42 below NYMEX, our lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2013. Given the exposure we now have to highly seasonal markets in the Mid-Atlantic, we expect our first quarter 2019 price realizations to be flat to or even a slight premium to NYMEX. For the full year, we still expect our weighted average differential before the impact of hedges to be $0.30. On the hedging front, we utilized the short-lived winter rally to layer in NYMEX and basis hedges, which we posted on our website this morning. We anticipate these hedges will generate over $55 million of additional revenue this year, based on the current forward curve. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering in hedges during market rallies in order to protect our anticipated free cash flow for the year.
Now I'll provide commentary for 2019. For the full year, we updated our 2019 capital budget to $800 million, resulting in production growth of 20% or 27% on a debt-adjusted per share basis. Our decision to target the lower end of our preliminary capital guidance range is the direct result of current market conditions, feedback from shareholders and the broader investment community and our continued strategic focus on returns and free cash flow over top line production growth.
We believe that we have an industry leader and -- we have been an industry leader in deemphasizing growth for the sake of it and prioritizing return of and on capital while maximizing free cash flow. Our updated program for the year reaffirms our commitment to this philosophy and echoes our commentary from the third quarter earnings call last October.
We have certainly heard data points from the Appalachian peers that imply a more rational approach to capital allocation in 2019, and Cabot fully supports the rationalization of capital to bring stability to the market.
With that said, we have actually witnessed a slight increase in the rig count in the Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville since our call last October, meanwhile, despite early winter-related rally, the NYMEX strip remains in backwardation. While we are cautiously optimistic on the supply-demand outlook for the next 24 months, due in large part to significant demand growth and material-based declines across the U.S., we believe it is prudent for us to plan more conservatively and utilize an incremental free cash flow, resulting from higher prices for additional returns of capital to shareholders as opposed to funding additional outsized production growth. As a result, we are using a $2.75 NYMEX assumption for budgeting purposes in 2019, which is below the current strip of approximately $2.90 when taking in consideration -- account -- and account for actual NYMEX settlements for January and February.
Under this more conservative price assumption, we expect to generate between $600 million and $650 million of free cash flow, implying a 6% free cash flow yield. I would highlight this differs slightly from $650 million to $700 million of expected free cash flow that we discussed on the third quarter call, which was based on a higher NYMEX assumption of $2.85 instead of the $2.75 we are using. As we highlighted on our third quarter call, we plan to return at least 50% of this free cash flow to shareholders annually through the combination of growing dividend and share repurchase, resulting in a minimum total shareholder yield of 3%.
At $2.75 NYMEX, our 2019 program is expected to deliver between 40% and 55% growth in adjusted earnings per share and between a 21% and 23% return on capital employed. Even under a $2.50 NYMEX assumption, which some of the sell side are calling for, our program would deliver between $475 million and $525 million of free cash flow, which implies a 5% free cash flow yield at the midpoint, also, between 20% and 35% growth in adjusted earnings per share and a return on capital employed between 19% and 21%. We believe these metrics are very compelling relative to the broader equity market, especially at these trough commodity price assumptions. I think it is also important to highlight that we are going to generate this type of free cash flow while continuing to reinvest in the disciplined growth of our assets via the drill bit. We will -- we have been numerous -- excuse me, we have seen numerous 2019 budgets released across the sector that imply significant reduction in capital spending year-over-year in order to target free cash flow neutrality.
However, for some, the limited capital investment, there could be a day of reckoning in 2020. In contrast, assuming price realizations are flat to 2019, our program for 2020 is designed, first and foremost, to deliver an improving return on capital employed and to generate strong free cash flow for the 5th consecutive year from a capital program that is lower than 2019, all while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. We expect to continue to deliver growth in cash flow and earnings per share in 2020, driven by disciplined capital allocation, resulting in measured production growth. Additionally, the continued reduction in our shares outstanding, resulting from our buyback program, should further accrete per share metrics.
Our decision to be more disciplined with our capital allocation for the year and deliver more measured growth will only do so much to help balance the market. We believe it is important to send a message to investors, both energy specialists and generalists alike, that there is a company in the industry that is committed to disciplined capital allocation and has the assets that can generate a compelling combination of returns and growth in per share financial metrics, even under much lower natural gas price assumptions and a reduced capital program. In summary, I believe our strategic effort have continued to create incremental value for our shareholders as we have transformed Cabot into the lowest-cost producer in the industry, with the lowest headcount and capital intensity, the highest capital efficiency and ultimately resulting in return on capital employed, free cash flow and per share growth metrics that are not only industry-leading but also extremely competitive when compared to all other sectors across the S&P 500. So with that, Allison, I'd be more than happy to open it up to questions."

So we're doing that. On the question about backfilling. We saw contemporaneous -- with the commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise and these power plants, we saw a fairly drastic narrowing of the differential. And with that -- that improved -- not only did we have it improve by the gas that we moved on the new infrastructures and to the power plants, but that dramatic improvement in the basis also enhanced every other molecule that we were still selling into the basin. So with that uplift and the rest of our gas, we feel comfortable that maintaining that volumes we're producing and having just a measured growth by our capital allocation and allocating back some of our free cash and buying back shares and having a per share metric component to growth, we think that fits what we're trying to accomplish on improving realizations throughout not only the basin but also where we're moving gas outside of the basin."

We have a number of examples that we could give to you, but I'll give you one example that most people are not going to have any problems understanding how we have the conviction that we do. We laid 2 -- this -- recently, we laid 2 Upper Marcellus wells in an area that we had prior completions on our -- in our -- in the Lower Marcellus. And in this specific example I'll give you, we had 2 Lower Marcellus wells that had been producing for an extended period of time. We put 2 Upper Marcellus wells 400 feet, get that context, 400 feet from 2 Lower Marcellus wells that had produced a long time. And we completed those 2 Upper Marcellus wells that were 400 feet from these 2 Lower Marcellus wells. It just so happened to be the 2 Lower Marcellus wells that we chose to do this experiment on have each cum-ed over 20 Bcf. Okay, so we laid 2 Upper Marcellus wells, 400 feet from 2 wells that had cum-ed each 20 Bcf. Those Upper Marcellus wells came on normally as you might expect. The early time production from those Upper Marcellus wells have actually fit a curve. And again I'm going to caution the comment here on a curve fit with very little data, but those 2 Upper Marcellus wells came on fitting a curve of 3.3 Bcf per 1,000 and 3.7 Bcf per 1,000. I'm not saying that that's what we're going to go to. So don't take it, and I hope nobody comes and ask about what about the 3.3, 3.7 Bcf-type thousand EUR. That might be our poster child from this point forward. I'm just giving you an example of our confidence level. If there's any place we would have seen some issues, it would've been where we had produced over 40 Bcf, 400-something feet away from a couple of Upper Marcellus. So that's that soapbox commentary on that. What was the rest of your question?"

The other thing that plays into that is what is the takeaway capacity in that part of our field at this point in time? What we wouldn't want to do is do all of the lowers and the uppers and then be constrained because we wouldn't be able to get that gas to market. And while -- in addition to being the most efficient to the lowers then the uppers and come back and do the uppers later. And Dan's example right now highlights that there is no degradation when we came back. That's still the primary focus of how we're going to do it. The really only downside is the [ mob ] cost you mentioned because we're building the pads where we can come back on them and all that kind of stuff. So there's not a lot of lost efficiency. What we don't want to do is instruct Williams to put a huge pipe out there that will never be filled again after the initial production. That's just not efficient from that side of the equation. So that's kind of the dynamic. We will do some science test, like Dan highlighted earlier, where we'll do -- we got 10 or 15 that we think -- I think that's the latest number in the '19 program. We did 9 in the '18 program. We'll continue to do a few handfuls of these as part of the science project going forward. But in terms of full develop -- the full pad outside and maybe 1 or 2 for science purposes, it's still most efficient to do what we're doing."

But a couple of moving parts in the way I look at it is, one, I think it is imperative that our industry rationalize the market in a way that is prudent for all shareholders. And I think there's -- there are signs that, that rationalization is taking place, even though from October to current, there's -- seems to be more rigs working today than there were back in October. We did see in December and January, a little bit of reduction in -- at least up in the Appalachia area, a flattening or a reduction in production up in that area. So that would be helpful. But in looking at the demand side of the equation, I'm optimistic that there is going to be another 3 or 4 Bcf a day going offshore by commissioning of the LNG facilities. We're seeing incremental demand that is needed up in the -- up in New York and up in the Boston area. When utilities now in Boston are talking about not taking application for new natural gas hookups. That means that demand is increasing, and there's a need for additional natural gas up there. So I'm encouraged by incremental demand up there in that particular area. So -- and I also think that it's proven from your side of the equation, Doug, that if in fact there's reward on value and there is expectation that value would be returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks, of dividends and that's meaningful, then that is going to help assist with the market as opposed to some that keep focused on growth at the -- at all cost. And so I think all of this is part of the forward look on natural gas. But I also think that natural gas plays a role on any of the renewable footprint out there, natural gas better be part of the equation. Otherwise, your responsiveness to the insecurity of a delivery of energy is going to be challenged."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter of 2019 Earnings Call. 
With me are several members of the executive team. 
I would first like to remind everyone that on this morning's call we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. 
Additionally, some of our comments with reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release. 
Cabot's shareholders have enjoyed a solid start to 2019. During the first quarter, we delivered record levels of operating cash flow, free cash flow, adjusted net income and production underpinned by the continued success from our operations in the Marcellus and our unwavering commitment to disciplined capital allocation and cost control. The first quarter net income was $263 million or $0.62 per share and adjusted net income, excluding selected items, was $3 million -- $308 million or $0.73 per share. 
This represents a 161% increase in adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $308 million, which was approximately 3.5x the amount from the prior year comparable quarter and greater than our free cash flow generated for the full year in 2018. 
For the trail -- trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 20.4% compared to 8.3% for the trailing 12 months as of the end of the prior comparable quarter, representing an increase of over 1,200 basis points. 
This ROC of over 20% exceeds the current ROC for the S&P 500 highlighting Cabot's competitive positioning relative to broader equity markets. 
Our success for the quarter was driven by higher production levels and proved realized prices and lower operating expenses. 
Production for the quarter of 2.28 billion cubic foot per day was above the high end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 21% relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Natural gas price realizations were $3.35 per Mcf, an increase of 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2018. 
Our price realizations before hedges were $0.06 below NYMEX, which was our best corporate-wide differential since the second quarter of 2013. 
Operating expenses decreased to $1.48 per Mcf, a 6% improvement relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily driven by lower direct operating expenses, DD&A and interest expense. 
Given our strong free cash flow generation during the quarter, we ended the period with over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of 0.6x, highlighting significant financial flexibility or continued return of capital to shareholders throughout the year. 
Our return of capital front, we announced a 29% increase in our dividend to $0.36 per share on an annualized basis, representing a 1.4% yield. 
This is our fourth dividend increase in the last 24 months. We expect to continue to increase our dividend methodically with an intent to grow our dividend over time to a yield that is competitive with the broader markets. 
Our free cash flow generation over the coming years will certainly be able to support this dividend growth even under significantly lower natural gas assumptions, should the lower prices occur. 
We remain fully committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year through dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, giving it is still early in the calendar year, and we have been in blackout period for the majority of the first 4 months of the year. We have not executed on any material share repurchases year-to-date. However, we fully expect to continue to reduce our shares outstanding throughout the year and have significant financial flexibility to be much more active on that front, especially, if we see a continued weakening in natural gas prices that have negatively impacted our share price. 
Moving on to our operations for the quarter. Our Marcellus production increased 25% compared to the prior year comparable quarter. During the quarter, we placed 13 wells on production, all of which were in March including 7 of the 13 wells that were current in line the last week of the month. 
We expect to place an additional 18 wells on production during the second quarter, resulting in a production guidance range for the quarter of 2.3 to 2.35 Bcf per day, or a 2% sequential increase relative to the first quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
On the pricing front, we have experienced some weakness in the natural gas forward curve as weather-related demand has dissipated in April, which is expected during the spring shoulder season. 
However, we believe there may be upside to the current price levels driven by weather-related demand this summer, that would also coincide with the potential increases in exports to Mexico and continuos strength in the demand for feed guess from LNG export facilities. 
Lastly on the production front, we are expecting a slowing of growth in the Northeast and [indiscernible], which we should be supportive for prices from a supply standpoint. 
The current strip including actual NYMEX settlement through April implies a [ $275  ] average price of the year, which is directly in line with our budgeted price. 
Based on these prices, we expect to generate over $50 million of hedging revenue for the last 3 quarters of the year. Through a combination of hedges and fixed-price deals, we have approximately 46% of our volume locked in from second quarter to fourth quarter, providing some mitigation of potential downside price risk. 
For the full year, we have reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget of $800 million, and our production growth guidance of 20% or 27% on a debt adjusted per share basis. At our [ $275  ] NYMEX budget price for the year, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share growth of 45% to 55%, return on capital employed a [ 22% to 23%  ] and free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million, implying a 6% free cash flow yield at the midpoint of the range. 
In closing, I'm proud to report one of the best quarters in Cabot's history, which is a direct result of continued operational excellence in the field, which has driven improved capital efficiency year after year, a marketing strategy that has allowed us to access new markets and significantly improve our differentials without increasing our gathering and transportation costs. A continued commitment to cost controls including divesting higher costs properties and maintaining low overhead cost and interest expense, the latter of which is supported by one of the strongest balance sheet in the industry. And lastly, as I've stated many times before, we truly feel it's paramount to our entire strategic plan, disciplined capital allocation focused on delivering strong returns on and up capital and a competitive growth in the per share metrics. Rocco, with that, more than happy to answer any questions."

So looking at what we can deliver with just those assets, managed the risk profile of it being single commodity or same jurisdiction. We're comfortable with that, we're comfortable with how we've been able to manage it, and we're comfortable with working through both the regulatory environment and the commodity price expectations that we can still deliver financial results. And when you look at long-term and assess from a board level, strategic level, Cabot has always made decisions that are I, think, beneficial to shareholders to deliver the maximum value. And any strategic decision we would make would also take that in consideration. If it's good for the shareholder, my job 1, 2 and 3 is to deliver value to the shareholder. And if it's good for the shareholder, my job is to evaluate it. So if it is strategic, it's strategic.

I just think and the Board thinks at this point in time, though maybe conservative, that representing delivery of 50% of our cash flow in broad terms including dividends and share buybacks is a messaging to The Street that we're going to do it.

I would first like to remind everyone that on this morning's call we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. 
Additionally, some of our comments with reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release. 
Cabot's shareholders have enjoyed a solid start to 2019. During the first quarter, we delivered record levels of operating cash flow, free cash flow, adjusted net income and production underpinned by the continued success from our operations in the Marcellus and our unwavering commitment to disciplined capital allocation and cost control. The first quarter net income was $263 million or $0.62 per share and adjusted net income, excluding selected items, was $3 million -- $308 million or $0.73 per share. 
This represents a 161% increase in adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $308 million, which was approximately 3.5x the amount from the prior year comparable quarter and greater than our free cash flow generated for the full year in 2018. 
For the trail -- trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 20.4% compared to 8.3% for the trailing 12 months as of the end of the prior comparable quarter, representing an increase of over 1,200 basis points. 
This ROCE of over 20% exceeds the current ROCE for the S&P 500, highlighting Cabot's competitive positioning relative to the broader equity markets. 
Our success for the quarter was driven by higher production levels, improved realized prices and lower operating expenses. 
Production for the quarter of 2.28 billion cubic foot per day was above the high-end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 21% relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Natural gas price realizations were $3.35 per Mcf, an increase of 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2018. 
Our price realizations, before hedges, were $0.06 below NYMEX, which was our best corporate-wide differential since the second quarter of 2013. 
Operating expenses decreased to $1.48 per Mcf, a 6% improvement relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily driven by lower direct operating expenses, DD&A and interest expense. 
Given our strong free cash flow generation during the quarter, we ended the period with over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of 0.6x, highlighting significant financial flexibility on continued return of capital to shareholders throughout the year. 
On the return of capital front, we announced a 29% increase in our dividend to $0.36 per share on an annualized basis, representing a 1.4% yield. 
This is our fourth dividend increase in the last 24 months. We expect to continue to increase our dividend methodically with an intent to grow our dividend over time to a yield that is competitive with the broader markets. 
Our free cash flow generation over the coming years will certainly be able to support this dividend growth, even under significantly lower natural gas assumptions, should the lower prices occur. 
We remain fully committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases, giving it is still early in the calendar year, and we have been in blackout period for the majority of the first 4 months of the year, we have not executed on any material share repurchases year-to-date. However, we fully expect to continue to reduce our shares outstanding throughout the year and have significant financial flexibility to be much more active on that front, especially, if we see a continued weakening in natural gas prices that have negatively impacted our share price. 
Moving on to our operations for the quarter. Our Marcellus production increased 25% compared to the prior year comparable quarter. During the quarter, we placed 13 wells on production, all of which were in March, including 7 of the 13 wells that were turned in line the last week of the month. 
We expect to place an additional 18 wells on production during the second quarter, resulting in a production guidance range for the quarter of 2.3 to 2.35 Bcf per day or a 2% sequential increase relative to the first quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
On the pricing front, we have experienced some weakness in the natural gas forward curve as weather-related demand has dissipated in April, which is expected during the spring shoulder season. 
However, we believe there may be upside to the current price levels driven by weather-related demand this summer that would also coincide with the potential increases in exports to Mexico and continue strength in the demand for feed gas from LNG export facilities. 
Lastly, on the production front, we are expecting a slowing of growth in the Northeast and Haynesville, which we should be supportive for prices from a supply standpoint. 
The current strip, including actual NYMEX settlement through April, implies a $2.75 average price for the year, which is directly in line with our budgeted price. 
Based on these prices, we expect to generate over $50 million of hedging revenue for the last 3 quarters of the year through a combination of hedges and fixed-price deals. We have approximately 46% of our volumes locked in from second quarter to fourth quarter, providing some mitigation of potential downside price risk. 
For the full year, we have reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget of $800 million, and our production growth guidance of 20% or 27% on a debt adjusted per share basis. At our $2.75 NYMEX budget price for the year, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share growth of 45% to 55%; return on capital employed of 22% to 23%; and free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million, implying a 6% free cash flow yield at the midpoint of the range. 
In closing, I'm proud to report one of the best quarters in Cabot's history, which is a direct result of continued operational excellence in the field, which has driven improved capital efficiency year after year, a marketing strategy that has allowed us to access new markets and significantly improve our differentials without increasing or gathering in transportation costs. A continued commitment to cost controls including divesting higher-cost properties and maintaining low overhead cost and interest expense, the latter of which is supported by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And lastly, as I've stated many times before, we truly feel it's paramount to our entire strategic plan, disciplined capital allocation focused on delivering strong returns on and of capital and a competitive growth in the per share metrics. Rocco, with that, more than happy to answer any questions."

But as prudency would necessitate, we're going to get more production before we make a firm statement on that, but we're pleased with what we're seeing, and we're continuing to drill representative wells in that section throughout this year."

We were focused on the dividend increase. We had a discussion with our Board that this is directionally where we want to go. So felt comfortable with our position on buybacks for the first quarter and laying out this dividend increase. And as we go through the year, we'll continue to have Board discussions on how we want to allocate our capital in the form of dividend increases and buybacks, but our comment and our objective of giving back a minimum 50% of our free cash flow is, I feel, certainly is going to occur before year-end."

It's going to be -- I think you'll continue to hear a lot of the chatter and expectations on the M&A side. When we look at our asset, and where -- how we're located, to your point of a single commodity, single basin, single regulator environment, it's 2-edged sword. We're there, but we're there with the, what I think is, probably the best natural gas assets in North America. I think our numbers and financials do to reflect that. 
So looking at what we can deliver with just those assets, manage the risk profile of it being single commodity or same jurisdiction. We're comfortable with that, we're comfortable with how we've been able to manage it, and we're comfortable with working through both the regulatory environment and the commodity price expectations that we can still deliver financial results. And when you look at long-term and assess from a Board level, strategic level, Cabot has always made decisions that are, I think, beneficial to shareholders to deliver the maximum value. And any strategic decision we would make would also take that in consideration. If it's good for the shareholder, my job 1, 2 and 3 is to deliver value to the shareholder. And if it's good for the shareholder, my job is to evaluate it. So if it's strategic, it's strategic. If it's doing what we're doing and that's organic growth, delivering value through dividend, increases and buybacks and organic growth with a very clean balance sheet. I think we have one of the best-looking companies on a macro level and delivery to shareholders that you can find out there with a high degree and level of consistency on delivery. So we're happy with the current we have, and again, if there's significant value enhancement in any other direction then I'm paid to look at it."

But I might add, others are going at this as well. And in the 6-county area up there, I think there's a something like 1.4 Bcf of in-basins demand added in the last 1.5 years. Of course, a lot of that was power growth. And we're continuing to get calls about additional projects up there, but on the power side. But we'll see how those play out. 
In terms of infrastructure, I'll just talk about Leidy South to begin with. Publicly you all will see a filing notice at FERC, probably in June on the project, where we completed prefiling, completed open houses to the projects moving along and see nothing at this point to move us away from the November 2021 in-service on the project. 
Talk a little bit about PennEast. I think publicly that they have said that they'll submit their DEP permit to New Jersey sometime in June. I think they also have said administratively, they are complete in Pennsylvania, so that's good. So we'll see how the DEP and therefore [ 01 ] is treated, once it's submitted. Obviously, it can be anywhere from 6 months to a year. And I believe they've stated, they'll start constructions as soon as they get that -- the final permit.

And from a council standpoint or third-party perspective, it seems to be a 2% yield on dividend, seems to be the floor when it comes to evaluating the broader market. And on the buybacks, there is the back and forth between opportunistic and just putting in a consistent program of buybacks, and what is the most effective process to employee in doing that. So -- and we have that discussion at our Board at this point in time. And again, it -- we've had free cash flow the last 3 years. We are now moving into a clear picture with just the Marcellus as our asset. 
Our predictability with again, was just last October with commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise, the certainty of the commodity space and where we think the landing point's going to be, the differences in differential in the Northeast area. We wanted to measure out and with that comfort and a clear path for a -- over a decade of being able to deliver free cash flow. 
I just think, and the Board thinks, at this point in time, though it maybe conservative, that representing delivery of 50% of our cash flow in broad terms including dividends and share buybacks is a messaging to The Street that we're going to do it, but we also say that we will get back possibly more than that. And we're comfortable right now taking a gradual step-up in the dividend increase, and we're comfortable right now just having a opportunistic messaging on buybacks. Could that change in the future? Sure it could. We talk about it every Board meeting. A little bit long-winded Brian, don't know if that answers your specifically but we do consider all aspects of how we get back capital."

Very often what we see is that the earnings trajectory is a kind of flattish as a result of this backwardation and forward curve pricing. I'm just curious if you guys are thinking in terms of growing earnings trajectory over the following years? Or maybe just keeping production moderate than offsetting the backwardation and the forward curve pricing?"

We think that is a good landing point at this stage. And with the additional give back to shareholders, we think that we will be able to attract incremental dollars from outside of a traditional energy investor and compete with the broader market. So from a design standpoint, without having issues with our -- and uncertainty attached to our program, keep in mind, we're doing this with 3 rigs and 2 frac crews, so the complications of a operation is very, very low and our results are very consistent. So we feel good about that. How we manage this financial side is along the lines that we've discussed. And we'll continue to be able to do that, again, into the next decade."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter of 2019 Earnings Call. 
With me are several members of the executive team. 
I would first like to remind everyone that on this morning's call we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. 
Additionally, some of our comments with reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release. 
Cabot's shareholders have enjoyed a solid start to 2019. During the first quarter, we delivered record levels of operating cash flow, free cash flow, adjusted net income and production underpinned by the continued success from our operations in the Marcellus and our unwavering commitment to disciplined capital allocation and cost control. The first quarter net income was $263 million or $0.62 per share and adjusted net income, excluding selected items, was $3 million -- $308 million or $0.73 per share. This represents a 161% increase in adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $308 million, which was approximately 3.5x the amount from the prior year comparable quarter and greater than our free cash flow generated for the full year in 2018. 
For the trail -- trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 20.4% compared to 8.3% for the trailing 12 months as of the end of the prior comparable quarter, representing an increase of over 1,200 basis points. 
This ROCE of over 20% exceeds the current ROCE for the S&P 500, highlighting Cabot's competitive positioning relative to the broader equity markets. 
Our success for the quarter was driven by higher production levels, improved realized prices and lower operating expenses. 
Production for the quarter of 2.28 billion cubic foot per day was above the high-end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 21% relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Natural gas price realizations were $3.35 per Mcf, an increase of 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2018. 
Our price realizations, before hedges, were $0.06 below NYMEX, which was our best corporate-wide differential since the second quarter of 2013. 
Operating expenses decreased to $1.48 per Mcf, a 6% improvement relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily driven by lower direct operating expenses, DD&A and interest expense. 
Given our strong free cash flow generation during the quarter, we ended the period with over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of 0.6x, highlighting significant financial flexibility on continued return of capital to shareholders throughout the year. 
On the return of capital front, we announced a 29% increase in our dividend to $0.36 per share on an annualized basis, representing a 1.4% yield. 
This is our fourth dividend increase in the last 24 months. We expect to continue to increase our dividend methodically with an intent to grow our dividend over time to a yield that is competitive with the broader market. 
Our free cash flow generation over the coming years will certainly be able to support this dividend growth, even under significantly lower natural gas assumptions, should the lower prices occur. 
We remain fully committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Given it is still early in the calendar year and we have been in blackout period for the majority of the first 4 months of the year, we have not executed on any material share repurchases year-to-date. However, we fully expect to continue to reduce our shares outstanding throughout the year and have significant financial flexibility to be much more active on that front, especially, if we see a continued weakening in natural gas prices that have negatively impacted our share price. 
Moving on to our operations for the quarter. Our Marcellus production increased 25% compared to the prior year comparable quarter. During the quarter, we placed 13 wells on production, all of which were in March, including 7 of the 13 wells that were turned in line the last week of the month. 
We expect to place an additional 18 wells on production during the second quarter, resulting in a production guidance range for the quarter of 2.3 to 2.35 Bcf per day or a 2% sequential increase relative to the first quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
On the pricing front, we have experienced some weakness in the natural gas forward curve as weather-related demand has dissipated in April, which is expected during the spring shoulder season. 
However, we believe there may be upside to the current price levels driven by weather-related demand this summer that would also coincide with the potential increases in exports to Mexico and continued strength in the demand for feed gas from LNG export facilities. 
Lastly, on the production front, we are expecting a slowing of growth in the Northeast and Haynesville, which we should be supportive for prices from a supply standpoint. 
The current strip, including actual NYMEX settlement through April, implies a $2.75 average price for the year, which is directly in line with our budgeted price. 
Based on these prices, we expect to generate over $50 million of hedging revenue for the last 3 quarters of the year through a combination of hedges and fixed-price deals. We have approximately 46% of our volumes locked in from second quarter to fourth quarter, providing some mitigation of potential downside price risk. 
For the full year, we have reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget of $800 million and our production growth guidance of 20% or 27% on a debt adjusted per share basis. At our $2.75 NYMEX budget price for the year, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share growth of 45% to 55%; return on capital employed of 22% to 23%; and free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million, implying a 6% free cash flow yield at the midpoint of the range. 
In closing, I'm proud to report one of the best quarters in Cabot's history, which is a direct result of continued operational excellence in the field, which has driven improved capital efficiency year after year, a marketing strategy that has allowed us to access new markets and significantly improve our differentials without increasing or gathering in transportation costs. A continued commitment to cost controls including divesting higher-cost properties and maintaining low overhead cost and interest expense, the latter of which is supported by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And lastly, as I've stated many times before, we truly feel it's paramount to our entire strategic plan, disciplined capital allocation focused on delivering strong returns on and of capital and a competitive growth in the per share metrics. Rocco, with that, more than happy to answer any questions."

So felt comfortable with our position on buybacks for the first quarter and laying out this dividend increase. And as we go through the year, we'll continue to have Board discussions on how we want to allocate our capital in the form of dividend increases and buybacks, but our comment and our objective of giving back a minimum 50% of our free cash flow is, I feel, certainly is going to occur before year-end."

It's going to be -- I think you'll continue to hear a lot of the chatter and expectations on the M&A side. When we look at our asset, and where -- how we're located, to your point of a single commodity, single basin, single regulator environment, it's 2-edged sword. We're there, but we're there with the, what I think is, probably the best natural gas assets in North America. I think our numbers and financials do reflect that. 
So looking at what we can deliver with just those assets, manage the risk profile of it being single commodity or same jurisdiction. We're comfortable with that, we're comfortable with how we've been able to manage it, and we're comfortable with working through both the regulatory environment and the commodity price expectations that we can still deliver financial results. And when you look at long-term and assess from a Board level, strategic level, Cabot has always made decisions that are, I think, beneficial to shareholders to deliver the maximum value. And any strategic decision we would make would also take that in consideration. If it's good for the shareholder, my job 1, 2 and 3 is to deliver value to the shareholder. And if it's good for the shareholder, my job is to evaluate it. So if it's strategic, it's strategic. If it's doing what we're doing and that's organic growth, delivering value through dividend, increases and buybacks and organic growth with a very clean balance sheet. I think we have one of the best-looking companies on a macro level and delivery to shareholders that you can find out there with a high degree and level of consistency on delivery. So we're happy with the current we have, and again, if there's significant value enhancement in any other direction then I'm paid to look at it."

We were out there looking very, very hard in a number of different things. Nothing to announce today of course, but I would add that we're also being very, maybe, selective in our approach. We want to find the right project, the right scale of timing. We also want to find the right project for the community, and there's just a lot of factors going into it, but we are looking around, we have a lot of leads on a lot of the prospects, I'll kind of leave it at that. 
But I might add, others are going at this as well. And in the 6-county area up there, I think there's been something like 1.4 Bcf of in-basin demand added in the last 1.5 years. Of course, a lot of that was power growth. And we're continuing to get calls about additional projects up there, but on the power side. But we'll see how those play out. 
In terms of infrastructure, I'll just talk about Leidy South to begin with. Publicly you all will see a filing notice at FERC, probably in June on the project, where we completed prefiling, completed open houses to the projects moving along and see nothing at this point to move us away from a November 2021 in-service on the project. 
Talk a little bit about PennEast. I think publicly that they have said that they'll submit their DEP permit to New Jersey sometime in June. I think they also have said administratively, they are complete in Pennsylvania, so that's good. So we'll see how the DEP and their 401 is treated, once it's submitted. Obviously, it can be anywhere from 6 months to a year. And I believe they've stated, they'll start constructions as soon as they get that -- the final permit. That's about it on the project side at this point."

There are some that say go ahead and get it -- ratchet it up to the level that you would want it to be. And from a council standpoint or third-party perspective, it seems to be a 2% yield on dividend, seems to be the floor when it comes to evaluating the broader market. And on the buybacks, there is the back and forth between opportunistic and just putting in a consistent program of buybacks, and what is the most effective process to employee in doing that. So -- and we have that discussion at our Board at this point in time. And again, it -- we've had free cash flow the last 3 years. We are now moving into a clear picture with just the Marcellus as our asset. 
Our predictability with again, was just last October with commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise, the certainty of the commodity space and where we think the landing point's going to be, the differences in differential in the Northeast area. We wanted to measure out and with that comfort and a clear path for a -- over a decade of being able to deliver free cash flow. 
I just think, and the Board thinks, at this point in time, though it may be conservative, that representing delivery of 50% of our cash flow in broad terms including dividends and share buybacks is a messaging to The Street that we're going to do it, but we also say that we will get back possibly more than that. And we're comfortable right now taking a gradual step-up in the dividend increase, and we're comfortable right now just having a opportunistic messaging on buybacks. Could that change in the future? Sure it could. We talk about it every Board meeting. A little bit long-winded Brian, don't know if that answers your specifically but we do consider all aspects of how we get back capital."

But in that combination, I do think there is a likelihood that there will be a little bit less activity as we move forward at the levels that it's at right now."

Obviously, in 2019, Cabot has outsized growth just because of the timing of that fill of the new projects, but a more moderate growth profile going into the future is what's -- is Cabot's plan at this point in time. We will defend market shares, we've said before, if we see the industry starting to backfill those in any great way.

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter of 2019 Earnings Call. 
With me are several members of the executive team. 
I would first like to remind everyone that on this morning's call we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. 
Additionally, some of our comments with reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release. 
Cabot's shareholders have enjoyed a solid start to 2019. During the first quarter, we delivered record levels of operating cash flow, free cash flow, adjusted net income and production underpinned by the continued success from our operations in the Marcellus and our unwavering commitment to disciplined capital allocation and cost control. The first quarter net income was $263 million or $0.62 per share and adjusted net income, excluding selected items, was $3 million -- $308 million or $0.73 per share. This represents a 161% increase in adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $308 million, which was approximately 3.5x the amount from the prior year comparable quarter and greater than our free cash flow generated for the full year in 2018. 
For the trail -- trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 20.4% compared to 8.3% for the trailing 12 months as of the end of the prior comparable quarter, representing an increase of over 1,200 basis points. 
This ROCE of over 20% exceeds the current ROCE for the S&P 500, highlighting Cabot's competitive positioning relative to the broader equity markets. 
Our success for the quarter was driven by higher production levels, improved realized prices and lower operating expenses. 
Production for the quarter of 2.28 billion cubic foot per day was above the high-end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 21% relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Natural gas price realizations were $3.35 per Mcf, an increase of 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2018. 
Our price realizations, before hedges, were $0.06 below NYMEX, which was our best corporate-wide differential since the second quarter of 2013. 
Operating expenses decreased to $1.48 per Mcf, a 6% improvement relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily driven by lower direct operating expenses, DD&A and interest expense. 
Given our strong free cash flow generation during the quarter, we ended the period with over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of 0.6x, highlighting significant financial flexibility on continued return of capital to shareholders throughout the year. 
On the return of capital front, we announced a 29% increase in our dividend to $0.36 per share on an annualized basis, representing a 1.4% yield. 
This is our fourth dividend increase in the last 24 months. We expect to continue to increase our dividend methodically with an intent to grow our dividend over time to a yield that is competitive with the broader market. 
Our free cash flow generation over the coming years will certainly be able to support this dividend growth, even under significantly lower natural gas assumptions, should the lower prices occur. 
We remain fully committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Given it is still early in the calendar year and we have been in blackout period for the majority of the first 4 months of the year, we have not executed on any material share repurchases year-to-date. However, we fully expect to continue to reduce our shares outstanding throughout the year and have significant financial flexibility to be much more active on that front, especially, if we see a continued weakening in natural gas prices that have negatively impacted our share price. 
Moving on to our operations for the quarter. Our Marcellus production increased 25% compared to the prior year comparable quarter. During the quarter, we placed 13 wells on production, all of which were in March, including 7 of the 13 wells that were turned in line the last week of the month. 
We expect to place an additional 18 wells on production during the second quarter, resulting in a production guidance range for the quarter of 2.3 to 2.35 Bcf per day or a 2% sequential increase relative to the first quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
On the pricing front, we have experienced some weakness in the natural gas forward curve as weather-related demand has dissipated in April, which is expected during the spring shoulder season. 
However, we believe there may be upside to the current price levels driven by weather-related demand this summer that would also coincide with the potential increases in exports to Mexico and continued strength in the demand for feed gas from LNG export facilities. 
Lastly, on the production front, we are expecting a slowing of growth in the Northeast and Haynesville, which we should be supportive for prices from a supply standpoint. 
The current strip, including actual NYMEX settlement through April, implies a $2.75 average price for the year, which is directly in line with our budgeted price. 
Based on these prices, we expect to generate over $50 million of hedging revenue for the last 3 quarters of the year through a combination of hedges and fixed-price deals. We have approximately 46% of our volumes locked in from second quarter to fourth quarter, providing some mitigation of potential downside price risk. 
For the full year, we have reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget of $800 million and our production growth guidance of 20% or 27% on a debt adjusted per share basis. At our $2.75 NYMEX budget price for the year, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share growth of 45% to 55%; return on capital employed of 22% to 23%; and free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million, implying a 6% free cash flow yield at the midpoint of the range. 
In closing, I'm proud to report one of the best quarters in Cabot's history, which is a direct result of continued operational excellence in the field, which has driven improved capital efficiency year after year, a marketing strategy that has allowed us to access new markets and significantly improve our differentials without increasing or gathering in transportation costs. A continued commitment to cost controls including divesting higher-cost properties and maintaining low overhead cost and interest expense, the latter of which is supported by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And lastly, as I've stated many times before, we truly feel it's paramount to our entire strategic plan, disciplined capital allocation focused on delivering strong returns on and of capital and a competitive growth in the per share metrics. Rocco, with that, more than happy to answer any questions."

And as we go through the year, we'll continue to have Board discussions on how we want to allocate our capital in the form of dividend increases and buybacks, but our comment and our objective of giving back a minimum 50% of our free cash flow is, I feel, certainly is going to occur before year-end."

It's going to be -- I think you'll continue to hear a lot of the chatter and expectations on the M&A side. When we look at our asset, and where -- how we're located, to your point of a single commodity, single basin, single regulator environment, it's 2-edged sword. We're there, but we're there with the, what I think is, probably the best natural gas assets in North America. I think our numbers and financials do reflect that. 
So looking at what we can deliver with just those assets, manage the risk profile of it being single commodity or same jurisdiction. We're comfortable with that, we're comfortable with how we've been able to manage it, and we're comfortable with working through both the regulatory environment and the commodity price expectations that we can still deliver financial results. And when you look at long-term and assess from a Board level, strategic level, Cabot has always made decisions that are, I think, beneficial to shareholders to deliver the maximum value. And any strategic decision we would make would also take that in consideration. If it's good for the shareholder, my job 1, 2 and 3 is to deliver value to the shareholder. And if it's good for the shareholder, my job is to evaluate it. So if it's strategic, it's strategic. If it's doing what we're doing and that's organic growth, delivering value through dividend, increases and buybacks and organic growth with a very clean balance sheet. I think we have one of the best-looking companies on a macro level and delivery to shareholders that you can find out there with a high degree and level of consistency on delivery. So we're happy with the current we have, and again, if there's significant value enhancement in any other direction then I'm paid to look at it."

We were out there looking very, very hard in a number of different things. Nothing to announce today of course, but I would add that we're also being very, maybe, selective in our approach. We want to find the right project, the right scale of timing. We also want to find the right project for the community, and there's just a lot of factors going into it, but we are looking around, we have a lot of leads on a lot of the prospects, I'll kind of leave it at that. 
But I might add, others are going at this as well. And in the 6-county area up there, I think there's been something like 1.4 Bcf of in-basin demand added in the last 1.5 years. Of course, a lot of that was power growth. And we're continuing to get calls about additional projects up there, but on the power side. But we'll see how those play out. 
In terms of infrastructure, I'll just talk about Leidy South to begin with. Publicly you all will see a filing notice at FERC, probably in June on the project, where we completed prefiling, completed open houses to the projects moving along and see nothing at this point to move us away from a November 2021 in-service on the project. 
Talk a little bit about PennEast. I think publicly that they have said that they'll submit their DEP permit to New Jersey sometime in June. I think they also have said administratively, they are complete in Pennsylvania, so that's good. So we'll see how the DEP and their 401 is treated, once it's submitted. Obviously, it can be anywhere from 6 months to a year. And I believe they've stated, they'll start constructions as soon as they get that -- the final permit.

And on the buybacks, there is the back and forth between opportunistic and just putting in a consistent program of buybacks, and what is the most effective process to employee in doing that. So -- and we have that discussion at our Board at this point in time. And again, it -- we've had free cash flow the last 3 years. We are now moving into a clear picture with just the Marcellus as our asset. 
Our predictability with again, was just last October with commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise, the certainty of the commodity space and where we think the landing point's going to be, the differences in differential in the Northeast area. We wanted to measure out and with that comfort and a clear path for a -- over a decade of being able to deliver free cash flow. 
I just think, and the Board thinks, at this point in time, though it may be conservative, that representing delivery of 50% of our cash flow in broad terms including dividends and share buybacks is a messaging to The Street that we're going to do it, but we also say that we will get back possibly more than that. And we're comfortable right now taking a gradual step-up in the dividend increase, and we're comfortable right now just having a opportunistic messaging on buybacks. Could that change in the future? Sure it could. We talk about it every Board meeting. A little bit long-winded Brian, don't know if that answers your specifically but we do consider all aspects of how we get back capital."

Obviously, in 2019, Cabot has outsized growth just because of the timing of that fill of the new projects, but a more moderate growth profile going into the future is what's -- is Cabot's plan at this point in time. We will defend market shares, we've said before, if we see the industry starting to backfill those in any great way.

There is no macro push or push from the peers for us to change our growth profile in any way at this point in time. And it reinforces our discipline and our capital allocation at this point."

I'd first like to remind everyone that this --",1524,"Thank you, Chad, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter 2019 earnings call. 
As usual, joining me today on the call are several members of Cabot's management team. I'd first like to remind everyone that this -- is on this call, this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reflect and refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are provided in this morning's earnings release. 
During the second quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic goals, and I'll list them: Generating positive free cash flow; returning capital to shareholders; improving return on capital employed; delivering growth per debt adjusted share; and maintaining low leverage. 
All of this was achieved despite lower NYMEX process during the quarter, which we treated the levels the industry has not experience since the second quarter of 2016. 
Second quarter net income was $181 million $0.43 per share and adjusted net income, excluding selected items, was $151 million or [ 36% ] per share. This represents 177% increase on adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $73 million compared to free cash flow deficit of $62 million in the prior year comparable quarter. We have now delivered positive free cash flow for 12 of the last 13 quarters. 
Year-to-date, we have generated $381 million of positive free cash flow, and we are on track to deliver between $500 million and $625 million of positive free cash flow for the full year based on an average NYMEX price assumption range of $260 million to $280 million. For the trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 23.5% compared to 8.5% for the trailing 12 months as of the end of the prior comparable quarter, representing an increase of approximately 1,500 basis points. 
The improvement in our financial metrics relative to prior year comparable quarter was driven by higher production levels, improved realized prices and lower operating expenses. 
Production for the quarter of 2.35 Bcf per day was at the high-end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 24% relative to prior year comparable quarter. 
Natural gas price realizations were $2.27 per Mcf, an increase of 6% when compared to the second quarter of '18. 
Price realizations, before hedges, were $0.44 below NYMEX, an improvement of $0.24 compared to the prior year comparable quarter. 
Operating expenses decreased to $1.41 per Mcf, a 24% improvement relative to the second quarter of 2018, which was primarily driven by lower exploration expenses, resulting from our decision to cease capital allocation for exploration projects at the end of 2018. 
As of the end of second quarter, our balance sheet remained one of the best in the industry with over $241 million of cash on hand and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 0.6x. 
During second quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares at a weighted average sub-share price of $24.63, reducing our shares outstanding to $418.4 million. 
This represents a 10% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017. 
This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors have authorized an increase in the shares repurchase program by 25 million shares, bringing the current remaining authorization to 31.5 million shares or approximately 8% of our outstanding shares. 
Our year-to-date share repurchases, coupled with our anticipated dividend payments for the full year, already implies a return of 50% of our anticipated free cash flow for the year at the midpoint of our NYMEX price assumption range. 
However, given the continued share price weakness we experienced during the second quarter of trading blackout period, we expect to continue to be active on opportunistic share repurchases in the second half of the year, while still preserving some cash on the balance sheet to support future return of capital to shareholders. 
For the full year, we have adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to a range of 16% to 18% or 24% to 26% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis. 
For the most part, this small guidance adjustment is simply a change in our operating plan that will increase the average lateral length on an 8-well pad we began drilling in the second quarter from 8,950 feet laterals to 12,450 feet, resulting in an additional 140 completed stages for the year. Frankly, this decision was not too difficult. I would ask, if you could put yourself in my shoes, do you want to purchase this offset acreage, slightly delay our turn in line date and add over 100 Bcf plus to these 8 wells or do we remain on our schedule? I took the slight delay in the 100 Bcf. 
Our update -- actually additionally, as it relates to absolute third quarter growth figures, we further risked these volumes for potential market conditions. Specifically, the last couple of years, the third quarter has been softness period of realizations and it could happen again. So we have decided to maintain maximum flexibility to manage the pace and payments of our current in line. On our 2019 capital program, the range of $800 million to $820 million reflects the incremental drilling and completion activity from longer laterals of this 8-well pad. In addition, we plan to drill an additional 4 net wells resulting from continued efficiency gains that are generating fast-growing times year-to-date than originally forecasted. 
We are firmly committed to disciplined capital spending, however, our rigs are fully contracted to the end of the year. So we made the decision to drill the 4 additional wells as opposed to incurring day rates on idle rigs at the end of the year. 
Given we now have 7 months of actual NYMEX settlements year-to-date, we tighten our NYMEX price assumption range for the full year [ $260 million to $280 million ] based on this range of NYMEX prices, we expect to $500 million to $625 million of positive free cash flow; 20% to 24% return on capital employed; and a 38% to 56% growth in adjusted earnings per share. 
Given the amount of questions we have received over the past few months regarding our plans for 2020, we decided to issue preliminary 2020 guidance earlier than usual. There is still a number of variables that will become better understood as we get closer to year-end and may impact our 2020 plans, including storage levels, NYMEX futures at year-end and the results of our annual service cost negotiations. 
However, based on our current outlook for the year, we believe this preliminary plan provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed and growth per share metrics in a lower natural gas price environment. 
Our 2020 operating plan is expected to deliver 5% production growth or 7% to 8% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis from a preliminary capital budget range of 7 20 to 7 25. This does include a 5% exit-to-exit growth rate in 2020. 
Visited NYMEX price of $2.50 this program is expected to deliver $375 million to $400 million of free cash flow, a return on capital employed of approximately 15%. At [ 275 ] NYMEX, these metrics increased to $525 million to $550 million of free cash flow and a gross fee of approximately 20%. 
Under both NYMEX passes assumptions, we expect to continue to deliver annual dividend growth and opportunistic buyback stock, while maintaining a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 1 turn. 
Not only do believe there is more moderate growth program is the appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020, but we also believe this is the best strategy for the company longer term, given the current outlook for supply growth over the coming years. 
Our plan for single mid-single-digit growth of top line production can result in high single-digit growth in metrics per debt adjusted share as a result of improving comp structure, a reduction in shares outstanding, resulting from an active share repurchase program, and a reduction in our absolute debt levels at -- as maturities come due over the next couple of years. 
At the risk of stating the obvious, we're all aware of the materials and presentation piling on the state of the macro environment across the sector. We believe that investors and analysts are correct and that we need to continue to be laser-focused on free cash flow generation rather than production growth for its own site, particularly given the outlook for future supply growth for both oil and gas. Going forward, we see absolutely no rationale for continuing to chase double-digit production growth when supply growth could outpace expected demand growth at this time. 
We can guarantee that Cabot will continue to deliver on its track record of disciplined capital allocation, focused on generating positive free cash flow, improving results on and of capital, delivering economic pressure growth and maintaining an ironclad balance sheet. [indiscernible] with that, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions."

We moved some vis-à-vis turn-in-line wells out and production might not be where it is on a near-term basis. 
But it's difficult, particularly on a company that is producing approaching 3 Bcf a day. And we're managing that care is, if you will, that growth with 3 rigs and 2 frac crews. So as you bring on a pad or 2, you look at the lumpiness that might occur on any given quarter, any 2 quarters, for that matter. You add into that a soft price out there that we're seeing and the timing of bringing on a pad is a conscious decision for us. 
And also the cadence of how we bring on a pad, i.e., do we bring it on as we typically might with more flush production? Or do we just slowly much, much slowly -- slower bring it on? And that has an effect. 
Particularly if you have a pad that you may be forecast back win and that pad was forecast to be $200 million, $250 million cubic feet a day. 
It doesn't take a lot of days or a slide in the schedule to affect -- how it affects your program. As an example so we decided to delete this program -- bringing on a pad that had the expectation in our forecast for 4 days. 
All right? While it doesn't seem like a lot, but that's a Bcf of production. So it shows up, particularly if you look at it so granularly in a quarterly perspective. So the numbers that are out there right now, I would caution that you ought to -- and our program, you all with the grain of salt. We're very comfortable with the efficiency of our program. The results are wells. We haven't seen fall offs on any of our averages that we anticipate. So we're comfortable there. As far as a budgeting process, we always add a expectation of service cost increases into our projections. 
We always do that just as a matter of course, and that gives us a little bit of room. This is no exception. If -- and that's what you see. However, I would make the statement that in light of where the current strip price is, macro environment is, I would be -- we're going to be looking at that service cost very diligently to see what it's going to take for annual service providers to join Cabot's team. 
We're -- and I'll add that we're very pleased with every provider we have out there to date. Efficient operations and they are part of the team. But we have, again, arrived, as I mentioned, into a pricing environment on pricing that we haven't seen going back to 2016.

We're trying to thread the needle on what is the best learning spot in this environment. We think it is absolutely wrong for Cabot to go out and be double digits or grow into this market.

So we're not really -- was closing here is over that type of number. I think casual looking at try to needle here. We have the luxury of doing that. We can invest in the long term value-creation of the business that continuing to grow production in a modest way up especially, on a per share basis in a responsible way still generate free cash flow to [ $250 million ] which are obviously most others cannot do. So we thing is about balancing both long term value-creation to continue to invest in the business but also making sure that we have ample amounts of free cash flow to continue to return to shareholders. Keep in mind, we also have cash on the balance sheet that could go back to shareholders and we still have a nonporous it in a pipeline and trust that we do monetize also mentally to shareholders.

As usual, joining me today on the call are several members of Cabot's management team. I'd first like to remind everyone that this -- on this call this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reflect and refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.
During the second quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic goals of, and I'll list them: Generating positive free cash flow, returning capital to shareholders, improving return on capital employed, delivering growth per debt adjusted share and maintaining low leverage.
All of this was achieved despite lower NYMEX prices during the quarter, which retreated to levels the industry has not experienced since the second quarter of 2016.
Second quarter net income was $181 million or $0.43 per share and adjusted net income, excluding selected items, was $151 million or $0.36 per share. This represents 177% increase on adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter.
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $73 million compared to free cash flow deficit of $62 million in the prior year comparable quarter. We have now delivered positive free cash flow for 12 of the last 13 quarters.
Year-to-date, we have generated $381 million of positive free cash flow, and we are on track to deliver between $500 million and $625 million of positive free cash flow for the full year based on an average NYMEX price assumption range of $2.60 to $2.80. For the trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 23.5% compared to 8.5% for the trailing 12 months as of the end of prior year comparable quarter, representing an increase of approximately 1,500 basis points.
The improvement in our financial metrics relative to prior year comparable quarter was driven by higher production levels, improved realized prices and lower operating expenses.
Production for the quarter of 2.35 Bcf per day was at the high end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 24% relative to prior year comparable quarter. Natural gas price realizations were $2.27 per Mcf, an increase of 6% when compared to the second quarter of '18. And price realizations, before hedges, were $0.44 below NYMEX, an improvement of $0.24 compared to the prior year comparable quarter.
Operating expenses decreased to $1.41 per Mcf, a 24% improvement relative to the second quarter of 2018, which was primarily driven by lower exploration expenses resulting from our decision to cease capital allocation to exploration projects at the end of 2018.
As of the end of second quarter, our balance sheet remain one of the best in the industry with over $241 million of cash on hand and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 0.6x.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares at a weighted average share price of $24.63, reducing our shares outstanding to $418.4 million. This represents a 10% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017.
This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors have authorized an increase in the shares repurchase program by 25 million shares, bringing the current remaining authorization to 31.5 million shares or approximately 8% of our outstanding shares.
Our year-to-date share repurchases, coupled with our anticipated dividend payments for the full year, already implies a return of 50% of our anticipated free cash flow for the year at the midpoint of our NYMEX price assumption range. However, given the continued share price weakness we experienced during the second quarter trading blackout period, we expect to continue to be active on opportunistic share repurchases in the second half of the year, while still preserving some cash on the balance sheet to support future return of capital to shareholders.
For the full year, we have adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to a range of 16% to 18% or 24% to 26% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis.
For the most part, this small guidance adjustment is simply a change in our operating plan that will increase the average lateral length on an 8-well pad we began drilling in the second quarter from 8,950 feet laterals to 12,450 feet, resulting in an additional 140 completed stages for the year. Frankly, this decision was not too difficult. I was asked, and you can put yourself in my shoes, do you want to purchase this offset acreage, slightly delay our turn-in-line date and add over 100 Bcf plus to these 8 wells or do we remain on our schedule? I took the slight delay and the 100 Bcf.
Our up date -- actually additionally, as it relates to absolute third quarter growth figures, we further risk these volumes for potential market conditions. Specifically, the last couple of years, the third quarter has been softest period for realizations and it could happen again. So we have decided to maintain maximum flexibility to manage the pace and cadence of our turn-in-line. On our 2019 capital program, the range of $800 million to $820 million reflects the incremental drilling and completion activity from the long laterals of this 8-well pad. In addition, we plan to drill an additional 4 net wells resulting from continued efficiency gains that are generating faster drilling times year-to-date than originally forecasted.
We're firmly committed to disciplined capital spending; however, our rigs are fully contracted through the end of the year so we made the decision to drill 4 additional wells as opposed to incurring day rates on idle rigs at the end of the year.
Given we now have 7 months of actual NYMEX settlements year-to-date, we tightened our NYMEX price assumption range for the full year to $2.60 to $2.80. Based on this range of NYMEX prices, we expect to deliver $500 million to $625 million of positive free cash flow, 20% to 24% return on capital employed and a 38% to 56% growth in adjusted earnings per share.
Given the amount of questions we have received over the past few months regarding our plans for 2020, we decided to issue preliminary 2020 guidance earlier than usual. There are still a number of variables that will become better understood as we get closer to year-end and may impact our 2020 plans, including storage levels, NYMEX futures at year-end and the results of our annual service cost negotiations. However, based on our current outlook for the year, we believe this preliminary plan provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed and growth per share metrics in a lower natural gas price environment.
Our 2020 operating plan is expected to deliver 5% production growth or 7% to 8% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis from a preliminary capital budget range of $720 million (sic) [ $700 million ] to $725 million. This does include a 5% exit-to-exit growth rate in 2020.
At our budgeted NYMEX price of $2.50, this program is expected to deliver $375 million to $400 million of free cash flow, a return on capital employed of approximately 15%. At $2.75 NYMEX, these metrics increase to $525 million to $550 million of free cash flow and a ROCE of approximately 20%.
Under both NYMEX price assumptions, we expect to continue to deliver annual dividend growth and opportunistic buyback of stock while maintaining a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 1 turn.
Not only do we believe this more moderate growth program is the appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020, but we also believe this is the best strategy for the company longer term, given the current outlook for supply growth over the coming years.
Our plan for single -- mid-single-digit growth of top line production can result in high single digit growth in metrics per debt adjusted share as a result of improving cost structure, a reduction in shares outstanding resulting from an active share repurchase program and a reduction in our absolute debt levels at -- as maturities come due over the next couple of years.
At the risk of stating the obvious, we're all aware of the materials and presentation opining on the state of the macro environment across the sector. We believe that investors, industry analysts are correct and that we need to continue to be laser-focused on free cash flow generation rather than production growth for its own site, particularly given the outlook for future supply growth for both oil and gas. Going forward, we see absolutely no rationale for continuing to chase double digit production growth when supply growth could outpace expected demand growth at this time.
We can guarantee that Cabot will continue to deliver on its track record of disciplined capital allocation, focused on generating positive free cash flow, improving results on and of capital, delivering economic per share growth and maintaining an ironclad balance sheet.
Chuck, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

I will say that we're also evaluating a number of opportunities in the interstate capacity markets. We've gotten -- it's getting better and better from that regard.

We've given our numbers at a $2.50 NYMEX price and what we can deliver with that, free cash flow, buying back shares, a good double digit return on capital employed, dividend. So we're in good shape.

We moved some of these turn-in-line wells out and production might not be where it is on a near-term basis. But it's difficult, particularly on a company that is producing approaching 3 Bcf a day and we're managing that cadence, if you will, that growth with 3 rigs and 2 frac crews. So as you bring on a pad or 2, you look at the lumpiness that might occur on any given quarter or any 2 quarters for that matter. You add into that a soft price out there that we're seeing and the timing of bringing on a pad is a conscious decision for us. And also the cadence of how we'd bring on a pad i.e., do we bring it on as we typically might with more flush production or do we just slowly, much, much slowly -- slower bring it on? And that has an effect.
Particularly if you have a pad that you may be forecast back win and that pad was forecast to be 200 million, 250 million cubic feet a day, it doesn't take a lot of days or a slide in the schedule to effect how it affects your program. As an example, so we decided to delay this program -- bringing on a pad that had that expectation in our forecast for 4 days. All right? Well, it doesn't seem like a lot, but that's a Bcf of production. So it shows up, particularly if you look at it so granularly in a quarterly perspective. So the numbers that are out there right now, I would caution that you got to -- and our program [ you got to take it ] with a grain of salt. We're very comfortable with the efficiency of our program, the results of our wells. We haven't seen fall-off on any of our averages that we anticipate. So we're comfortable there. As far as a budgeting process, we always add a expectation of service cost increases into our projections.
We always do that just as a matter of course and that gives us a little bit of room. This is no exception. If -- and that's what you see. However, I would make this statement that in light of where the current strip price is -- macro environment is, I would be -- we're going to be looking at the service cost very diligently to see what it's going to take for annual service providers to join Cabot's team.
We're -- and I'll add that we're very pleased with every provider we have out there to date, efficient operations and they are part of the team. But we have, again, arrived, as I mentioned, into a pricing environment on prices that we haven't seen going back to 2016.

That there's about $50 million there that goes into certain projects we're working on, whether it's from compression, whether it's buying new water trucks for our service subsidiary, whether it's some lease acquisition as we start having some land exploration. So obviously, the D&C capital is going to be significantly lower than that $700 million to $725 million that we've talked about. And yes, I do expect to see a moderation in base declines as we move into 2020 and 2021, which would presumably result in lower maintenance capital in the out years."

We're looking at some pad level, well level compression projects that ultimately are 100% plus type IRR projects because they allow us to see production uplifts.
But ultimately, 11 years into the program, when you're producing out of $650 million to $700 million wells -- 650 to 700 producing wells, you're just going to have ongoing capital that's outside of your drilling and completion program.

If we wanted to continue to hold that level flat going into 2021, our expectation would be that maintenance capital would probably be $40 million to $50 million, even lighter than the 2020 levels because you are going to have a more moderated base decline. Now obviously our plan would hopefully be if we can get a little bit support from the macro environment to not just hold levels flat and obviously our plan for the year already assumes a 5% exit-to-exit growth rate and so presumably if you are growing over time to 3 Bcf, 3.5 Bcf, whatever the number is, ultimately, at that level, yes, we'll have a higher maintenance capital amount but it will be off of a much higher base of production and obviously will result in much higher free cash flow levels."

We have many sensitivities on how we would guide on our growth. The supply-side has grown rapidly. There is all kinds of discussions every single day out there about what the industry ought to do in regard to the supply-demand match. And as I've stated in my notes, I fully support the comments that I'm hearing out there that we have enough supply today. And that Cabot is going to do what is necessary to deliver the best return to its shareholders and part of that equation is to land in a production spot whether it's just flat production or if it is a small growth with the commodity price we're using in 2020 case, the $2.50. We're trying to thread the needle on what is the best landing spot in this environment. We think it is absolutely wrong for Cabot to go out and be double digits or grow into this market. And with the 3 rigs and 2 frac crews, we're kind of throttled back about as far as we can get, and it's kind of that 5% number. If we go to a straight maintenance then maybe we don't have 3 frac crew -- I mean, 3 rigs the entire year. Maybe the 2 frac crews are too many for the entire year, but that's the balance and the tweaking that we tried to try and to manage. And the reset for Cabot and what we look at, what's good for our shareholders is that we're not going to grow as much as we could."

We can invest in the long-term value-creation of the business by continuing to grow production in a modest way and especially on a per share basis in a responsible way, but still generate free cash flow at $2.50, which obviously most others cannot do. So we think it's about balancing both long-term value-creation through continuing to invest in the business, but also making sure that we have ample amounts of free cash flow to continue to return to shareholders. Keep in mind, we also have cash on the balance sheet that could go back to shareholders and we still have a noncore asset in a pipeline interest that we could monetize and also incrementally return to shareholders.

As usual, joining me today on the call are several members of Cabot's management team. I'd first like to remind everyone that this -- on this call this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reflect and refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are provided in this morning's earnings release.
During the second quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic goals of, and I'll list them: Generating positive free cash flow, returning capital to shareholders, improving return on capital employed, delivering growth per debt adjusted share and maintaining low leverage.
All of this was achieved despite lower NYMEX prices during the quarter, which retreated to levels the industry has not experienced since the second quarter of 2016.
Second quarter net income was $181 million or $0.43 per share and adjusted net income, excluding selected items, was $151 million or $0.36 per share. This represents 177% increase on adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter.
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $73 million compared to free cash flow deficit of $62 million in the prior year comparable quarter. We have now delivered positive free cash flow for 12 of the last 13 quarters.
Year-to-date, we have generated $381 million of positive free cash flow, and we are on track to deliver between $500 million and $625 million of positive free cash flow for the full year based on an average NYMEX price assumption range of $2.60 to $2.80. For the trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 23.5% compared to 8.5% for the trailing 12 months as of the end of prior year comparable quarter, representing an increase of approximately 1,500 basis points.
The improvement in our financial metrics relative to prior year comparable quarter was driven by higher production levels, improved realized prices and lower operating expenses.
Production for the quarter of 2.35 Bcf per day was at the high end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 24% relative to prior year comparable quarter. Natural gas price realizations were $2.27 per Mcf, an increase of 6% when compared to the second quarter of '18. And price realizations before hedges, were $0.44 below NYMEX, an improvement of $0.24 compared to the prior year comparable quarter.
Operating expenses decreased to $1.41 per Mcf, a 24% improvement relative to the second quarter of 2018, which was primarily driven by lower exploration expenses resulting from our decision to cease capital allocation to exploration projects at the end of 2018.
As of the end of the second quarter, our balance sheet remained one of the best in the industry with over $241 million of cash on hand and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 0.6x.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares at a weighted average share price of $24.63, reducing our shares outstanding to $418.4 million. This represents a 10% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017.
This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors have authorized an increase in the shares repurchase program by 25 million shares, bringing the current remaining authorization to 31.5 million shares or approximately 8% of our outstanding shares.
Our year-to-date share repurchases, coupled with our anticipated dividend payments for the full year, already implies a return of 50% of our anticipated free cash flow for the year at the midpoint of our NYMEX price assumption range. However, given the continued share price weakness we experienced during the second quarter trading blackout period, we expect to continue to be active on opportunistic share repurchases in the second half of the year, while still preserving some cash on the balance sheet to support future return of capital to shareholders.
For the full year, we have adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to a range of 16% to 18% or 24% to 26% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis.
For the most part, this small guidance adjustment is simply a change in our operating plan that will increase the average lateral length on an 8-well pad we began drilling in the second quarter from 8,950 feet laterals to 12,450 feet, resulting in an additional 140 completed stages for the year. Frankly, this decision was not too difficult. I was asked, and you can put yourself in my shoes, do you want to purchase this offset acreage, slightly delay our turn-in-line date and add over 100 Bcf plus to these 8 wells or do we remain on our schedule? I took the slight delay and the 100 Bcf.
Our update -- actually additionally, as it relates to absolute third quarter growth figures, we further risk these volumes for potential market conditions. Specifically, the last couple of years, the third quarter has been softest period for realizations and it could happen again. So we have decided to maintain maximum flexibility to manage the pace and cadence of our turn-in-line. On our 2019 capital program, the range of $800 million to $820 million reflects the incremental drilling and completion activity from the long laterals of this 8-well pad. In addition, we plan to drill an additional 4 net wells resulting from continued efficiency gains that are generating faster drilling times year-to-date than originally forecasted.
We're firmly committed to disciplined capital spending; however, our rigs are fully contracted through the end of the year so we made the decision to drill 4 additional wells as opposed to incurring day rates on idle rigs at the end of the year.
Given we now have 7 months of actual NYMEX settlements year-to-date, we tightened our NYMEX price assumption range for the full year to $2.60 to $2.80. Based on this range of NYMEX prices, we expect to deliver $500 million to $625 million of positive free cash flow, 20% to 24% return on capital employed and a 38% to 56% growth in adjusted earnings per share.
Given the amount of questions we have received over the past few months regarding our plans for 2020, we decided to issue preliminary 2020 guidance earlier than usual. There are still a number of variables that will become better understood as we get closer to year-end and may impact our 2020 plans, including storage levels, NYMEX futures at year-end and the results of our annual service cost negotiations. However, based on our current outlook for the year, we believe this preliminary plan provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed and growth per share metrics in a lower natural gas price environment.
Our 2020 operating plan is expected to deliver 5% production growth or 7% to 8% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis from a preliminary capital budget range of $720 million (sic) [ $700 million ] to $725 million. This does include a 5% exit-to-exit growth rate in 2020.
At our budgeted NYMEX price of $2.50, this program is expected to deliver $375 million to $400 million of free cash flow, a return on capital employed of approximately 15%. At $2.75 NYMEX, these metrics increase to $525 million to $550 million of free cash flow and a ROCE of approximately 20%.
Under both NYMEX price assumptions, we expect to continue to deliver annual dividend growth and opportunistic buyback of stock while maintaining a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 1 turn.
Not only do we believe this more moderate growth program is the appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020, but we also believe this is the best strategy for the company longer term, given the current outlook for supply growth over the coming years.
Our plan for single -- mid-single-digit growth of top line production can result in high single digit growth in metrics per debt adjusted share as a result of improving cost structure, a reduction in shares outstanding resulting from an active share repurchase program and a reduction in our absolute debt levels at -- as maturities come due over the next couple of years.
At the risk of stating the obvious, we're all aware of the materials and presentation opining on the state of the macro environment across the sector. We believe that investors, industry analysts are correct and that we need to continue to be laser-focused on free cash flow generation rather than production growth for its own sake, particularly given the outlook for future supply growth for both oil and gas. Going forward, we see absolutely no rationale for continuing to chase double digit production growth when supply growth could outpace expected demand growth at this time.
We can guarantee that Cabot will continue to deliver on its track record of disciplined capital allocation, focused on generating positive free cash flow, improving results on and of capital, delivering economic per share growth and maintaining an ironclad balance sheet.
Chuck, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

We've given our numbers at a $2.50 NYMEX price and what we can deliver with that, free cash flow, buying back shares, a good double digit return on capital employed, dividend. So we're in good shape.

We moved some of these turn-in-line wells out and production might not be where it is on a near-term basis. But it's difficult, particularly on a company that is producing approaching 3 Bcf a day and we're managing that cadence, if you will, that growth with 3 rigs and 2 frac crews. So as you bring on a pad or 2, you look at the lumpiness that might occur on any given quarter or any 2 quarters for that matter. You add into that a soft price out there that we're seeing and the timing of bringing on a pad is a conscious decision for us. And also the cadence of how we'd bring on a pad i.e., do we bring it on as we typically might with more flush production or do we just slowly, much, much slowly -- slower bring it on? And that has an effect.
Particularly if you have a pad that you maybe forecast back when and that pad was forecast to be 200 million, 250 million cubic feet a day, it doesn't take a lot of days or a slide in the schedule to affect how it affects your program. As an example, say we decided to delay this program -- bringing on a pad that had that expectation in our forecast for 4 days. All right? Well, that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's a Bcf of production. So it shows up, particularly if you look at it so granularly in a quarterly perspective. So the numbers that are out there right now, I would caution that you got to -- and our program you got to take it with a grain of salt. We're very comfortable with the efficiency of our program, the results of our wells. We haven't seen fall-off on any of our averages that we anticipate. So we're comfortable there. As far as a budgeting process, we always add an expectation of service cost increases into our projections.
We always do that just as a matter of course and that gives us a little bit of room. This is no exception. If -- and that's what you see. However, I would make this statement that in light of where the current strip price is, the macro environment is, I would be -- we're going to be looking at that service cost very diligently to see what it's going to take for our annual service providers to join Cabot's team.
We're -- and I'll add that we're very pleased with every provider we have out there to date, efficient operations and they are part of the team. But we have, again, arrived, as I mentioned, into a pricing environment on prices that we haven't seen going back to 2016.

If we wanted to continue to hold that level flat going into 2021, our expectation would be that maintenance capital would probably be $40 million to $50 million, even lighter than the 2020 levels because you are going to have a more moderated base decline.

There is all kinds of discussions every single day out there about what the industry ought to do in regard to the supply-demand match. And as I've stated in my notes, I fully support the comments that I'm hearing out there that we have enough supply today. And that Cabot is going to do what is necessary to deliver the best return to its shareholders and part of that equation is to land in a production spot whether it's just flat production or if it is a small growth with the commodity price we're using in 2020 case, the $2.50. We're trying to thread the needle on what is the best landing spot in this environment. We think it is absolutely wrong for Cabot to go out and be double digits or grow into this market. And with the 3 rigs and 2 frac crews, we're kind of throttled back about as far as we can get, and it's kind of that 5% number. If we go to a straight maintenance then maybe we don't have 3 frac crew -- I mean, 3 rigs the entire year. Maybe the 2 frac crews are too many for the entire year, but that's the balance and the tweaking that we tried to -- trying to manage.

So we think it's about balancing both long-term value-creation through continuing to invest in the business but also making sure that we have ample amounts of free cash flow to continue to return to shareholders.

I'd first like to remind everyone that this --",1527,"Thank you, Chuck, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call.
As usual, joining me today on the call are several members of Cabot's management team. I'd first like to remind everyone that this -- on this call this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reflect and refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are provided in this morning's earnings release.
During the second quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic goals of, and I'll list them: Generating positive free cash flow, returning capital to shareholders, improving return on capital employed, delivering growth per debt adjusted share and maintaining low leverage.
All of this was achieved despite lower NYMEX prices during the quarter, which retreated to levels the industry has not experienced since the second quarter of 2016.
Second quarter net income was $181 million or $0.43 per share and adjusted net income, excluding selected items, was $151 million or $0.36 per share. This represents 177% increase on adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter.
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $73 million compared to free cash flow deficit of $62 million in the prior year comparable quarter. We have now delivered positive free cash flow for 12 of the last 13 quarters.
Year-to-date, we have generated $381 million of positive free cash flow, and we are on track to deliver between $500 million and $625 million of positive free cash flow for the full year based on an average NYMEX price assumption range of $2.60 to $2.80. For the trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 23.5% compared to 8.5% for the trailing 12 months as of the end of prior year comparable quarter, representing an increase of approximately 1,500 basis points.
The improvement in our financial metrics relative to prior year comparable quarter was driven by higher production levels, improved realized prices and lower operating expenses.
Production for the quarter of 2.35 Bcf per day was at the high end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 24% relative to prior year comparable quarter. Natural gas price realizations were $2.27 per Mcf, an increase of 6% when compared to the second quarter of '18. And price realizations before hedges, were $0.44 below NYMEX, an improvement of $0.24 compared to the prior year comparable quarter.
Operating expenses decreased to $1.41 per Mcf, a 24% improvement relative to the second quarter of 2018, which was primarily driven by lower exploration expenses resulting from our decision to cease capital allocation to exploration projects at the end of 2018.
As of the end of the second quarter, our balance sheet remained one of the best in the industry with over $241 million of cash on hand and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 0.6x.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares at a weighted average share price of $24.63, reducing our shares outstanding to $418.4 million. This represents a 10% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017.
This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors have authorized an increase in the shares repurchase program by 25 million shares, bringing the current remaining authorization to 31.5 million shares or approximately 8% of our outstanding shares.
Our year-to-date share repurchases, coupled with our anticipated dividend payments for the full year, already implies a return of 50% of our anticipated free cash flow for the year at the midpoint of our NYMEX price assumption range. However, given the continued share price weakness we experienced during the second quarter trading blackout period, we expect to continue to be active on opportunistic share repurchases in the second half of the year, while still preserving some cash on the balance sheet to support future return of capital to shareholders.
For the full year, we have adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to a range of 16% to 18% or 24% to 26% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis.
For the most part, this small guidance adjustment is simply a change in our operating plan that will increase the average lateral length on an 8-well pad we began drilling in the second quarter from 8,950 feet laterals to 12,450 feet, resulting in an additional 140 completed stages for the year. Frankly, this decision was not too difficult. I was asked, and you can put yourself in my shoes, do you want to purchase this offset acreage, slightly delay our turn-in-line date and add over 100 Bcf plus to these 8 wells or do we remain on our schedule? I took the slight delay and the 100 Bcf.
Our update -- actually additionally, as it relates to absolute third quarter growth figures, we further risk these volumes for potential market conditions. Specifically, the last couple of years, the third quarter has been softest period for realizations and it could happen again. So we have decided to maintain maximum flexibility to manage the pace and cadence of our turn-in-line. On our 2019 capital program, the range of $800 million to $820 million reflects the incremental drilling and completion activity from the long laterals of this 8-well pad. In addition, we plan to drill an additional 4 net wells resulting from continued efficiency gains that are generating faster drilling times year-to-date than originally forecasted.
We're firmly committed to disciplined capital spending; however, our rigs are fully contracted through the end of the year so we made the decision to drill 4 additional wells as opposed to incurring day rates on idle rigs at the end of the year.
Given we now have 7 months of actual NYMEX settlements year-to-date, we tightened our NYMEX price assumption range for the full year to $2.60 to $2.80. Based on this range of NYMEX prices, we expect to deliver $500 million to $625 million of positive free cash flow, 20% to 24% return on capital employed and a 38% to 56% growth in adjusted earnings per share.
Given the amount of questions we have received over the past few months regarding our plans for 2020, we decided to issue preliminary 2020 guidance earlier than usual. There are still a number of variables that will become better understood as we get closer to year-end and may impact our 2020 plans, including storage levels, NYMEX futures at year-end and the results of our annual service cost negotiations. However, based on our current outlook for the year, we believe this preliminary plan provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed and growth per share metrics in a lower natural gas price environment.
Our 2020 operating plan is expected to deliver 5% production growth or 7% to 8% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis from a preliminary capital budget range of $720 million (sic) [ $700 million ] to $725 million. This does include a 5% exit-to-exit growth rate in 2020.
At our budgeted NYMEX price of $2.50, this program is expected to deliver $375 million to $400 million of free cash flow, a return on capital employed of approximately 15%. At $2.75 NYMEX, these metrics increase to $525 million to $550 million of free cash flow and a ROCE of approximately 20%.
Under both NYMEX price assumptions, we expect to continue to deliver annual dividend growth and opportunistic buyback of stock while maintaining a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 1 turn.
Not only do we believe this more moderate growth program is the appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020, but we also believe this is the best strategy for the company longer term, given the current outlook for supply growth over the coming years.
Our plan for single -- mid-single-digit growth of top line production can result in high single digit growth in metrics per debt adjusted share as a result of improving cost structure, a reduction in shares outstanding resulting from an active share repurchase program and a reduction in our absolute debt levels at -- as maturities come due over the next couple of years.
At the risk of stating the obvious, we're all aware of the materials and presentation opining on the state of the macro environment across the sector. We believe that investors, industry analysts are correct and that we need to continue to be laser-focused on free cash flow generation rather than production growth for its own sake, particularly given the outlook for future supply growth for both oil and gas. Going forward, we see absolutely no rationale for continuing to chase double digit production growth when supply growth could outpace expected demand growth at this time.
We can guarantee that Cabot will continue to deliver on its track record of disciplined capital allocation, focused on generating positive free cash flow, improving results on and of capital, delivering economic per share growth and maintaining an ironclad balance sheet.
Chuck, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

There's a lot of producers that would like to have good demand projects tied to their gathering systems. So we're being a little bit quiet on how we explain our business model up there.
I will say that we're also evaluating a number of opportunities in the interstate capacity markets. We've gotten -- it's getting better and better from that regard. We're still not where we want to be to take over some positions on the long haul side.

We, through Phil and his team up there in Pittsburgh, are able to extend laterals as we're discussing in various different ways.

So should the industry as a whole -- let's back up a little bit, as a whole consolidate, just -- it should consolidate in a lot of ways to be able to rationalize some of the return profiles that are being experienced, particularly in the slow commodity strip. This commodity strip, if it's persistent, is going to be a challenge for a number of companies. We have -- and we are the lowest cost producer across the space in the natural gas. We've given our numbers at a $2.50 NYMEX price and what we can deliver with that, free cash flow, buying back shares, a good double-digit return on capital employed, dividend. So we're in good shape. But overall, the industry is not healthy right now in this space, in this price, projections on the strip, and something is going to have to change."

We moved some of these turn-in-line wells out and production might not be where it is on a near-term basis. But it's difficult, particularly on a company that is producing approaching 3 Bcf a day and we're managing that cadence, if you will, that growth with 3 rigs and 2 frac crews. So as you bring on a pad or 2, you look at the lumpiness that might occur on any given quarter or any 2 quarters for that matter. You add into that a soft price out there that we're seeing and the timing of bringing on a pad is a conscious decision for us. And also the cadence of how we'd bring on a pad i.e., do we bring it on as we typically might with more flush production or do we just slowly, much, much slowly -- slower bring it on? And that has an effect.
Particularly if you have a pad that you maybe forecast back when and that pad was forecast to be 200 million, 250 million cubic feet a day, it doesn't take a lot of days or a slide in the schedule to affect how it affects your program. As an example, say we decided to delay this program -- bringing on a pad that had that expectation in our forecast for 4 days. All right? Well, that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's a Bcf of production. So it shows up, particularly if you look at it so granularly in a quarterly perspective. So the numbers that are out there right now, I would caution that you got to -- and our program you got to take it with a grain of salt. We're very comfortable with the efficiency of our program, the results of our wells. We haven't seen fall-off on any of our averages that we anticipate. So we're comfortable there. As far as a budgeting process, we always add an expectation of service cost increases into our projections.
We always do that just as a matter of course and that gives us a little bit of room. This is no exception. If -- and that's what you see. However, I would make this statement that in light of where the current strip price is, the macro environment is, I would be -- we're going to be looking at that service cost very diligently to see what it's going to take for our annual service providers to join Cabot's team.
We're -- and I'll add that we're very pleased with every provider we have out there to date, efficient operations and they are part of the team. But we have, again, arrived, as I mentioned, into a pricing environment on prices that we haven't seen going back to 2016. So it's a difficult pricing environment than -- and we're going to have those negotiations ongoing here between now and the end of the year."

And that Cabot is going to do what is necessary to deliver the best return to its shareholders and part of that equation is to land in a production spot whether it's just flat production or if it is a small growth with the commodity price we're using in 2020 case, the $2.50. We're trying to thread the needle on what is the best landing spot in this environment. We think it is absolutely wrong for Cabot to go out and be double digits or grow into this market. And with the 3 rigs and 2 frac crews, we're kind of throttled back about as far as we can get, and it's kind of that 5% number. If we go to a straight maintenance then maybe we don't have 3 frac crew -- I mean, 3 rigs the entire year. Maybe the 2 frac crews are too many for the entire year, but that's the balance and the tweaking that we tried to -- trying to manage. And the reset for Cabot and what we look at, what's good for our shareholders is that we're not going to grow as much as we could."

We can invest in the long-term value-creation of the business by continuing to grow production in a modest way and especially on a per share basis in a responsible way, but still generate free cash flow at $2.50, which obviously most others cannot do. So we think it's about balancing both long-term value-creation through continuing to invest in the business but also making sure that we have ample amounts of free cash flow to continue to return to shareholders. Keep in mind, we also have cash on the balance sheet that could go back to shareholders and we still have a noncore asset in a pipeline interest that we could monetize and also incrementally return to shareholders. So we think there'll be plenty of opportunities to return cash to shareholders over the coming months and years."

I also have the Cabot management team with me today. I would first like to remind everybody that on this call, we will make forward-looking state",1270,"Thank you, Aily, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning for the Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. I also have the Cabot management team with me today. I would first like to remind everybody that on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, were provided in yesterday's earnings release. Cabot's third quarter results solidify our position as the leading natural gas producer in the United States as we continue to consistently deliver strong financial results even in this challenged natural gas price environment that experienced the lowest quarterly average NYMEX price on record since the second quarter of 2016. 
Despite these lower NYMEX prices, we were able to successfully execute on our strategic goals by delivering the following improvements relative to the prior year comparable quarter. They are as follows: 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share over 150% growth in free cash flow; a 21% increase in return of capital to shareholders; and increase  in return on capital employed of over 1,400 basis points to 25%; 18% growth in daily production; a 15% reduction in operating expenses per unit, including interest expense and G&A to $1.43 per 1,000 cubic feet equivalent; and a reduction in net debt to 0.7x EBITDAX. 
Additionally, during the third quarter, we announced the divestiture of our non-core interest in the Meade Pipeline for $256 million, representing an accretive transaction multiple of over 13x expected 2019 EBITDAX. This transaction remains on track to close during the fourth quarter, and will provide additional available funds to further support our continued return of capital to shareholders over the coming quarters. 
Year-to-date, we have generated $454 million of positive free cash flow, of which we have returned approximately 100% to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and dividends, including the repurchase of 10.5 million shares during the third quarter at a weighted average share price of $18.21, reducing our shares outstanding to 407.9 million shares. I'll get that straight. This represents a 12% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in second quarter of 2017. We currently have $21 million remaining shares authorized under our share repurchase program or approximately 5% of our current shares outstanding. We also announced that 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to fifth increase in our dividends since May 2017, which is underpinned by our expectation for continued free cash flow generation even under NYMEX prices assumptions materially below the current forward curve. 
I fully anticipate continuing to be active on our opportunistic share repurchase program while also evaluating further increases to our dividend, which currently delivers a 2.2% yield based on current share price. In yesterday's release, we adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to 17%, which is in the midpoint of our prior range of 16% to 18%. This implies a 25% increase in our production per debt adjusted share, highlighting the impact of our ongoing share repurchases and debt reduction production, which will continue to allow us further agreed power growth of share adjusted over time.
We also reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget range of $800 million, $820 million. For the full, we remain on track to deliver between $500 million and $525 million of positive free cash flow, representing a 7% free cash flow yield based on an average NYMEX price assumption of $2.60, which is derived from the average of the actual settlements for the first 10 months of the year, and recent strip prices for November and December. 
At this price assumption, we also expect to deliver a return on capital employed of 20% to 22%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 38% to 42% in 2019. As you will recall, we provided a preliminary 2020 plan on the second quarter earnings call that is expected to deliver full year production growth of 5% or 7% to 8% on a debt adjusted per share basis based on a preliminary capital budget range of $700 million to $725 million. We continue to believe this moderated growth plan is appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020, even if it provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed, growth and per share metrics assuming a $2.50 or higher NYMEX price. However, subsequent to the second quarter earnings call, the 2020, 2021 NYMEX forward curve has continue to decline to levels below the $2.50 NYMEX budget price. As a result, we incorporated a slide in our investor material back in August that highlighted Cabot's ability to deliver competitive free cash flow in 2020 under a $575 million cap -- maintenance capital plan, assuming prices continued to remain lower than our original budget price assumption. 
This maintenance capital plan, which includes non-drilling and completion capital, will allow the company to hold the fourth quarter 2020 production levels flat to the midpoint of our fourth quarter 2019 net production guidance range of approximately 2.4 Bcf per day, resulting in 2% to 3% growth in full production per debt adjusted share while still generating excess free cash flow after our newly increased dividend commitments even at a $2 NYMEX price assumption. 
Both the growth plan and the maintenance plan assuming a moderate amount of curtailments during the summer season based on expectations of normal pipeline maintenance, higher line pressure and weaker spot market prices. We are currently in the process in evaluating both scenarios to determine, which plan will deliver the most value for our shareholders in 2020 while also positioning the company for continued value creation in 2021. 
Ultimately, our outlook on natural gas prices for both 2020 and 2021 will dictate our plan forward. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, there are still numerous variables that will be better understood as we navigate through the winter withdrawal season, including the impacts of weather, the continued reduction in operating activity levels across North America natural gas basins, associated gas production growth and continued natural gas demand growth primarily from exports. 
In a $2.50 or higher natural NYMEX price regime, we believe the growth scenario delivers a compelling combination of free cash flow returns and per share growth while positioning the company for continued growth in 2021. In a sub-$2.50 NYMEX environment, we believe the maintenance capital scenario allows us to optimize our free cash flow available to opportunistically repurchase more of our outstanding shares in the low price environment while compromising some growth in a per share metrics, which you believe is prudent if the expectation for natural gas prices remains challenged in 2020 and 2021. As a result, we plan to communicate our final 2020 plan with the market in the fourth quarter call in late February once you have a more refined near and midterm outlook on the natural gas markets. Either way, both plans are designed to deliver a combination of free -- the strong free cash flow generation from a higher return on capital employed, continued return of capital shareholder, low financial leverage and growth in production and reserves per share, a volume and opportunistic that better days are ahead for us for natural gas prices we believe our business model is extremely resilient and will continue to deliver compelling financial metrics even in the lows of the natural gas price cycle.
With that compares favorably in not only across the energy sector but against the broader energy markets as well. And Aily, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

What we try to in laying out the plan, both the maintenance plan and the growth plan, is look at it as bookings right now with the knowledge we have and some of our our early expectations of what we might see and natural gas prices. Bookings that being -- we feel like that on a maintenance program, we can deliver everything we're delivering today to the shareholders. And we focus on that and we focus on the financial metrics. We think we can do that in a maintenance program. If you had this steady-state. And basically, we kind of been in this narrow bandwidth of natural gas prices for an extended period of time as is. So navigating in between the bookings, maintenance and this growth that we've laid out, we're comfortable in that zone right now. And kind of toggling back and forth and in between that fairway, we think is a prudent spot to land. And we'll continue to look at the market and look at the tea leafs and what our best estimate it is for natural gas prices as it rolls forward. But trying to continue to do what we've done in the past, i.e., protect our balance sheet, show a little bit of growth, have return on capital, return of capital, both in dividends and share buybacks, we're going to continue doing the same. And I think our history shows that we're prudent in how we're managing that. Our position has been to give back 50% of our free cash flow. And we sit today where we've given back 100%, which illustrates that as our balance sheet stays strong, the Strip price stays in a bandwidth, we're comfortable generating that we're going to generate free cash flow. We're prepared to go deeper than just the 50%. So we'll have now more clarity in February, and we'll get a little bit more precise in February. But we kind of look at what we've laid out here as the bookings."

And the strong basis differential for the year, I think, we're coming a light, probably close to $0.45 under, which is obviously big improvement over 2018, and much better improvement over '17 and '16. 
But our outlook is consistent of our very comprehensive sales files with the future outlook on our differentials. And combine all that with what this subjective piece that we put on it to give the guidance, if does look very favorable. There is in-basin demand continues to inch up a little bit. The overall demand picture is very good. We did have some hiccups, I guess, on basins in September, October with typical shoulder month, if you're using obviously, we've had massive storage injections all year. And then we have [indiscernible] had their maintenance program in September. So we continue to have all hiccups on differentials, but the longer term outlook is very positive, and we're happy that all the in-basin projects. And the take away that's established up there over the last 3, 4 years is finally proven itself to be the answer to our basis issues."

I think the -- you look at the net gas basin, you look at the some of the stress and tension in the market, and to make capital allocation decisions in a way that 1 project balance sheet or does not do any further damage to a balance sheet is extremely important in this environment. We've seen some releases recently on aware that debt powers are and how you manage the data to ours. We all had conversations and talk about the recriminations and the borrowing base coming up and that is being managed proactively I think right now by the industry. But I also think that there is a clear understanding that over allocating capital into a macro environment that already stretched or exaggerated in some ways is maybe not as prudent as it should be for financial metrics, if also -- we're also seeing the heels of privatizations on from translation commitment has been made in the marketplace. I think some of the additional drilling that might be taking place today is an effort to adjust fulfill commitments in that particular area. And I think that's influencing a little bit of market. I think that will anticipate with time. I don't think that's a sustainable model if, in fact, financial gas price stays in the range it is, I think it creates issues maybe with future issues with balance sheet, if that continues. So I do think that you are saying some reduction in a rigs and frac crews. You take 1 frac crew, we know it's going to be down at least 1 frac crew up in the Northeast. Well, that's probably 1,500 stages on an annual basis. 1,500 stages is a lot of gas compared to having that frac crews there. The same with during the rigs. The rigs, you might -- you lose -- dropped wondering, that's probably going to be plus or minus 200,000 lateral feet. That should be taking out all of our future gas production that would be available for the market. So I think you are seeing it and I think you'll continue to see that rationalization occur. And being able to see that reduction, I think is a -- I don't know if you can get the some of the cost of doing business down, then I think companies will be more inclined to not have to grow into a growth profile to fulfill their objectives. I think it's going on and I think it's prudent."

I also have the Cabot management team with me today. I would first like to remind everybody that on this call we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
Cabot's third quarter results solidify our position as the leading natural gas producer in the United States as we continue to consistently deliver strong financial results even in this challenged natural gas price environment that experienced the lowest quarterly average NYMEX price on record since the second quarter of 2016. Despite these lower NYMEX prices, we were able to successfully execute on our strategic goals by delivering the following improvements relative to the prior year comparable quarter. They are as follows: 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share over 150% growth in free cash flow; a 21% increase in return of capital to shareholders; and increase in return on capital employed of over 1,400 basis points to 25%; 18% growth in daily production; a 15% reduction in operating expenses per unit, including interest expense and G&A to $1.43 per 1,000 cubic foot equivalent; and a reduction in net debt to 0.7x EBITDAX.
Additionally, during the third quarter, we announced the divestiture of our noncore interest in the Meade Pipeline for $256 million, representing an accretive transaction multiple of over 13x expected 2019 EBITDAX. This transaction remains on track to close during the fourth quarter and will provide additional available funds to further support our continued return of capital to shareholders over the coming quarters.
Year-to-date, we have generated $454 million of positive free cash flow, of which we have returned approximately 100% to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and dividend, including the repurchase of 10.5 million shares during the third quarter at a weighted average share price of $18.21, reducing our shares outstanding to 407.9 million shares. I'll get that straight. 
This represents a 12% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017. We currently have 21 million remaining shares authorized under our share repurchase program or approximately 5% of our current shares outstanding. We also announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the fifth increase in our dividends since May 2017, which is underpinned by our expectation for continued free cash flow generation even under NYMEX prices assumptions materially below the current forward curve.
I fully anticipate and continue to be active on our opportunistic share repurchase program while also evaluating further increases to our dividend, which currently delivers a 2.2% yield based on current share price. In yesterday's release, we adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to 17%, which is in the midpoint of our prior range of 16% to 18%. This implies a 25% increase in our production per debt adjusted share, highlighting the impact of our ongoing share repurchases and debt reduction, which will continue to allow us further accrete our growth per share adjusted over time.
We also reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget range of $800 million, $820 million. For the full, we remain on track to deliver between $500 million and $525 million of positive free cash flow, representing a 7% free cash flow yield based on an average NYMEX price assumption of $2.60, which is derived from the average of the actual settlements for the first 10 months of the year and recent Strip prices for November and December.
At this price assumption, we also expect to deliver a return on capital employed of 20% to 22% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 38% to 42% in 2019. As you will recall, we provided a preliminary 2020 plan on second quarter earnings call that is expected to deliver full year production growth of 5% or 7% to 8% on a debt adjusted per share basis based on a preliminary capital budget range of $700 million to $725 million.
We continue to believe this moderated growth plan is appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020, even it provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed, growth and per share metrics, assuming a $2.50 or higher NYMEX price. However, subsequent to the second quarter earnings call, the 2020, 2021 NYMEX forward curve has continued to decline to levels below the $2.50 NYMEX budget price. As a result, we incorporated a slide in our investor material back in August that highlighted Cabot's ability to deliver competitive free cash flow in 2020 under a $575 million cap -- maintenance capital plan, assuming prices continued to remain lower than our original budget price assumption. This maintenance capital plan, which includes nondrilling and completion capital, would allow the company to hold the fourth quarter 2020 production levels flat to the midpoint of our fourth quarter 2019 net production guidance range of approximately 2.4 Bcf per day, resulting in 2% to 3% growth in full year production per debt adjusted share while still generating excess free cash flow after our newly increased dividend commitments even at a $2 NYMEX price assumption.
Both the growth plan and the maintenance plan assume a moderate amount of curtailments during the shoulder season based on expectations of normal pipeline maintenance, higher line pressure and weaker spot market prices. We are currently in the process of evaluating both scenarios to determine which plan will deliver the most value for our shareholders in 2020 while also positioning the company for continued value creation in 2021.
Ultimately, our outlook on natural gas prices for both 2020 and 2021 will dictate our plan forward. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, there are still numerous variables that will be better understood as we navigate through the winter withdrawal season, including the impacts of weather, the continued reduction in operating activity levels across North American natural gas basins, associated gas production growth and continued natural gas demand growth, primarily from exports.
In a $2.50 or higher natural NYMEX price regime, we believe the growth scenario delivers a compelling combination of free cash flow returns and per share growth while positioning the company for continued growth in 2021. In a sub $2.50 NYMEX environment, we believe the maintenance capital scenario allows us to maximize our free cash flow available to opportunistically repurchase more of our outstanding shares in a low price environment while compromising some growth in a per share metrics, which we believe is prudent if the expectation for natural gas prices remains challenged in 2020 and 2021. As a result, we plan to communicate our final 2020 plan to the market on the fourth quarter call in late February, once we have a more refined, near and mid-term outlook on the natural gas markets.
Either way, both plans are designed to deliver a combination of free -- strong free cash flow generation, high return on capital employed, continued return of capital shareholder, low financial leverage and growth in production and reserves per share while remain opportunistic that better days are ahead for us for natural gas prices. We believe our business model is extremely resilient and will continue to deliver compelling financial metrics even in the lows of the natural gas price cycle.
That compares favorably not only across the energy sector but against the broader energy markets as well. And Aily, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

A lot of sensitivities. What we try to in laying out the plan, both the maintenance plan and the growth plan, is look at it as kind of bookings right now with the knowledge we have and some of our early expectations of what we might see in natural gas prices. Bookings being that -- we feel like that on a maintenance program, we can deliver everything we're delivering today to the shareholders, and we focus on that and we focus on the financial metrics.
We think we can do that in a maintenance program, if you had this steady state. And basically, we've kind of been in this narrow bandwidth of natural gas prices for an extended period of time as is. So navigating in between the bookings, maintenance and this growth that we've laid out, we're comfortable in that zone right now and kind of toggling back and forth and in between that fairway we think is a prudent spot to land. And we will continue to look at the market and look at the tea leafs and what our best estimate it is for natural gas prices as it rolls forward. 
But trying to continue to do what we've done in the past, i.e., protect our balance sheet, show a little bit of a growth, have return on capital, return of capital, both in dividends and share buybacks, we're going to continue doing the same, and I think our history shows that we're prudent in how we're managing that.
Our position has been to give back 50% of our free cash flow, and we sit today where we've given back 100%, which illustrates that as our balance sheet stays strong, the Strip price stays in a bandwidth and we're comfortable generating that we're going to generate free cash flow, we're prepared to go deeper than just the 50%. So we'll know -- have more clarity in February and we'll get a little bit more precise in February. But we kind of look at what we've laid out here as the bookings."

I think the -- you look at the nat gas space and you look at the some of the stress and tension in the market and to make capital allocation decisions in a way that one protects the balance sheet or does not do any further damage to balance sheet is extremely important in this environment. We've seen some releases recently on where the debt towers are and how you manage the debt towers. We've all had conversations and talk about the redeterminations and the borrowing base coming up and that's being managed proactively I think right now by the industry, but I also think that there's a clear understanding that over-allocating capital into a macro environment that is already stretched or saturated in some ways is maybe not as prudent as it should be for financial metrics. 
It's also -- we're also seeing the ills of prior decisions on firm transportation commitment that had been made in the marketplace. I think some of the additional drilling that might be taking place today is an effort to just fulfill commitments in that particular area. And I think that's influencing a little bit of market. I think that will dissipate with time. I don't think that's a sustainable model. If in fact the financial gas price stays in the range it is, I think it creates issues maybe with future issues with balance sheet, if that continues.
So I do think that you're seeing some reduction in rigs and frac crews. Take 1 frac crew, we know it's going to be down at least 1 frac crew up in the Northeast. Well, that's probably 1,500 stages on an annual basis. 1,500 stages is a lot of gas compared to having that frac crews there. The same with during the rigs. The rigs, you might -- you lose -- you drop 1 one rig and that's probably going to be plus or minus 200,000 lateral feet that you're going to be taking out of future gas production that would be available for the market.
So I think you're seeing it and I think you'll continue to see that rationalization occur. And the -- being able to see that reduction I think is -- and if we can get the -- some of the cost of doing business down, then I think companies will be more inclined to not have to grow into a growth profile to fulfill their objectives. I think it's going on and I think it's prudent."

I also have the Cabot management team with me today. 
I would first like to remind everybody that on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
Cabot's third quarter results solidify our position as the leading natural gas producer in the United States as we continue to consistently deliver strong financial results even in this challenged natural gas price environment that experienced the lowest quarterly average NYMEX price on record since the second quarter of 2016. Despite these lower NYMEX prices, we were able to successfully execute on our strategic goals by delivering the following improvements relative to the prior year comparable quarter. They are as follows: 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share; over 150% growth in free cash flow; a 21% increase in return of capital to shareholders; and increase in return on capital employed of over 1,400 basis points to 25%; 18% growth in daily production; a 15% reduction in operating expenses per unit, including interest expense and G&A to $1.43 per 1,000 cubic foot equivalent; and a reduction in net debt to 0.7x EBITDAX.
Additionally, during the third quarter, we announced the divestiture of our noncore interest in the Meade Pipeline for $256 million, representing an accretive transaction multiple of over 13x expected 2019 EBITDAX. This transaction remains on track to close during the fourth quarter and will provide additional available funds to further support our continued return of capital to shareholders over the coming quarters.
Year-to-date, we have generated $454 million of positive free cash flow, of which we have returned approximately 100% to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and dividend, including the repurchase of 10.5 million shares during the third quarter at a weighted average share price of $18.21, reducing our shares outstanding to 407.9 million shares. I'll get that straight. 
This represents a 12% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017. We currently have 21 million remaining shares authorized under our share repurchase program or approximately 5% of our current shares outstanding. We also announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the fifth increase in our dividend since May 2017, which is underpinned by our expectation for continued free cash flow generation even under NYMEX price assumptions materially below the current forward curve.
I fully anticipate continuing to be active on our opportunistic share repurchase program while also evaluating further increases to our dividend, which currently delivers a 2.2% yield based on current share price. In yesterday's release, we adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to 17%, which is in the midpoint of our prior range of 16% to 18%. This implies a 25% increase in our production per debt adjusted share, highlighting the impact of our ongoing share repurchases and debt reduction, which will continue to allow us further accrete on our growth per share adjusted over time.
We also reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget range of $800 million, $820 million. For the full year, we remain on track to deliver between $500 million and $525 million of positive free cash flow, representing a 7% free cash flow yield based on an average NYMEX price assumption of $2.60, which is derived from the average of the actual settlements for the first 10 months of the year and recent Strip prices for November and December.
At this price assumption, we also expect to deliver a return on capital employed of 20% to 22% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 38% to 42% in 2019. As you will recall, we provided a preliminary 2020 plan on second quarter earnings call that is expected to deliver full year production growth of 5% or 7% to 8% on a debt adjusted per share basis based on a preliminary capital budget range of $700 million to $725 million.
We continue to believe this moderated growth plan is appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020, given it provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed, growth and per share metrics, assuming a $2.50 or higher NYMEX price. However, subsequent to the second quarter earnings call, the 2020, 2021 NYMEX forward curve has continued to decline to levels below the $2.50 NYMEX budget price. As a result, we incorporated a slide in our investor material back in August that highlighted Cabot's ability to deliver competitive free cash flow in 2020 under a $575 million cap -- maintenance capital plan, assuming prices continued to remain lower than our original budget price assumption. This maintenance capital plan, which includes nondrilling and completion capital, would allow the company to hold fourth quarter 2020 production levels flat to the midpoint of our fourth quarter 2019 net production guidance range of approximately 2.4 Bcf per day, resulting in 2% to 3% growth in full year production per debt adjusted share while still generating excess free cash flow after our newly increased dividend commitments even at a $2 NYMEX price assumption.
Both the growth plan and the maintenance plan assume a moderate amount of curtailments during the shoulder season based on expectations of normal pipeline maintenance, higher line pressure and weaker spot market prices. We are currently in the process of evaluating both scenarios to determine which plan will deliver the most value for our shareholders in 2020 while also positioning the company for continued value creation in 2021.
Ultimately, our outlook on natural gas prices for both 2020 and 2021 will dictate our plan forward. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, there are still numerous variables that will be better understood as we navigate through the winter withdrawal season, including the impacts of weather, the continued reduction in operating activity levels across North American natural gas basins, associated gas production growth and continued natural gas demand growth, primarily from exports.
In a $2.50 or higher natural NYMEX price regime, we believe the growth scenario delivers a compelling combination of free cash flow returns and per share growth while positioning the company for continued growth in 2021. In a sub $2.50 NYMEX environment, we believe the maintenance capital scenario allows us to maximize our free cash flow available to opportunistically repurchase more of our outstanding shares in a low price environment while compromising some growth in a per share metrics, which we believe is prudent if the expectation for natural gas prices remains challenged in 2020 and 2021. As a result, we plan to communicate our final 2020 plan to the market on the fourth quarter call in late February, once we have a more refined, near and mid-term outlook on the natural gas markets.
Either way, both plans are designed to deliver a combination of free -- strong free cash flow generation, high return on capital employed, continued return of capital to shareholders, low financial leverage and growth in production and reserves per share while we remain opportunistic that better days are ahead of us for natural gas prices. We believe our business model is extremely resilient and will continue to deliver compelling financial metrics even in the lows of the natural gas price cycle.
That compares favorably not only across the energy sector, but against the broader energy markets as well. And Aily, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

What we try to do in laying out the plan, both the maintenance plan and the growth plan, is look at it as kind of bookends right now with the knowledge we have and some of our early expectations of what we might see in natural gas prices. Bookends being that -- we feel like that on a maintenance program, we can deliver everything we're delivering today to the shareholders, and we focus on that and we focus on the financial metrics.
We think we can do that in a maintenance program, if you had this steady state. And basically, we've kind of been in this narrow bandwidth of natural gas prices for an extended period of time as is. So navigating in between the bookends, maintenance and this growth that we've laid out, we're comfortable in that zone right now and kind of toggling back and forth and in between that fairway we think is a prudent spot to land. And we will continue to look at the market and look at the tea leaves and what our best estimate it is for natural gas prices as it rolls forward. 
But trying to continue to do what we've done in the past, i.e., protect our balance sheet, show a little bit of a growth, have return on capital, return of capital, both in dividends and share buybacks, we're going to continue doing the same, and I think our history shows that we're prudent in how we're managing that.
Our position has been to give back 50% of our free cash flow, and we sit today where we've given back 100%, which illustrates that as our balance sheet stays strong, the Strip price stays in a bandwidth that we're comfortable generating -- that we're going to generate free cash flow. We're prepared to go deeper than just the 50%. So we'll know -- have more clarity in February and we'll get a little bit more precise in February. But we kind of look at what we've laid out here as the bookends."

And we're not just jumping out with a big number. We're just kind of moving it forward, a 2.2% yield is above, for the most part, above the class out there and we're comfortable with that.

I think the -- you look at the nat gas space and you look at some of the stress and tension in the market and to make capital allocation decisions in a way that one protects the balance sheet or does not do any further damage to balance sheet is extremely important in this environment. We've seen some releases recently on where the debt towers are and how you manage the debt towers. We've all had conversations and talk about the redeterminations and the borrowing base coming up and that's being managed proactively I think right now by the industry, but I also think that there's a clear understanding that over-allocating capital into a macro environment that is already stretched or saturated in some ways is maybe not as prudent as it should be for financial metrics. 
It's also -- we're also seeing the ills of prior decisions on firm transportation commitments that had been made in the marketplace. I think some of the additional drilling that might be taking place today is an effort to just fulfill commitments in that particular area. And I think that's influencing a little bit of market. I think that will dissipate with time. I don't think that's a sustainable model. If in fact the natural gas price stays in the range it is, I think it creates issues maybe with the future issues with balance sheets, if that continues.
So I do think that you're seeing some reduction in rigs and frac crews. Take 1 frac crew, we know it's going to be down at least 1 frac crew up in the Northeast. Well, that's probably 1,500 stages on an annual basis. 1,500 stages is a lot of gas compared to having that frac crew there. The same with drilling the rigs. The rigs, you might -- you lose -- you drop 1 one rig and that's probably going to be plus or minus 200,000 lateral feet that you're going to be taking out of future gas production that would be available for the market.
So I think you're seeing it and I think you'll continue to see that rationalization occur. And the -- being able to see that reduction I think is -- and if we can get the -- some of the cost of doing business down, then I think companies will be more inclined to not have to grow into a growth profile to fulfill their objectives. I think it's going on and I think it's prudent."

And so we are taking the next steps to look at all aspects of the project, the -- for the permitting the commercial aspects of the project and sometime over the next few months we'll try to get collectively -- decide on path forward. And again, it's a small win, but there's still a lot of work to be done."

I also have the Cabot management team with me today. 
I would first like to remind everybody that on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
Cabot's third quarter results solidify our position as the leading natural gas producer in the United States as we continue to consistently deliver strong financial results even in this challenged natural gas price environment that experienced the lowest quarterly average NYMEX price on record since the second quarter of 2016. Despite these lower NYMEX prices, we were able to successfully execute on our strategic goals by delivering the following improvements relative to the prior year comparable quarter. They are as follows: 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share; over 150% growth in free cash flow; a 21% increase in return of capital to shareholders; and increase in return on capital employed of over 1,400 basis points to 25%; 18% growth in daily production; a 15% reduction in operating expenses per unit, including interest expense and G&A to $1.43 per 1,000 cubic foot equivalent; and a reduction in net debt to 0.7x EBITDAX.
Additionally, during the third quarter, we announced the divestiture of our noncore interest in the Meade Pipeline for $256 million, representing an accretive transaction multiple of over 13x expected 2019 EBITDAX. This transaction remains on track to close during the fourth quarter and will provide additional available funds to further support our continued return of capital to shareholders over the coming quarters.
Year-to-date, we have generated $454 million of positive free cash flow, of which we have returned approximately 100% to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and dividend, including the repurchase of 10.5 million shares during the third quarter at a weighted average share price of $18.21, reducing our shares outstanding to 407.9 million shares. I'll get that straight. 
This represents a 12% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017. We currently have 21 million remaining shares authorized under our share repurchase program or approximately 5% of our current shares outstanding. We also announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the fifth increase in our dividend since May 2017, which is underpinned by our expectation for continued free cash flow generation even under NYMEX price assumptions materially below the current forward curve.
I fully anticipate continuing to be active on our opportunistic share repurchase program while also evaluating further increases to our dividend, which currently delivers a 2.2% yield based on current share price. In yesterday's release, we adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to 17%, which is in the midpoint of our prior range of 16% to 18%. This implies a 25% increase in our production per debt adjusted share, highlighting the impact of our ongoing share repurchases and debt reduction, which will continue to allow us further accrete on our growth per share adjusted over time.
We also reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget range of $800 million, $820 million. For the full year, we remain on track to deliver between $500 million and $525 million of positive free cash flow, representing a 7% free cash flow yield based on an average NYMEX price assumption of $2.60, which is derived from the average of the actual settlements for the first 10 months of the year and recent Strip prices for November and December.
At this price assumption, we also expect to deliver a return on capital employed of 20% to 22% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 38% to 42% in 2019. As you will recall, we provided a preliminary 2020 plan on second quarter earnings call that is expected to deliver full year production growth of 5% or 7% to 8% on a debt adjusted per share basis based on a preliminary capital budget range of $700 million to $725 million.
We continue to believe this moderated growth plan is appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020, given it provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed, growth and per share metrics, assuming a $2.50 or higher NYMEX price. However, subsequent to the second quarter earnings call, the 2020, 2021 NYMEX forward curve has continued to decline to levels below the $2.50 NYMEX budget price. As a result, we incorporated a slide in our investor material back in August that highlighted Cabot's ability to deliver competitive free cash flow in 2020 under a $575 million cap -- maintenance capital plan, assuming prices continued to remain lower than our original budget price assumption. This maintenance capital plan, which includes nondrilling and completion capital, would allow the company to hold fourth quarter 2020 production levels flat to the midpoint of our fourth quarter 2019 net production guidance range of approximately 2.4 Bcf per day, resulting in 2% to 3% growth in full year production per debt adjusted share while still generating excess free cash flow after our newly increased dividend commitments even at a $2 NYMEX price assumption.
Both the growth plan and the maintenance plan assume a moderate amount of curtailments during the shoulder season based on expectations of normal pipeline maintenance, higher line pressure and weaker spot market prices. We are currently in the process of evaluating both scenarios to determine which plan will deliver the most value for our shareholders in 2020 while also positioning the company for continued value creation in 2021.
Ultimately, our outlook on natural gas prices for both 2020 and 2021 will dictate our plan forward. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, there are still numerous variables that will be better understood as we navigate through the winter withdrawal season, including the impacts of weather, the continued reduction in operating activity levels across North American natural gas basins, associated gas production growth and continued natural gas demand growth, primarily from exports.
In a $2.50 or higher natural NYMEX price regime, we believe the growth scenario delivers a compelling combination of free cash flow returns and per share growth while positioning the company for continued growth in 2021. In a sub $2.50 NYMEX environment, we believe the maintenance capital scenario allows us to maximize our free cash flow available to opportunistically repurchase more of our outstanding shares in a low price environment while compromising some growth in a per share metrics, which we believe is prudent if the expectation for natural gas prices remains challenged in 2020 and 2021. As a result, we plan to communicate our final 2020 plan to the market on the fourth quarter call in late February, once we have a more refined, near and mid-term outlook on the natural gas markets.
Either way, both plans are designed to deliver a combination of free -- strong free cash flow generation, high return on capital employed, continued return of capital to shareholders, low financial leverage and growth in production and reserves per share while we remain opportunistic that better days are ahead of us for natural gas prices. We believe our business model is extremely resilient and will continue to deliver compelling financial metrics even in the lows of the natural gas price cycle.
That compares favorably not only across the energy sector, but against the broader energy markets as well. And Aily, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

And I guess, as you think about the implications for '21, which you all laid out today in the press release, how do you think about, I guess, the optimum program for where you're most efficient so that if you're operating in a flattish band of commodities or a narrow channel between $2.40 and $2.60, capital is best optimized and crews are best optimized as opposed to having to change things from year-to-year?"

What we try to do in laying out the plan, both the maintenance plan and the growth plan, is look at it as kind of bookends right now with the knowledge we have and some of our early expectations of what we might see in natural gas prices. Bookends being that -- we feel like that on a maintenance program, we can deliver everything we're delivering today to the shareholders, and we focus on that and we focus on the financial metrics.
We think we can do that in a maintenance program, if you had this steady state. And basically, we've kind of been in this narrow bandwidth of natural gas prices for an extended period of time as is. So navigating in between the bookends, maintenance and this growth that we've laid out, we're comfortable in that zone right now and kind of toggling back and forth and in between that fairway we think is a prudent spot to land. And we will continue to look at the market and look at the tea leaves and what our best estimate it is for natural gas prices as it rolls forward. 
But trying to continue to do what we've done in the past, i.e., protect our balance sheet, show a little bit of a growth, have return on capital, return of capital, both in dividends and share buybacks, we're going to continue doing the same, and I think our history shows that we're prudent in how we're managing that.
Our position has been to give back 50% of our free cash flow, and we sit today where we've given back 100%, which illustrates that as our balance sheet stays strong, the Strip price stays in a bandwidth that we're comfortable generating -- that we're going to generate free cash flow. We're prepared to go deeper than just the 50%. So we'll know -- have more clarity in February and we'll get a little bit more precise in February. But we kind of look at what we've laid out here as the bookends."

I guess everything -- conversely, if prices are better, I guess certainly thinking probably from your perspective beyond 2020, you talked about in a $2.50 price I believe around mid-single digits growth kind of for the next few years.

We'd make -- that decision would be made the same way we're making a decision today. Our priority focus is on returning value to shareholders. We recognize that shareholders like to see a return both in dividends and buybacks. So we'll focus on those financial metrics as a priority first. Growth is, in our opinion, is secondary. If we can deliver the financial metrics and have a moderate growth program, we think in this macro environment, that, that is a prudent course of action to take. 
And even with higher prices, I think there is a lot of shareholders out there, including a lot of shareholders around this table, that would like to see value come back to them as opposed to just see growth for the sake of growth. So we'll balance that. It's a high-class problem if we get to higher prices, and we do think higher prices are in our future, just not our immediate future."

I was just wondering, A, is there a nat gas or an oil price range that you think will generate a meaningful pullback in nat gas activity? And B, do you think this might already be underway?"

I think the -- you look at the nat gas space and you look at some of the stress and tension in the market and to make capital allocation decisions in a way that one protects the balance sheet or does not do any further damage to balance sheet is extremely important in this environment. We've seen some releases recently on where the debt towers are and how you manage the debt towers. We've all had conversations and talk about the redeterminations and the borrowing base coming up and that's being managed proactively I think right now by the industry, but I also think that there's a clear understanding that over-allocating capital into a macro environment that is already stretched or saturated in some ways is maybe not as prudent as it should be for financial metrics. 
It's also -- we're also seeing the ills of prior decisions on firm transportation commitments that had been made in the marketplace. I think some of the additional drilling that might be taking place today is an effort to just fulfill commitments in that particular area. And I think that's influencing a little bit of market. I think that will dissipate with time. I don't think that's a sustainable model. If in fact the natural gas price stays in the range it is, I think it creates issues maybe with the future issues with balance sheets, if that continues.
So I do think that you're seeing some reduction in rigs and frac crews. Take 1 frac crew, we know it's going to be down at least 1 frac crew up in the Northeast. Well, that's probably 1,500 stages on an annual basis. 1,500 stages is a lot of gas compared to having that frac crew there. The same with drilling the rigs. The rigs, you might -- you lose -- you drop 1 one rig and that's probably going to be plus or minus 200,000 lateral feet that you're going to be taking out of future gas production that would be available for the market.
So I think you're seeing it and I think you'll continue to see that rationalization occur. And the -- being able to see that reduction I think is -- and if we can get the -- some of the cost of doing business down, then I think companies will be more inclined to not have to grow into a growth profile to fulfill their objectives. I think it's going on and I think it's prudent."
