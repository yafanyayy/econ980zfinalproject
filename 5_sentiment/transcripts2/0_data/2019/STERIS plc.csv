It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 6.9%, driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points to 42.7% and was impacted favorably by currency, price and the impact of divestitures, somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 20.8% of revenue, a substantial increase from second quarter levels and 20 basis points better than the third quarter last year. EBIT margin was negatively impacted in the quarter by 40 basis points due to higher-than-anticipated calendar year-end employee health care benefits claims activity, causing an increase in SG&A for the quarter.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.9%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 11% to $107.2 million, and earnings increased 13% to $1.26 per diluted share, benefiting from both revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $225 million of cash and $1.25 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $50.7 million. Given our spending to date and plans for the fourth quarter, we are reducing our expectations for capital expenditures by $10 million to approximately $180 million for the full fiscal year 2019. 
As a reminder, during the third quarter, we announced the restructuring plan that will generate profit improvement of approximately $12 million over the next 2 years. In addition, we adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the Healthcare Products segment. These 2 items have resulted in a significant increase in depreciation and amortization for the quarter. Unlike the P&L, we do not adjust the balance sheet, nor free cash flow, for these items. Hence, depreciation and amortization for the quarter was significantly higher at $82.7 million, primarily due to $36 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with both the restructuring plan and the branding strategy.
Free cash flow for the first 9 months increased to $252.9 million, mainly due to improvements in cash from operations. We are updating the full fiscal year 2019 free cash flow expectation to include higher working capital requirements, costs associated with our planned redomicile to Ireland and restructuring plan costs. Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $330 million for the year.
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Fiscal 2019 is shaping up to be a strong year for STERIS, fueled by solid demand from our customers in all 4 segments. For the first 3 quarters, we're ahead of our expectations for revenue growth and, as a result, are increasing our full year constant currency organic revenue growth expectations to be approximately 6%.
Each of our business segments have contributed nicely to our revenue growth so far this year. AST and Healthcare Specialty Services are leading the way with 8% constant currency organic revenue growth year-to-date. In AST, we continue to see solid underlying demand from our core medical device customers. Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment continues to exceed our revenue expectations, driven primarily by strength in the United States. Their profitability has improved as planned as we have successfully leveraged the investments made over the past year or so.
Healthcare Products' constant currency organic revenue has grown 7% so far this year with strength in both recurring revenues and capital equipment. Even with the growth in capital equipment shipments, our health care backlog has also grown nicely and is anticipated to shift over the next few quarters. We expect a solid fourth quarter in health care capital shipments.
And finally, Life Science constant currency organic revenue has grown 5% year-to-date with growth across the business. Our fourth quarter last year was a strong record quarter for Life Science capital equipment shipments, which we do not expect to replicate this year. Backlog has stayed relatively steady versus last year and certainly above our historic levels, which gives us comfort that the underlying trends we have experienced over the last year or so will continue.
As I mentioned earlier, we now expect our overall constant currency organic revenue growth to be approximately 6% for fiscal 2019. As a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver another record year, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.74 to $4.84. I will note that when we raised our outlook this [indiscernible] last quarter, our thinking was that the effective tax rate would come in around 20%. With continued favorability on the tax rate in the third quarter due to favorable discrete items, we will likely have a modest upside on the effective tax rate for the fiscal year but not certain enough or substantial enough to re-guide that rate.
We appreciate your taking the time to join us this morning and your continued support of STERIS. I will turn the call over to Julie to open for Q&A."

First of all, we've been talking about for a long time that we're trying to move our revenue pattern to be a little bit away from the fourth quarter. We traditionally have a very strong quarter. We'd like to run our factories more level loaded to the extent possible, and as a result, we've been trying to pull that forward. We've had some success with that this year. And so I do expect, relatively speaking, as you know, we've been strong the first 3 quarters. We may not be quite as strong relative to historic period growth last year. So that's one item. I will mention there's 1 less shipping date this year than last year. And that doesn't have a big effect on capital equipment, but it does have some effect on recurring revenue. And I would say, you're probably correct. We may be being a bit conservative because we do have a situation where the end of March happens to fall on a Saturday and Sunday. We don't like to run our plants and shipping on Saturdays and Sundays. And secondly, we have Brexit coming, March 29, which is 2 days before our fiscal year, there's some uncertainty about how the patterns of shipments will relate as to that. So we probably are being a bit conservative in our forecast. We're quite confident with the 6%, but we'll see how the end of the month of March turns out."

If it runs to the number of days, that's just a calendar timing issue. The balance, if anything, given, again, the uncertainty of Brexit, there's some people pulling things ahead and pushing things behind to accommodate that. And our plans are running pretty high. And so if a couple of orders, particularly the capital orders, slip the wrong 2 days out of the year or end of the year, that can have a fairly significant effect on those growth rates in a given quarter. But in terms of pipeline, we see no difference in the health care capital pipeline than we've talked about now for probably 18 months or so. And on the consumable side, we have seen no difference in the ordering patterns. So I would not suggest -- I guess, I'd say it differently.

In addition to that, the health care claims activity that we talked about is we were little bit surprised by the level of claims activity in the fourth or in the calendar fourth quarter as we seem to be moving a lot of our employees to high-deductible claims. And once they hit their deductible, as anybody would, they would take advantage of hitting that deductible and going through additional procedures, if required or if needed.

But having said that, when you combine it with the instrument repair business, it moderates those fluctuations a bit because that business is larger. So in total, we don't really feel differently about that than we've been saying now for a couple of years."

And as you guys follow who medical devices know that most of the device makers are having pretty solid quarters. And so when they do, we tend to, too, because, I mean, that's the ultimate demand of that business. We have expanded geographically, and we've expanded our capabilities. And we've talked about that, and those expansions are paying off. As we bring things online, they tend to have a negative effect on our margins because we have greater depreciation on our startup costs. But now that we have 60-some-odd plants, any individual plant tends to have less of that impact. And we have seen our utilization rates outrun our expectations for this year. And so we're getting a lot of our plants are running fairly high. I wouldn't suggest that, I mean, numbers between those high 30s and low 40s, I wouldn't suggest that those are not kind of a normal run rate for that business.

Some of those are places where we are doing the work, we're outsourcing the work, and we're outsourcing it inside their facilities, some of which we may own the capital, some of which they may own the capital. And they have a number of places where we are beginning that walk by taking a piece of their business, and over time, we would anticipate taking more and more. So there's a full spectrum of outsourcing in this ORC business, some of which is what you would think of as a traditional stand-alone ORC, but just as we do in the U.K. In the U.K., we have certain customers where we do all the work in a center that's off their side, and we are tracking it back and forth. But we have a number centers where we are doing the work inside we are site.

There are other places where their capacity is such, and they would have to rebuild, if you will. And so building the center off-site as opposed to sticking it in the middle of their hospital, it's better for them to have enough site for any number of possible reasons. So then it's more of a transition as you would think of it. But even then, it's not like you turn the switch off in the facility and then switch on in the other facility, and 100% moves.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 6.9% driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points to 42.7% and was impacted favorably by currency, price and the impact of divestitures, somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 20.8% of revenue, a substantial increase from second quarter levels and 20 basis points better than the third quarter last year. EBIT margin was negatively impacted in the quarter by 40 basis points due to higher-than-anticipated calendar year-end employee healthcare benefits/claims activity, causing an increase in SG&A for the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.9%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 11% to $107.2 million, and earnings increased 13% to $1.26 per diluted share, benefiting from both revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $225 million of cash and $1.25 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $50.7 million. Given our spending to date and plans for the fourth quarter, we are reducing our expectations for capital expenditures by $10 million to approximately $180 million for the full fiscal year 2019.
As a reminder, during the third quarter, we announced the restructuring plan that will generate profit improvement of approximately $12 million over the next 2 years. In addition, we adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the Healthcare Products segment. These 2 items have resulted in a significant increase in depreciation and amortization for the quarter. Unlike the P&L, we do not adjust the balance sheet nor free cash flow for these items. Hence, depreciation and amortization for the quarter was significantly higher at $82.7 million, primarily due to $36 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with both the restructuring plan and the branding strategy.
Free cash flow for the first 9 months increased to $252.9 million, mainly due to improvements in cash from operations. We are updating the full fiscal year 2019 free cash flow expectation to include higher working capital requirements, costs associated with our planned redomicile to Ireland and restructuring plan costs. Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $330 million for the year.
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Fiscal 2019 is shaping up to be a strong year for STERIS, fueled by solid demand from our customers in all 4 segments. For the first 3 quarters, we're ahead of our expectations for revenue growth and as a result are increasing our full year constant currency organic revenue growth expectations to be approximately 6%.
Each of our business segments have contributed nicely to our revenue growth so far this year. AST and Healthcare Specialty Services are leading the way with 8% constant currency organic revenue growth year-to-date. In AST, we continued to see solid underlying demand from our core medical device customers. 
Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment continues to exceed our revenue expectations driven primarily by strength in the United States. Their profitability has improved as planned as we have successfully leveraged the investments made over the past year or so. 
Healthcare Products constant currency organic revenue has grown 7% so far this year with strength in both recurring revenues and capital equipment. Even with the growth in capital equipment shipments, our Healthcare backlog has also grown nicely and is anticipated to shift over the next few quarters. We expect a solid fourth quarter in Healthcare capital shipments.
And finally, Life Science constant currency organic revenue has grown 5% year-to-date with growth across the business. Our fourth quarter last year was a strong record quarter for Life Science capital equipment shipments, which we do not expect to replicate this year. Backlog has stayed relatively steady versus last year and certainly above our historic levels, which gives us comfort that the underlying trends we have experienced over the last year or so will continue.
As I mentioned earlier, we now expect our overall constant currency organic revenue growth to be approximately 6% for fiscal 2019. As a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver another record year with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.74 to $4.84. I will note that when we raised our outlook to this range last quarter, our thinking was that the effective tax rate would come in around 20%. With continued favorability on the tax rate in the third quarter due to favorable discrete items, we will likely have a modest upside on the effective tax rate for the fiscal year but not certain enough or substantial enough to re-guide that rate.
We appreciate your taking the time to join us this morning and your continued support of STERIS. I will turn the call over to Julie to open for Q&A."

First of all, we've been talking about for a long time that we're trying to move our revenue pattern to be a little bit away from the fourth quarter. We traditionally have a very strong fourth quarter. We like to run our factories more level-loaded to the extent possible, and as a result, we've been trying to pull that forward. We've had some success with that this year, and so I do expect, relatively speaking, as you know, we've been strong the first 3 quarters. We may not be quite as strong relative to historic growth period last year. So that's one item. I will mention there's 1 less shipping day this year than last year, and that doesn't have a big effect on capital equipment, but it does have some effect on the recurring revenue. And I would say you're probably correct. We may be being a bit conservative because we do have a situation where the end of March happens to fall on a Saturday or Sunday. We don't like to run our plants and shipping on Saturdays and Sundays. And secondly, we have Brexit coming, March 29, which is 2 days before our fiscal year. And there are some uncertainty about how the patterns of shipments will relate as to that. So we probably are being a bit conservative in our forecast. We're quite comfortable with the 6%, but we'll see how the end of the month of March turns out."

There are 2 issues in concert. One is again there are possibilities, but none of those possibilities can we have taken lateral action. Many times they're private companies that have that decision to make themselves. And secondly, as we've discussed before, right now, the market is fairly high on price across the board. And so we want to be careful not to overpay for something that we may purchase. So it's a combination of those 2 things, I think, that have caused us not to have a purchase in the last little bit.

All of our units are experiencing solid growth from the demand side. We anticipate continuation 1.5 days or a day less, which is 1.5 points on the consumable side. If everything runs to the number of days, that's just a calendar timing issue. The balance, if anything, given, again, the uncertainty of Brexit, there are some people pulling things ahead and pushing things behind to accommodate that. And our plants are running pretty high. And so if a couple of orders, particularly capital orders, slip, the wrong 2 days out of the year or end of the year, that can have a fairly significant effect on those growth rates in a given quarter. But in terms of pipeline, we see no difference in the healthcare capital pipeline than we've talked about now for probably 18 months or so. And on the consumable side, we have seen no difference in the ordering pattern. So I would not suggest -- I said -- I guess I'd say it differently. I think our full year numbers are more reflective of what we have seen and are still seeing in the pipeline than what might be implied by the fourth quarter."

We anticipated early on that it would cost us about $5 million impact. Right now, that estimate has been revised to about $10 million, which is one of the reasons we are taking down free cash flow. In addition to that, the healthcare claims activity that we talked about is we were a little bit surprised by the level of claims activity in the fourth or in the calendar fourth quarter as we seem to be moving a lot of our employees to high-deductible claims. And once they hit their deductible, as anybody would, they would take advantage of hitting that deductible and going through additional procedures, if required or if needed.

So we don't feel differently about that. Obviously, we invested early, as we said we were going, late last year and early this year, as we said we were going to. That impacted the margins early. And they're now flowing through almost exactly as expected, except they're a bit ahead on revenue. So it's a little better on a dollar basis. So -- and again, I think you will see some fluctuations as we move forward, if you talk specifically about the ORC business. But having said that, when you combine it with the instrument repair business, it moderates those fluctuations a bit because that business is larger.

And as you guys who follow medical devices know that most of the device makers were having pretty solid quarters. And so when they do, we tend to, too, because, I mean, that's the ultimate demand of that business. We have expanded geographically, and we've expanded our capabilities. And we've talked about that, and those expansions are paying off. As we bring things online, they tend to have a negative effect on our margins because we have greater depreciation and early startup costs. But now that we have 60-some-odd plants, any individual plant tends to have less of that impact. And we have seen our utilization rates outrun our expectations for this year, and so we're getting to where a lot of our plants are running fairly high. I wouldn't suggest that -- I mean, numbers between those high 30s and low 40s, I wouldn't suggest that those are not kind of a normal run rate for that business. We do spend a lot of capital to make that money. So the ROICs are attractive but not stupendous, but -- so I wouldn't suggest that those are not, but you will see fluctuations around that range.

And we don't think so. Even though, again, just like shipments, are kind lumpy in Life Science, backlog is kind of lumpy in Life Science because the orders come in the same way that shipments go out, kind of in big chunks. As it turns out, as we speak today, our backlog is roughly the same as it was last year. It was down a bit at the end of December. But end of January, we're right back to within $1 million. I don't remember where we were last year. So to us, it looks steady state. So I don't expect a big downturn nor do I expect a big upturn. But all things being equal, looks kind of a steady state."

Some of those are full ORC, what you would think of as a full ORC. Some of those are places where we are doing the work. We're outsourcing the work, where we're outsourcing it inside their facilities, some of which we may own the capital, some of which they may own the capital.

So there's a full spectrum of outsourcing in this ORC business, some of which is what you would think of as a traditional standalone ORC, but just as we do in the U.K. In the U.K., we have certain customers where we do all the work in a center that's off their site, and we are trucking it back and forth. But we have a number of centers where we are doing the work inside their site and outsourcing the work.

There are other places where their capacity is such,  and they would have to rebuild, if you will. And so building the center off-site as opposed to sticking it in the middle of their hospital. It's better for them to have it off-site for any number of possible reasons. So then it's more of a transition as you would think of it. But even then, it's not like you turn a switch off in the facility and a switch on in the other facility and 100% moves. That would be a bridge too far. So it typically is over the course of time."

EBIT margin was negatively impacted in the quarter by 40 basis points due to higher-than-anticipated calendar year-end employee healthcare benefits/claims activity, causing an increase in SG&A for the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.9%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 11% to $107.2 million, and earnings increased 13% to $1.26 per diluted share, benefiting from both revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $225 million of cash and $1.25 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $50.7 million. Given our spending to date and plans for the fourth quarter, we are reducing our expectations for capital expenditures by $10 million to approximately $180 million for the full fiscal year 2019.
As a reminder, during the third quarter, we announced the restructuring plan that will generate profit improvement of approximately $12 million over the next 2 years. In addition, we adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the Healthcare Products segment. These 2 items have resulted in a significant increase in depreciation and amortization for the quarter. Unlike the P&L, we do not adjust the balance sheet nor free cash flow for these items. Hence, depreciation and amortization for the quarter was significantly higher at $82.7 million, primarily due to $36 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with both the restructuring plan and the branding strategy.
Free cash flow for the first 9 months increased to $252.9 million, mainly due to improvements in cash from operations. We are updating the full fiscal year 2019 free cash flow expectation to include higher working capital requirements, costs associated with our planned redomicile to Ireland and restructuring plan costs. Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $330 million for the year.
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Fiscal 2019 is shaping up to be a strong year for STERIS, fueled by solid demand from our customers in all 4 segments. For the first 3 quarters, we're ahead of our expectations for revenue growth and as a result are increasing our full year constant currency organic revenue growth expectations to be approximately 6%.
Each of our business segments have contributed nicely to our revenue growth so far this year. AST and Healthcare Specialty Services are leading the way with 8% constant currency organic revenue growth year-to-date. In AST, we continued to see solid underlying demand from our core medical device customers. 
Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment continues to exceed our revenue expectations driven primarily by strength in the United States. Their profitability has improved as planned as we have successfully leveraged the investments made over the past year or so. 
Healthcare Products constant currency organic revenue has grown 7% so far this year with strength in both recurring revenues and capital equipment. Even with the growth in capital equipment shipments, our Healthcare backlog has also grown nicely and is anticipated to ship over the next few quarters. We expect a solid fourth quarter in Healthcare capital shipments.
And finally, Life Science constant currency organic revenue has grown 5% year-to-date with growth across the business. Our fourth quarter last year was a strong record quarter for Life Science capital equipment shipments, which we do not expect to replicate this year. Backlog has stayed relatively steady versus last year and certainly above our historic levels, which gives us comfort that the underlying trends we have experienced over the last year or so will continue.
As I mentioned earlier, we now expect our overall constant currency organic revenue growth to be approximately 6% for fiscal 2019. As a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver another record year with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.74 to $4.84. I will note that when we raised our outlook to this range last quarter, our thinking was that the effective tax rate would come in around 20%. With continued favorability on the tax rate in the third quarter due to favorable discrete items, we will likely have a modest upside on the effective tax rate for the fiscal year but not certain enough or substantial enough to re-guide that rate.
We appreciate your taking the time to join us this morning and your continued support of STERIS. I will turn the call over to Julie to open for Q&A."

First of all, we've been talking about for a long time that we're trying to move our revenue pattern to be a little bit away from the fourth quarter. We traditionally have a very strong fourth quarter. We like to run our factories more level-loaded to the extent possible, and as a result, we've been trying to pull that forward. We've had some success with that this year, and so I do expect, relatively speaking, as you know, we've been strong the first 3 quarters. We may not be quite as strong relative to historic growth period last year. So that's one item. I will mention there's 1 less shipping day this year than last year, and that doesn't have a big effect on capital equipment, but it does have some effect on the recurring revenue. And I would say you're probably correct. We may be being a bit conservative because we do have a situation where the end of March happens to fall on a Saturday or Sunday. We don't like to run our plants and shipping on Saturdays and Sundays. And secondly, we have Brexit coming, March 29, which is 2 days before our fiscal year. And there are some uncertainty about how the patterns of shipments will relate as to that. So we probably are being a bit conservative in our forecast. We're quite comfortable with the 6%, but we'll see how the end of the month of March turns out."

There are 2 issues in concert. One is again there are possibilities, but none of those possibilities can we take unilateral action. Many times they're private companies that have that decision to make themselves. And secondly, as we've discussed before, right now, the market is fairly high on price across the board.

If everything runs to the number of days, that's just a calendar timing issue. The balance, if anything, given, again, the uncertainty of Brexit, there are some people pulling things ahead and pushing things behind to accommodate that. And our plants are running pretty hot. And so if a couple of orders, particularly capital orders, slip, the wrong 2 days out of the year or end of the year, that can have a fairly significant effect on those growth rates in a given quarter. But in terms of pipeline, we see no difference in the healthcare capital pipeline than we've talked about now for probably 18 months or so. And on the consumable side, we have seen no difference in the ordering pattern. So I would not suggest -- I said -- I guess I'd say it differently.

In addition to that, the healthcare claims activity that we talked about is we were a little bit surprised by the level of claims activity in the fourth or in the calendar fourth quarter as we seem to be moving a lot of our employees to high-deductible claims. And once they hit their deductible, as anybody would, they would take advantage of hitting that deductible and going through additional procedures, if required or if needed.

And as you guys who follow medical devices know that most of the device makers are having pretty solid quarters. And so when they do, we tend to, too, because, I mean, that's the ultimate demand of that business. We have expanded geographically, and we've expanded our capabilities. And we've talked about that, and those expansions are paying off. As we bring things online, they tend to have a negative effect on our margins because we have greater depreciation and early startup costs. But now that we have 60-some-odd plants, any individual plant tends to have less of that impact. And we have seen our utilization rates outrun our expectations for this year, and so we're getting to where a lot of our plants are running fairly high. I wouldn't suggest that -- I mean, numbers between those high 30s and low 40s, I wouldn't suggest that those are not kind of a normal run rate for that business. We do spend a lot of capital to make that money. So the ROICs are attractive but not stupendous, but -- so I wouldn't suggest that those are not, but you will see fluctuations around that range. I wouldn't say we'll always be over 40% , but I wouldn't bet my life against that either."

And we don't think so. Even though, again, just like shipments, are kind lumpy in Life Science, backlog is kind of lumpy in Life Science because the orders come in the same way that shipments go out, kind of in big chunks. As it turns out, as we speak today, our backlog is roughly the same as it was last year. It was down a bit at the end of December. But end of January, we're right back to within $1 million. I don't remember where we were last year. So to us, it looks steady state. So I don't expect a big downturn nor do I expect a big upturn. But all things being equal, looks kind of a steady state."

But we have a number of centers where we are doing the work inside their site and outsourcing the work.

There are other places where their capacity is such, and they would have to rebuild, if you will. And so building the center off-site as opposed to sticking it in the middle of their hospital. It's better for them to have it off-site for any number of possible reasons. So then it's more of a transition as you would think of it. But even then, it's not like you turn a switch off in the facility and a switch on in the other facility and 100% moves. That would be a bridge too far. So it typically is over the course of time."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 6.9% driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points to 42.7% and was impacted favorably by currency, price and the impact of divestitures, somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 20.8% of revenue, a substantial increase from second quarter levels and 20 basis points better than the third quarter last year. EBIT margin was negatively impacted in the quarter by 40 basis points due to higher-than-anticipated calendar year-end employee healthcare benefits/claims activity, causing an increase in SG&A for the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.9%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 11% to $107.2 million, and earnings increased 13% to $1.26 per diluted share, benefiting from both revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $225 million of cash and $1.25 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $50.7 million. Given our spending to date and plans for the fourth quarter, we are reducing our expectations for capital expenditures by $10 million to approximately $180 million for the full fiscal year 2019.
As a reminder, during the third quarter, we announced the restructuring plan that will generate profit improvement of approximately $12 million over the next 2 years. In addition, we adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the Healthcare Products segment. These 2 items have resulted in a significant increase in depreciation and amortization for the quarter. Unlike the P&L, we do not adjust the balance sheet nor free cash flow for these items. Hence, depreciation and amortization for the quarter was significantly higher at $82.7 million, primarily due to $36 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with both the restructuring plan and the branding strategy.
Free cash flow for the first 9 months increased to $252.9 million, mainly due to improvements in cash from operations. We are updating the full fiscal year 2019 free cash flow expectation to include higher working capital requirements, costs associated with our planned redomicile to Ireland and restructuring plan costs. Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $330 million for the year.
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Fiscal 2019 is shaping up to be a strong year for STERIS, fueled by solid demand from our customers in all 4 segments. For the first 3 quarters, we're ahead of our expectations for revenue growth and as a result are increasing our full year constant currency organic revenue growth expectations to be approximately 6%.
Each of our business segments have contributed nicely to our revenue growth so far this year. AST and Healthcare Specialty Services are leading the way with 8% constant currency organic revenue growth year-to-date. In AST, we continued to see solid underlying demand from our core medical device customers. 
Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment continues to exceed our revenue expectations driven primarily by strength in the United States. Their profitability has improved as planned as we have successfully leveraged the investments made over the past year or so. 
Healthcare Products constant currency organic revenue has grown 7% so far this year with strength in both recurring revenues and capital equipment. Even with the growth in capital equipment shipments, our Healthcare backlog has also grown nicely and is anticipated to ship over the next few quarters. We expect a solid fourth quarter in Healthcare capital shipments.
And finally, Life Science constant currency organic revenue has grown 5% year-to-date with growth across the business. Our fourth quarter last year was a strong record quarter for Life Science capital equipment shipments, which we do not expect to replicate this year. Backlog has stayed relatively steady versus last year and certainly above our historic levels, which gives us comfort that the underlying trends we have experienced over the last year or so will continue.
As I mentioned earlier, we now expect our overall constant currency organic revenue growth to be approximately 6% for fiscal 2019. As a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver another record year with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.74 to $4.84. I will note that when we raised our outlook to this range last quarter, our thinking was that the effective tax rate would come in around 20%. With continued favorability on the tax rate in the third quarter due to favorable discrete items, we will likely have a modest upside on the effective tax rate for the fiscal year but not certain enough or substantial enough to re-guide that rate.
We appreciate your taking the time to join us this morning and your continued support of STERIS. I will turn the call over to Julie to open for Q&A."

First of all, we've been talking about for a long time that we're trying to move our revenue pattern to be a little bit away from the fourth quarter. We traditionally have a very strong fourth quarter. We like to run our factories more level-loaded to the extent possible, and as a result, we've been trying to pull that forward. We've had some success with that this year, and so I do expect, relatively speaking, as you know, we've been strong the first 3 quarters. We may not be quite as strong relative to historic growth period last year. So that's one item. I will mention there's 1 less shipping day this year than last year, and that doesn't have a big effect on capital equipment, but it does have some effect on the recurring revenue. And I would say you're probably correct. We may be being a bit conservative because we do have a situation where the end of March happens to fall on a Saturday or Sunday. We don't like to run our plants and shipping on Saturdays and Sundays. And secondly, we have Brexit coming, March 29, which is 2 days before our fiscal year. And there are some uncertainty about how the patterns of shipments will relate as to that. So we probably are being a bit conservative in our forecast. We're quite comfortable with the 6%, but we'll see how the end of the month of March turns out."

There are 2 issues in concert. One is again there are possibilities, but none of those possibilities can we take unilateral action. Many times they're private companies that have that decision to make themselves. And secondly, as we've discussed before, right now, the market is fairly high on price across the board. And so we want to be careful not to overpay for something that we may purchase. So it's a combination of those 2 things, I think, that have caused us not to have a purchase in the last little bit.

If everything runs to the number of days, that's just a calendar timing issue. The balance, if anything, given, again, the uncertainty of Brexit, there are some people pulling things ahead and pushing things behind to accommodate that. And our plants are running pretty hot. And so if a couple of orders, particularly capital orders, slip, the wrong 2 days out of the year or end of the year, that can have a fairly significant effect on those growth rates in a given quarter. But in terms of pipeline, we see no difference in the healthcare capital pipeline than we've talked about now for probably 18 months or so. And on the consumable side, we have seen no difference in the ordering pattern. So I would not suggest -- I said -- I guess I'd say it differently.

In addition to that, the healthcare claims activity that we talked about is we were a little bit surprised by the level of claims activity in the fourth or in the calendar fourth quarter as we seem to be moving a lot of our employees to high-deductible claims. And once they hit their deductible, as anybody would, they would take advantage of hitting that deductible and going through additional procedures, if required or if needed.

So we don't feel differently about that. Obviously, we invested early, as we said we were going, late last year and early this year, as we said we were going to. That impacted the margins early. And they're now flowing through almost exactly as expected, except they're a bit ahead on revenue. So it's a little better on a dollar basis. So -- and again, I think you will see some fluctuations as we move forward, if you talk specifically about the ORC business.

And as you guys who follow medical devices know that most of the device makers are having pretty solid quarters. And so when they do, we tend to, too, because, I mean, that's the ultimate demand of that business. We have expanded geographically, and we've expanded our capabilities. And we've talked about that, and those expansions are paying off. As we bring things online, they tend to have a negative effect on our margins because we have greater depreciation and early startup costs. But now that we have 60-some-odd plants, any individual plant tends to have less of that impact. And we have seen our utilization rates outrun our expectations for this year, and so we're getting to where a lot of our plants are running fairly high. I wouldn't suggest that -- I mean, numbers between those high 30s and low 40s, I wouldn't suggest that those are not kind of a normal run rate for that business. We do spend a lot of capital to make that money. So the ROICs are attractive but not stupendous, but -- so I wouldn't suggest that those are not, but you will see fluctuations around that range. I wouldn't say we'll always be over 40% , but I wouldn't bet my life against that either."

But are we starting -- I'm trying to kind of get at here is what's kind of the normalized capital growth rate?

And we don't think so. Even though, again, just like shipments, are kind lumpy in Life Science, backlog is kind of lumpy in Life Science because the orders come in the same way that shipments go out, kind of in big chunks. As it turns out, as we speak today, our backlog is roughly the same as it was last year. It was down a bit at the end of December. But end of January, we're right back to within $1 million. I don't remember where we were last year. So to us, it looks steady state. So I don't expect a big downturn nor do I expect a big upturn. But all things being equal, looks kind of a steady state."

But we have a number of centers where we are doing the work inside their site and outsourcing the work.

There are other places where their capacity is such, and they would have to rebuild, if you will. And so building the center off-site as opposed to sticking it in the middle of their hospital. It's better for them to have it off-site for any number of possible reasons. So then it's more of a transition as you would think of it. But even then, it's not like you turn a switch off in the facility and a switch on in the other facility and 100% moves. That would be a bridge too far. So it typically is over the course of time."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 9% driven by volume, and 70 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 43.8%, and was impacted favorably by productivity, mix, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.1% of revenue, an increase of 170 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate of the quarter was 19.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items along with stock -- the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 24% to $131.1 million, and earnings increased to $1.53 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended March with $220.6 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $76.5 million, bringing our total spend for the full fiscal year to $189.7 million. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 increased to $355.4 million, mainly due to improvements in cash from operations.

We appreciate the time you all take to discuss our recent performance and our outlook for the new fiscal year. Our message today is simple. We had a strong FY '19 on both the top and bottom line, and we have a solid momentum heading into fiscal 2020. Underlying demand from our customers and success with new products contributed to 8% constant currency organic revenue growth for the full year, meaningfully above our expectations. Part of that demand was related to the onetime benefit of customers building inventory. As you probably know, many companies have supply-chain concerns regarding Brexit. This resulted in some of our customers desiring safety stock ahead of the March 29 Brexit date. 
Our AST and Healthcare Specialty Services led the way this year in growth rates for fiscal 2019. Each increasing revenue 9% on a constant currency organic basis. 
First, our AST segment, it continues to benefit from our core Medical Device customer growth. Over the past 3 years, we have invested more than $100 million to expand our global network, which has allowed us to grow with our customers. We are making an even larger commitment this fiscal year as a result of expanding global demand. Our plan is to invest over $110 million to grow AST capacity at a number of facilities around the globe, primarily, in radiation technologies. 
We remain committed to supporting our Medical Device customers worldwide with the technology-neutral sustainable set of sterilization offerings. We believe these investments will reap rewards for years and anticipate continued investment in capacity in the coming years. We generally expect these facilities to generate ROIC above our capital cost in a 3- to 5-year timeframe. As you know, AST operating profits improved again this fiscal year, ending the full year at 40% EBIT margins. 
Moving onto the Healthcare Specialty Services business. We experienced a very strong year, particularly in North America. As for our franchise and our rising business in North America both exceeded our expectations as customers see the benefit of sterile solutions. Profit dollars improved 10% and margins improved sequentially quarter by quarter as we leveraged the investments we made earlier. We continue to believe that this segment can achieve mid-teen margins over time. 
Our Healthcare Products segment also had a good year, increasing 7% on a constant currency organic revenue basis, with solid growth across consumables, service and capital equipment. Revenue continued to benefit from products loss over the past 12 to 18 months, including our Celerity 20-minute biological indicator, Dipromax 2 and related chemistries, Endo and new washers and sterilizers. We expect another year of robust new product sales in fiscal 2020, including the clean sweep ceiling systems and operating integration systems as well as our recently launched Dipro S2, which offers compact size and shorter cycle site compared with prior generations. 
Operating profit dollars for Healthcare Products grew double digits, and margins improved 120 basis points to over 24%. And finally, our Life Sciences segment grew annual revenue 5% on a constant currency organic basis versus last year's challenging comparisons. Consumable products led the way with a 7% increase over the prior year, with capital equipment and service growing low single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, we moved our products manufacturing to a new facility that will support our growth for many years. As a result of that move, some customers preordered inventory, driving products consumable growth somewhat above normal levels in Q4. This will likely impact our growth rate a bit in the first half of 2020. Life Science continued to improve the bottom line, with 60 basis points improvement in EBIT margin for the year. 
All told, we ended fiscal 2019 with record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.89. Volume growth, improved margins and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate grew that improvement. I'm looking ahead to fiscal 2020, the underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong. We anticipate constant currency organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, with currency impact approximately neutral to our revenue guidance. Within that revenue outlook, we are absorbing our restructuring plan, which reduces organic revenue by about $20 million in fiscal 2020. Margin expansion will likely be within our typical range, reflecting the benefits of our restructuring, which are somewhat offset by continued investments in the business. We anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. For your modeling, we expect earnings to be split about 45% first half and 55% second half, which is consistent with prior years. We've planned an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% and interest expense to decline $3 million to $4 million in fiscal 2020 due to lower debt levels. As usual, our share count is assumed to be neutral in our guidance, with share repurchases roughly offsetting management equity grants, and to be clear, this outlook assumes no Medical Device excise tax to be in effect in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
Capital spending is planned to be approximately $280 million in fiscal 2020, a meaningful increase from prior years. As already mentioned, the primary driver is AST expansions. In addition we do plan to continue spending capital to grow our outsourced Celerity reprocessing business in the HSS segment. 
As a result of expectations for strong operating performance, somewhat offset by nearly $100 million of increased capital spending, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $300 million for fiscal 2020. 
Fiscal 2019 was a great year for STERIS, with all our business segments meeting or exceeding our expectations. That does make for a challenging comparison in FY '20, but we are confident in our ability to sustain revenue growth in line with our long-term targets and continue our path in increasing earnings in 2020 and beyond. We believe that STERIS is better positioned than ever before, and we appreciate your past and continued support of your company.

The earlier-on expansions are in the U.S., some European and other parts of the world are lagging a little bit. But -- so in terms of dollars this year, it's probably more heavily weighted to the U.S. side, but over dollars, over a longer period of time. And these projects don't end in 3 months, these are 12, 18, 24 months projects. And so the longer-term tails will be outside the U.S. but at a high level, we've got a lot of expanding and we're continuing to expand more. And it kind of is when you think about it were growing high single digits or even mid-single digits, we have to build effectively 4 or 5 plants a year, unfortunately not all those are greenfield build. Some of these are greenfield builds, but a number of them are adding a bit to an already existing plant, that's obviously much cheaper. So it's a combination of all those things that gets us $110 million. And the $110 million was specifically growth investment for AST. We also talked about roughly $100  million in total, because we've had growth divestment in AST last year. The $100 million is in total capital spend, and that does include spending for the HSS plant, but it is never plants, if you will. But that level of spending is -- pales of in comparison to the $110 million of AST."

So people that are concerned -- and then in AST, people concerned that they may not be able to get the goods either out of England or out of Europe, into England or other places, they built their inventories somewhat. We -- in those places where they told us about it, and told us about it in advance, we had a pretty good visibility. So again, something on the order of around $5 million with good visibility. What we don't know is what we don't know. Supply chains are sometimes long. The hospital build their inventory and then the their inventory and somebody else bids a little inventory, and AST, if the manufacturers are building inventory in anticipation in their warehouses and they want it sterilized ahead of time, we don't often have visibility to that. So our best guess is probably something in the $5 million to $10 million range, but it is a guess at this point in time. I don't think it's significantly greater than that."

As you know, we're in the healthcare business and we are quite accustomed to dealing with all kinds of regulatory agencies. Our -- a big, big piece of our business across all of our businesses is sterilization, and sterilization, by definition, requires the use of products that are, let's say, they kill bugs -- they kill biological entities, which means we're biological entities, so there's a risk if we don't handle it right, then there's issue. We do handle it right. We've been doing this for 40 years. We do feel that we -- I mean, we know we meet the requirements as they stand today. We are generally speaking ahead of the requirements because many places of the world do not require the same levels of scrutiny that are in the U.S. and Western Europe, and we build our factories or sterilization facilities in a way that it meets the highest levels of standards, both in safety of our people and for admissions. And so the answer is, we think we're in a good spot. We're always looking for ways to improve it, and there's always a risk in all of our business that there's a regulatory impact. Having said that, we don't think there's anybody in the planet better positioned in sterilization and general analysis sterilization with a handle on the consequential thing that the regulators choose to do. So we're comfortable in our position. I will say, in addition, it's worthwhile to note that roughly half of all devices that have to be sterilized, which is essentially anything that touches your bloodstream, from adhesive bandages to orthopedic implants, I should insert orthopedic implants, because that's a big radiation product, to pacemakers, let's say, so across a wide range of products, roughly 50% of them have to be sterilized with gas of some sort, and ethylene oxide is by far the preferred methodology. What I mean by far, by 99% to 1% kind of numbers. And if we stopped doing ethylene oxide around the world, we would stop healthcare around the world in a few weeks. So I think all parties that -- all the parties working on this are looking for the same thing. We want safety for our workers, we want safety for the patients, and we want safety for the environment, and everybody's working on the same thing.

So that one we're comfortable it's in there. And that sits in the guidance that we gave in terms of the 45/55. Terms of the ""Brexit numbers"", that's a tougher one, because, as you know, supposedly we're Brexiting in October, but supposedly, we were Brexiting in March, so I don't know if our customers will work their way down and build up again in October they don't have this ability or they're going to solve it until they get to October and, that one is less clear to us. In our planning, we did not take that a very significant account that is with the current across the year, if you will, so in our planning, we're assuming just kind of work its way out thought the full fiscal year as supposed to be any onetime thing. As we get closer to October, we'll adjust that planning, obviously. So I think that's a response to your first question. The second question is, we do have -- as I mentioned before, we have a pretty robust pipeline down in Beatty opportunities. These are opportunities don't always turn into actualities, A, in the timeframe you like, or B, sometimes other people think things  work more than we do. So -- and then sometimes owners decide to continue down, and so we have the normal uncertainties, but we have a robust pipeline, we clearly are not financially constrained in making any significant view of what we want to do."

We do not, in any way, phase capital crunch at this point in time. We like investing into businesses, because we normally will, and we tend to do what we think we're going to do with those as close to the M&A, which we generally do when there's a little bit more risk. So we're not in any way in a capital constrained situation in our operating business. If anything, we are pushing them to find opportunities to invest more in their businesses. There's a line between investing and spending, and we want to -- governments tend to co-spending investment, with investments and we expect to get a return on those -- it's all cash within that spend.

Is this now pretty consistent when you dilute it back, when you think about the underlying base business plus outsourcing, is this really something that we can really think about now as kind of a consistent double-digit organic grower, and in those margins lifting sequentially from here?

Typically, in the outsourcing business, you do have to invest, and that investment can be both capital and expense investments. You've seen that before, and it's true basically in all services businesses. But the outsource can come in kind of big lumps, and if the lump comes along, it will look a lot like that the AST business looked for us 10 years-or-so ago. 10 years ago, every time we boost our AST plant, we saw a margin decline. And today we have enough of them, but it's just doesn't push the margins. It does push them in that plant, that plant falls. And so if we have a number of things that come along in the HSS business or we're making investments, we can see temporary decline, we don't expect that to be a situation, and we expect over time for those to grow. I mean, we've mentioned we do believe this is a mid-teens kind of business, where we put that marker out there, we're on around 3%, so we thought that was kind of an aggressive marker.

We're organized globally, the sales force is organized globally, and so that is very much a global business. In the healthcare space, it is -- it's not that it's less, it is country by country in the large case, and so we have to organize around the countries, and it just so happens that U.S. is a big one, and that's the one we started. So we still are quite a bit stronger in the U.S. than in other places. Interestingly enough, our OUS business, if you look at it organically, our OUS business has historically grown faster than the U.S. business, it's just we keep buying things that have the same kind of footprint we do, which is heavily U.S. So the inorganic side has grown faster than the U.S. and OUS, with the exception of synergy, and synergy did change our footprint a fair amount, because we do outsourcing largely in the U.K. and also in Europe. So but at a high level, yes, we're attuned in any market where that -- if we use the market loosely, in the country where they're accepting that type of services that we do, and we're looking for ways to amend our products and services such that they're mor acceptable outside of the United States."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant-currency organic revenue growth was 9% driven by volume and 70 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 43.8% and was impacted favorably by productivity, mix, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.1% of revenue, an increase of 170 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items along with stock -- the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 24% to $131.1 million, and earnings increased to $1.53 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended March with $220.6 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $76.5 million, bringing our total spend for the full fiscal year to $189.7 million. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 increased to $355.4 million mainly due to improvements in cash from operations.

We appreciate the time you all take to discuss our recent performance and our outlook for the new fiscal year. Our message today is simple. We had a strong FY '19 on both the top and bottom line, and we have a solid momentum heading into fiscal 2020. 
Underlying demand from our customers and success with new products contributed to 8% constant-currency organic revenue growth for the full year, meaningfully above our expectations. Part of that demand was related to a onetime benefit of customers building inventory. As you probably know, many companies had supply-chain concerns regarding Brexit. This resulted in some of our customers desiring safety stock ahead of the original March 29 Brexit date. 
Our AST and Healthcare Specialty Service segments led the way this year in growth rates for fiscal 2019, each increasing revenue 9% on a constant-currency organic basis. First, our AST segment. It continues to benefit from our core medical device customers growth. Over the past 3 years, we have invested more than $100 million to expand our global network, which has allowed us to grow with our customers. We are making an even larger commitment this fiscal year as a result of expanding global demand. Our plan is to invest over $110 million to grow AST capacity at a number of facilities around the globe, primarily in radiation technologies. 
We remain committed to supporting our medical device customers worldwide with a technology-neutral sustainable set of sterilization offerings. We believe these investments will reap rewards for years and anticipate continued investment in capacity in the coming years. We generally expect these facilities to generate ROIC above our capital cost in a 3- to 5-year time frame. As you know, AST operating profit improved again this fiscal year, ending the full year at 40% EBIT margins. 
Moving on to the Healthcare Specialty Services business. We experienced a very strong year, particularly in North America. Our instrument repair franchise and our outsourced instrument reprocessing business in North America both exceeded our expectations as customers see the benefit of STERIS solutions. Profit dollars improved 10% and margins improved sequentially quarter by quarter as we leveraged the investments made earlier. We continue to believe that this segment can achieve mid-teen margins over time. 
Our Healthcare Products segment also had a good year, increasing 7% on a constant-currency organic revenue basis, with solid growth across consumables, service and capital equipment. Revenue continued to benefit from products launched over the past 12 to 18 months, including our Celerity 20-minute biological indicator, V-PRO maX 2 and related V-PRO maX chemistries, SYSTEM 1 endo and new washers and sterilizers. We expect another year of robust new product sales in fiscal 2020, including the CLEANSUITE Ceiling Systems and [indiscernible] operating and integration systems as well as our recently launched V-PRO s2, which offers compact size and shorter cycle time compared with prior generations. Operating profit dollars for Healthcare Products grew double digits, and margins improved 120 basis points to over 24%. 
And finally, our Life Sciences segment grew annual revenue 5% on a constant-currency organic basis versus last year's challenging comparisons. Consumable products led the way with a 7% increase over the prior year, with capital equipment and service growing low single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, we moved our barrier products manufacturing to a new facility that will support our growth for many years. As a result of that move, some customers preordered inventory, driving barrier products consumable growth somewhat above normal levels in Q4. This will likely impact our growth rate a bit in the first half of 2020. Life Science continued to improve the bottom line with 60 basis points improvement in EBIT margin for the year. 
All told, we ended fiscal 2019 with record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.89. Volume growth, improved margins and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate drove that improvement. 
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2020, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong. We anticipate constant-currency organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, with currency impact approximately neutral to our revenue guidance. Within that revenue outlook, we are absorbing our restructuring plan, which reduces organic revenue by about $20 million in fiscal 2020. Margin expansion will likely be within our typical range, reflecting the benefits of our restructuring, which were somewhat offset by continued investments in the business. 
We anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. For your modeling, we expect earnings to be split about 45% first half and 55% second half, which is consistent with prior years. We plan an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% and interest expense to decline $3 million to $4 million in fiscal 2020 due to lower debt levels. As usual, our share count is assumed to be neutral in our guidance, with share repurchases roughly offsetting management equity grants. And to be clear, this outlook assumes no medical device excise tax to be in effect in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
Capital spending is planned to be approximately $280 million in fiscal 2020, a meaningful increase from prior years. As already mentioned, the primary driver is AST expansions. In addition, we do plan to continue spending capital to grow our outsourced instrument reprocessing business in the HSS segment. As a result of expectations for strong operating performance, somewhat offset by nearly $100 million of increased capital spending, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $300 million for fiscal 2020. 
Fiscal 2019 was a great year for STERIS, with all our business segments meeting or exceeding our expectations. That does make for a challenging comparison in FY '20, but we are confident in our ability to sustain revenue growth in line with our long-term targets and continue our path in increasing earnings in 2020 and beyond. We believe that STERIS is better positioned than ever before, and we appreciate your past and continued support of your company.

It is split fairly well around the globe. So the U.S. makes up roughly half the business, and so the U.S. is roughly half of the expansion, but then the balance is around the globe. The earlier-on expansions are in the U.S. Some European and other parts of the world are lagging a little bit. But -- so in terms of dollars this year, it's probably more heavily weighted to the U.S. side, but over dollars -- over a longer period of time because these projects don't end in 3 months. These are 12-, 18-, 24-month projects, and so the longer-term tails will be outside the U.S. But at high level, we've got a lot of expanding, and we're continuing to expand more. And kind of the easiest way to think about it, if we're growing high single digits or even mid-single digits, we have to build, effectively, 4 or 5 plants a year. Unfortunately, not all those are greenfield builds. Some of these are greenfield builds, but a number of them are adding a bit to an already existing plant. That's obviously much cheaper. So it's a combination of all those things that gets us to $110 million. And the $110 million was specifically growth investment for AST. We also talked about roughly $100 million in total because we had growth investment in AST last year, the $100 million-ish in total capital spend, and that does include spending for the HSS plant. But it is not for plants, if you will. But that level of spending is -- pales in comparison to the $110 million of AST."

But we have visibility to, orders of magnitude, $5 million of revenue or, I'll call it, inventory buildup by our customers. It's spread around, a fair amount in Healthcare Products business, so that -- I would say probably the bulk of it, in the Healthcare Products business. But we also saw it in the Life Science business because you have the pharmaceutical plants on both sides of the pond, and there are barrier products on both sides of the pond. So people that were concerned -- and then in AST. People concerned that they may not be able to get the goods either out of England into Europe or out of Europe into England or other places, they built their inventories somewhat. In those places where they told us about it and told us about it in advance, we have a pretty good visibility. So again, something on the order of around $5 million, we have good visibility. What we don't know is what we don't know. The supply chains are sometimes long. The hospital builds a little inventory, and then the -- a distributor builds a little inventory, and somebody else builds a little inventory. In AST, if a manufacturer is building inventory in anticipation in their warehouses and they want it sterilized ahead of time, we don't often have visibility to that. So our best guess is probably something in the $5 million to $10 million range, but it is a guess at this point in time. I don't think it's significantly greater than that."

As you know, I mean we're in the healthcare business, and we are quite accustomed to dealing with all kinds of regulatory agencies. A big, big piece of our business across all of our businesses is sterilization, and sterilization, by definition, requires the use of products that are -- let's say, they kill bugs. They kill biological entities, which means we're a biological entity, so there's a risk, if we don't handle it right, that there's an issue. We do handle it right. We've been doing this for 40 years. We do feel that we -- I mean, we know we meet the requirements as they stand today. We are, generally speaking, ahead of the requirements because many places in the world do not require the same level of scrutiny that are in the U.S. and Western Europe. And we build our factories or sterilization facilities in a way that it meets the highest levels of standards, both in safety of our people and for admissions. And so the answer is we think we're in a good spot. We are always looking for ways to improve it, and there's always a risk in all of our business that there's a regulatory impact. Having said that, we don't think there's anybody in the planet better positioned in sterilization and general analysis sterilization to be able to handle any consequential thing that the regulators choose to do. So we're comfortable in our position. 
I will say, in addition, it's worthwhile to note that roughly half of all devices that have to be sterilized, which is essentially anything that touches your bloodstream, from adhesive bandages to orthopedic implants and -- I shouldn't say orthopedic implants here because that's a radiation product, but to pacemakers, let's say, so across a wide range of products. Roughly 50% of them have to be sterilized with gas of some sort, and ethylene oxide is, by far, the preferred methodology. And I mean by far, by 99% to 1% kind of numbers. And if we stopped doing ethylene oxide around the world, we would stop healthcare around the world in a few weeks. 
So I think all parties -- all the parties working on this are looking for the same thing. We want safety for our workers. We want safety for the patients, and we want safety for the environment. And everybody's working on the same thing, and I'm confident we'll find the proper ways to handle that."

Larry, the only area where we have kind of comfort on the timing of the orders, the inventory fuel of our customers, is in the barrier products. We do -- we'll expect to see that because -- work its way out probably in a quarter or 4 or 5 months because that was clearly done as a result of our plant expansion, the plant -- or the plant change. We have a beautiful plant for that facility now, and that will work its way up relatively quickly. So that one we're comfortable is in there. And it's -- that sits in the guidance that we gave in terms of the 45-55. 
In terms of the ""Brexit numbers,"" that's a tougher one because, as you know, supposedly, we're Brexit-ing in October, but supposedly, we were Brexit-ing in March. And so I don't know if our customers will work their way down and then build up again in October if they don't have visibility or if they're going to just hold it until they get to October and when normal -- that one is less clear to us. In our planning, we did not take that in any significant account that is -- we took it across the year, if you will. So in our planning, we're assuming it just kind of works its way out over the full fiscal year as opposed to any onetime thing. As we get closer to October, we'll adjust that planning, obviously. 
So that's -- I think that responds to the first question. The second question is we do have -- as I mentioned before, we have a pretty robust pipeline right now in BD opportunities. The issue is opportunities don't always turn into actualities, a, in the time frame you like; or b, sometimes, other people think things will work more than we do. And then sometimes, owners decide to continue their own, and so we have the normal uncertainties. But we have a robust pipeline, and we clearly are not financially constrained in making any significant view of what we want to do."

We do not, in any way, face capital crunch at this point in time. We like investing into businesses because we know them really well, and we tend to do what we think we're going to do in those as opposed to M&A, which we generally do where there's a little more risk. So we are not, in any way, in a capital-constrained situation in our operating businesses. If anything, we are pushing them to find opportunities to invest more in their businesses. There's a thin line between investing and spending, and we want to -- governments tend to call spending investment. We tend to call investments investments, and we expect to get a return on those -- on that, it's all cash, but on that spend.

But the outsourced can come in kind of big lumps, and if the lump comes along, it will look a lot like the AST business used to look for us 10 years or so ago. 10 years ago, every time we go to the AST plant, we saw a margin decline. And today, we have enough of them, but it just doesn't push the margins. It does push them in that plant, that plant falls, but the other -- so if we have a number of things that come along in the HSS business where we're making investments, we could see temporary decline. We don't expect that to be a permanent situation, and we expect, over time, for those to grow. And we've mentioned we do believe this is a mid-teens kind of business.

When it comes to the Life Science business, it is also largely a global business because our Life Science customers tend to be global entities, and so we do face them globally, if you will. We're organized globally. The sales force is organized globally, and so that is very much a global business. 
In the Healthcare space, it is -- it's not that it's U.S. It is country by country, in large case, and so you have to organize around the countries. And it just so happens the U.S. is a big one, and that's the one we started. So we still are quite a bit stronger in the U.S. than other places. Interestingly enough, our OUS business, if you look at it organically, our OUS business has historically grown faster than the U.S. business. It's just we keep buying things that have the same kind of footprint we do, which is heavily U.S. So the inorganic side has grown faster in the U.S. than OUS, with the exception of Synergy, and Synergy did change our footprint a fair amount because we do outsourcing largely in the U.K. and also in Europe. 
So -- but at a high level, yes, we're attuned in any market where that -- if we use the market loosely, any country where they're accepting the type of services that we do, and we're looking for ways to amend our products and services such that they're more acceptable outside the United States."

It's just where we kind of think about it, so we have to manage that.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 9% driven by volume and 70 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 43.8% and was impacted favorably by productivity, mix, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.1% of revenue, an increase of 170 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items along with stock -- the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 24% to $131.1 million, and earnings increased to $1.53 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended March with $220.6 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $76.5 million, bringing our total spend for the full fiscal year to $189.7 million. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 increased to $355.4 million mainly due to improvements in cash from operations.

Underlying demand from our customers and success with new products contributed to 8% constant currency organic revenue growth for the full year, meaningfully above our expectations. Part of that demand was related to a onetime benefit of customers building inventory. As you probably know, many companies had supply chain concerns regarding Brexit. This resulted in some of our customers desiring safety stock ahead of the original March 29 Brexit date. 
Our AST and Healthcare Specialty Service segments led the way this year in growth rates for fiscal 2019, each increasing revenue 9% on a constant currency organic basis. First, our AST segment. It continues to benefit from our core medical device customers growth. Over the past 3 years, we have invested more than $100 million to expand our global network, which has allowed us to grow with our customers. We are making an even larger commitment this fiscal year as a result of expanding global demand. Our plan is to invest over $110 million to grow AST capacity at a number of facilities around the globe, primarily in radiation technologies. 
We remain committed to supporting our medical device customers worldwide with a technology-neutral sustainable set of sterilization offerings. We believe these investments will reap rewards for years and anticipate continued investment in capacity in the coming years. We generally expect these facilities to generate ROIC above our capital cost in a 3- to 5-year time frame. As you know, AST operating profit improved again this fiscal year, ending the full year at 40% EBIT margins. 
Moving on to the Healthcare Specialty Services business. We experienced a very strong year, particularly in North America. Our instrument repair franchise and our outsourced instrument reprocessing business in North America both exceeded our expectations as customers see the benefit of STERIS solutions. Profit dollars improved 10%, and margins improved sequentially quarter-by-quarter as we leveraged the investments made earlier. We continue to believe that this segment can achieve mid-teen margins over time. 
Our Healthcare Products segment also had a good year, increasing 7% on a constant currency organic revenue basis with solid growth across consumables, service and capital equipment. Revenue continued to benefit from products launched over the past 12 to 18 months, including our Celerity 20-minute biological indicator, V-PRO maX 2 and related V-PRO maX chemistries, SYSTEM 1 endo and new washers and sterilizers. We expect another year of robust new product sales in fiscal 2020, including the CLEANSUITE Ceiling Systems and [ XU ] operating room integration systems as well as our recently launched V-PRO s2, which offers compact size and shorter cycle time compared with prior generations. Operating profit dollars for Healthcare Products grew double digits, and margins improved 120 basis points to over 24%. 
And finally, our Life Sciences segment grew annual revenue 5% on a constant currency organic basis versus last year's challenging comparisons. Consumable products led the way with a 7% increase over the prior year, with capital equipment and service growing low single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, we moved our barrier products manufacturing to a new facility that will support our growth for many years. As a result of that move, some customers preordered inventory, driving barrier products consumable growth somewhat above normal levels in Q4. This will likely impact our growth rate a bit in the first half of 2020. Life Science continued to improve the bottom line with 60 basis points improvement in EBIT margin for the year. 
All told, we ended fiscal 2019 with record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.89. Volume growth, improved margins and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate drove that improvement. 
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2020. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong. We anticipate constant currency organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, with currency impact approximately neutral to our revenue guidance. Within that revenue outlook, we are absorbing our restructuring plan, which reduces organic revenue by about $20 million in fiscal 2020. Margin expansion will likely be within our typical range, reflecting the benefits of our restructuring, which were somewhat offset by continued investments in the business. 
We anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. For your modeling, we expect earnings to be split about 45% first half and 55% second half, which is consistent with prior years. We plan on an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% and interest expense to decline $3 million to $4 million in fiscal 2020 due to lower debt levels. As usual, our share count is assumed to be neutral in our guidance, with share repurchases roughly offsetting management equity grants. And to be clear, this outlook assumes no medical device excise tax to be in effect in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
Capital spending is planned to be approximately $280 million in fiscal 2020, a meaningful increase from prior years. As I already mentioned, the primary driver is AST expansions. In addition, we do plan to continue spending capital to grow our outsourced instrument reprocessing business in the HSS segment. As a result of expectations for strong operating performance, somewhat offset by nearly $100 million of increased capital spending, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $300 million for fiscal 2020. 
Fiscal 2019 was a great year for STERIS, with all our business segments meeting or exceeding our expectations. That does make for a challenging comparison in FY '20, but we are confident in our ability to sustain revenue growth in line with our long-term targets and continue our path in increasing earnings in 2020 and beyond. We believe that STERIS is better positioned than ever before, and we appreciate your past and continued support of your company.

It is split fairly well around the globe. So the U.S. makes up roughly half the business, and so the U.S. is roughly half of the expansion, but then the balance is around the globe. The earlier-on expansions are in the U.S. Some European and other parts of the world are lagging a little bit. But -- so in terms of dollars this year, it's probably more heavily weighted to the U.S. side but over dollars -- over a longer period of time because these projects don't end in 3 months. These are 12-, 18-, 24-month projects, and so the longer-term tails will be outside the U.S. But at a high level, we've done a lot of expanding, and we're continuing to expand more. And kind of the easiest way to think about it if we're growing high single digits or even mid-single digits, we have to build, effectively, 4 or 5 plants a year. Unfortunately, not all those are greenfield builds. Some of these are greenfield builds, but a number of them are adding a bit to an already existing plant. That's obviously much cheaper. So it's a combination of all those things that gets us to $110 million. That $110 million was specifically growth investment for AST. We also talked about roughly $100 million in total because we had growth investment in AST last year, the $100 million-ish in total capital spend, and that does include spending for the HSS plant. But it is [ not for ] plants, if you will. But that level of spending is -- pales in comparison to the $110 million of AST."

So on average, we would hope to grow our profit a little bit faster than our revenue by doing that.

It's just part of the answer is we don't know what we don't know, and we thought that was worthwhile more in a conversation mode than in a discussion mode. But we had visibility to orders of magnitude $5 million of revenue or -- I'll call it inventory buildup by our customers. It's spread around, a fair amount in Healthcare Products business, so that -- I would say probably the bulk of it in the Healthcare Products business. But we also saw it in the Life Science business because you have pharmaceutical plants on both sides of the Pond, and there are barrier products on both sides of the Pond. So people that were concerned -- and then in AST. People concerned that they may not be able to get the goods either out of England into Europe or out of Europe into England or other places, they built their inventories somewhat. In those places where they told us about it and told us about it in advance, we have a pretty good visibility. So again, something on the order of around $5 million, we have good visibility. What we don't know is what we don't know. The supply chains are sometimes long. The hospital builds a little inventory, and then the -- a distributor builds a little inventory, and somebody else builds a little inventory. In AST, if a manufacturer is building inventory in anticipation in their warehouses and they want it sterilized ahead of time, we don't often have visibility to that. So our best guess is probably something in the $5 million to $10 million range, but it is a guess at this point in time. I don't think it's significantly greater than that."

As you know, I mean we're in the healthcare business, and we are quite accustomed to dealing with all kinds of regulatory agencies. A big, big piece of our business across all of our businesses is sterilization. And sterilization by definition requires the use of products that are -- let's say -- they kill bugs. They kill biological entities, which means we're a biological entity. So there's a risk if we don't handle it right, that there's an issue. We do handle it right. We've been doing this for 40 years. We do feel that we -- I mean we know we meet the requirements as they stand today. We are generally speaking ahead of the requirements because many places in the world do not require the same level of scrutiny that are in the U.S. and Western Europe. And we build our factories or sterilization facilities in a way that it meets the highest levels of standards, both in safety of our people and for emissions. And so the answer is we think we're in a good spot. We are always looking for ways to improve it, and there's always a risk in all of our business that there's a regulatory impact. Having said that, we don't think there's anybody in the planet better positioned in sterilization and general analysis sterilization to be able to handle any consequential thing the regulators choose to do. So we're comfortable in our position. 
I will say, in addition, it's worthwhile to note that roughly half of all devices that have to be sterilized, which is essentially anything that touches your bloodstream, from adhesive bandages to orthopedic implants and -- I shouldn't say orthopedic implants here because that's a radiation product, but to pacemakers, let's say, so across a wide range of products, roughly 50% of them have to be sterilized with gas of some sort, and ethylene oxide is by far the preferred methodology. And I mean by far, by 99% to 1% kind of numbers. And if we stopped doing ethylene oxide around the world, we would stop healthcare around the world in a few weeks. 
So I think all parties -- all the parties working on this are looking for the same thing. We want safety for our workers. We want safety for the patients, and we want safety for the environment. And everybody's working on the same thing, and I'm confident we'll find the proper ways to handle that."

Larry, the only area where we have kind of comfort on the timing of the orders, the inventory [ fill ] of our customers is in the barrier products. We do -- we'll expect to see that because -- work its way out probably in a quarter or 4 or 5 months because that was clearly done as a result of our plant expansion, the plant -- or the plant change. We have a beautiful plant for that facility now, and that will work its way out relatively quickly. So that one we're comfortable is in there. And it's -- that sits in the guidance that we gave in terms of the 45-55. 
In terms of the ""Brexit numbers,"" that's a tougher one because, as you know, supposedly we're Brexit-ing in October, but supposedly we were Brexit-ing in March. And so I don't know if our customers will work their way down and build up again in October if they don't have visibility or if they're going to just hold it until they get to October and run normal. That one is less clear to us. In our planning, we did not take that in any significant account; that is, we took it across the year, if you will. So in our planning, we're assuming it just kind of works its way out over the full fiscal year as opposed to any onetime thing. As we get closer to October, we'll adjust that planning, obviously. 
So that's -- I think that responds to the first question. The second question is we do have -- as I mentioned before, we have a pretty robust pipeline right now in BD opportunities. The issue is opportunities don't always turn into actualities, a, in the time frame you like or, b, sometimes other people think things will work more than we do. And then sometimes owners decide to continue [ down ], and so we have the normal uncertainties. But we have a robust pipeline, and we clearly are not financially constrained in making any significant view of what we want to do."

We generally plan to grow it roughly in line with the growth in profitability and cash flow, which tend to marry each other. The second thing is to invest in the businesses. And so if we were going to slow any capital spending down as a result of cash needs, it would be not on the current businesses we have. It would be on the M&A side, which is next in line. We do not in any way face capital crunch at this point in time. We like investing into businesses because we know them really well, and we tend to do what we think we're going to do in those as opposed to M&A, which we generally do where there's a little more risk. So we are not in any way in a capital-constrained situation in our operating businesses. If anything, we are pushing them to find opportunities to invest more in their businesses. There's a thin line between investing and spending, and we want to -- governments tend to call spending investment. We tend to call investments investments, and we expect to get a return on those -- on that, it's all cash, but on that spend. But there's no capital constraint in any of our businesses for growth capital per se. There is obviously constraint on operating expenses and other expenses in the business as there should be, but if it can generate good returns, we're happy to invest it across the line in our businesses."

I mean it's true basically in all service businesses. But the outsourced can come in kind of big lumps, and if a lump comes along, it will look a lot like the AST business used to look for us 10 years or so ago. 10 years ago, every time we build an AST plant, we saw a margin decline. And today, we have enough of them, but it just doesn't push the margins. It does push them in that plant. That plant falls, but the other -- so if we have a number of things that come along in the HSS business where we're making investments, we could see a temporary decline. We don't expect that to be a permanent situation, and we expect over time for those to grow. And we've mentioned we do believe this is a mid-teens kind of business. We put that marker out there when we were running 3%. So we thought that was kind of an aggressive marker. We think that's a reasonable marker.

When it comes to the Life Science business, it is also largely a global business because our Life Science customers tend to be global entities. And so we do face them globally, if you will. We're organized globally. The sales force is organized globally, and so that is very much a global business. 
In the Healthcare space, it is -- it's not that it's U.S. It is country by country in large case, and so you have to organize around the countries. And it just so happens the U.S. is a big one, and it's the one we started. So we still are quite a bit stronger in the U.S. than other places. Interestingly enough, our OUS business -- if you look at it organically, our OUS business has historically grown faster than the U.S. business. It's just we keep buying things that have the same kind of footprint we do, which is heavily U.S. So the inorganic side has grown faster in the U.S. than OUS, with the exception of Synergy, and Synergy did change our footprint a fair amount because we do outsourcing largely in the U.K. and also in Europe. 
So -- but at a high level, yes, we're attuned in any market where that -- if you use the market loosely, any country where they're accepting of the type of services that we do, and we're looking for ways to amend our products and services such that they're more acceptable outside the United States."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 9% driven by volume and 70 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 43.8% and was impacted favorably by productivity, mix, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.1% of revenue, an increase of 170 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items along with stock -- the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 24% to $131.1 million, and earnings increased to $1.53 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended March with $220.6 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $76.5 million, bringing our total spend for the full fiscal year to $189.7 million. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 increased to $355.4 million mainly due to improvements in cash from operations.

Part of that demand was related to a onetime benefit of customers building inventory. As you probably know, many companies had supply chain concerns regarding Brexit. This resulted in some of our customers desiring safety stock ahead of the original March 29 Brexit date. 
Our AST and Healthcare Specialty Service segments led the way this year in growth rates for fiscal 2019, each increasing revenue 9% on a constant currency organic basis. First, our AST segment. It continues to benefit from our core medical device customers growth. Over the past 3 years, we have invested more than $100 million to expand our global network, which has allowed us to grow with our customers. We are making an even larger commitment this fiscal year as a result of expanding global demand. Our plan is to invest over $110 million to grow AST capacity at a number of facilities around the globe, primarily in radiation technologies. 
We remain committed to supporting our medical device customers worldwide with a technology-neutral sustainable set of sterilization offerings. We believe these investments will reap rewards for years and anticipate continued investment in capacity in the coming years. We generally expect these facilities to generate ROIC above our capital cost in a 3- to 5-year time frame. As you know, AST operating profit improved again this fiscal year, ending the full year at 40% EBIT margins. 
Moving on to the Healthcare Specialty Services business. We experienced a very strong year, particularly in North America. Our instrument repair franchise and our outsourced instrument reprocessing business in North America both exceeded our expectations as customers see the benefit of STERIS solutions. Profit dollars improved 10%, and margins improved sequentially quarter-by-quarter as we leveraged the investments made earlier. We continue to believe that this segment can achieve mid-teen margins over time. 
Our Healthcare Products segment also had a good year, increasing 7% on a constant currency organic revenue basis with solid growth across consumables, service and capital equipment. Revenue continued to benefit from products launched over the past 12 to 18 months, including our Celerity 20-minute biological indicator, V-PRO maX 2 and related V-PRO maX chemistries, SYSTEM 1 endo and new washers and sterilizers. We expect another year of robust new product sales in fiscal 2020, including the CLEANSUITE Ceiling Systems and [ XU ] operating room integration systems as well as our recently launched V-PRO s2, which offers compact size and shorter cycle time compared with prior generations. Operating profit dollars for Healthcare Products grew double digits, and margins improved 120 basis points to over 24%. 
And finally, our Life Sciences segment grew annual revenue 5% on a constant currency organic basis versus last year's challenging comparisons. Consumable products led the way with a 7% increase over the prior year, with capital equipment and service growing low single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, we moved our barrier products manufacturing to a new facility that will support our growth for many years. As a result of that move, some customers preordered inventory, driving barrier products consumable growth somewhat above normal levels in Q4. This will likely impact our growth rate a bit in the first half of 2020. Life Science continued to improve the bottom line with 60 basis points improvement in EBIT margin for the year. 
All told, we ended fiscal 2019 with record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.89. Volume growth, improved margins and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate drove that improvement. 
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2020. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong. We anticipate constant currency organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, with currency impact approximately neutral to our revenue guidance. Within that revenue outlook, we are absorbing our restructuring plan, which reduces organic revenue by about $20 million in fiscal 2020. Margin expansion will likely be within our typical range, reflecting the benefits of our restructuring, which were somewhat offset by continued investments in the business. 
We anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. For your modeling, we expect earnings to be split about 45% first half and 55% second half, which is consistent with prior years. We plan on an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% and interest expense to decline $3 million to $4 million in fiscal 2020 due to lower debt levels. As usual, our share count is assumed to be neutral in our guidance, with share repurchases roughly offsetting management equity grants. And to be clear, this outlook assumes no medical device excise tax to be in effect in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
Capital spending is planned to be approximately $280 million in fiscal 2020, a meaningful increase from prior years. As I already mentioned, the primary driver is AST expansions. In addition, we do plan to continue spending capital to grow our outsourced instrument reprocessing business in the HSS segment. As a result of expectations for strong operating performance, somewhat offset by nearly $100 million of increased capital spending, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $300 million for fiscal 2020. 
Fiscal 2019 was a great year for STERIS, with all our business segments meeting or exceeding our expectations. That does make for a challenging comparison in FY '20, but we are confident in our ability to sustain revenue growth in line with our long-term targets and continue our path in increasing earnings in 2020 and beyond. We believe that STERIS is better positioned than ever before, and we appreciate your past and continued support of your company.

It is split fairly well around the globe. So the U.S. makes up roughly half the business, and so the U.S. is roughly half of the expansion, but then the balance is around the globe. The earlier-on expansions are in the U.S. Some European and other parts of the world are lagging a little bit. But -- so in terms of dollars this year, it's probably more heavily weighted to the U.S. side but over dollars -- over a longer period of time because these projects don't end in 3 months. These are 12-, 18-, 24-month projects, and so the longer-term tails will be outside the U.S. But at a high level, we've done a lot of expanding, and we're continuing to expand more. And kind of the easiest way to think about it if we're growing high single digits or even mid-single digits, we have to build, effectively, 4 or 5 plants a year. Unfortunately, not all those are greenfield builds. Some of these are greenfield builds, but a number of them are adding a bit to an already existing plant. That's obviously much cheaper. So it's a combination of all those things that gets us to $110 million. That $110 million was specifically growth investment for AST. We also talked about roughly $100 million in total because we had growth investment in AST last year, the $100 million-ish in total capital spend, and that does include spending for the HSS plant. But it is [ not for ] plants, if you will. But that level of spending is -- pales in comparison to the $110 million of AST."

It's just part of the answer is we don't know what we don't know, and we thought that was worthwhile more in a conversation mode than in a discussion mode. But we had visibility to orders of magnitude $5 million of revenue or -- I'll call it inventory buildup by our customers. It's spread around, a fair amount in Healthcare Products business, so that -- I would say probably the bulk of it in the Healthcare Products business. But we also saw it in the Life Science business because you have pharmaceutical plants on both sides of the Pond, and there are barrier products on both sides of the Pond. So people that were concerned -- and then in AST. People concerned that they may not be able to get the goods either out of England into Europe or out of Europe into England or other places, they built their inventories somewhat. In those places where they told us about it and told us about it in advance, we have a pretty good visibility. So again, something on the order of around $5 million, we have good visibility. What we don't know is what we don't know. The supply chains are sometimes long. The hospital builds a little inventory, and then the -- a distributor builds a little inventory, and somebody else builds a little inventory. In AST, if a manufacturer is building inventory in anticipation in their warehouses and they want it sterilized ahead of time, we don't often have visibility to that. So our best guess is probably something in the $5 million to $10 million range, but it is a guess at this point in time. I don't think it's significantly greater than that."

As you know, I mean we're in the healthcare business, and we are quite accustomed to dealing with all kinds of regulatory agencies. A big, big piece of our business across all of our businesses is sterilization. And sterilization by definition requires the use of products that are -- let's say -- they kill bugs. They kill biological entities, which means we're a biological entity. So there's a risk if we don't handle it right, that there's an issue. We do handle it right. We've been doing this for 40 years. We do feel that we -- I mean we know we meet the requirements as they stand today. We are generally speaking ahead of the requirements because many places in the world do not require the same level of scrutiny that are in the U.S. and Western Europe. And we build our factories or sterilization facilities in a way that it meets the highest levels of standards, both in safety of our people and for emissions. And so the answer is we think we're in a good spot. We are always looking for ways to improve it, and there's always a risk in all of our business that there's a regulatory impact. Having said that, we don't think there's anybody in the planet better positioned in sterilization and general analysis sterilization to be able to handle any consequential thing the regulators choose to do. So we're comfortable in our position. 
I will say, in addition, it's worthwhile to note that roughly half of all devices that have to be sterilized, which is essentially anything that touches your bloodstream, from adhesive bandages to orthopedic implants and -- I shouldn't say orthopedic implants here because that's a radiation product, but to pacemakers, let's say, so across a wide range of products, roughly 50% of them have to be sterilized with gas of some sort, and ethylene oxide is by far the preferred methodology. And I mean by far, by 99% to 1% kind of numbers. And if we stopped doing ethylene oxide around the world, we would stop healthcare around the world in a few weeks. 
So I think all parties -- all the parties working on this are looking for the same thing. We want safety for our workers. We want safety for the patients, and we want safety for the environment. And everybody's working on the same thing, and I'm confident we'll find the proper ways to handle that."

Larry, the only area where we have kind of comfort on the timing of the orders, the inventory [ fill ] of our customers is in the barrier products. We do -- we'll expect to see that because -- work its way out probably in a quarter or 4 or 5 months because that was clearly done as a result of our plant expansion, the plant -- or the plant change. We have a beautiful plant for that facility now, and that will work its way out relatively quickly. So that one we're comfortable is in there. And it's -- that sits in the guidance that we gave in terms of the 45-55. 
In terms of the ""Brexit numbers,"" that's a tougher one because, as you know, supposedly we're Brexit-ing in October, but supposedly we were Brexit-ing in March. And so I don't know if our customers will work their way down and build up again in October if they don't have visibility or if they're going to just hold it until they get to October and run normal. That one is less clear to us. In our planning, we did not take that in any significant account; that is, we took it across the year, if you will. So in our planning, we're assuming it just kind of works its way out over the full fiscal year as opposed to any onetime thing. As we get closer to October, we'll adjust that planning, obviously. 
So that's -- I think that responds to the first question. The second question is we do have -- as I mentioned before, we have a pretty robust pipeline right now in BD opportunities. The issue is opportunities don't always turn into actualities, a, in the time frame you like or, b, sometimes other people think things will work more than we do. And then sometimes owners decide to continue [ down ], and so we have the normal uncertainties. But we have a robust pipeline, and we clearly are not financially constrained in making any significant view of what we want to do."

I mean, first of all, our #1 -- our capital allocation philosophy hasn't changed. Our #1 issue is we don't intend to cut our dividend. We generally plan to grow it roughly in line with the growth in profitability and cash flow, which tend to marry each other. The second thing is to invest in the businesses. And so if we were going to slow any capital spending down as a result of cash needs, it would be not on the current businesses we have. It would be on the M&A side, which is next in line. We do not in any way face capital crunch at this point in time. We like investing into businesses because we know them really well, and we tend to do what we think we're going to do in those as opposed to M&A, which we generally do where there's a little more risk. So we are not in any way in a capital-constrained situation in our operating businesses. If anything, we are pushing them to find opportunities to invest more in their businesses. There's a thin line between investing and spending, and we want to -- governments tend to call spending investment. We tend to call investments investments, and we expect to get a return on those -- on that, it's all cash, but on that spend. But there's no capital constraint in any of our businesses for growth capital per se. There is obviously constraint on operating expenses and other expenses in the business as there should be, but if it can generate good returns, we're happy to invest it across the line in our businesses."

So when we think about moving that forward now, in your prepared remarks you talked about a mid-teens grower -- I'm sorry, a mid-teens margin. Is this now pretty consistent or will it be back -- when you think about the underlying base business plus outsourcing, is this really something that we can think about now as kind of a consistent double-digit organic grower and then those margins lifting sequentially from here?

I mean it's true basically in all service businesses. But the outsourced can come in kind of big lumps, and if a lump comes along, it will look a lot like the AST business used to look for us 10 years or so ago. 10 years ago, every time we build an AST plant, we saw a margin decline. And today, we have enough of them, but it just doesn't push the margins. It does push them in that plant. That plant falls, but the other -- so if we have a number of things that come along in the HSS business where we're making investments, we could see a temporary decline. We don't expect that to be a permanent situation, and we expect over time for those to grow. And we've mentioned we do believe this is a mid-teens kind of business. We put that marker out there when we were running 3%. So we thought that was kind of an aggressive marker. We think that's a reasonable marker.

When it comes to the Life Science business, it is also largely a global business because our Life Science customers tend to be global entities. And so we do face them globally, if you will. We're organized globally. The sales force is organized globally, and so that is very much a global business. 
In the Healthcare space, it is -- it's not that it's U.S. It is country by country in large case, and so you have to organize around the countries. And it just so happens the U.S. is a big one, and it's the one we started. So we still are quite a bit stronger in the U.S. than other places. Interestingly enough, our OUS business -- if you look at it organically, our OUS business has historically grown faster than the U.S. business. It's just we keep buying things that have the same kind of footprint we do, which is heavily U.S. So the inorganic side has grown faster in the U.S. than OUS, with the exception of Synergy, and Synergy did change our footprint a fair amount because we do outsourcing largely in the U.K. and also in Europe. 
So -- but at a high level, yes, we're attuned in any market where that -- if you use the market loosely, any country where they're accepting of the type of services that we do, and we're looking for ways to amend our products and services such that they're more acceptable outside the United States."

The fixed costs you have to actively manage them not to grow. And we do work at that, but like all things, there's some growth -- fixed isn't really fixed. It's just the way we kind of think about it, so we have to manage that. But in general, our expectation is when we're doing things that if we grow we should become more efficient as we grow.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 9% driven by volume and 70 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 43.8% and was impacted favorably by productivity, mix, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.1% of revenue, an increase of 170 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items along with stock -- the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 24% to $131.1 million, and earnings increased to $1.53 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended March with $220.6 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $76.5 million, bringing our total spend for the full fiscal year to $189.7 million. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 increased to $355.4 million mainly due to improvements in cash from operations.

34783,612055295,1747283,"STERIS plc, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, May 14, 2019",2019-05-14,"Earnings Calls","STERIS plc","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate the time y'all take to discuss our recent performance and our outlook for the new fiscal year. Our message today is simple. We had a strong FY '19 on both the top and bottom line, and we have a",1018,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate the time y'all take to discuss our recent performance and our outlook for the new fiscal year. Our message today is simple. We had a strong FY '19 on both the top and bottom line, and we have a solid momentum heading into fiscal 2020. 
Underlying demand from our customers and success with new products contributed to 8% constant currency organic revenue growth for the full year, meaningfully above our expectations. Part of that demand was related to a onetime benefit of customers building inventory. As you probably know, many companies had supply chain concerns regarding Brexit. This resulted in some of our customers desiring safety stock ahead of the original March 29 Brexit date. 
Our AST and Healthcare Specialty Service segments led the way this year in growth rates for fiscal 2019, each increasing revenue 9% on a constant currency organic basis. First, our AST segment. It continues to benefit from our core medical device customers growth. Over the past 3 years, we have invested more than $100 million to expand our global network, which has allowed us to grow with our customers. We are making an even larger commitment this fiscal year as a result of expanding global demand. Our plan is to invest over $110 million to grow AST capacity at a number of facilities around the globe, primarily in radiation technologies. 
We remain committed to supporting our medical device customers worldwide with a technology-neutral sustainable set of sterilization offerings. We believe these investments will reap rewards for years and anticipate continued investment in capacity in the coming years. We generally expect these facilities to generate ROIC above our capital cost in a 3- to 5-year time frame. As you know, AST operating profit improved again this fiscal year, ending the full year at 40% EBIT margins. 
Moving on to the Healthcare Specialty Services business. We experienced a very strong year, particularly in North America. Our instrument repair franchise and our outsourced instrument reprocessing business in North America both exceeded our expectations as customers see the benefit of STERIS solutions. Profit dollars improved 10%, and margins improved sequentially quarter-by-quarter as we leveraged the investments made earlier. We continue to believe that this segment can achieve mid-teen margins over time. 
Our Healthcare Products segment also had a good year, increasing 7% on a constant currency organic revenue basis with solid growth across consumables, service and capital equipment. Revenue continued to benefit from products launched over the past 12 to 18 months, including our Celerity 20-minute biological indicator, V-PRO maX 2 and related V-PRO maX chemistries, SYSTEM 1 endo and new washers and sterilizers. We expect another year of robust new product sales in fiscal 2020, including the CLEANSUITE Ceiling Systems and [ XU ] operating room integration systems as well as our recently launched V-PRO s2, which offers compact size and shorter cycle time compared with prior generations. Operating profit dollars for Healthcare Products grew double digits, and margins improved 120 basis points to over 24%. 
And finally, our Life Sciences segment grew annual revenue 5% on a constant currency organic basis versus last year's challenging comparisons. Consumable products led the way with a 7% increase over the prior year, with capital equipment and service growing low single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, we moved our barrier products manufacturing to a new facility that will support our growth for many years. As a result of that move, some customers preordered inventory, driving barrier products consumable growth somewhat above normal levels in Q4. This will likely impact our growth rate a bit in the first half of 2020. Life Science continued to improve the bottom line with 60 basis points improvement in EBIT margin for the year. 
All told, we ended fiscal 2019 with record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.89. Volume growth, improved margins and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate drove that improvement. 
Now looking ahead to fiscal 2020. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong. We anticipate constant currency organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, with currency impact approximately neutral to our revenue guidance. Within that revenue outlook, we are absorbing our restructuring plan, which reduces organic revenue by about $20 million in fiscal 2020. Margin expansion will likely be within our typical range, reflecting the benefits of our restructuring, which were somewhat offset by continued investments in the business. 
We anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. For your modeling, we expect earnings to be split about 45% first half and 55% second half, which is consistent with prior years. We plan on an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% and interest expense to decline $3 million to $4 million in fiscal 2020 due to lower debt levels. As usual, our share count is assumed to be neutral in our guidance, with share repurchases roughly offsetting management equity grants. And to be clear, this outlook assumes no medical device excise tax to be in effect in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
Capital spending is planned to be approximately $280 million in fiscal 2020, a meaningful increase from prior years. As I already mentioned, the primary driver is AST expansions. In addition, we do plan to continue spending capital to grow our outsourced instrument reprocessing business in the HSS segment. As a result of expectations for strong operating performance, somewhat offset by nearly $100 million of increased capital spending, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $300 million for fiscal 2020. 
Fiscal 2019 was a great year for STERIS, with all our business segments meeting or exceeding our expectations. That does make for a challenging comparison in FY '20, but we are confident in our ability to sustain revenue growth in line with our long-term targets and continue our path in increasing earnings in 2020 and beyond. We believe that STERIS is better positioned than ever before, and we appreciate your past and continued support of your company.

It is split fairly well around the globe. So the U.S. makes up roughly half the business, and so the U.S. is roughly half of the expansion, but then the balance is around the globe. The earlier-on expansions are in the U.S. Some European and other parts of the world are lagging a little bit. But -- so in terms of dollars this year, it's probably more heavily weighted to the U.S. side but over dollars -- over a longer period of time because these projects don't end in 3 months. These are 12-, 18-, 24-month projects, and so the longer-term tails will be outside the U.S. But at a high level, we've done a lot of expanding, and we're continuing to expand more. And kind of the easiest way to think about it if we're growing high single digits or even mid-single digits, we have to build, effectively, 4 or 5 plants a year. Unfortunately, not all those are greenfield builds. Some of these are greenfield builds, but a number of them are adding a bit to an already existing plant. That's obviously much cheaper. So it's a combination of all those things that gets us to $110 million. That $110 million was specifically growth investment for AST. We also talked about roughly $100 million in total because we had growth investment in AST last year, the $100 million-ish in total capital spend, and that does include spending for the HSS plant. But it is [ not for ] plants, if you will. But that level of spending is -- pales in comparison to the $110 million of AST."

There are puts and takes in that business. Sometimes mix has an effect if one -- if a roughly high-margin piece of the business is growing a little faster than the other or vice versa, you have a mix effect. But in general, we anticipate being more efficient with our resources over time and sharing some of that with our customers and keeping some of that for ourselves. So on average, we would hope to grow our profit a little bit faster than our revenue by doing that. And we don't have a target per se or an end point per se because we add things to it all along, and that changes the mix. But in general, our people know that we think we should get more efficient every year and pass on a piece of that efficiency to our customers."

It's just part of the answer is we don't know what we don't know, and we thought that was worthwhile more in a conversation mode than in a discussion mode. But we had visibility to orders of magnitude $5 million of revenue or -- I'll call it inventory buildup by our customers. It's spread around, a fair amount in Healthcare Products business, so that -- I would say probably the bulk of it in the Healthcare Products business. But we also saw it in the Life Science business because you have pharmaceutical plants on both sides of the Pond, and there are barrier products on both sides of the Pond. So people that were concerned -- and then in AST. People concerned that they may not be able to get the goods either out of England into Europe or out of Europe into England or other places, they built their inventories somewhat. In those places where they told us about it and told us about it in advance, we have a pretty good visibility. So again, something on the order of around $5 million, we have good visibility. What we don't know is what we don't know. The supply chains are sometimes long. The hospital builds a little inventory, and then the -- a distributor builds a little inventory, and somebody else builds a little inventory. In AST, if a manufacturer is building inventory in anticipation in their warehouses and they want it sterilized ahead of time, we don't often have visibility to that. So our best guess is probably something in the $5 million to $10 million range, but it is a guess at this point in time. I don't think it's significantly greater than that."

As you know, I mean we're in the healthcare business, and we are quite accustomed to dealing with all kinds of regulatory agencies. A big, big piece of our business across all of our businesses is sterilization. And sterilization by definition requires the use of products that are -- let's say -- they kill bugs. They kill biological entities, which means we're a biological entity. So there's a risk if we don't handle it right, that there's an issue. We do handle it right. We've been doing this for 40 years. We do feel that we -- I mean we know we meet the requirements as they stand today. We are generally speaking ahead of the requirements because many places in the world do not require the same level of scrutiny that are in the U.S. and Western Europe. And we build our factories or sterilization facilities in a way that it meets the highest levels of standards, both in safety of our people and for emissions. And so the answer is we think we're in a good spot. We are always looking for ways to improve it, and there's always a risk in all of our business that there's a regulatory impact. Having said that, we don't think there's anybody in the planet better positioned in sterilization and general analysis sterilization to be able to handle any consequential thing the regulators choose to do. So we're comfortable in our position. 
I will say, in addition, it's worthwhile to note that roughly half of all devices that have to be sterilized, which is essentially anything that touches your bloodstream, from adhesive bandages to orthopedic implants and -- I shouldn't say orthopedic implants here because that's a radiation product, but to pacemakers, let's say, so across a wide range of products, roughly 50% of them have to be sterilized with gas of some sort, and ethylene oxide is by far the preferred methodology. And I mean by far, by 99% to 1% kind of numbers. And if we stopped doing ethylene oxide around the world, we would stop healthcare around the world in a few weeks. 
So I think all parties -- all the parties working on this are looking for the same thing. We want safety for our workers. We want safety for the patients, and we want safety for the environment. And everybody's working on the same thing, and I'm confident we'll find the proper ways to handle that."

Larry, the only area where we have kind of comfort on the timing of the orders, the inventory [ fill ] of our customers is in the barrier products. We do -- we'll expect to see that because -- work its way out probably in a quarter or 4 or 5 months because that was clearly done as a result of our plant expansion, the plant -- or the plant change. We have a beautiful plant for that facility now, and that will work its way out relatively quickly. So that one we're comfortable is in there. And it's -- that sits in the guidance that we gave in terms of the 45-55. 
In terms of the ""Brexit numbers,"" that's a tougher one because, as you know, supposedly we're Brexit-ing in October, but supposedly we were Brexit-ing in March. And so I don't know if our customers will work their way down and build up again in October if they don't have visibility or if they're going to just hold it until they get to October and run normal. That one is less clear to us. In our planning, we did not take that in any significant account; that is, we took it across the year, if you will. So in our planning, we're assuming it just kind of works its way out over the full fiscal year as opposed to any onetime thing. As we get closer to October, we'll adjust that planning, obviously. 
So that's -- I think that responds to the first question. The second question is we do have -- as I mentioned before, we have a pretty robust pipeline right now in BD opportunities. The issue is opportunities don't always turn into actualities, a, in the time frame you like or, b, sometimes other people think things will work more than we do. And then sometimes owners decide to continue [ down ], and so we have the normal uncertainties. But we have a robust pipeline, and we clearly are not financially constrained in making any significant view of what we want to do."

I mean, first of all, our #1 -- our capital allocation philosophy hasn't changed. Our #1 issue is we don't intend to cut our dividend. We generally plan to grow it roughly in line with the growth in profitability and cash flow, which tend to marry each other. The second thing is to invest in the businesses. And so if we were going to slow any capital spending down as a result of cash needs, it would be not on the current businesses we have. It would be on the M&A side, which is next in line. We do not in any way face capital crunch at this point in time. We like investing into businesses because we know them really well, and we tend to do what we think we're going to do in those as opposed to M&A, which we generally do where there's a little more risk. So we are not in any way in a capital-constrained situation in our operating businesses. If anything, we are pushing them to find opportunities to invest more in their businesses. There's a thin line between investing and spending, and we want to -- governments tend to call spending investment. We tend to call investments investments, and we expect to get a return on those -- on that, it's all cash, but on that spend. But there's no capital constraint in any of our businesses for growth capital per se. There is obviously constraint on operating expenses and other expenses in the business as there should be, but if it can generate good returns, we're happy to invest it across the line in our businesses."

So when we think about moving that forward now, in your prepared remarks you talked about a mid-teens grower -- I'm sorry, a mid-teens margin. Is this now pretty consistent or will it be back -- when you think about the underlying base business plus outsourcing, is this really something that we can think about now as kind of a consistent double-digit organic grower and then those margins lifting sequentially from here?

Typically, in the outsourcing business, you do have to invest, and that investment can be both capital and expense investment. You've seen that before. I mean it's true basically in all service businesses. But the outsourced can come in kind of big lumps, and if a lump comes along, it will look a lot like the AST business used to look for us 10 years or so ago. 10 years ago, every time we build an AST plant, we saw a margin decline. And today, we have enough of them, but it just doesn't push the margins. It does push them in that plant. That plant falls, but the other -- so if we have a number of things that come along in the HSS business where we're making investments, we could see a temporary decline. We don't expect that to be a permanent situation, and we expect over time for those to grow. And we've mentioned we do believe this is a mid-teens kind of business. We put that marker out there when we were running 3%. So we thought that was kind of an aggressive marker. We think that's a reasonable marker.

When it comes to the Life Science business, it is also largely a global business because our Life Science customers tend to be global entities. And so we do face them globally, if you will. We're organized globally. The sales force is organized globally, and so that is very much a global business. 
In the Healthcare space, it is -- it's not that it's U.S. It is country by country in large case, and so you have to organize around the countries. And it just so happens the U.S. is a big one, and it's the one we started. So we still are quite a bit stronger in the U.S. than other places. Interestingly enough, our OUS business -- if you look at it organically, our OUS business has historically grown faster than the U.S. business. It's just we keep buying things that have the same kind of footprint we do, which is heavily U.S. So the inorganic side has grown faster in the U.S. than OUS, with the exception of Synergy, and Synergy did change our footprint a fair amount because we do outsourcing largely in the U.K. and also in Europe. 
So -- but at a high level, yes, we're attuned in any market where that -- if you use the market loosely, any country where they're accepting of the type of services that we do, and we're looking for ways to amend our products and services such that they're more acceptable outside the United States."

It's just the way we kind of think about it, so we have to manage that. But in general, our expectation is when we're doing things that if we grow we should become more efficient as we grow.

Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 44.2% and was favorably impacted by productivity, price, mix and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor and material costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 19.5% of revenue, an increase of 160 basis points from the first quarter last year, despite an increase in S G&A expenses, mostly relating to higher incentive compensation given the strength of the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items, primarily the benefit related to stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 23% to $105 million and earnings increased to $1.23 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and the lower tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended June with $238.1 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $49.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $47.1 million. Free cash flow for the first 3 months declined as anticipated to $59.6 million due to the increased capital spending. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

As you've already heard from Mike, we started fiscal 2020, stronger than expected, with growth, meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments. The additional volume and the lower effective tax rate dr",702,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. As you've already heard from Mike, we started fiscal 2020, stronger than expected, with growth, meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments. The additional volume and the lower effective tax rate drove earnings above our expectations for the quarter. Based on our performance in the first quarter and revised expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are now updating our full year outlook. Starting with revenue. We now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal 2020, up 100 basis points from our original 5% to 6% range. The updated revenue forecast suggests that the outperformance in the first quarter holds for the year and that we will experience somewhat higher volumes than we originally planned over the remaining course of the year. The 2 segments of our business that are driving the increased volume growth for the year versus our original plan, our health care products and AST. Health care products is seeing improved demand for both consumables and capital equipment. Our new products have helped grow consumable sales in sterility assurance, instrument cleaning chemistries and V-PRO consumables. On the capital equipment side, we have a strong backlog of capital equipment orders and a healthy pipeline going forward. When our capital equipment grows significantly, we can run into capacity constraints in our shared manufacturing facilities in any given period. Our revenue forecast recognizes our efforts to run our plants at normalized run rates throughout the year, which creates some risk for potential timing issues and capital equipment shipments at quarter end and year-end. The ASG segment continues to deliver strong growth as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues, and we feel the capacity of the expansions we have made in past years. This encourages us about our significant expansion plans for AST that we have previously reported. With the additional volume growth, we are for the total company, we are increasingly comfortable with approximately 75 basis point improvement in EBIT margin percentage. We also anticipate that our effective tax rate for FY '20 will be at the low end of our original guidance of 19% to 20% with all these factors considered, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.53, up $0.10 from our original outlook. While our first quarter exceeded consensus by $0.12. It did not meet our internal plan by that much. As a result, we continue to expect earnings in our revised forecast to be weighted about 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half. The rest of our outlook is unchanged as we continue to expect about $280 million in capital spending to fuel future organic growth in our businesses and $300 million in free cash flow for the year. Our capital spending has started the year a bit light, as Mike has said, but we expect it to ramp up over the next 3 quarters as our projects move forward. 
On a completely different note, as you likely saw in our proxy, we have several board members retire as of our annual meeting. Loyal Wilson had the foresight to be the initial primary investor in Steris over 30 years ago, has served on our board ever since and has made innumerable contributions over his tenure. Dr. Michael Wood have been a board member for 15 years and has brought a unique perspective on the surgeon, and former CEO of the Mayoclinic. And Sir. Duncan, former Head of the NHS in the U.K., joined our board several years ago as the result of our combination with Synergy Health, where he was Chairman and a long-standing board member. All 3 of these individuals have made significant contributions to our company over many years. We thank them for their service and wish him the very best. In closing, we started this year strong and continue to expect another year of record performance in FY '20. We believe the short-term and the long-term future for Steris is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support. We are now pleased to take any questions you may have. Julie, can you start Q&A, please."

We've talked about this before, we continue to put capacity in places where our medical device customers are expanding. And we haven't seen our -- the OEMs who are making these devices, generally speaking, haven't been building capacity for that growth. So by definition, they're outsourcing more. And we have had the good fortune of picking up probably more than our fair share of that growth due to having our plants in the right places. And that's why we have continued expanding kind of on the come, if you will, for the next 10 years, and we will continue to do that. So we're comfortable that we're growing a bit faster than the market, but I don't think it's radically faster and it's not due to any particular big swing of a customer at the customer be or someone from a customer moving to us. Our -- we call this churn, our net churn has been roughly constant for quite a while. We have picked up positively for quite a while, but it's not our range.

And as you know, we've grown backlog a lot in the last 12 months. And so if it drops off a little bit on concerned. There's some point which, in fact, we have 2 types of orders, some that ship in 12 to 18 months and some that ships in more like more like 6 to 9 in health care and 12 to 24 in life science. But there are some points, if you have a lot of your backlog that is ASAP-type backlog, having too much actually is a problem.

If we look at this quarter, really across segments in the medical device world, there's this whole kind of strength. And I don't know, I think, pointing to any specifics. I'm curious if you're seeing anything that's maybe driving an increase in surgical procedures or operations?"

We clearly are seeing strength in medical devices in terms of volumes. Every hospital that I've talked to recently tells me their OR is busy. And so we're seeing those facilities busy. Now you have to separate, you ask",404,"Yes. Well, no, you're exactly right. We clearly are seeing strength in medical devices in terms of volumes. Every hospital that I've talked to recently tells me their OR is busy. And so we're seeing those facilities busy. Now you have to separate, you asked about hospitals, you have to separate inpatient care from inpatient surgeries from outpatient surgeries. And for our purposes, we don't really care if the surgery is inpatient or outpatient. And by the way, I use surgery in the broadest sense, it can be any number of procedures like endoscopic procedures where our U.S. endoscopy business works really well if they're doing nose procedures. So it's procedures in hospitals and/or ambulatory surgery centers or GI centers or other procedural centers. In our view, it has clearly been strong. We've said before, for the long term, if you look at the high level. For the long term, we have the baby boom in North America running through it in much of Western Europe. And that baby boom wants to have new hips and new shoulders and a sculpt knee and multiple other issues. And as fast as ambulatory surgery is growing, which it is. And ambulatory surgery in the U.S., at least, the fastest-growing area for our business. As fast as it's growing, it's also getting more complexity. So -- and they need to do have real sterilization capabilities and ambulatory surgery centers and other GI centers. And by the same token, there are more and more complex surgeries being done in the acute settings. And so even though it looks like, Oh, gee, we only did 5 surgeries, but if 2 of them are double transplants, that's very different than doing 5 sculpt knees. So I think both the complexity of surgeries in acute care continues to rise. In ambulatory surgery, we're seeing faster growth as the less intensive procedures were moving more and more in the ambulatory setting where patients want them to be. And we have this push of the baby boom coming through, who is going to require more and more in all, I'll call it, the western world or the industrialized world. And then the nonindustrialized world as their GDP per capita rises, more and more people can afford this kind of health care. So we think the long-term outlook for the rate of procedures is quite good, which is why we've invested in that space."

First of all, vis-à-vis Brexit and -- well, vis-a-vis Brexit. We said at the time, we were pretty sure there was about $5 million pull forward, and we had no idea how much else it might be. And so we were guessing in the $5 million to $10 million range. We still don't really know because we don't have visibility to all that space. But the fact that the quarter stayed very strong suggest that it wasn't $10 million. It was probably closer to the $5 million number that we're well aware of, plus or minus $1 million or $2 million. So we're feeling a bit more comfortable that it was the known numbers plus a little as opposed to the unknown numbers times, 2 or 3 or 4. So and so that's point one. Point 2, given the fact Brexit is not adjudicated. We do think whatever that number is, some point in the future, and I suspect it would be after it may be well after the dust settles on how the U.K. is going to Brexit or not. But I wouldn't see I think, just speaking from ourselves, the buildup we've made. We're not planning to pull it down and then build it back up again. We're just letting it sit there until they sort out Brexit. So I think that's the most logical thing. So you tell me when and how they're going to Brexit. And I'll give you the answer. But I think we're more comfortable in the few million dollars range. In terms of our plant closure, we saw exactly what we expected. There was order pull forward and those orders fell off in the quarter so that we're over that, that's done. That's part of the reason we feel comfortable even more comfortable with our forecast because we absorbed that without, in fact, not only without a loss, but that still was at our plan. So we absorbed that one. And in terms of the product closures, that will still be out there over probably the next 12 to 15 months, but it's relatively small numbers, will be spread over a large number of months. So I don't think you'll notice it. I think I hit all the topics there, Matt. Yes, I think you got them all."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant-currency organic revenue growth was 10%, driven by volume and 120 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 44.2% and was favorably impacted by productivity, price, mix and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor and material costs. 
EBIT margin for the quarter was 19.5% of revenue, an increase of 160 basis points from the first quarter last year, despite an increase in SG&A expenses mostly relating to higher incentive compensation given the strength of the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items, primarily the benefit related to stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 23% to $105 million and earnings increased to $1.23 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and the lower tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended June with $238.1 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $49.8 million while depreciation and amortization was $47.1 million. Free cash flow for the first 3 months declined as anticipated to $59.6 million due to the increased capital spending.

As you've already heard from Mike, we started fiscal 2020 stronger than expected, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments.

As you've already heard from Mike, we started fiscal 2020 stronger than expected, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments. The additional volume and the lower effective tax rate drove earnings above our expectations for the quarter. 
Based on our performance in the first quarter and revised expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are now updating our full year outlook. Starting with revenue. We now expect constant-currency organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal 2020, up 100 basis points from our original 5% to 6% range. The updated revenue forecast suggests that the outperformance in the first quarter holds for the year and that we will experience somewhat higher volumes than we originally planned over the remaining course of the year. The 2 segments of our business that are driving the increased volume growth for the year versus our original plan are Healthcare Products and AST. 
Healthcare Products is seeing improved demand for both consumables and capital equipment. Our new products have helped grow consumable sales in sterility assurance, instrument cleaning chemistries and V-PRO consumables. On the capital equipment side, we have a strong backlog of capital equipment orders and a healthy pipeline going forward. When our capital equipment grows significantly, we can run into capacity constraints in our shared manufacturing facilities in any given period. Our revenue forecast recognizes our efforts to run our plants at normalized run rates throughout the year, which creates some risk for potential timing issues in capital equipment shipments at quarter ends and year-ends. 
The AST segment continues to deliver strong growth as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues, and we fill the capacity of the expansions we have made in past years. This encourages us about our significant expansion plans for AST that we have previously reported. 
With the additional volume growth, we are -- for the total company, we are increasingly comfortable with approximately a 75 basis point improvement in EBIT margin percentage. We also anticipate that our effective tax rate for FY '20 will be at the low end of our original guidance of 19% to 20%. With all these factors considered, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.53, up $0.10 from our original outlook. 
While our first quarter exceeded consensus by $0.12, it did not meet our internal plan by that much. As a result, we continue to expect earnings in our revised forecast to be weighted about 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half. The rest of our outlook is unchanged as we continue to expect about $280 million in capital spending to fuel future organic growth in our businesses and $300 million in free cash flow for the year. Our capital spending has started the year a bit light, as Mike has said, but we expect it to ramp up over the next 3 quarters as our projects move forward. 
On a completely different note, as you likely saw in our proxy, we had several Board members retire as of our annual meeting. Loyal Wilson had the foresight to be the initial primary investor in Steris over 30 years ago, has served on our Board ever since and has made innumerable contributions over his tenure. Dr. Michael Wood has been a Board member for 15 years and has brought a unique perspective as a surgeon and former CEO of the Mayo Clinic. And Sir Duncan Nichol, former Head of the NHS in the U.K., joined our Board several years ago as the result of our combination with Synergy Health, where he was Chairman and a longstanding Board member. 
All 3 of these individuals have made significant contributions to our company over many years. We thank them for their service, and wish them the very best. 
In closing, we started this year strong and continue to expect another year of record performance in FY '20. We believe the short-term and the long-term future for Steris is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support."

And that's why we have continued expanding kind of on the calm, if you will, for the next 10 years, and we will continue to do that. 
So we are comfortable that we're growing a bit faster than the market, but I don't think it's radically faster. And it's not due to any particular big swing of customer A to customer B or someone from -- a customer moving to us. Our -- we call this churn. Our net churn has been roughly constant for quite a while. We have picked up positively for quite a while, but it's not out of range. So this is, call it, for lack of a better term, true growth in picking up the growth of the device customers, and we are obviously getting a little bit better than our fair share."

We're not seeing any deceleration of, I'll call it, pipeline or order pipeline coming in. In fact, if anything, it would be the opposite. So backlog is a relatively small piece of orders, and it's orders minus shipments. So we shipped a bit more in this quarter than you might have expected, and the backlog fell a little bit. But in terms of order, order rates, pipeline, we're not seeing any decline. So this is a temporal change, which often happens in capital at any given quarter. And as you know, we've grown backlog a lot in the last 12 months. And so if it drops off a little bit, it doesn't concern us. 
There's some point in which -- in fact, we have 2 types of orders: some that ship in 12 to 18 months and some that ships in -- these are more like 6 to 9 in health care and 12 to 24 in life science. But there are some points, if you have a lot of your backlog that is ASAP-type backlog, having too much actually is a problem. So if we have a bunch of ASAP orders from customers, we try to get them out as quickly as we can.

I mentioned the ones where we've seen some kind of significant growth. I mentioned that in the text. The -- call it, the sterility assurance products are growing quite nicely for us right now. We have a number of new products in that space. V-PRO, V-PRO is driven not by new consumables but by new products, new capital products as we place those new capital products, and we have just a completely new line of V-PRO now.

So -- and then, our ICC business. Again, we have multiple new products in the instrument cleaning chemistries, and those are just continuing to take hold. We think we have the best line in ICC now by a significant margin. So they continue to grow. 
So it's not any one product. And there's a series of also sterilizers and washers, particularly for Europe. We're not seeing any one product be a dominant force here. It's just multiple products and the combination of them, washers, sterilizers and the things that go with them, ORI and tables and lights and the things that go with them.

We clearly are seeing strength in medical devices in terms of volumes. Every hospital that I've talked to recently tells me their OR is busy, and so we're seeing those facilities busy. Now you have to separate -- you a",407,"Yes. Well, no, you're exactly right. We clearly are seeing strength in medical devices in terms of volumes. Every hospital that I've talked to recently tells me their OR is busy, and so we're seeing those facilities busy. Now you have to separate -- you asked about hospitals. You have to separate inpatient care from inpatient surgeries from outpatient surgeries. And for our purposes, we don't really care if the surgery is inpatient or outpatient. And by the way, I use surgery in the broadest sense. It can be any number of procedures like endoscopic procedures where our U.S. endoscopy business works really well if they're doing those procedures. So it's procedures in hospitals and/or ambulatory surgery centers or GI centers or other procedural centers. 
In our view, it has clearly been strong. We've said before, for the long term -- if you look at the high level, for the long term, we have the baby boom in North America running through in much of Western Europe. And that baby boom wants to have new hips and new shoulders and a sculpt knee and multiple other issues and as fast as ambulatory surgery is growing, which it is -- and ambulatory surgery in the U.S. at least is fastest growing area for our business. As fast as it's growing, it's also getting more complexity. So -- and they need to do have real sterilization capabilities in ambulatory surgery centers and other GI centers. 
And by the same token, there are more and more complex surgeries being done in the acute settings. And so even though it looks like, ""Oh, gee, we only did 5 surgeries,"" but if 2 of them are double transplants, that's very different than doing 5 sculpt knees. So I think both the complexity of surgeries in acute care continues to rise. In ambulatory surgery, we're seeing faster growth as the less intensive procedures are moving more and more in the ambulatory setting where patients want them to be. And we have this push of the baby boom coming through, who is going to require more and more in all, I'll call it, the western world or the industrialized world. And then the nonindustrialized world, as their GDP per capita rises, more and more people can afford this kind of health care. So we think the long-term outlook for the rate of procedures is quite good, which is why we've invested in that space."

And I'll kind of try to walk through the 2 or 3 items that you've mentioned sequentially. First of all, vis-à-vis Brexit and -- well, vis-a-vis Brexit, we said at the time we were pretty sure there was about $5 million pull forward, and we had no idea how much else it might be. And so we were guessing in the $5 million to $10 million range. We still don't really know because we don't have visibility to all that space. But the fact that the quarter stayed very strong suggests that it wasn't $10 million. It was probably closer to the $5 million number that we were well aware of,  plus or minus $1 million or $2 million. But -- so we're feeling a bit more comfortable that it was the known numbers plus a little as opposed to the unknown numbers times 2 or 3 or 4. So -- and so that's point 1. 
Point 2, given the fact Brexit is not adjudicated, we do think whatever that number is, some point in the future, and I suspect it would be after -- it may be well after the dust settles on how the U.K. is going to Brexit or not, I would -- but I wouldn't see I think -- just speaking from ourselves, the buildup we've made, we're not planning to pull it down and then build it back up again. We're just letting it sit there until they sort out Brexit. And we think -- I think that's the most logical thing. So you tell me when and how they're going to exit and I'll give you the answer. But I think we're more comfortable within the few million dollar range. 
In terms of our plant closure, we saw exactly what we expected. There was order pull forward, and those orders fell off in the quarter so that we're over that, that's done. That's part of the reason we feel comfortable -- even more comfortable with our forecast because we absorbed that without -- in fact, not only without a loss, but that still was at our plan. So we absorbed that one. And in terms of the product closures, that will still be out there over probably the next 12 to 15 months. But it's relatively small numbers and will be spread over a large number of months, so I don't think you'll notice it. I think I hit all the topics there, Matt."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant-currency organic revenue growth was 10%, driven by volume and 120 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 44.2% and was favorably impacted by productivity, price, mix and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor and material costs. 
EBIT margin for the quarter was 19.5% of revenue, an increase of 160 basis points from the first quarter last year, despite an increase in SG&A expenses mostly relating to higher incentive compensation given the strength of the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items, primarily the benefit related to stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 23% to $105 million and earnings increased to $1.23 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and the lower tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended June with $238.1 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $49.8 million while depreciation and amortization was $47.1 million. Free cash flow for the first 3 months declined as anticipated to $59.6 million due to the increased capital spending.

As you've already heard from Mike, we started fiscal 2020 stronger than expected, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments.

As you've already heard from Mike, we started fiscal 2020 stronger than expected, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments. The additional volume and the lower effective tax rate drove earnings above our expectations for the quarter. 
Based on our performance in the first quarter and revised expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are now updating our full year outlook. Starting with revenue. We now expect constant-currency organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal 2020, up 100 basis points from our original 5% to 6% range. The updated revenue forecast suggests that the outperformance in the first quarter holds for the year and that we will experience somewhat higher volumes than we originally planned over the remaining course of the year. The 2 segments of our business that are driving the increased volume growth for the year versus our original plan are Healthcare Products and AST. 
Healthcare Products is seeing improved demand for both consumables and capital equipment. Our new products have helped grow consumable sales in sterility assurance, instrument cleaning chemistries and V-PRO consumables. On the capital equipment side, we have a strong backlog of capital equipment orders and a healthy pipeline going forward. When our capital equipment grows significantly, we can run into capacity constraints in our shared manufacturing facilities in any given period. Our revenue forecast recognizes our efforts to run our plants at normalized run rates throughout the year, which creates some risk for potential timing issues in capital equipment shipments at quarter ends and year-ends. 
The AST segment continues to deliver strong growth as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues, and we fill the capacity of the expansions we have made in past years. This encourages us about our significant expansion plans for AST that we have previously reported. 
With the additional volume growth, we are -- for the total company, we are increasingly comfortable with approximately a 75 basis point improvement in EBIT margin percentage. We also anticipate that our effective tax rate for FY '20 will be at the low end of our original guidance of 19% to 20%. With all these factors considered, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.53, up $0.10 from our original outlook. 
While our first quarter exceeded consensus by $0.12, it did not meet our internal plan by that much. As a result, we continue to expect earnings in our revised forecast to be weighted about 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half. The rest of our outlook is unchanged as we continue to expect about $280 million in capital spending to fuel future organic growth in our businesses and $300 million in free cash flow for the year. Our capital spending has started the year a bit light, as Mike has said, but we expect it to ramp up over the next 3 quarters as our projects move forward. 
On a completely different note, as you likely saw in our proxy, we had several Board members retire as of our annual meeting. Loyal Wilson had the foresight to be the initial primary investor in Steris over 30 years ago, has served on our Board ever since and has made innumerable contributions over his tenure. Dr. Michael Wood has been a Board member for 15 years and has brought a unique perspective as a surgeon and former CEO of the Mayo Clinic. And Sir Duncan Nichol, former Head of the NHS in the U.K., joined our Board several years ago as the result of our combination with Synergy Health, where he was Chairman and a longstanding Board member. 
All 3 of these individuals have made significant contributions to our company over many years. We thank them for their service and wish them the very best. 
In closing, we started this year strong and continue to expect another year of record performance in FY '20. We believe the short-term and the long-term future for Steris is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support."

And then there's been just good underlying generic increases. We've talked about this before. We continue to put capacity in places where our medical device customers are expanding. And we haven't seen our -- the OEMs who are making these devices, generally speaking, haven't been building capacity for that growth. So by definition, they're outsourcing more, and we have had the good fortune of picking up probably more than our fair share of that growth due to having our plants in the right places. And that's why we have continued expanding kind of on the come, if you will, for the next 10 years, and we will continue to do that. 
So we are comfortable that we're growing a bit faster than the market, but I don't think it's radically faster. And it's not due to any particular big swing of customer A to customer B or someone from -- a customer moving to us. Our -- we call this churn.

But in terms of order, order rates, pipeline, we're not seeing any decline. So this is a temporal change, which often happens in capital in any given quarter. And as you know, we've grown backlog a lot in the last 12 months. And so if it drops off a little bit, it doesn't concern us. 
There's some point in which -- in fact, we have 2 types of orders: some that ship in 12 to 18 months and some that ship in -- these are more like 6 to 9 in health care and 12 to 24 in life science. But there are some points, if you have a lot of your backlog that is ASAP-type backlog, having too much actually is a problem. So when we have a bunch of ASAP orders from customers, we try to get them out as quickly as we can. So this does not concern us at all, and it does not reflect any concern in our view of orders coming in or pipeline for orders."

So -- and then, our ICC business. Again, we have multiple new products in the instrument cleaning chemistries, and those are just continuing to take hold. We think we have the best line in ICC now by a significant margin. So they continue to grow.

We clearly are seeing strength in medical devices in terms of volumes. Every hospital that I've talked to recently tells me their OR is busy, and so we're seeing those facilities busy. Now you have to separate -- you a",407,"Yes. Well, no, you're exactly right. We clearly are seeing strength in medical devices in terms of volumes. Every hospital that I've talked to recently tells me their OR is busy, and so we're seeing those facilities busy. Now you have to separate -- you asked about hospitals. You have to separate inpatient care from inpatient surgeries from outpatient surgeries. And for our purposes, we don't really care if the surgery is inpatient or outpatient. And by the way, I use surgery in the broadest sense. It can be any number of procedures like endoscopic procedures where our U.S. endoscopy business works really well if they're doing those procedures. So it's procedures in hospitals and/or ambulatory surgery centers or GI centers or other procedural centers. 
In our view, it has clearly been strong. We've said before, for the long term -- if you look at the high level, for the long term, we have the baby boom in North America running through and much of Western Europe. And that baby boom wants to have new hips and new shoulders and a scoped knee and multiple other issues. And as fast as ambulatory surgery is growing, which it is -- and ambulatory surgery in the U.S. at least is fastest growing area for our business. As fast as it's growing, it's also getting more complexity. So -- and they need to do have real sterilization capabilities in ambulatory surgery centers and other GI centers. 
And by the same token, there are more and more complex surgeries being done in the acute settings. And so even though it looks like, ""Oh, gee, we only did 5 surgeries,"" but if 2 of them are double transplants, that's very different than doing 5 scoped knees. So I think both the complexity of surgeries in acute care continues to rise. In ambulatory surgery, we're seeing faster growth as the less intensive procedures are moving more and more in the ambulatory setting where patients want them to be. And we have this push of the baby boom coming through, who is going to require more and more in all, I'll call it, the western world or the industrialized world. And then the nonindustrialized world, as their GDP per capita rises, more and more people can afford this kind of health care. So we think the long-term outlook for the rate of procedures is quite good, which is why we've invested in that space."

And I'll kind of try to walk through the 2 or 3 items that you've mentioned sequentially. First of all, vis-à-vis Brexit and -- well, vis-a-vis Brexit, we said at the time we were pretty sure there was about $5 million pull forward, and we had no idea how much else it might be. And so we were guessing in the $5 million to $10 million range. We still don't really know because we don't have visibility to all that space. But the fact that the quarter stayed very strong suggests that it wasn't $10 million. It was probably closer to the $5 million number that we were well aware of,  plus or minus $1 million or $2 million. But -- so we're feeling a bit more comfortable that it was the known numbers plus a little as opposed to the unknown numbers times 2 or 3 or 4. So -- and so that's point 1. 
Point 2, given the fact Brexit is not adjudicated, we do think whatever that number is, some point in the future, and I suspect it would be after -- it may be well after the dust settles on how the U.K. is going to Brexit or not, I would -- but I wouldn't see I think -- just speaking from ourselves, the buildup we've made, we're not planning to pull it down and then build it back up again. We're just letting it sit there until they sort out Brexit. And we think -- I think that's the most logical thing. So you tell me when and how they're going to exit and I'll give you the answer. But I think we're more comfortable within the few million dollar range. 
In terms of our plant closure, we saw exactly what we expected. There was order pull forward, and those orders fell off in the quarter so that -- we're over that, that's done. That's part of the reason we feel comfortable -- even more comfortable with our forecast because we absorbed that without -- in fact, not only without a loss, but that still was at our plan. So we absorbed that one. And in terms of the product closures, that will still be out there over probably the next 12 to 15 months. But it's relatively small numbers and will be spread over a large number of months, so I don't think you'll notice it. I think I hit all the topics there, Matt."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant-currency organic revenue growth was 10% driven by volume and 120 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 44.2% and was favorably impacted by productivity, price, mix and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor and material costs. 
EBIT margin for the quarter was 19.5% of revenue, an increase of 160 basis points from the first quarter last year, despite an increase in SG&A expenses mostly relating to higher incentive compensation given the strength of the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items, primarily the benefit related to stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 23% to $105 million and earnings increased to $1.23 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and the lower tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended June with $238.1 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $49.8 million while depreciation and amortization was $47.1 million. Free cash flow for the first 3 months declined as anticipated to $59.6 million due to the increased capital spending. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."
34783,630573133,1801036,"STERIS plc, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2019",2019-08-06,"Earnings Calls","STERIS plc","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. As you've already heard from Mike, we started fiscal 2020 stronger than expected, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments.

As you've already heard from Mike, we started fiscal 2020 stronger than expected, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments. The additional volume and the lower effective tax rate drove earnings above our expectations for the quarter. 
Based on our performance in the first quarter and revised expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are now updating our full year outlook. Starting with revenue. We now expect constant-currency organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal 2020, up 100 basis points from our original 5% to 6% range. The updated revenue forecast suggests that the outperformance in the first quarter holds for the year and that we will experience somewhat higher volumes than we originally planned over the remaining course of the year. The 2 segments of our business that are driving the increased volume growth for the year versus our original plan are Healthcare Products and AST. 
Healthcare Products is seeing improved demand for both consumables and capital equipment. Our new products have helped grow consumable sales in sterility assurance, instrument cleaning chemistries and V-PRO consumables. On the capital equipment side, we have a strong backlog of capital equipment orders and a healthy pipeline going forward. When our capital equipment grows significantly, we can run into capacity constraints in our shared manufacturing facilities in any given period. Our revenue forecast recognizes our efforts to run our plants at normalized run rates throughout the year, which creates some risk for potential timing issues in capital equipment shipments at quarter ends and year-ends. 
The AST segment continues to deliver strong growth as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues, and we fill the capacity of the expansions we have made in past years. This encourages us about our significant expansion plans for AST that we have previously reported. 
With the additional volume growth, we are -- for the total company, we are increasingly comfortable with approximately a 75 basis point improvement in EBIT margin percentage. We also anticipate that our effective tax rate for FY '20 will be at the low end of our original guidance of 19% to 20%. With all these factors considered, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.53, up $0.10 from our original outlook. 
While our first quarter exceeded consensus by $0.12, it did not meet our internal plan by that much. As a result, we continue to expect earnings in our revised forecast to be weighted about 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half. The rest of our outlook is unchanged as we continue to expect about $280 million in capital spending to fuel future organic growth in our businesses and $300 million in free cash flow for the year. Our capital spending has started the year a bit light, as Mike has said, but we expect it to ramp up over the next 3 quarters as our projects move forward. 
On a completely different note, as you likely saw in our proxy, we had several Board members retire as of our annual meeting. Loyal Wilson had the foresight to be the initial primary investor in Steris over 30 years ago, has served on our Board ever since and has made innumerable contributions over his tenure. Dr. Michael Wood has been a Board member for 15 years and has brought a unique perspective as a surgeon and former CEO of the Mayo Clinic. And Sir Duncan Nichol, former Head of the NHS in the U.K., joined our Board several years ago as the result of our combination with Synergy Health, where he was Chairman and a longstanding Board member. 
All 3 of these individuals have made significant contributions to our company over many years. We thank them for their service and wish them the very best. 
In closing, we started this year strong and continue to expect another year of record performance in FY '20. We believe the short-term and the long-term future for Steris is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support."

There's been some -- I think we reported last time some modest increase probably due to Brexit in Europe. There's been some modest increase due to the Chicago closing that you referred to. And then there's been just good underlying generic increases. We've talked about this before. We continue to put capacity in places where our medical device customers are expanding. And we haven't seen our -- the OEMs who are making these devices, generally speaking, haven't been building capacity for that growth. So by definition, they're outsourcing more, and we have had the good fortune of picking up probably more than our fair share of that growth due to having our plants in the right places. And that's why we have continued expanding kind of on the come, if you will, for the next 10 years, and we will continue to do that. 
So we are comfortable that we're growing a bit faster than the market, but I don't think it's radically faster. And it's not due to any particular big swing of customer A to customer B or someone from -- a customer moving to us. Our -- we call this churn.

We're not seeing any deceleration of, I'll call it, pipeline or order pipeline coming in. In fact, if anything, it would be the opposite. So backlog is a relatively small piece of orders, and it's orders minus shipments. So we shipped a bit more in this quarter than you might have expected, and the backlog fell a little bit. But in terms of order, order rates, pipeline, we're not seeing any decline. So this is a temporal change, which often happens in capital in any given quarter. And as you know, we've grown backlog a lot in the last 12 months. And so if it drops off a little bit, it doesn't concern us. 
There's some point in which -- in fact, we have 2 types of orders: some that ship in 12 to 18 months and some that ship in -- these are more like 6 to 9 in health care and 12 to 24 in life science. But there are some points, if you have a lot of your backlog that is ASAP-type backlog, having too much actually is a problem. So when we have a bunch of ASAP orders from customers, we try to get them out as quickly as we can. So this does not concern us at all, and it does not reflect any concern in our view of orders coming in or pipeline for orders."

And I might even be a little on the light side on the Healthcare Products side. So it's not any one silver bullet. It's just a lot of new products that are picking up steam. 
I mentioned the ones where we've seen some kind of significant growth. I mentioned that in the text. The -- call it, the sterility assurance products are growing quite nicely for us right now. We have a number of new products in that space. V-PRO, V-PRO is driven not by new consumables but by new products, new capital products as we place those new capital products, and we have just a completely new line of V-PRO now. And those new capital products does -- do drive the consumables or allow the consumables to grow. 
So -- and then, our ICC business. Again, we have multiple new products in the instrument cleaning chemistries, and those are just continuing to take hold. We think we have the best line in ICC now by a significant margin. So they continue to grow.

It's not so much a single product. It's the family of products working together that I think is the driver."

We clearly are seeing strength in medical devices in terms of volumes. Every hospital that I've talked to recently tells me their OR is busy, and so we're seeing those facilities busy. Now you have to separate -- you a",407,"Yes. Well, no, you're exactly right. We clearly are seeing strength in medical devices in terms of volumes. Every hospital that I've talked to recently tells me their OR is busy, and so we're seeing those facilities busy. Now you have to separate -- you asked about hospitals. You have to separate inpatient care from inpatient surgeries from outpatient surgeries. And for our purposes, we don't really care if the surgery is inpatient or outpatient. And by the way, I use surgery in the broadest sense. It can be any number of procedures like endoscopic procedures where our U.S. endoscopy business works really well if they're doing those procedures. So it's procedures in hospitals and/or ambulatory surgery centers or GI centers or other procedural centers. 
In our view, it has clearly been strong. We've said before, for the long term -- if you look at the high level, for the long term, we have the baby boom in North America running through and much of Western Europe. And that baby boom wants to have new hips and new shoulders and a scoped knee and multiple other issues. And as fast as ambulatory surgery is growing, which it is -- and ambulatory surgery in the U.S. at least is fastest growing area for our business. As fast as it's growing, it's also getting more complexity. So -- and they need to do have real sterilization capabilities in ambulatory surgery centers and other GI centers. 
And by the same token, there are more and more complex surgeries being done in the acute settings. And so even though it looks like, ""Oh, gee, we only did 5 surgeries,"" but if 2 of them are double transplants, that's very different than doing 5 scoped knees. So I think both the complexity of surgeries in acute care continues to rise. In ambulatory surgery, we're seeing faster growth as the less intensive procedures are moving more and more in the ambulatory setting where patients want them to be. And we have this push of the baby boom coming through, who is going to require more and more in all, I'll call it, the western world or the industrialized world. And then the nonindustrialized world, as their GDP per capita rises, more and more people can afford this kind of health care. So we think the long-term outlook for the rate of procedures is quite good, which is why we've invested in that space."

And I'll kind of try to walk through the 2 or 3 items that you've mentioned sequentially. First of all, vis-à-vis Brexit and -- well, vis-a-vis Brexit, we said at the time we were pretty sure there was about $5 million pull forward, and we had no idea how much else it might be. And so we were guessing in the $5 million to $10 million range. We still don't really know because we don't have visibility to all that space. But the fact that the quarter stayed very strong suggests that it wasn't $10 million. It was probably closer to the $5 million number that we were well aware of,  plus or minus $1 million or $2 million. But -- so we're feeling a bit more comfortable that it was the known numbers plus a little as opposed to the unknown numbers times 2 or 3 or 4. So -- and so that's point 1. 
Point 2, given the fact Brexit is not adjudicated, we do think whatever that number is, some point in the future, and I suspect it would be after -- it may be well after the dust settles on how the U.K. is going to Brexit or not, I would -- but I wouldn't see I think -- just speaking from ourselves, the buildup we've made, we're not planning to pull it down and then build it back up again. We're just letting it sit there until they sort out Brexit. And we think -- I think that's the most logical thing. So you tell me when and how they're going to exit and I'll give you the answer. But I think we're more comfortable within the few million dollar range. 
In terms of our plant closure, we saw exactly what we expected. There was order pull forward, and those orders fell off in the quarter so that -- we're over that, that's done. That's part of the reason we feel comfortable -- even more comfortable with our forecast because we absorbed that without -- in fact, not only without a loss, but that still was at our plan. So we absorbed that one. And in terms of the product closures, that will still be out there over probably the next 12 to 15 months. But it's relatively small numbers and will be spread over a large number of months, so I don't think you'll notice it. I think I hit all the topics there, Matt."

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 10%, driven by volume and 90 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. Gross margin for the quarter increased 150 basis points to 43.6% and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs. 
EBIT margin for the quarter was 20.3% of revenue, an increase of 150 basis points from the second quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.1%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items, primarily the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 21% to $113.1 million and earnings increased to $1.32 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended September with $225.5 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $48.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. Free cash flow for the first 6 months declined slightly, as anticipated, to $162 million, due to the planned increase in capital spending. However, we have not invested as much capital as we thought in the first half of the fiscal year, simply due to the timing of projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending by $20 million to $260 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $320 million. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt?"

The additiona",668,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. As you've already heard from Mike, our second quarter continued the trend of outperformance that began in our last fiscal year, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments. The additional volume, higher margin attainment and a lower effective tax rate combined to drive earnings above our expectations for the quarter. 
Based on our performance in the first half and our expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again updating our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5% for fiscal 2020, up 150 basis points from our prior range of 6% to 7%. The increase is due to outperformance of the underlying business as well as the impact of several small tuck-in acquisitions that we have completed, primarily in health care products. While none of the transactions are material on a stand-alone basis, when combined, we expect they will add about $30 million or 100 basis points to our constant currency organic revenue growth for the full fiscal year. 
For your modeling purposes, second quarter revenue benefited by about $5 million from these tuck-in acquisitions, with the balance to be spread across the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has challenging comparisons, which gives us some caution on the growth rate for the second half of the fiscal year. Health care products and AST are the 2 segments, principally driving this increased organic revenue growth. Health care products are seeing improved demand across the segment with steady growth in consumables, improved performance from service and ongoing strength in capital equipment. 
AST is delivering strong growth as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues and the capacity expansions that have come online in the past year or so have allowed us to meet that demand. 
Now as you may have read, several ethylene oxide facilities operated by others in the industry have been closed temporarily or permanently due to concerns around the emissions of ethylene oxide gas. The safe and efficient use of ethylene oxide sterilization is required to meet the global need for critical, life-saving and life-changing medical devices for patients. 
For context, approximately 50% of single-use medical devices around the globe that require sterilization are sterilized using ethylene oxide. These devices include items as simple as adhesive bandages and as complex as pacemakers and surgical kits. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we have picked up a modest amount of volume from customers who have been impacted by the closures. However, our U.S. ethylene oxide plants are running full, which will limit our ability to take on significant additional capacity in the second half. Given the strength we've seen so far this year across our business segments and the pipeline of business we see for the back half. We now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.50 to $5.65, up $0.12 from last quarter's outlook. 
The acquisitions discussed earlier are expected to add approximately $0.05 to our outlook in the second half, with the remainder coming from outperformance of the underlying business. The upper end of our earnings outlook range assumes no impact from the medical device excise tax in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is the calendar first quarter. Although we believe the device tax will be delayed or repealed around the first of the calendar year, the lower end of our range should absorb this possible uncertainty, if it is not. 
We've had a strong first half of the year and continue to expect another year of record performance in fiscal 2020. We believe the short-term and the long-term future for STERIS is bright. We appreciate your ongoing support and appreciate the work of the 12,000 people of STERIS, who are making that happen.

And fall all intensive purposes, it's the only gas used for this purpose around the world. The second answer to your question is, I do think this is more around fear than around science, and there are conversations going on that are scientifically don't make a lot of sense. And that's just one of the things that has happened in this process. But our view is we are absolutely adamant about running safe facilities. Safety may be the strongest virtue inside of STERIS. And when we talk about safety, we think that about the people that work with us and for us. And we also think about the community that we live in. So we are absolutely committed to safety. We have -- we know that we are at the, I'll call it, the better end or strong end of the industry in terms of the way we deploy everything about our facilities, not just how we handle gas. And also because we do it so much, we can look across plants and look for best ideas across those facilities. So we do think we are at the positive end of this spectrum. There's, as we understand it, roughly 100 plants around the country to do this kind of work. And so I'm sure there's a full spectrum of activity. So -- but I do think most of the conversation has not been handled scientifically. And I do think -- I applaud both the FDA and the EPA for working hard to manage this effort and to handle things scientifically in the process. And I think that's the way it will end up."

As you point out, when people have more ability to pay for things. They tend to do a little more, and then they have less ability to pay for. They do a little less. But since this is health care much of it or most of it is not -- not necessarily something one can decide to or not to do. There are some cosmetic procedures, obviously, where that's not the case. But those tend not to be driven by health care reimbursement, those tend to be driven more by personal payments. So in broad, it's just very clear that the number of procedures is rising. And in my view, it will continue to rise. We are -- right now, we're in the middle of the baby boom generation is in their mid-60s. And so we still have, I'll call it, the back half of the baby boom generation to get to the mid-60s. And really, it's the 60s and 70s, where we spend most of our money. So in terms of health care. So procedures are clearly rising. And as we've discussed, there's more and more going out to outpatient type facilities, both in hospital systems and outside of hospital systems. But at the same time, the hospitals feel busy and more and more complex procedures are being done. So for every arthroscopic knee that goes to outpatient, there's another transplant of hearts or lungs or something that stays in the inpatient. So even though the number may not be rising, the complexity continues to rise in the hospital settings. And then in many respects, in the outpatient setting. Their complexity is rising as well. And when you put all that together, that drives growth in the industry. I think you guys have seen the other medical device companies reporting and their reporting strength as well, and that's a function of procedures."

I believe those who attend the meeting. And for those who don't know this, I mean, the FDA has called in order to discuss potential alternatives to ethylene oxide and to discuss other sterilization methods. My personal view, we are presenting there. If you would like to see our -- some of our thoughts, if you will, in that space. The FDA asked for presenters. They chose the ones that they thought would be the better ones to discuss or not every presenter who requested to speak is speaking. So in any event, I think you will see what we largely know that is there are a lot of ways to sterilize things. And we know that because we use virtually all of them, some place somewhere. It is just certain methods of sterilization are better for certain activities. And at this moment in time, and I think for the -- certainly, the intermediate to long-term future, ethylene oxide is going to be a significant portion of that because it's particularly effective for single-use devices that cannot withstand heat or radiation and on the other hand, can accept that gas, and that gas is very gentle on the devices. And frankly, a lot of that is because it's been the method of choice by both the agency and medical device makers for decades now. And so everyone is designed around that, designed for that. So for a long time, in my opinion, that will be a significant method. And even though my earlier comments were, I believe, exactly what I said that we have a lot of non science being discussed. That doesn't mean in our view, that we can't continuously improve. We have been improving our processes and the way we manage that technology for decades now, and we will continue to improve that. And one of the biggest areas in our view is that -- and it's typical of a lean approach to things. And the key is not to remediate. The key is to use less. And so a year or so ago, up 2 years ago almost now, we had developed a procedure and process to do what we call sustainable ethylene oxide, and we have seen many of our customers accept that and and they can use maybe up to 50% less gas. And if you use 50% less gas, you have even lower than 50% less going out end of the year because some of the gas is used, obviously. And so in any event, we think that, that's a great approach. That's one of the things we will be discussing in the next couple of days at the agency. And we are seeing more and more customers for semi obvious reasons, thinking that, that's a good idea. So I think we'll see a much greater use of lower levels of gas to get the same level of sterilization. It's still sterile. We kill all the bugs. That's what sterile means, but we can do so with less gas."

And it was pretty phenomenal on top of a previous year, pretty phenomenal. And we just don't forecast beating beats all the time. And so our pause is related to the strength of the fourth quarter last year, not a lack of strength in our current business. And as I mentioned before, as our plants get more full, which they are getting pretty full right now. It is more difficult if you have built something for one customer. And they, at the last minute decided they're not going to take something. And if you have a lot of capacity, it's easy to flip that to another customer or to move things around. It is more difficult to do that when we're at the stronger end, if you will, of use of our capacity. Our guys have done a great job adding capacity without building buildings the last several years. And so we do have the ability to do that. We do have the ability to meet the forecast we have in place. But we have less flexibility at the last minute to move something. So it could slip out of the quarter. It only takes a couple of significant projects to move out of the quarter in order for us to have a little bit lower growth rate. 
I think your numbers might be a little low in terms of the numbers -- in terms of what the implied deceleration means. But -- and truthfully, we don't worry that much about quarters, the implied acceleration in the year is pretty positive. In terms of backlog, backlog is a function of orders coming in and shipments going out. And as you have seen, our shipments in health care have been extraordinary in the last 2 quarters. And as a result -- and our orders have been quite strong, and our pipeline continues quite strong. And so we have this temporal thing where we shipped a little bit more than the orders that came in, but you're talking minute levels, I think, a couple of million dollars or something like that year-over-year."

So if you were to back those out, you would add another $15 million, which I think would help solve the issue that you're looking for in still doing a nice job of generating solid free cash flow."

At the top of my head, that level of breakdown is a little tough. I will tell you that we do announce those on our website. And so if you want details, you could easily pick them up off of our website. But at a high level, I can say the preponderance of the openings, both U.S. and globally are radiation based, not ethylene oxide base, that we are growing our capacity in ethylene oxide, and have grown it in both the U.S. and OUS. And orders of magnitude, roughly in line with our expectation of what EO growth will be, which is more in that 5% to 7% range. And -- but on the other hand, on the radiation side, we have expected a bit faster growth and so we are growing our radiation business. Again, both in the U.S. and OUS more rapidly even than that have and continue to. And all things being equal, we are expanding much more in either e-beam or x-ray than we are in gamma radiation. And we see those as being complementary. And so generally speaking, we're expanding in either x-ray or e-beam in or both in or around facilities we already have as well as locating some in new sites. And the reason for that is customers may not be comfortable -- or said differently, would be more comfortable moving to x-ray or e-beam if they have cobalt backup is the one thing and also, it's also where the customers are that need radiation. So it's a combination of those 2 events. So generally speaking, we expect to see cobalt around a long, long, long time, but more of the growth of the business we expected to happen in either e-beam or x-ray. So those forms of radiation."

And they are, for lack of a better term, semi interchangeable. We happen to have subproduct of our own that we sterilize that we know we can do either way. Having said that, the preponderance of products are one or the other, because the -- it's not that they both wouldn't sterilize in most cases, there are some cases where they actually wouldn't sterilize because the radiation or gas can't get to the product. But generally speaking, they can sterilize what you ruin the product with the sterilization methodology. And so we -- obviously, we can't run the product while we're sterilizing. So at a high level, I would say it's -- and this is ballpark, but maybe 10% or 15% of either one could go either way, but we're not talking 90% that can go either way, it is at a high level. So there is some substitution possibility, but limited. 
Having said that, that's why we have virtually every form of sterilization under the planet because what is really good to do in hospitals for reprocessing where we commonly use is almost useless for most industrial sterilization, where we're doing it the first time in things that are pre packaged for a variety of reasons. The same is true for most of the gas versus and with stream, for example. Steam is commonly used in hospitals is completely irrelevant, industrial because that's already packaged. And so you would be running the packaging, if nothing else, and it probably wouldn't work anyway. So at a high level, it's very limited. Now when you come to the inside of radiation, x-ray versus e-beam versus cobalt, there, the combination of x-ray and cobalt, there's much more substitutability, if you will, and it varies based again on the device itself, the packaging of the device, the way it is put in place. So there is much more substitutability in radiation versus radiation, there is very limited, really, substitutability, gas to radiation at a high level."

It's only been around 6 or 7 years because I haven't said that for 6 to 7 years. The short answer is there is no business that we don't believe we can't improve. And so we're always working to improve it. In any business, there's a point at which, for any product line or any space, you risk creating a price umbrella and other competitors decide to take that business from you because of price, and we monitor that very carefully. We -- that's why, as you know, we we reduce costs faster than our profits rise because we tend to place some of that cost reduction back into price, if you will, or not raising prices. It's not that we're cutting prices, usually, it is that we're not raising prices. So that's part of our mantra. You are correct that you get to certain levels, you have to start watching that. But the other side of this, you have to remember is ROS, return on sales, is not the only determinant of whether things are priced correctly or whether it's hard or difficult to enter to compete. ROIC is also a very, very important component. In fact, more important component. And so some of those products that are making very healthy returns on sales, we have to invest an awful lot of capital to get there. And whether that capital is capital, intellectual property types of capital or whether that is purely capital spending kind of capital or inventory and receivables kind of capital, working capital, we also watch that very carefully. We're comfortable with where we are. And I'm not ready to declare an end. As I think I said maybe 4 or 5 years ago, when we get to '20, we'll talk about it. Well we're talking about it. So we're not feeling any natural cap in our business."

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 10%, driven by volume and 90 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new product. Gross margin for the quarter increased 150 basis points to 43.6% and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs.
EBIT margin for the quarter was 20.3% of revenue, an increase of 150 basis points from the second quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.1%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items, primarily the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 21% to $113.1 million and earnings increased to $1.32 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended September with $225.5 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt.
During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $48.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. Free cash flow for the first 6 months declined slightly, as anticipated, to $162 million due to the planned increase in capital spending. However, we have not invested as much capital as we thought in the first half of the fiscal year, simply due to the timing of projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending by $20 million to $260 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $320 million.

As you've already heard from Mike, our second quarter continued the trend of outperformance that began in our last fiscal year, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments. The additional volume, higher margin attainment and a lower effective tax rate combined to drive earnings above our expectations for the quarter. 
Based on our performance in the first half and our expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again updating our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5% for fiscal 2020, up 150 basis points from our prior range of 6% to 7%. The increase is due to outperformance of the underlying business as well as the impact of several small tuck-in acquisitions that we have completed, primarily in health care products. While none of the transactions are material on a stand-alone basis, when combined, we expect they will add about $30 million or 100 basis points to our constant currency organic revenue growth for the full fiscal year.
For your modeling purposes, second quarter revenue benefited by about $5 million from these tuck-in acquisitions, with the balance to be spread across the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has challenging comparisons, which gives us some caution on the growth rate for the second half of the fiscal year. Health care products and AST are the 2 segments principally driving this increased organic revenue growth. Health care products are seeing improved demand across the segment with steady growth in consumables, improved performance from service and ongoing strength in capital equipment. AST is delivering strong growth, as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues and the capacity expansions that have come online in the past year or so have allowed us to meet that demand.
Now as you may have read, several ethylene oxide facilities operated by others in the industry have been closed temporarily or permanently due to concerns around the emissions of ethylene oxide gas. The safe and efficient use of ethylene oxide sterilization is required to meet the global need for critical life-saving and life-changing medical devices for patients. For context, approximately 50% of single-use medical devices around the globe that require sterilization are sterilized using ethylene oxide. These devices include items as simple as adhesive bandages and as complex as pacemakers and surgical kits. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we have picked up a modest amount of volume from customers who have been impacted by the closures. However, our U.S. ethylene oxide plants are running full, which will limit our ability to take on significant additional capacity in the second half. Given the strength we've seen so far this year across our business segments and the pipeline of business we see for the back half, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.50 to $5.65, up $0.12 from last quarter's outlook.
The acquisitions discussed earlier are expected to add approximately $0.05 to our outlook in the second half, with the remainder coming from outperformance of the underlying business. The upper end of our earnings outlook range assumes no impact from the medical device excise tax in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is the calendar first quarter. Although we believe the device tax will be delayed or repealed around the first of the calendar year, the lower end of our range should absorb this possible uncertainty if it is not. 
We've had a strong first half of the year and continue to expect another year of record performance in fiscal 2020. We believe the short-term and the long-term future for STERIS is bright. We appreciate your ongoing support and appreciate the work of the 12,000 people of STERIS who are making that happen.

But our view is, we are absolutely adamant about running safe facilities. Safety may be the strongest virtue inside of STERIS. And when we talk about safety, we think that about the people that work with us and for us, and we also think about the community that we live in. So we are absolutely committed to safety. We have -- we know that we are at the, I'll call it, the better end or strong end of the industry in terms of the way we deploy everything about our facilities, not just how we handle gas. And also because we do it so much, we could look across plants and look for best ideas across those facilities. So we do think we are at the positive end of this spectrum. There's, as we understand it, roughly 100 plants around the country to do this kind of work. And so I'm sure there's a full spectrum of activity.

When people have more ability to pay for things, they tend to do a little more; and when they have less ability to pay for, they do a little less. But since this is health care much of it or most of it is not necessarily something one can decide to or not to do. There are some cosmetic procedures, obviously, where that's not the case, but those tend not to be driven by health care reimbursement; those tend to be driven more by personal payments. So in broad, it's just very clear that the number of procedures is rising, and in my view, it will continue to rise. We are right now where the middle of the baby boom generation is in their mid-60s. And so we still have, I'll call it, the back half of the baby boom generation to get to the mid-60s. And really, it's the 60s and 70s, where we spend most of our money. So in terms of health care. So procedures are clearly rising. And as we've discussed, there's more and more going out to outpatient-type facilities, both in in-hospital systems and outside of hospital systems. But at the same time, the hospital are still busy and more and more complex procedures are being done. So for every arthroscopic knee that goes to outpatient, there's another transplant of hearts or lungs or something that goes -- stays in the inpatient. So even though the number may not be rising, the complexity continues to rise in the hospital settings, and then in many respects, in the outpatient setting their complexity is rising as well. And when you put all that together, that drives growth in the industry. I think you guys have seen the other medical device companies reporting and their reporting strength as well, and that's a function of procedures."

And for those who don't know this, I mean, the FDA has called in order to discuss potential alternatives to ethylene oxide",520,"So -- well, I think, Larry, again, the agency is doing a good job of gathering information. I believe those who attend the meeting. And for those who don't know this, I mean, the FDA has called in order to discuss potential alternatives to ethylene oxide and to discuss other sterilization methods. My personal view, we are presenting there, if you would like to see our some of our thoughts, if you will, in that space. The FDA asked for presenters. They chose the ones that they thought would be the better ones to discuss or not every presenter who requested to speak is speaking. So in any event, I think you will see what we largely know that is there are a lot of ways to sterilize things. And we know that because we use virtually all of them, some place somewhere. It is just certain methods of sterilization are better for certain activities. And at this moment in time and I think for the -- certainly, the intermediate to long-term future, ethylene oxide is going to be a significant portion of that because it's particularly effective for single-use devices that cannot withstand heat or radiation, and on the other hand, can accept that gas and that gas is very gentle on the devices. And frankly, a lot of that is because it's been the method of choice by both the agency and medical device makers for decades now. And so everyone is designed around that, designed for that. So for a long time, in my opinion, that will be a significant method. And even though my earlier comments were, I believe, exactly what I said that we have a lot of nonscience being discussed, that doesn't mean, in our view, that we can't continuously improve. We have been improving our processes and the way we manage that technology for decades now and we will continue to improve that.
And one of the biggest areas in our view is that -- and it's typical of a lean approach to things. And the key is not to remediate, the key is to use less. And so a year or so ago, well, 2 years ago almost now, we had developed a procedure and process to do what we call sustainable ethylene oxide, and we have seen many of our customers accept that and they can use maybe up to 50% less gas. And if you use 50% less gas, you have even lower than 50% less going out into the air because some of the gas is used, obviously. And so in any event, we think that, that's a great approach. That's one of the things we will be discussing in the next couple of days at the agency. And we are seeing more and more customers for some of the obvious reasons, thinking that, that's a good idea. So I think we'll see a much greater use of lower levels of gas to get the same level of sterilization. It's still sterile. We kill all the bugs. That's what sterile means, but we can do so with less gas."

And it was pretty phenomenal on top of a previous year, pretty phenomenal. And we just don't forecast beating beats all the time. And so our pause is related to the strength of the fourth quarter last year, not a lack of strength in our current business. And as I mentioned before, as our plants get more full, which they are getting pretty full right now, it is more difficult if you have built something for one customer, and they, at the last minute decide they're not going to take something. And if you have a lot of capacity, it's easy to flip that to another customer or to move things around. It is more difficult to do that when we're at the stronger end, if you will, of use of our capacity. Our guys have done a great job adding capacity without building buildings in the last several years. And so we do have the ability to do that. We do have the ability to meet the forecast we have in place. But we have less flexibility at the last minute to move something. So it could slip out of the quarter. It only takes a couple of significant projects to move out of the quarter in order for us to have a little bit lower growth rate.
I think your numbers might be a little low in terms of the numbers -- in terms of what the ""implied deceleration means."" But -- and truthfully, we don't worry that much about quarters, the implied acceleration in the year is pretty positive. In terms of backlog, backlog is a function of orders coming in and shipments going out. And as you have seen, our shipments in health care have been extraordinary in the last 2 quarters. And as a result -- and our orders have been quite strong, and our pipeline continues quite strong. And so we have this temporal thing where we shipped a little bit more than the orders that came in, but you're talking minute levels, I think, a couple of million dollars or something like that year-over-year."

So that's -- those are the positive things. Now we did leave the range in earnings roughly the same, which for the year, we only have half a year to go, but we still haven't seen device tax sort out. We still haven't seen Brexit sort out. We still haven't -- trade is an every-other-day conversation. So we left the range as it is because we do think there's a bit more uncertainty of what may occur.

At the top of my head, that level of breakdown is a little tough. I will tell you that we do announce those on our website. And so if you want details, you could easily pick them up off of our website. But at a high level, I can say the preponderance of the openings, both U.S. and globally, are radiation-based, not ethylene-oxide-based; that we are growing our capacity in ethylene oxide; and we have grown it in both the U.S. and OUS. In orders of magnitude, roughly in line with our expectation of what EO growth will be, which is more in that 5% to 7% range. And -- but on the other hand, on the radiation side, we have expected a bit faster growth, and so we are growing our radiation business, again, both in the U.S. and OUS, more rapidly even in than that half and continue to.
And all things being equal, we are expanding much more in either e-beam or X-ray than we are in Cobalt gamma radiation. And we see those as being complementary. And so generally speaking, we're expanding in either X-ray or e-beam, or both, in or around Cobalt facilities we already have as well as locating some in new sites. And the reason for that is customers may not be comfortable, or said differently, would be more comfortable moving to X-ray or e-beam if they have Cobalt backup as the one thing; and also, that's also where the customers are that need radiation. So it's a combination of those 2 events. So generally speaking, we expect to see Cobalt around a long, long, long time, but more of the growth of the business we expect to happen in either e-beam or X-ray. So those forms of radiation."

In those, they are, for lack of a better term, semi interchangeable. We happen to have a subproduct of our own that we sterilize, that we know we can do either way. Having said that, the preponderance of products are one or the other, because the -- it's not that they both wouldn't sterilize in most cases. There are some cases where they actually wouldn't sterilize because the radiation or gas can't get to the product. But generally speaking, they could sterilize, but you'll ruin the product with the sterilization methodology. And so we -- obviously, we can't ruin the product while we're sterilizing. So at a high level, I would say, it's -- and this is ballpark, but maybe 10% or 15% of either one could go either way, but we are not talking 90% that can go either way. It is at a high level. So there is some substitution possibility, but limited. 
Having said that, that's why we have virtually every form of sterilization under the planet because what is really good to do in hospitals for reprocessing where we commonly use hydrogen peroxide is almost useless for most industrial sterilization where we're doing it the first time in things that are prepackaged, for a variety of reasons. The same is true for most of the gas versus -- and with steam, for example. Steam is commonly used in hospitals. It's completely irrelevant in industrial because that's already packaged. And so you would be running the packaging, if nothing else, and it probably wouldn't work anyway. So at a high level, it's very limited. Now when you come to the inside of radiation, X-ray versus e-beam versus Cobalt, there, the combination of X-ray and Cobalt, there's much more substitutability, if you will. And it varies based, again, on the device itself, the packaging of the device, the way it is put in place. So there is much more substitutability in radiation versus radiation. There is very limited, really, substitutability, gas to radiation at a high level."

But the other side of this you have to remember is, ROS, return on sales, is not the only determinant of whether things are priced correctly or whether it's hard or difficult to enter to compete. ROIC is also a very, very important component, in fact, more important component. And so some of those products that are making very healthy returns on sales, we have to invest an awful lot of capital to get there. And whether that capital is capital -- intellectual property types of capital or whether that is purely capital spending kind of capital or inventory and receivables kind of capital, working capital, we also watch that very carefully. We're comfortable with where we are, and I'm not ready to declare an end. As I think I said, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, when we get to '20, we'll talk about it, well, that's what we're talking about it. So we're not feeling any natural cap in our business."

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 10% driven by volume and 90 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new product. Gross margin for the quarter increased 150 basis points to 43.6% and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs.
EBIT margin for the quarter was 20.3% of revenue, an increase of 150 basis points from the second quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.1%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items, primarily the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 21% to $113.1 million and earnings increased to $1.32 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended September with $225.5 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt.
During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $48.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. Free cash flow for the first 6 months declined slightly, as anticipated, to $162 million due to the planned increase in capital spending. However, we have not invested as much capital as we thought in the first half of the fiscal year, simply due to the timing of projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending by $20 million to $260 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $320 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt?"

The additiona",668,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. As you've already heard from Mike, our second quarter continued the trend of outperformance that began in our last fiscal year, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments. The additional volume, higher margin attainment and a lower effective tax rate combined to drive earnings above our expectations for the quarter. 
Based on our performance in the first half and our expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again updating our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5% for fiscal 2020, up 150 basis points from our prior range of 6% to 7%. The increase is due to outperformance of the underlying business as well as the impact of several small tuck-in acquisitions that we have completed, primarily in health care products. While none of the transactions are material on a stand-alone basis, when combined, we expect they will add about $30 million or 100 basis points to our constant currency organic revenue growth for the full fiscal year.
For your modeling purposes, second quarter revenue benefited by about $5 million from these tuck-in acquisitions, with the balance to be spread across the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has challenging comparisons, which gives us some caution on the growth rate for the second half of the fiscal year. Health care products and AST are the 2 segments principally driving this increased organic revenue growth. Health care products are seeing improved demand across the segment with steady growth in consumables, improved performance from service and ongoing strength in capital equipment. AST is delivering strong growth, as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues and the capacity expansions that have come online in the past year or so have allowed us to meet that demand.
Now as you may have read, several ethylene oxide facilities operated by others in the industry have been closed temporarily or permanently due to concerns around the emissions of ethylene oxide gas. The safe and efficient use of ethylene oxide sterilization is required to meet the global need for critical life-saving and life-changing medical devices for patients. For context, approximately 50% of single-use medical devices around the globe that require sterilization are sterilized using ethylene oxide. These devices include items as simple as adhesive bandages and as complex as pacemakers and surgical kits. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we have picked up a modest amount of volume from customers who have been impacted by the closures. However, our U.S. ethylene oxide plants are running full, which will limit our ability to take on significant additional capacity in the second half. Given the strength we've seen so far this year across our business segments and the pipeline of business we see for the back half, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.50 to $5.65, up $0.12 from last quarter's outlook.
The acquisitions discussed earlier are expected to add approximately $0.05 to our outlook in the second half, with the remainder coming from outperformance of the underlying business. The upper end of our earnings outlook range assumes no impact from the medical device excise tax in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is the calendar first quarter. Although we believe the device tax will be delayed or repealed around the first of the calendar year, the lower end of our range should absorb this possible uncertainty if it is not. 
We've had a strong first half of the year and continue to expect another year of record performance in fiscal 2020. We believe the short-term and the long-term future for STERIS is bright. We appreciate your ongoing support and appreciate the work of the 12,000 people of STERIS who are making that happen.

And for all intents and purposes, it's the only gas used for this purpose around the world. 
The second answer to your question is I do think this is more around fear than around science, and there are conversations going on that scientifically don't make lot of sense, and that's just one of the things that has happened in this process. But our view is, we are absolutely adamant about running safe facilities. Safety may be the strongest virtue inside of STERIS. And when we talk about safety, we think that about the people that work with us and for us, and we also think about the community that we live in. So we are absolutely committed to safety. We have -- we know that we are at the, I'll call it, the better end or strong end of the industry in terms of the way we deploy everything about our facilities, not just how we handle gas. And also because we do it so much, we could look across plants and look for best ideas across those facilities. So we do think we are at the positive end of this spectrum. There's, as we understand it, roughly 100 plants around the country to do this kind of work. And so I'm sure there's a full spectrum of activity. So -- but I do think most of the conversation has not been handled scientifically. And I do think -- I applaud both the FDA and the EPA for working hard to manage this effort and to handle things scientifically in the process. And I think that's the way it will end up."

I mean, I think we've talked about this, and this was a broad question, and there are variances over time, as you pointed out. When people have more ability to pay for things, they tend to do a little more; and when they have less ability to pay for, they do a little less. But since this is health care much of it or most of it is not necessarily something one can decide to or not to do. There are some cosmetic procedures, obviously, where that's not the case, but those tend not to be driven by health care reimbursement; those tend to be driven more by personal payments. So in broad, it's just very clear that the number of procedures is rising, and in my view, it will continue to rise. We are right now where the middle of the baby boom generation is in their mid-60s. And so we still have, I'll call it, the back half of the baby boom generation to get to the mid-60s. And really, it's the 60s and 70s, where we spend most of our money. 
So in terms of health care, so procedures are clearly rising. And as we've discussed, there's more and more going out to outpatient-type facilities, both in in-hospital systems and outside of hospital systems. But at the same time, the hospital are still busy and more and more complex procedures are being done. So for every arthroscopic knee that goes to outpatient, there's another transplant of hearts or lungs or something that goes -- stays in the inpatient. So even though the number may not be rising, the complexity continues to rise in the hospital settings, and then in many respects, in the outpatient setting their complexity is rising as well. And when you put all that together, that drives growth in the industry. I think you guys have seen the other medical device companies reporting and their reporting strength as well, and that's a function of procedures."

I believe those who attend the meeting. And for those who don't know this, I mean, the FDA has called in order to discuss potential alternatives to ethylene oxide and to discuss other sterilization methods. My personal view, we are presenting there, if you would like to see our some of our thoughts, if you will, in that space. The FDA asked for presenters. They chose the ones that they thought would be the better ones to discuss or not every presenter who requested to speak is speaking. So in any event, I think you will see what we largely know that is there are a lot of ways to sterilize things. And we know that because we use virtually all of them, some place somewhere. It is just certain methods of sterilization are better for certain activities. And at this moment in time and I think for the -- certainly, the intermediate to long-term future, ethylene oxide is going to be a significant portion of that because it's particularly effective for single-use devices that cannot withstand heat or radiation, and on the other hand, can accept that gas and that gas is very gentle on the devices. And frankly, a lot of that is because it's been the method of choice by both the agency and medical device makers for decades now. And so everyone is designed around that, designed for that. So for a long time, in my opinion, that will be a significant method. And even though my earlier comments were, I believe, exactly what I said that we have a lot of nonscience being discussed, that doesn't mean, in our view, that we can't continuously improve. We have been improving our processes and the way we manage that technology for decades now and we will continue to improve that.
And one of the biggest areas in our view is that -- and it's typical of a lean approach to things. And the key is not to remediate, the key is to use less. And so a year or so ago, well, 2 years ago almost now, we had developed a procedure and process to do what we call sustainable ethylene oxide, and we have seen many of our customers accept that and they can use maybe up to 50% less gas. And if you use 50% less gas, you have even lower than 50% less going out into the air because some of the gas is used, obviously. And so in any event, we think that, that's a great approach. That's one of the things we will be discussing in the next couple of days at the agency. And we are seeing more and more customers for some of the obvious reasons, thinking that, that's a good idea. So I think we'll see a much greater use of lower levels of gas to get the same level of sterilization. It's still sterile. We kill all the bugs. That's what sterile means, but we can do so with less gas."

Just help us think a little bit more about the implied deceleration in the organic constant currency revenue base for the second half of the year. I think if you use the midpoints of the range and take that 100 basis points of inorganic contribution, the back half is going to imply something like 4.5-ish percent. So maybe just again, flush that out a little bit. And I guess the other question is, how do we think about the health care products backlog, which I believe, declined about 2% in this quarter."

And it was pretty phenomenal on top of a previous year, pretty phenomenal. And we just don't forecast beating beats all the time. And so our pause is related to the strength of the fourth quarter last year, not a lack of strength in our current business. And as I mentioned before, as our plants get more full, which they are getting pretty full right now, it is more difficult if you have built something for one customer, and they, at the last minute decide they're not going to take something. And if you have a lot of capacity, it's easy to flip that to another customer or to move things around. It is more difficult to do that when we're at the stronger end, if you will, of use of our capacity. Our guys have done a great job adding capacity without building buildings in the last several years. And so we do have the ability to do that. We do have the ability to meet the forecast we have in place. But we have less flexibility at the last minute to move something. So it could slip out of the quarter. It only takes a couple of significant projects to move out of the quarter in order for us to have a little bit lower growth rate.
I think your numbers might be a little low in terms of the numbers -- in terms of what the ""implied deceleration means."" But -- and truthfully, we don't worry that much about quarters, the implied acceleration in the year is pretty positive. In terms of backlog, backlog is a function of orders coming in and shipments going out. And as you have seen, our shipments in health care have been extraordinary in the last 2 quarters. And as a result -- and our orders have been quite strong, and our pipeline continues quite strong. And so we have this temporal thing where we shipped a little bit more than the orders that came in, but you're talking minute levels, I think, a couple of million dollars or something like that year-over-year."

So we still think that's a positive grower for our business, and we continue to see the same.
In fact, one of the things we talked about is that we are spending money again. In the service business, you have to spend in front of growth, that's not always true in every business, but we have to spend money in front of growth to get people ready for future revenues. And so we clearly have seen that win. I suspect we'll see that in the back half of the year that we will have -- we'll be spending ahead of future growth in the business."

And for another 0.5 point, we thought that was well within what we should expect, and we kept the range roughly the same. So at a high level, that's really the simple description. When we -- on the earnings side, again, there's -- the first component is, indeed, the piece that we talked about with the business development. So those acquisitions do provide some level of earnings. But then in addition to that, we've clearly seen, our plants are running full. And when plants run full, they tend to do a little bit better, that's the expansion. And we continue -- we don't -- haven't talked about it, but we continue to do more and more in-sourcing. And so our plants, in addition to adding volume, are continuing to in-source and that's a -- that just squares the impact because you're growing and your in-sourcing, so it makes it even better. So that's -- those are the positive things. Now we did leave the range in earnings roughly the same, which for the year, we only have half a year to go, but we still haven't seen device tax sort out. We still haven't seen Brexit sort out. We still haven't -- trade is an every-other-day conversation. So we left the range as it is because we do think there's a bit more uncertainty of what may occur. But given what we have already put in the bank and what we anticipate in the orders we have in hand and the orders we see coming, we just thought it was advisable to move up."

And it's hard to nitpick at what's essentially 10% of sales at the midpoint of guidance, really healthy cash flow target for the year. But we're not really getting that much leverage there. It looks like it's the CapEx delta that's really now going into cash flow. So I guess, just to bring it together, I understand you have to spend to continue to grow, and there's been a lot of investment in AST. But is this kind of as good as we can get when we think about cash flow going forward? Or is there opportunity for greater leverage from a cash flow perspective as we just kind of think thematically over the next 3 years as you start to leverage some of the different investments you've made and the capacity comes online and gets utilized at AST?"

At the top of my head, that level of breakdown is a little tough. I will tell you that we do announce those on our website. And so if you want details, you could easily pick them up off of our website. But at a high level, I can say the preponderance of the openings, both U.S. and globally, are radiation-based, not ethylene-oxide-based; that we are growing our capacity in ethylene oxide; and we have grown it in both the U.S. and OUS. In orders of magnitude, roughly in line with our expectation of what EO growth will be, which is more in that 5% to 7% range. And -- but on the other hand, on the radiation side, we have expected a bit faster growth, and so we are growing our radiation business, again, both in the U.S. and OUS, more rapidly even in than that half and continue to.
And all things being equal, we are expanding much more in either e-beam or X-ray than we are in Cobalt gamma radiation. And we see those as being complementary. And so generally speaking, we're expanding in either X-ray or e-beam, or both, in or around Cobalt facilities we already have as well as locating some in new sites. And the reason for that is customers may not be comfortable, or said differently, would be more comfortable moving to X-ray or e-beam if they have Cobalt backup as the one thing; and also, that's also where the customers are that need radiation. So it's a combination of those 2 events. So generally speaking, we expect to see Cobalt around a long, long, long time, but more of the growth of the business we expect to happen in either e-beam or X-ray. So those forms of radiation."

In those, they are, for lack of a better term, semi interchangeable. We happen to have a subproduct of our own that we sterilize, that we know we can do either way. Having said that, the preponderance of products are one or the other because the -- it's not that they both wouldn't sterilize in most cases. There are some cases where they actually wouldn't sterilize because the radiation or gas can't get to the product. But generally speaking, they could sterilize, but you'll ruin the product with the sterilization methodology. And so we -- obviously, we can't ruin the product while we're sterilizing. So at a high level, I would say, it's -- and this is ballpark, but maybe 10% or 15% of either one could go either way, but we are not talking 90% that can go either way. It is at a high level. So there is some substitution possibility, but limited. 
Having said that, that's why we have virtually every form of sterilization under the planet because what is really good to do in hospitals for reprocessing where we commonly use hydrogen peroxide is almost useless for most industrial sterilization where we're doing it the first time in things that are prepackaged, for a variety of reasons. The same is true for most of the gas versus -- and with steam, for example. Steam is commonly used in hospitals. It's completely irrelevant in industrial because that's already packaged. And so you would be running the packaging, if nothing else, and it probably wouldn't work anyway. So at a high level, it's very limited. Now when you come to the inside of radiation, X-ray versus e-beam versus Cobalt, there, the combination of X-ray and Cobalt, there's much more substitutability, if you will. And it varies based, again, on the device itself, the packaging of the device, the way it is put in place. So there is much more substitutability in radiation versus radiation. There is very limited, really, substitutability, gas to radiation at a high level."

We've only been around 6 or 7 years because I haven't said that for 6 or 7 years. The short answer is, there is no business that we don't believe we can't improve. And so we're always working to improve it. In any business, there's a point at which, for any product line or any space, you risk creating a price umbrella and other competitors decide to take that business from you because of price, and we monitor that very carefully. We -- that's why, as you know, we reduce costs faster than our profits rise because we tend to place some of that cost reduction back into price, if you will, or not raising prices. It's not that we're cutting prices, usually, it is that we're not raising prices. So that's part of our mantra.
Yes, you are correct that if you get to certain levels, you have to start watching that. But the other side of this you have to remember is, ROS, return on sales, is not the only determinant of whether things are priced correctly or whether it's hard or difficult to enter to compete. ROIC is also a very, very important component, in fact, more important component. And so some of those products that are making very healthy returns on sales, we have to invest an awful lot of capital to get there. And whether that capital is capital -- intellectual property types of capital or whether that is purely capital spending kind of capital or inventory and receivables kind of capital, working capital, we also watch that very carefully. We're comfortable with where we are, and I'm not ready to declare an end. As I think I said, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, when we get to '20, we'll talk about it, well, that's what we're talking about it.

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 10% driven by volume and 90 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new product. Gross margin for the quarter increased 150 basis points to 43.6% and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs.
EBIT margin for the quarter was 20.3% of revenue, an increase of 150 basis points from the second quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.1%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items, primarily the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 21% to $113.1 million and earnings increased to $1.32 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended September with $225.5 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt.
During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $48.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. Free cash flow for the first 6 months declined slightly, as anticipated, to $162 million due to the planned increase in capital spending. However, we have not invested as much capital as we thought in the first half of the fiscal year, simply due to the timing of projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending by $20 million to $260 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $320 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt?"

The additiona",668,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. As you've already heard from Mike, our second quarter continued the trend of outperformance that began in our last fiscal year, with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all 4 segments. The additional volume, higher margin attainment and a lower effective tax rate combined to drive earnings above our expectations for the quarter. 
Based on our performance in the first half and our expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again updating our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5% for fiscal 2020, up 150 basis points from our prior range of 6% to 7%. The increase is due to outperformance of the underlying business as well as the impact of several small tuck-in acquisitions that we have completed, primarily in health care products. While none of the transactions are material on a stand-alone basis, when combined, we expect they will add about $30 million or 100 basis points to our constant currency organic revenue growth for the full fiscal year.
For your modeling purposes, second quarter revenue benefited by about $5 million from these tuck-in acquisitions, with the balance to be spread across the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has challenging comparisons, which gives us some caution on the growth rate for the second half of the fiscal year. Health care products and AST are the 2 segments principally driving this increased organic revenue growth. Health care products are seeing improved demand across the segment with steady growth in consumables, improved performance from service and ongoing strength in capital equipment. AST is delivering strong growth, as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues and the capacity expansions that have come online in the past year or so have allowed us to meet that demand.
Now as you may have read, several ethylene oxide facilities operated by others in the industry have been closed temporarily or permanently due to concerns around the emissions of ethylene oxide gas. The safe and efficient use of ethylene oxide sterilization is required to meet the global need for critical life-saving and life-changing medical devices for patients. For context, approximately 50% of single-use medical devices around the globe that require sterilization are sterilized using ethylene oxide. These devices include items as simple as adhesive bandages and as complex as pacemakers and surgical kits. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we have picked up a modest amount of volume from customers who have been impacted by the closures. However, our U.S. ethylene oxide plants are running full, which will limit our ability to take on significant additional capacity in the second half. Given the strength we've seen so far this year across our business segments and the pipeline of business we see for the back half, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.50 to $5.65, up $0.12 from last quarter's outlook.
The acquisitions discussed earlier are expected to add approximately $0.05 to our outlook in the second half, with the remainder coming from outperformance of the underlying business. The upper end of our earnings outlook range assumes no impact from the medical device excise tax in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is the calendar first quarter. Although we believe the device tax will be delayed or repealed around the first of the calendar year, the lower end of our range should absorb this possible uncertainty if it is not. 
We've had a strong first half of the year and continue to expect another year of record performance in fiscal 2020. We believe the short-term and the long-term future for STERIS is bright. We appreciate your ongoing support and appreciate the work of the 12,000 people of STERIS who are making that happen.

And for all intents and purposes, it's the only gas used for this purpose around the world. 
The second answer to your question is I do think this is more around fear than around science, and there are conversations going on that scientifically don't make lot of sense, and that's just one of the things that has happened in this process. But our view is, we are absolutely adamant about running safe facilities. Safety may be the strongest virtue inside of STERIS. And when we talk about safety, we think that about the people that work with us and for us, and we also think about the community that we live in. So we are absolutely committed to safety. We have -- we know that we are at the, I'll call it, the better end or strong end of the industry in terms of the way we deploy everything about our facilities, not just how we handle gas. And also because we do it so much, we could look across plants and look for best ideas across those facilities. So we do think we are at the positive end of this spectrum. There's, as we understand it, roughly 100 plants around the country to do this kind of work. And so I'm sure there's a full spectrum of activity. So -- but I do think most of the conversation has not been handled scientifically. And I do think -- I applaud both the FDA and the EPA for working hard to manage this effort and to handle things scientifically in the process. And I think that's the way it will end up."

I mean, I think we've talked about this, and this was a broad question, and there are variances over time, as you pointed out. When people have more ability to pay for things, they tend to do a little more; and when they have less ability to pay for, they do a little less. But since this is health care much of it or most of it is not necessarily something one can decide to or not to do. There are some cosmetic procedures, obviously, where that's not the case, but those tend not to be driven by health care reimbursement; those tend to be driven more by personal payments. So in broad, it's just very clear that the number of procedures is rising, and in my view, it will continue to rise. We are right now where the middle of the baby boom generation is in their mid-60s. And so we still have, I'll call it, the back half of the baby boom generation to get to the mid-60s. And really, it's the 60s and 70s, where we spend most of our money. 
So in terms of health care, so procedures are clearly rising. And as we've discussed, there's more and more going out to outpatient-type facilities, both in in-hospital systems and outside of hospital systems. But at the same time, the hospital are still busy and more and more complex procedures are being done. So for every arthroscopic knee that goes to outpatient, there's another transplant of hearts or lungs or something that goes -- stays in the inpatient. So even though the number may not be rising, the complexity continues to rise in the hospital settings, and then in many respects, in the outpatient setting their complexity is rising as well. And when you put all that together, that drives growth in the industry. I think you guys have seen the other medical device companies reporting and their reporting strength as well, and that's a function of procedures."

I believe those who attend the meeting. And for those who don't know this, I mean, the FDA has called in order to discuss potential alternatives to ethylene oxide and to discuss other sterilization methods. My personal view, we are presenting there, if you would like to see our some of our thoughts, if you will, in that space. The FDA asked for presenters. They chose the ones that they thought would be the better ones to discuss or not every presenter who requested to speak is speaking. So in any event, I think you will see what we largely know that is there are a lot of ways to sterilize things. And we know that because we use virtually all of them, some place somewhere. It is just certain methods of sterilization are better for certain activities. And at this moment in time and I think for the -- certainly, the intermediate to long-term future, ethylene oxide is going to be a significant portion of that because it's particularly effective for single-use devices that cannot withstand heat or radiation, and on the other hand, can accept that gas and that gas is very gentle on the devices. And frankly, a lot of that is because it's been the method of choice by both the agency and medical device makers for decades now. And so everyone is designed around that, designed for that. So for a long time, in my opinion, that will be a significant method. And even though my earlier comments were, I believe, exactly what I said that we have a lot of nonscience being discussed, that doesn't mean, in our view, that we can't continuously improve. We have been improving our processes and the way we manage that technology for decades now and we will continue to improve that.
And one of the biggest areas in our view is that -- and it's typical of a lean approach to things. And the key is not to remediate, the key is to use less. And so a year or so ago, well, 2 years ago almost now, we had developed a procedure and process to do what we call sustainable ethylene oxide, and we have seen many of our customers accept that and they can use maybe up to 50% less gas. And if you use 50% less gas, you have even lower than 50% less going out into the air because some of the gas is used, obviously. And so in any event, we think that, that's a great approach. That's one of the things we will be discussing in the next couple of days at the agency. And we are seeing more and more customers for some of the obvious reasons, thinking that, that's a good idea. So I think we'll see a much greater use of lower levels of gas to get the same level of sterilization. It's still sterile. We kill all the bugs. That's what sterile means, but we can do so with less gas."

And it was pretty phenomenal on top of a previous year, pretty phenomenal. And we just don't forecast beating beats all the time. And so our pause is related to the strength of the fourth quarter last year, not a lack of strength in our current business. And as I mentioned before, as our plants get more full, which they are getting pretty full right now, it is more difficult if you have built something for one customer, and they, at the last minute decide they're not going to take something. And if you have a lot of capacity, it's easy to flip that to another customer or to move things around. It is more difficult to do that when we're at the stronger end, if you will, of use of our capacity. Our guys have done a great job adding capacity without building buildings in the last several years. And so we do have the ability to do that. We do have the ability to meet the forecast we have in place. But we have less flexibility at the last minute to move something. So it could slip out of the quarter. It only takes a couple of significant projects to move out of the quarter in order for us to have a little bit lower growth rate.
I think your numbers might be a little low in terms of the numbers -- in terms of what the ""implied deceleration means."" But -- and truthfully, we don't worry that much about quarters, the implied acceleration in the year is pretty positive. In terms of backlog, backlog is a function of orders coming in and shipments going out. And as you have seen, our shipments in health care have been extraordinary in the last 2 quarters. And as a result -- and our orders have been quite strong, and our pipeline continues quite strong. And so we have this temporal thing where we shipped a little bit more than the orders that came in, but you're talking minute levels, I think, a couple of million dollars or something like that year-over-year."

I apologize hopping between a couple of calls here this morning. My final one is just on the cash flow guidance. And it's hard to nitpick at what's essentially 10% of sales at the midpoint of guidance, really healthy cash flow target for the year. But we're not really getting that much leverage there. It looks like it's the CapEx delta that's really now going into cash flow. So I guess, just to bring it together, I understand you have to spend to continue to grow, and there's been a lot of investment in AST. But is this kind of as good as we can get when we think about cash flow going forward? Or is there opportunity for greater leverage from a cash flow perspective as we just kind of think thematically over the next 3 years as you start to leverage some of the different investments you've made and the capacity comes online and gets utilized at AST?"

And all we did, you're right, in the guidance is we have taken down CapEx and we did increase cash flow by the exact same $20 million. But what you're not seeing is we do not adjust free cash flow, so there is another roughly $15 million of impact to free cash flow for the acquisitions, the integrations, our restructuring costs are still coming and impacting us. So if you were to back those out, you would add another $15 million, which I think would help solve the issue that you're looking for and still doing a nice job of generating solid free cash flow."

At the top of my head, that level of breakdown is a little tough. I will tell you that we do announce those on our website. And so if you want details, you could easily pick them up off of our website. But at a high level,",302,"Yes. We're doing so many, Matt. At the top of my head, that level of breakdown is a little tough. I will tell you that we do announce those on our website. And so if you want details, you could easily pick them up off of our website. But at a high level, I can say the preponderance of the openings, both U.S. and globally, are radiation-based, not ethylene-oxide-based; that we are growing our capacity in ethylene oxide; and we have grown it in both the U.S. and OUS. In orders of magnitude, roughly in line with our expectation of what EO growth will be, which is more in that 5% to 7% range. And -- but on the other hand, on the radiation side, we have expected a bit faster growth, and so we are growing our radiation business, again, both in the U.S. and OUS, more rapidly even in than that half and continue to.
And all things being equal, we are expanding much more in either e-beam or X-ray than we are in Cobalt gamma radiation. And we see those as being complementary. And so generally speaking, we're expanding in either X-ray or e-beam, or both, in or around Cobalt facilities we already have as well as locating some in new sites. And the reason for that is customers may not be comfortable, or said differently, would be more comfortable moving to X-ray or e-beam if they have Cobalt backup as the one thing; and also, that's also where the customers are that need radiation. So it's a combination of those 2 events. So generally speaking, we expect to see Cobalt around a long, long, long time, but more of the growth of the business we expect to happen in either e-beam or X-ray. So those forms of radiation."

In those, they are, for lack of a better term, semi interchangeable. We happen to have a subproduct of our own that we sterilize, that we know we can do either way. Having said that, the preponderance of products are one or the other because the -- it's not that they both wouldn't sterilize in most cases. There are some cases where they actually wouldn't sterilize because the radiation or gas can't get to the product. But generally speaking, they could sterilize, but you'll ruin the product with the sterilization methodology. And so we -- obviously, we can't ruin the product while we're sterilizing. So at a high level, I would say, it's -- and this is ballpark, but maybe 10% or 15% of either one could go either way, but we are not talking 90% that can go either way. It is at a high level. So there is some substitution possibility, but limited. 
Having said that, that's why we have virtually every form of sterilization under the planet because what is really good to do in hospitals for reprocessing where we commonly use hydrogen peroxide is almost useless for most industrial sterilization where we're doing it the first time in things that are prepackaged, for a variety of reasons. The same is true for most of the gas versus -- and with steam, for example. Steam is commonly used in hospitals. It's completely irrelevant in industrial because that's already packaged. And so you would be running the packaging, if nothing else, and it probably wouldn't work anyway. So at a high level, it's very limited. Now when you come to the inside of radiation, X-ray versus e-beam versus Cobalt, there, the combination of X-ray and Cobalt, there's much more substitutability, if you will. And it varies based, again, on the device itself, the packaging of the device, the way it is put in place. So there is much more substitutability in radiation versus radiation. There is very limited, really, substitutability, gas to radiation at a high level."

We've only been around 6 or 7 years because I haven't said that for 6 or 7 years. The short answer is, there is no business that we don't believe we can't improve. And so we're always working to improve it. In any business, there's a point at which, for any product line or any space, you risk creating a price umbrella and other competitors decide to take that business from you because of price, and we monitor that very carefully. We -- that's why, as you know, we reduce costs faster than our profits rise because we tend to place some of that cost reduction back into price, if you will, or not raising prices. It's not that we're cutting prices, usually, it is that we're not raising prices. So that's part of our mantra.
Yes, you are correct that if you get to certain levels, you have to start watching that. But the other side of this you have to remember is, ROS, return on sales, is not the only determinant of whether things are priced correctly or whether it's hard or difficult to enter to compete. ROIC is also a very, very important component, in fact, more important component. And so some of those products that are making very healthy returns on sales, we have to invest an awful lot of capital to get there. And whether that capital is capital -- intellectual property types of capital or whether that is purely capital spending kind of capital or inventory and receivables kind of capital, working capital, we also watch that very carefully. We're comfortable with where we are, and I'm not ready to declare an end. As I think I said, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, when we get to '20, we'll talk about it, well, that's what we're talking about it. So we're not feeling any natural cap in our business."
