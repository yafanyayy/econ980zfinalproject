Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial review call.
2018 was a good year for AES, demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We delivered on all of our commitments including our financial guidance and hit key milestones on our strategy, positioning AES for long-term sustainable growth.
Some of our key accomplishments last year were: we reached the high end of our expected ranges for both earnings per share and parent free cash flow; we achieved a key investment-grade financial metric 1-year ahead of our plan; we met our expectation of signing long-term PPAs for 2 gigawatts of renewable capacity and increase our backlog to almost 6 gigawatts; we accomplished key milestones on our 4.4 gigawatts under construction and completed construction of an additional 1.3 gigawatts; we introduced a longer-term target to reduce our carbon intensity by 70% from 2016 to 2030, we now expect to achieve a 50% reduction by 2022; and our world-leading battery-based energy storage joint venture with Siemens, Fluence, was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects, bringing its total to 766 megawatts.
Reflecting on our successful execution, improved visibility and increased confidence in our ability to deliver, we're extending our longer-term outlook by 2 years and now expect 7% to 9% average annual growth in earnings and cash flow through 2022.
As a result of our strong performance in 2018, combined with our improved outlook, we expected to hit the high end of our prior guidance range through 2020. Gustavo will discuss our 2018 results and guidance in more detail after I provide an overview of our strategy.
Turning now to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around the 3 themes of: first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio and lowering risk to deliver attractive returns; second, delivering on our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and three, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position.
Today, I will review the progress we've made this year in support of these themes and how we have positioned ourselves well for the future. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are seeing the benefits of many initiatives that began several years ago to derisk our portfolio. AES today is a very different company than it was in 2011, doing business in 28 countries around the world with significant commodity exposure. Since then, we have focused our portfolio on roughly a dozen markets where we have a competitive advantage and we have reduced our overall exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrology by 70%.
In 2018 alone, we paid down $1 billion in parent debt, and we are on a path to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020, supported not only by our financial metrics, but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio.
Our efforts to enhance the resilience of the portfolio have led us to focus increasingly on clean technologies. As you can see on Slide 6, we are significantly decreasing the carbon intensity of our portfolio. 
In November, we announced the carbon intensity reduction target of 70% by 2030 versus 2016 levels. Today, I am pleased to announce an interim carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022. Our shift to renewable simply makes good business sense. It increases the longevity of our cash flows and allows us to attract a broader investor base.
Another way we are decreasing the risk of our portfolio is by completing most of the large conventional projects under construction and focusing our future growth on renewable projects, which are less capital intensive and considerably simpler to build. Turning now to our strong backlog of projects beginning with our projects -- progress on those under construction on Slide 7.
In 2018, we completed 1.3 gigawatts of new projects including the Eagle Valley combined-cycle gas plant at IP&L in Indiana and the AES Colón combined-cycle gas plant and regasification terminal in Panama and 254 megawatts of solar energy storage, mostly in the U.S. 
We still have another 4.4 gigawatts currently under construction and expected to come online through 2021. 
Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the commissioning phase, and we expect it will be fully completed in April. Our Southland repowering project in Southern California is approximately 80% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. 
And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 3/4 complete with 2/3 of the tunneling work done. The remaining projects under construction are made up of renewables across our portfolio. 
As you can see on Slide 9, this capacity is split equally between the U.S. and internationally. All of these projects are going well and they are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction.
Since our last call in November, we have broken ground on 731 megawatts of solar, wind and energy storage. As can be seen on Slide 10, in 2018, we signed new PPAs for approximately 2 gigawatts of renewables, and we're on track to sign between 2 and 3 gigawatts annually in the coming years. 
Turning to Slide 11. Combining our capacity under construction with our long-term PPAs that are not yet under construction yields our total backlog of 5.8 gigawatts. As we execute on our plan to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year, we expect to bring a total of 12 gigawatts online by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about 1/3 today. 
As can be seen on Slide 12, our renewable investments are expected to produce low to high teen IRRs across all our markets, assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, which I will discuss in the next few slides beginning on Slide 13.
First, we have existing commercial relationships that we can leverage to drive new growth. For example, our green blend and extend strategy allows us to negotiate new long-term PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers. Through this win-win strategy, we preserve the value of our existing thermal capacity contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewable energy. In exchange, our customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation.
In 2018 alone, we negotiated green blend and extend contracts for 576 megawatts in Chile and Mexico. A second advantage that we have for renewable growth is deep market intimacy. For example, AES Distributed Energy recently inaugurated the largest solar storage facility in the world, the island of Kauai. The project was made possible by AES's long history in Hawaii and willingness to work with local stakeholders to meet their needs and goals. The project, which includes 100-megawatt hours of 5-hour duration energy storage will essentially serve as a source of baseload power for the island and deliver roughly 11% of its power.
We recently broke ground on a similar second project, also on the island of Kauai, with 14 megawatts of solar and 70-megawatt hours of 5-hour duration energy storage. 
Third, our work with partners provide us with an important competitive advantage. We're bringing in partners to achieve economies of scale, fine-tune our portfolio and improve our returns on invested capital. 
Our recent sell down of sPower is a good example where we agreed to sell 48% of our stake in sPower's operating portfolio, which along with operational improvements and refinancing, have increase our returns to 13%. The sell down also provides us with funds to invest in sPower's 10 gigawatts development pipeline to earn similar attractive returns.
Turning now to Slide 16. In addition to our growth in renewables, we continue to increase our LNG business, which is displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with a cheaper and cleaner natural gas. As you may know, in 2018, we inaugurated our AES Colón combined-cycle gas plant and LNG regasification facility in Panama, which will play a key role in supplying natural gas for the entire Central American region. 
Our LNG facilities in Panama and the Dominican Republic represent a total installed capacity of 150 tera BTUs to serve local and regional markets. The majority of this capacity is now under contract, and the remaining 55 tera BTUs are still available to drive future growth.
As I mentioned on our last call, we are capitalizing on the expertise we have gained in the Dominican Republic and Panama by developing a similar LNG regasification facility and associated combined cycle power plants in Vietnam. 
Although this long-term U.S. dollar-denominated, 450 tera Btu facility is in its early stages, we are making very good progress and it has a potential to contribute significantly to our longer-term growth post 2023. 
Turning to Slide 17. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position. As an example, in 2007, AES launched a small energy storage group that was the first of its kind. 
Today, energy storage is beginning to revolutionize the sector and AES is at the forefront. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens was recently named the #1 utility scale energy storage integrator in the world by Navigant Research for the third time in a row. In 2018, Fluence was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects and is now the largest global energy storage provider by capacity in the world with a total of 80 projects in 17 countries.
Turning to Slide 18, we're also implementing a corporate-wide digital transformation, including becoming a strategic investor in simple energy. Simple energy provides a digital platform that allows our IP&L and DP&L utilities to accelerate energy efficiency and demand response programs, all the while improving customer experience. Simple energies digital platform serves not only AES's utilities, but 40 other utilities in the U.S. with access to over 40 million end customers. Although not in our guidance, we expect that our new digital initiatives to materially benefit both our top and bottom lines. 
We will provide more color as our digital strategy matures on future calls. Now I will turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results, capital allocation, 2019 guidance and longer-term expectations in more detail."

Today, I will cover our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2018 on a strong note, a",1365,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I will cover our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2018 on a strong note, achieving the upper end of our expected ranges for all metrics and setting a solid foundation for growth through 2022. 
As shown on Slide 20, adjusted EPS was $1.24, reflecting higher margins from our businesses particularly in the U.S. and South America strategic business units, or SBUs, as well as debt pay down at the parent. This positive drivers were partially offset by asset sales in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. 
Turning to Slide 21, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $160 million. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 22. 
In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by DPL, which benefited from higher rates following the resolution of its rate case. Results also reflects higher contributions from our U.S. solar business and an extended summer out in our Southland plan in California. Increased PTC at our South America SBU reflects higher contracted price in Colombia as well as higher tariffs in Argentina following the 2017 reset. 
Results also benefited from higher contracted sales and lower interest expense at AES Gener in Chile.
Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCC, SBU, reflects a full year of operations at the DPP combined cycle expansion and highest spot energy prices in the Dominican Republic. Results also reflect the commencement of operations at the AES Colón CCGT and regasification facility and improving hydrology in Panama. 
Finally, in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and in Kazakhstan. 
Turning to our improving credit profile on Slide 26. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment-grade in 2016, we have reduced the parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. This includes an additional $150 million with payment in December 2018, which is an acceleration of the debt reduction we had anticipated through 2020. As a result, we achieved a key investment-grade financial metric of 3.95x parent leverage, 1-year ahead of plan, providing us additional confidence in our ability to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. 
We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years, we expect that our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering. 
Now to our 2018 parent capital allocation on Slide 27. Sources on the left-hand side reflects $1.9 billion of total discretionary cash generating in 2018 consistent with our prior expectations. This includes $689 million of parent free cash flow just above the high end of our expected range. 
Uses on the right-hand side of the slide are also largely in line with our prior disclosures. The one notable exception is our $1.3 billion of cash allocated to parent debt reduction, which reflects the additional $150 million paid down in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 28. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.28 to $1.40. Growth this year will be largely driven by contributions for new projects and cost savings, more specifically, we expect it to benefit from the completion of most of our large thermal construction projects with expected commencement of operations at OPGC 2 in the next few weeks and the first full year of operations at AES Colón in Panama. 
[indiscernible] including 1.4 gigawatts scheduled to reach commercial operations this year. A full year of contributions from the cost savings implemented in 2018, lower parent interest expense due to completed and continued debt reduction and a slightly lower effective tax rate of 29% to 31%.
This growth will be partially offset by announced business exits in the Philippines, the Netherlands and Oklahoma. Today, we are also providing our outlook of 7% to 9% EPS in cash flow growth through 2022. We have extended this outlook by 2 years, which reflects improved confidence in our backlog, an increased visibility of earnings and cash flow. One additional point regarding our longer-term outlook. The 7% to 10% growth rate, which is roughly 2018 base is in line with hitting the high end of our previous 8% to 10% growth of a 2017 base through 2020.
Consistent with our prior expectations, growth in the outer years is expected to be driven by projects currently under construction, such as Southland, the reallocation of parent cash to global renewables growth and increased LNG sales and MCAC. I'd also note a couple of additional business-related assumptions embedded in our longer-term outlook. 
First, regarding Maritza in Bulgaria. The plan continues to be dispatched and paid in a timely manner. Discussions related to our PPA are still in early stages, and we are working to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. As we discussed before, our outlook is resilient to any reasonably likely outcome. 
Second, we continue to see our U.S. utilities well positioned for future rate base investment in T&D infrastructure. IPL has grown its rate base over the last few years, and going forward, there is still opportunity for growth in the mid-single digits. At DPL, where the focus has been on restructuring the business, we can see growth in the high single digits. To that end, since our last call, DPL has filed both its good modernization plant in the expansion. Together, these findings aim to maintain DPL's financial stability while bringing its customers the substantial benefits associated with the robust, modernized electric grade. 
Our guidance assumes that [indiscernible] extended for 2 years from late 2020 through late 2022, allowing the company to meet its financial obligations while retaining the ability to grow its asset base through its marginal investments.
Turning to Slide 29. Parent free cash flow is expected to be from $700 million to $750 million this year and it is also expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022. Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 30. 
Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include 321 -- $320 million in asset received proceeds with $107 million in proceeds to the parent from the announced sell down of sPower's operating portfolio in a placeholder for an additional $150 million of this year. Now to the uses on the right-hand side.
Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect it to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics. And we plan to invest over $400 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $100 million of unallocated cash. 
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We expected our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is more than 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The rest comes from our $2 billion asset sale target, $1.4 billion, of which is completed or announced. 
Turning to the use of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board, we expect that the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We expect to use $300 million for debt reduction, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the planned asset sales. 
We are planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog in projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used to create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Big picture is we have considerable capital tied up in construction projects, which we will be cutting the ribbon from now through 2021. In many cases, we contributed all of the capital that we need to contribute. So most of our growth is coming from organic projects and just cutting the ribbon. So I want that to be perfectly clear. Second, you have to remember, in our renewables program, half of this is outside the U.S. and the half that's in the U.S. about 40% is wind. So the contributions, for example, of HLBV is so far negligible and it's not as big for us as it is for other people going forward. So in terms of the growth, as I said, a big contributor to this is the organic growth coming from the projects we have completed. In addition to the megawatts that I've mentioned, for example, we have completed the storage tank in Panama Colon, which is going to happen about middle of this year.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Financial Review Call.
2018 was a good year for AES, demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We delivered on all of our commitments, including our financial guidance and hit key milestones on our strategy, positioning AES for long-term sustainable growth.
Some of our key accomplishments last year were: we reached the high end of our expected ranges, for both earnings per share and parent free cash flow; we achieved a key investment-grade financial metric 1 year ahead of our plan; we met our expectation of signing long-term PPAs for 2 gigawatts of renewable capacity and increased our backlog to almost 6 gigawatts; we accomplished key milestones on our 4.4 gigawatts under construction and completed construction of an additional 1.3 gigawatts; we introduced a longer-term target to reduce our carbon intensity by 70% from 2016 through 2030, we now expect to achieve a 50% reduction by 2022; and our world-leading battery-based energy storage joint venture with Siemens, Fluence, was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects, bringing its total to 766 megawatts.
Reflecting on our successful execution, improved visibility and increased confidence in our ability to deliver, we are extending our longer-term outlook by 2 years and now expect 7% to 9% average annual growth in earnings and cash flow through 2022.
As a result of our strong performance in 2018, combined with our improved outlook, we expected to hit the high end of our prior guidance range through 2020. Gustavo will discuss our 2018 results and guidance in more detail after I provide an overview of our strategy.
Turning now to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around the 3 themes of: first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio and lowering risk to deliver attractive returns; second, delivering on our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and, three, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position.
Today, I will review the progress we've made this year in support of these themes and how we have positioned ourselves well for the future. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are seeing the benefits of many initiatives that began several years ago to derisk our portfolio. AES today is a very different company than it was in 2011, doing business in 28 countries around the world with significant commodity exposure. Since then, we have focused our portfolio on roughly a dozen markets, where we have a competitive advantage and we have reduced our overall exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrologies by 70%.
In 2018 alone, we paid down $1 billion in parent debt, and we are on a path to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020, supported not only by our financial metrics, but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio.
Our efforts to enhance the resilience of the portfolio have led us to focus increasingly on clean technologies. 
As you can see on Slide 6, we are significantly decreasing the carbon intensity of our portfolio.  In November, we announced a carbon intensity reduction target of 70% by 2030 versus 2016 levels. Today, I am pleased to announce an interim carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022. Our shift to renewable simply makes good business sense. It increases the longevity of our cash flows and allows us to attract a broader investor base.
Another way we are decreasing the risk of our portfolio is by completing most of the large conventional projects under construction and focusing our future growth on renewable projects, which are less capital intensive and considerably simpler to build. 
Turning now to our strong backlog of projects beginning with our projects -- progress on those under construction on Slide 7.  In 2018, we completed 1.3 gigawatts of new projects, including the Eagle Valley combined-cycle gas plant at IPL in Indiana and the AES Colón combined-cycle gas plant and regasification terminal in Panama and 254 megawatts of solar energy storage, mostly in the U.S.  We still have another 4.4 gigawatts currently under construction and expected it to come online through 2021. 
Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the commissioning phase, and we expect it will be fully completed in April. 
Our Southland repowering project in Southern California is approximately 80% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. 
And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 3/4 complete, with 2/3 of the tunneling work done. 
The remaining projects under construction are made up of renewables across our portfolio. 
As you can see on Slide 9, this capacity is split equally between the U.S. and internationally. All of these projects are going well and they are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction.
Since our last call in November, we have broken ground on 731 megawatts of solar, wind and energy storage. 
As can be seen on Slide 10, in 2018, we signed new PPAs for approximately 2 gigawatts of renewables, and we're on track to sign between 2 and 3 gigawatts annually in the coming years. 
Turning to Slide 11. Combining our capacity under construction with our long-term PPAs that are not yet under construction, deals deals that are total backlog of 5.8 gigawatts. As we execute on our plan to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year, we expect to bring a total of 12 gigawatts online by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about 1/3 today. 
As can be seen on Slide 12, our renewable investments are expected to produce low- to high-teen IRRs across all our markets, assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, which I will discuss in the next few slides, beginning on Slide 13.
First, we have existing commercial relationships that we can leverage to drive new growth. For example, our green, blend and extend strategy allows us to negotiate new long-term PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers. Through this win-win strategy, we preserve the value of our existing thermal capacity contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewable energy. In exchange, our customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation.
In 2018 alone, we negotiated green-blend-and-extend contracts for 576 megawatts in Chile and Mexico. A second advantage that we have for renewable growth is deep market intimacy. For example, AES Distributed Energy recently inaugurated the largest solar storage facility in the world, in island of Kaua'i. The project was made possible by AES' long history in Hawaii and willingness to work with local stakeholders to meet their needs and goals. The project, which includes 100-megawatt hours of 5-hour duration energy storage, will essentially serve as a source of baseload power for the island and deliver roughly 11% of its power.
We recently broke ground on a similar second project, also on the island of Kaua'i, with 14 megawatts of solar and 70-megawatt hours of 5-hour duration energy storage. 
Third, our work with partners provides us with an important competitive advantage. We bringing in partners to achieve economies of scale, fine-tune our portfolio and improve our returns on invested capital. 
Our recent sell down of sPower is a good example, where we agreed to sell 48% of our stake in sPower's operating portfolio which, along with operational improvements and refinancing, have increase our returns to 13%. The sell down also provides us with funds to invest in sPower's 10-gigawatt development pipeline to earn similar attractive returns.
Turning now to Slide 16. In addition to our growth in renewables, we continue to increase our LNG business, which is displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. 
As you may know, in 2018, we inaugurated our AES Colón combined-cycle gas plant and LNG regasification facility in Panama, which will play a key role in supplying natural gas for the entire Central American region. 
Our LNG facilities in Panama and the Dominican Republic represent a total installed capacity of 150 tera BTUs to serve local and regional markets. The majority of this capacity is now under contract, and the remaining 55 tera BTUs are still available to drive future growth.
As I mentioned on our last call, we are capitalizing on the expertise we have gained in the Dominican Republic and Panama by developing a similar LNG regasification facility and associated combined cycle power plants in Vietnam. 
Although this long-term U.S. dollar-denominated, 450 tera Btu facility is in its early stages, we are making very good progress and it has the potential to contribute significantly to our longer-term growth post-2023. 
Turning to Slide 17. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position. As an example, in 2007, AES launched a small energy storage group that was the first of its kind.  Today, energy storage is beginning to revolutionize the sector and AES is at the forefront. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, was recently named the #1 utility scale, energy-storage integrator in the world by Navigant Research for the third time in a row. 
In 2018, Fluence was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects and is now the largest global energy-storage provider, by capacity, in the world with a total of 80 projects in 17 countries.
Turning to Slide 18, we're also implementing a corporate-wide digital transformation, including becoming a strategic investor in simple energy. Simple energy provides a digital platform that allows our IP&L and DP&L utilities to accelerate energy efficiency and demand response programs, all the while improving customer experience. Simple energy's digital platform serves not only AES' utilities, but 40 other utilities in the U.S. with access to over 40 million end customers. 
Although not in our guidance, we had expected our new digital initiatives to materially benefit both our top and bottom lines. 
We will provide more color, as our digital strategy matures, on future calls. 
Now I will turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results, capital allocation, 2019 guidance and longer-term expectations in more detail."

Today, I will cover our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022.

Today, I will cover our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2018 on a strong note, achieving the upper end of our expected ranges for all metrics and setting a solid foundation for growth through 2022. 
As shown on Slide 20, adjusted EPS was $1.24, reflecting higher margins from our businesses, particularly in the U.S. and Utilities and South America's strategic business units, or SBUs, as well as debt pay down at the parent. These positive drivers were partially offset by asset sales in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. 
Turning to Slide 21, adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $160 million. 
I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 22.  In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by DPLs, which benefited from higher rates following the resolution of its rate case. Results also reflect higher contributions from our U.S. solar business and an extended summer run at our Southland plan in California. Increased PTC at our South America SBU reflects higher contracted price in Colombia as well as higher tariff in Argentina, following the 2017 reset.  Results also benefited from higher contracted sales and lower interest expense at AES Gener in Chile.
Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC , SBU, reflects a full year of operations at the DPP combined at cycle expansion and higher spot energy prices in the Dominican Republic. Results also reflect the commencement of operations at the AES Colón CCGT and regasification facility and improved hydrology in Panama. 
Finally, in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. 
Turning to our improving credit profile on Slide 26. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment-grade in 2016, we have reduced the parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. This includes an additional $150 million with repayment in December 2018, which is an acceleration of the debt reduction we had anticipated through 2020. As a result, we achieved a key investment-grade financial metric of 3.95x parent leverage, 1 year ahead of plan, providing us additional confidence in our ability to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. 
We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years, we expect that our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering. 
Now to our 2018 parent capital allocation on Slide 27. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.9 billion of total discretionary cash generating in 2018, consistent with our prior expectations. This includes $689 million of parent free cash flow just above the high end of our expected range. 
Uses on the right-hand side of the slide are also largely in line with our prior disclosures. The one notable exception is our $1.3 billion of cash allocated to parent debt reduction, which reflects the additional $150 million paid down in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 28. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.28 to $1.40. Growth this year will be largely driven by contributions for new projects and cost savings, more specifically, we expect it to benefit from the completion of most of our large thermal construction projects with expected commencement of operations at OPGC 2 in the next few weeks and the first full year of operations at AES Colón in Panama.  Continued growth in renewables, including 1.4 gigawatts scheduled to reach commercial operations this year. A full year of contributions from the cost savings implemented in 2018, lower parent entering interest expense due to completed and continued debt reduction and a slightly lower effective tax rate of 29% to 31%.
This growth will be partially offset by announced business exits in the Philippines, the Netherlands and Oklahoma. Today, we are also providing our outlook of 7% to 9% EPS in cash flow growth through 2022. We have extended this outlook by 2 years, which reflects improved confidence in our backlog and increased visibility of earnings and cash flow. One additional point regarding our longer-term outlook, this 7% to 10% growth rate, which is roughly 2018 base, is in line with hitting the high end of our previous 8% to 10% growth of a 2017 base through 2020.
Consistent with our prior expectations, growth in the outer years is expected to be driven by projects currently under construction, such as Southland, the allocation of parent cash to global renewables' growth and increased LNG sales and MCAC. 
I'd also note a couple of additional business-related assumptions embedded in our longer-term outlook.  First, regarding Maritza in Bulgaria. The plan continues to be dispatched and paid in a timely manner. Discussions related to our PPA are still in early stages, and we are working to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. As we discussed before, our outlook is resilient to any reasonably likely outcome. 
Second, we continue to see our U.S. utilities well positioned for future rate base investment in T&D infrastructure. IPL has grown its rate base over the last few years, and going forward, there is still opportunity for growth in the mid-single digits. 
At DPL, where the focus has been on restructuring the business, we could see growth in the high single digits. To that end, since our last call, DPL has filed both its grid modernization plan in the [ Amman ] expansion. Together, these findings aim to maintain DPL's financial integrity, while bringing its customers the substantial benefits associated with the robust, modernized electric grid. 
Our guidance assumes that we might extend it for 2 years from late 2020 through late 2022, allowing the company to meet its financial obligations while retaining the ability to grow its asset base through its marginal investments.
Turning to Slide 29. Parent free cash flow is expected to be from $700 million to $750 million this year, and it is also expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022. 
Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 30.  Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $320 million in asset received proceeds with $107 million in proceeds to the parent from the announced sell down of sPower's operating portfolio, in a placeholder for an additional $150 million of this year. 
Now to the uses on the right-hand side.  Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in the December, we will be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect it to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics. And we plan to invest over $400 billion in our subsidiaries, leaving about $100 million of unallocated cash. 
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We expected our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is more than 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The rest comes from our $2 billion asset-sale target, $1.4 billion of which is completed or announced. 
Turning to the use of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We expect to use $300 million for debt reduction, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality, as we pursue the planned asset sales. 
We are planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog in projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used to create shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. 
2018 was a very good year for AES, as demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We are on track to attain investment-grade credit ratings in 2020. We are completing our conventional construction projects. We are signing long-term PPAs for renewables, including successfully implementing green, blend and extend through our backlog. Going forward, we will invest our growing free cash flow in a robust growth pipeline, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and our competitive dividend. 
Accordingly, combining our annual growth and current dividend yield, we expect to deliver double-digit total returns to our shareholders through 2022.

Big picture is we have considerable capital tied up in construction projects, which we will be cutting the ribbon from now through 2021. In many cases, we've contributed all of the capital that we need to contribute. So most of our growth is coming from organic projects and just cutting the ribbon. So I want that to be perfectly clear. 
Second, you have to remember, in our renewables program, half of this is outside the U.S. and the half that's in the U.S., about 40% is wind. So the contributions, for example, of HLBV is so far negligible and it's not as big for us as it is for other people going forward. So in terms of the growth, as I said, a big contributor to this is the organic growth coming from the projects we have completed. In addition to the megawatts that I've mentioned, for example, we have completed the storage tank in Panama, Colón, which is going to happen about middle of this year. So we have additional projects coming online from there. 
So with that I can pass it up to Gustavo, but I want to make absolutely unambiguous that we have very strong organic growth coming on. And given the distribution of our growth, you don't have things like HLBV outside of the U.S."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial review call.
2018 was a good year for AES, demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We delivered on all of our commitments, including our financial guidance and hit key milestones on our strategy, positioning AES for long-term sustainable growth.
Some of our key accomplishments last year were: we reached the high end of our expected ranges, for both earnings per share and parent free cash flow; we achieved a key investment-grade financial metric 1 year ahead of our plan; we met our expectation of signing long-term PPAs for 2 gigawatts of renewable capacity and increased our backlog to almost 6 gigawatts; we accomplished key milestones on our 4.4 gigawatts under construction and completed construction of an additional 1.3 gigawatts; we introduced a longer-term target to reduce our carbon intensity by 70% from 2016 through 2030, we now expect to achieve a 50% reduction by 2022; and our world-leading battery-based energy storage joint venture with Siemens, Fluence, was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects, bringing its total to 766 megawatts.
Reflecting on our successful execution, improved visibility and increased confidence in our ability to deliver, we are extending our longer-term outlook by 2 years and now expect 7% to 9% average annual growth in earnings and cash flow through 2022.
As a result of our strong performance in 2018, combined with our improved outlook, we expect to hit the high end of our prior guidance range through 2020. Gustavo will discuss our 2018 results and guidance in more detail after I provide an overview of our strategy.
Turning now to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around the 3 themes of: first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio and lowering risk to deliver attractive returns; second, delivering on our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and, three, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position.
Today, I will review the progress we've made this year in support of these themes and how we have positioned ourselves well for the future. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are seeing the benefits of many initiatives that began several years ago to derisk our portfolio. AES today is a very different company than it was in 2011, doing business in 28 countries around the world with significant commodity exposure. Since then, we have focused our portfolio on roughly a dozen markets, where we have a competitive advantage and we have reduced our overall exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrologies by 70%.
In 2018 alone, we paid down $1 billion in parent debt, and we are on a path to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020, supported not only by our financial metrics, but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio.
Our efforts to enhance the resilience of the portfolio have led us to focus increasingly on clean technologies. 
As you can see on Slide 6, we are significantly decreasing the carbon intensity of our portfolio. In November, we announced a carbon intensity reduction target of 70% by 2030 versus 2016 levels. Today, I am pleased to announce an interim carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022. Our shift to renewable simply makes good business sense. It increases the longevity of our cash flows and allows us to attract a broader investor base.
Another way we are decreasing the risk of our portfolio is by completing most of the large conventional projects under construction and focusing our future growth on renewable projects, which are less capital intensive and considerably simpler to build. 
Turning now to our strong backlog of projects beginning with our projects -- progress on those under construction on Slide 7.  In 2018, we completed 1.3 gigawatts of new projects, including the Eagle Valley combined-cycle gas plant at IP&L in Indiana and the AES Colón combined-cycle gas plant and regasification terminal in Panama and 254 megawatts of solar and energy storage, mostly in the U.S. We still have another 4.4 gigawatts currently under construction and expect it to come online through 2021. 
Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the commissioning phase, and we expect it will be fully completed in April. 
Our Southland repowering project in Southern California is approximately 80% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. 
And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 3/4 complete, with 2/3 of the tunneling work done. 
The remaining projects under construction are made up of renewables across our portfolio. 
As you can see on Slide 9, this capacity is split equally between the U.S. and internationally. All of these projects are going well and they are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction.
Since our last call in November, we have broken ground on 731 megawatts of solar, wind and energy storage. 
As can be seen on Slide 10, in 2018, we signed new PPAs for approximately 2 gigawatts of renewables, and we're on track to sign between 2 and 3 gigawatts annually in the coming years. 
Turning to Slide 11. Combining our capacity under construction with our long-term PPAs that are not yet under construction, yields our total backlog of 5.8 gigawatts. As we execute on our plan to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year, we expect to bring a total of 12 gigawatts online by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about 1/3 today. 
As can be seen on Slide 12, our renewable investments are expected to produce low- to high-teen IRRs across all our markets, assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, which I will discuss in the next few slides, beginning on Slide 13.
First, we have existing commercial relationships that we can leverage to drive new growth. For example, our green, blend and extend strategy allows us to negotiate new long-term PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers. Through this win-win strategy, we preserve the value of our existing thermal capacity contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewable energy. In exchange, our customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation.
In 2018 alone, we negotiated green blend and extend contracts for 576 megawatts in Chile and Mexico. A second advantage that we have for renewable growth is deep market intimacy. For example, AES Distributed Energy recently inaugurated the largest solar storage facility in the world, in island of Kaua'i. The project was made possible by AES' long history in Hawaii and willingness to work with local stakeholders to meet their needs and goals. The project, which includes 100-megawatt hours of 5-hour duration energy storage, will essentially serve as a source of baseload power for the island and deliver roughly 11% of its power.
We recently broke ground on a similar second project, also on the island of Kaua'i, with 14 megawatts of solar and 70-megawatt hours of 5-hour duration energy storage. 
Third, our work with partners provides us with an important competitive advantage. We bring in partners to achieve economies of scale, fine-tune our portfolio and improve our returns on invested capital. 
Our recent sell down of sPower is a good example, where we agreed to sell 48% of our stake in sPower's operating portfolio which, along with operational improvements and refinancing, have increased our returns to 13%. The sell down also provides us with funds to invest in sPower's 10-gigawatt development pipeline to earn similar attractive returns.
Turning now to Slide 16. In addition to our growth in renewables, we continue to increase our LNG business, which is displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. 
As you may know, in 2018, we inaugurated our AES Colón combined-cycle gas plant and LNG regasification facility in Panama, which will play a key role in supplying natural gas for the entire Central American region. 
Our LNG facilities in Panama and the Dominican Republic represent a total installed capacity of 150 tera BTUs to serve local and regional markets. The majority of this capacity is now under contract, and the remaining 55 tera BTUs are still available to drive future growth.
As I mentioned on our last call, we are capitalizing on the expertise we have gained in the Dominican Republic and Panama by developing a similar LNG regasification facility and associated combined cycle power plants in Vietnam. 
Although this long-term U.S. dollar-denominated 450 tera Btu facility is in its early stages, we are making very good progress and it has the potential to contribute significantly to our longer-term growth post-2023. 
Turning to Slide 17. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position. As an example, in 2007, AES launched a small energy storage group that was the first of its kind.  Today, energy storage is beginning to revolutionize the sector and AES is at the forefront. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, was recently named the #1 utility scale, energy-storage integrator in the world by Navigant Research for the third time in a row. 
In 2018, Fluence was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects and is now the largest global energy-storage provider, by capacity, in the world with a total of 80 projects in 17 countries.
Turning to Slide 18, we're also implementing a corporate-wide digital transformation, including becoming a strategic investor in simple energy. Simple energy provides a digital platform that allows our IP&L and DP&L utilities to accelerate energy efficiency and demand response programs, all the while improving customer experience. Simple energy's digital platform serves not only AES' utilities, but 40 other utilities in the U.S. with access to over 40 million end customers. 
Although not in our guidance, we expect that our new digital initiatives to materially benefit both our top and bottom lines. 
We will provide more color, as our digital strategy matures, on future calls. 
Now I will turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results, capital allocation, 2019 guidance and longer-term expectations in more detail."

Today, I will cover our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2018 on a strong note,",1380,"Thank you, Andrés. 
Today, I will cover our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2018 on a strong note, achieving the upper end of our expected ranges for all metrics and setting a solid foundation for growth through 2022. 
As shown on Slide 20, adjusted EPS was $1.24, reflecting higher margins from our businesses, particularly in the U.S. and Utilities and South America's strategic business units, or SBUs, as well as debt pay down at the parent. These positive drivers were partially offset by asset sales in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. 
Turning to Slide 21, adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $160 million. 
I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 22.  In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by DPLs, which benefited from higher rates following the resolution of its rate case. Results also reflect higher contributions from our U.S. solar business and an extended summer run at our Southland plant in California. Increased PTC at our South America SBU reflects higher contracted price in Colombia as well as higher tariff in Argentina, following the 2017 reset. Results also benefited from higher contracted sales and lower interest expense at AES Gener in Chile.
Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCC SBU (sic) [ MCAC SBU ], reflects a full year of operations at the DPP combined at cycle expansion and higher spot energy prices in the Dominican Republic. Results also reflect the commencement of operations at the AES Colón CCGT and regasification facility and improved with hydrology in Panama. 
Finally, in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. 
Turning to our improving credit profile on Slide 26. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016, we have reduced the parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. This includes an additional $150 million repayment in December 2018, which is an acceleration of the debt reduction we had anticipated through 2020. As a result, we achieved a key investment-grade financial metric of 3.95x parent leverage, 1 year ahead of plan, providing us additional confidence in our ability to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. 
We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years, we expect that our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering. 
Now to our 2018 parent capital allocation on Slide 27. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.9 billion of total discretionary cash generating in 2018, consistent with our prior expectations. This includes $689 million of parent free cash flow just above the high end of our expected range. 
Uses on the right-hand side of the slide are also largely in line with our prior disclosures. The one notable exception is our $1.3 billion of cash allocated to parent debt reduction, which reflects the additional $150 million paid down in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 28. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.28 to $1.40. Growth this year will be largely driven by contributions for new projects and cost savings, more specifically, we expect it to benefit from the completion of most of our large thermal construction projects with expected commencement of operations at OPGC 2 in the next few weeks and the first full year of operations at AES Colón in Panama.  Continued growth in renewables, including 1.4 gigawatts scheduled to reach commercial operations this year. A full year of contributions from the cost savings implemented in 2018, lower parent entering interest expense due to completed and continued debt reduction and a slightly lower effective tax rate of 29% to 31%.
This growth will be partially offset by announced business exits in the Philippines, the Netherlands and Oklahoma. Today, we are also providing our outlook of 7% to 9% EPS in cash flow growth through 2022. We have extended this outlook by 2 years, which reflects improved confidence in our backlog and increased visibility of earnings and cash flow. One additional point regarding our longer-term outlook, this 7% to 9% growth rate, which is roughly 2018 base, is in line with hitting the high end of our previous 8% to 10% growth of a 2017 base through 2020.
Consistent with our prior expectations, growth in the outer years is expected to be driven by projects currently under construction, such as Southland, the allocation of parent cash to global renewables' growth and increased LNG sales and MCAC. 
I'd also note a couple of additional business-related assumptions embedded in our longer-term outlook.  First, regarding Maritza in Bulgaria. The plan continues to be dispatched and paid in a timely manner. Discussions related to our PPA are still in early stages, and we are working to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. As we discussed before, our outlook is resilient to any reasonably likely outcome. 
Second, we continue to see our U.S. utilities well positioned for future rate base investment in T&D infrastructure. IPL has grown its rate base over the last few years, and going forward, there is still opportunity for growth in the mid-single digits. 
At DPL, where the focus has been on restructuring the business, we could see growth in the high single digits. To that end, since our last call, DPL has filed both its grid modernization plan and DMR extension. Together, these findings aim to maintain DPL's financial integrity, while bringing its customers the substantial benefits associated with the robust, modernized electric grid. 
Our guidance assumes that DMR is extended it for 2 years from late 2020 through late 2022, allowing the company to meet its financial obligations while retaining the ability to grow its asset base through its marginal investments.
Turning to Slide 29. Parent free cash flow is expected to be from $700 million to $750 million this year, and it is also expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022. 
Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 30.  Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $320 million in asset-sales proceeds with $107 million in proceeds to the parent from the announced sell down of sPower's operating portfolio, in a placeholder for an additional $150 million of this year. 
Now to the uses on the right-hand side.  Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in the December, we will be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect it to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics. And we plan to invest over $400 billion in our subsidiaries, leaving about $100 million of unallocated cash. 
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We expect that our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is more than 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The rest comes from our $2 billion asset-sale target, $1.4 billion of which is completed or announced. 
Turning to the use of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We expect to use $300 million for debt reduction, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality, as we pursue the planned asset sales. 
We are planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog in projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used to create shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Big picture is we have considerable capital tied up in construction projects, which we will be cutting the ribbon from now through 2021. In many cases, we've contributed all of the capital that we need to contribute. So most of our growth is coming from organic projects and just cutting the ribbon. So I want that to be perfectly clear. Second, you have to remember, in our renewables program, half of this is outside the U.S. and the half that's in the U.S., about 40% is wind. So the contributions, for example, of HLBV is so far negligible and it's not as big for us as it is for other people going forward. So in terms of the growth, as I said, a big contributor to this is the organic growth coming from the projects we have completed. In addition to the megawatts that I've mentioned, for example, we have completed the storage tank in Panama, Colón, which is going to happen about middle of this year. So we have additional projects coming online from there. So with that I can pass it up to Gustavo, but I want to make absolutely unambiguous that we have very strong organic growth coming on. And given the distribution of our growth, you don't have things like HLBV outside of the U.S."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial review call.
2018 was a good year for AES, demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We delivered on all of our commitments, including our financial guidance and hit key milestones on our strategy, positioning AES for long-term sustainable growth.
Some of our key accomplishments last year were: we reached the high end of our expected ranges, for both earnings per share and parent free cash flow; we achieved a key investment-grade financial metric 1 year ahead of our plan; we met our expectation of signing long-term PPAs for 2 gigawatts of renewable capacity and increased our backlog to almost 6 gigawatts; we accomplished key milestones on our 4.4 gigawatts under construction and completed construction of an additional 1.3 gigawatts; we introduced a longer-term target to reduce our carbon intensity by 70% from 2016 through 2030, we now expect to achieve a 50% reduction by 2022; and our world-leading battery-based energy storage joint venture with Siemens, Fluence, was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects, bringing its total to 766 megawatts.
Reflecting on our successful execution, improved visibility and increased confidence in our ability to deliver, we are extending our longer-term outlook by 2 years and now expect 7% to 9% average annual growth in earnings and cash flow through 2022.
As a result of our strong performance in 2018, combined with our improved outlook, we expect to hit the high end of our prior guidance range through 2020. Gustavo will discuss our 2018 results and guidance in more detail after I provide an overview of our strategy.
Turning now to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around the 3 themes of: first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio and lowering risk to deliver attractive returns; second, delivering on our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and, three, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position.
Today, I will review the progress we've made this year in support of these themes and how we have positioned ourselves well for the future. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are seeing the benefits of many initiatives that began several years ago to derisk our portfolio. AES today is a very different company than it was in 2011, doing business in 28 countries around the world with significant commodity exposure. Since then, we have focused our portfolio on roughly a dozen markets, where we have a competitive advantage and we have reduced our overall exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrologies by 70%.
In 2018 alone, we paid down $1 billion in parent debt, and we are on a path to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020, supported not only by our financial metrics, but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio.
Our efforts to enhance the resilience of the portfolio have led us to focus increasingly on clean technologies. 
As you can see on Slide 6, we are significantly decreasing the carbon intensity of our portfolio. In November, we announced a carbon intensity reduction target of 70% by 2030 versus 2016 levels. Today, I am pleased to announce an interim carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022. Our shift to renewable simply makes good business sense. It increases the longevity of our cash flows and allows us to attract a broader investor base.
Another way we are decreasing the risk of our portfolio is by completing most of the large conventional projects under construction and focusing our future growth on renewable projects, which are less capital intensive and considerably simpler to build. 
Turning now to our strong backlog of projects beginning with our projects -- progress on those under construction on Slide 7.  In 2018, we completed 1.3 gigawatts of new projects, including the Eagle Valley combined-cycle gas plant at IP&L in Indiana and the AES Colón combined-cycle gas plant and regasification terminal in Panama and 254 megawatts of solar and energy storage, mostly in the U.S. We still have another 4.4 gigawatts currently under construction and expect it to come online through 2021. 
Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the commissioning phase, and we expect it will be fully completed in April. 
Our Southland repowering project in Southern California is approximately 80% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. 
And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 3/4 complete, with 2/3 of the tunneling work done. 
The remaining projects under construction are made up of renewables across our portfolio. 
As you can see on Slide 9, this capacity is split equally between the U.S. and internationally. All of these projects are going well and they are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction.
Since our last call in November, we have broken ground on 731 megawatts of solar, wind and energy storage. 
As can be seen on Slide 10, in 2018, we signed new PPAs for approximately 2 gigawatts of renewables, and we're on track to sign between 2 and 3 gigawatts annually in the coming years. 
Turning to Slide 11. Combining our capacity under construction with our long-term PPAs that are not yet under construction, yields our total backlog of 5.8 gigawatts. As we execute on our plan to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year, we expect to bring a total of 12 gigawatts online by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about 1/3 today. 
As can be seen on Slide 12, our renewable investments are expected to produce low- to high-teen IRRs across all our markets, assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, which I will discuss in the next few slides, beginning on Slide 13.
First, we have existing commercial relationships that we can leverage to drive new growth. For example, our green, blend and extend strategy allows us to negotiate new long-term PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers. Through this win-win strategy, we preserve the value of our existing thermal capacity contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewable energy. In exchange, our customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation.
In 2018 alone, we negotiated green blend and extend contracts for 576 megawatts in Chile and Mexico. A second advantage that we have for renewable growth is deep market intimacy. For example, AES Distributed Energy recently inaugurated the largest solar storage facility in the world, in island of Kaua'i. The project was made possible by AES' long history in Hawaii and willingness to work with local stakeholders to meet their needs and goals. The project, which includes 100-megawatt hours of 5-hour duration energy storage, will essentially serve as a source of baseload power for the island and deliver roughly 11% of its power.
We recently broke ground on a similar second project, also on the island of Kaua'i, with 14 megawatts of solar and 70-megawatt hours of 5-hour duration energy storage. 
Third, our work with partners provides us with an important competitive advantage. We bring in partners to achieve economies of scale, fine-tune our portfolio and improve our returns on invested capital. 
Our recent sell down of sPower is a good example, where we agreed to sell 48% of our stake in sPower's operating portfolio which, along with operational improvements and refinancing, have increased our returns to 13%. The sell down also provides us with funds to invest in sPower's 10-gigawatt development pipeline to earn similar attractive returns.
Turning now to Slide 16. In addition to our growth in renewables, we continue to increase our LNG business, which is displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. 
As you may know, in 2018, we inaugurated our AES Colón combined-cycle gas plant and LNG regasification facility in Panama, which will play a key role in supplying natural gas for the entire Central American region. 
Our LNG facilities in Panama and the Dominican Republic represent a total installed capacity of 150 tera BTUs to serve local and regional markets. The majority of this capacity is now under contract, and the remaining 55 tera BTUs are still available to drive future growth.
As I mentioned on our last call, we are capitalizing on the expertise we have gained in the Dominican Republic and Panama by developing a similar LNG regasification facility and associated combined cycle power plants in Vietnam. 
Although this long-term U.S. dollar-denominated 450 tera Btu facility is in its early stages, we are making very good progress and it has the potential to contribute significantly to our longer-term growth post-2023. 
Turning to Slide 17. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position. As an example, in 2007, AES launched a small energy storage group that was the first of its kind.  Today, energy storage is beginning to revolutionize the sector and AES is at the forefront. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, was recently named the #1 utility scale, energy-storage integrator in the world by Navigant Research for the third time in a row. 
In 2018, Fluence was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects and is now the largest global energy-storage provider, by capacity, in the world with a total of 80 projects in 17 countries.
Turning to Slide 18, we're also implementing a corporate-wide digital transformation, including becoming a strategic investor in simple energy. Simple energy provides a digital platform that allows our IP&L and DP&L utilities to accelerate energy efficiency and demand response programs, all the while improving customer experience. Simple energy's digital platform serves not only AES' utilities, but 40 other utilities in the U.S. with access to over 40 million end customers. 
Although not in our guidance, we expect that our new digital initiatives to materially benefit both our top and bottom lines. 
We will provide more color, as our digital strategy matures, on future calls. 
Now I will turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results, capital allocation, 2019 guidance and longer-term expectations in more detail."
35312,600076131,1676116,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2019",2019-02-27,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andrés. Today, I will cover our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2018 on a strong note,",1380,"Thank you, Andrés. 
Today, I will cover our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2018 on a strong note, achieving the upper end of our expected ranges for all metrics and setting a solid foundation for growth through 2022. 
As shown on Slide 20, adjusted EPS was $1.24, reflecting higher margins from our businesses, particularly in the U.S. and Utilities and South America's strategic business units, or SBUs, as well as debt pay down at the parent. These positive drivers were partially offset by asset sales in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. 
Turning to Slide 21, adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $160 million. 
I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 22.  In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by DPLs, which benefited from higher rates following the resolution of its rate case. Results also reflect higher contributions from our U.S. solar business and an extended summer run at our Southland plant in California. Increased PTC at our South America SBU reflects higher contracted price in Colombia as well as higher tariff in Argentina, following the 2017 reset. Results also benefited from higher contracted sales and lower interest expense at AES Gener in Chile.
Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCC SBU (sic) [ MCAC SBU ], reflects a full year of operations at the DPP combined at cycle expansion and higher spot energy prices in the Dominican Republic. Results also reflect the commencement of operations at the AES Colón CCGT and regasification facility and improved with hydrology in Panama. 
Finally, in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. 
Turning to our improving credit profile on Slide 26. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016, we have reduced the parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. This includes an additional $150 million repayment in December 2018, which is an acceleration of the debt reduction we had anticipated through 2020. As a result, we achieved a key investment-grade financial metric of 3.95x parent leverage, 1 year ahead of plan, providing us additional confidence in our ability to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. 
We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years, we expect that our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering. 
Now to our 2018 parent capital allocation on Slide 27. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.9 billion of total discretionary cash generating in 2018, consistent with our prior expectations. This includes $689 million of parent free cash flow just above the high end of our expected range. 
Uses on the right-hand side of the slide are also largely in line with our prior disclosures. The one notable exception is our $1.3 billion of cash allocated to parent debt reduction, which reflects the additional $150 million paid down in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 28. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.28 to $1.40. Growth this year will be largely driven by contributions for new projects and cost savings, more specifically, we expect it to benefit from the completion of most of our large thermal construction projects with expected commencement of operations at OPGC 2 in the next few weeks and the first full year of operations at AES Colón in Panama.  Continued growth in renewables, including 1.4 gigawatts scheduled to reach commercial operations this year. A full year of contributions from the cost savings implemented in 2018, lower parent entering interest expense due to completed and continued debt reduction and a slightly lower effective tax rate of 29% to 31%.
This growth will be partially offset by announced business exits in the Philippines, the Netherlands and Oklahoma. Today, we are also providing our outlook of 7% to 9% EPS in cash flow growth through 2022. We have extended this outlook by 2 years, which reflects improved confidence in our backlog and increased visibility of earnings and cash flow. One additional point regarding our longer-term outlook, this 7% to 9% growth rate, which is roughly 2018 base, is in line with hitting the high end of our previous 8% to 10% growth of a 2017 base through 2020.
Consistent with our prior expectations, growth in the outer years is expected to be driven by projects currently under construction, such as Southland, the allocation of parent cash to global renewables' growth and increased LNG sales and MCAC. 
I'd also note a couple of additional business-related assumptions embedded in our longer-term outlook.  First, regarding Maritza in Bulgaria. The plan continues to be dispatched and paid in a timely manner. Discussions related to our PPA are still in early stages, and we are working to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. As we discussed before, our outlook is resilient to any reasonably likely outcome. 
Second, we continue to see our U.S. utilities well positioned for future rate base investment in T&D infrastructure. IPL has grown its rate base over the last few years, and going forward, there is still opportunity for growth in the mid-single digits. 
At DPL, where the focus has been on restructuring the business, we could see growth in the high single digits. To that end, since our last call, DPL has filed both its grid modernization plan and DMR extension. Together, these findings aim to maintain DPL's financial integrity, while bringing its customers the substantial benefits associated with the robust, modernized electric grid. 
Our guidance assumes that DMR is extended it for 2 years from late 2020 through late 2022, allowing the company to meet its financial obligations while retaining the ability to grow its asset base through its marginal investments.
Turning to Slide 29. Parent free cash flow is expected to be from $700 million to $750 million this year, and it is also expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022. 
Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 30.  Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $320 million in asset-sales proceeds with $107 million in proceeds to the parent from the announced sell down of sPower's operating portfolio, in a placeholder for an additional $150 million of this year. 
Now to the uses on the right-hand side.  Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in the December, we will be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect it to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics. And we plan to invest over $400 billion in our subsidiaries, leaving about $100 million of unallocated cash. 
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We expect that our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is more than 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The rest comes from our $2 billion asset-sale target, $1.4 billion of which is completed or announced. 
Turning to the use of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We expect to use $300 million for debt reduction, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality, as we pursue the planned asset sales. 
We are planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog in projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used to create shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. 
2018 was a very good year for AES, as demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We are on track to attain investment-grade credit ratings in 2020. We are completing our conventional construction projects. We are signing long-term PPAs for renewables, including successfully implementing green, blend and extend through our backlog. Going forward, we will invest our growing free cash flow in a robust growth pipeline, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and our competitive dividend. 
Accordingly, combining our annual growth and current dividend yield, we expect to deliver double-digit total returns to our shareholders through 2022. 
Operator, we're ready to take questions."

So yes, it's included. But our guidance is robust to any reasonably likely outcome. Regarding DP&L and the rider, I mean, basically what I can tell you is that this has to do with our -- the company achieving investment grade. The company has plans for grid modernization, grid resilience, and we think those elements are necessary and likely to remain. So basically, the outlook for the DP&L, in terms of improving the quality of new services, is good and the modernization rider is part of that."

Big picture is we have considerable capital tied up in construction projects, which we will be cutting the ribbon from now through 2021. In many cases, we've contributed all of the capital that we need to contribute. So most of our growth is coming from organic projects and just cutting the ribbon. So I want that to be perfectly clear. Second, you have to remember, in our renewables program, half of this is outside the U.S. and the half that's in the U.S., about 40% is wind. So the contributions, for example, of HLBV is so far negligible and it's not as big for us as it is for other people going forward. So in terms of the growth, as I said, a big contributor to this is the organic growth coming from the projects we have completed. In addition to the megawatts that I've mentioned, for example, we have completed the storage tank in Panama, Colón, which is going to happen about middle of this year. So we have additional projects coming online from there. So with that I can pass it up to Gustavo, but I want to make absolutely unambiguous that we have very strong organic growth coming on. And given the distribution of our growth, you don't have things like HLBV outside of the U.S."

So it's a mix of product. And the large ones tend to be a bit lumpy. But we like very much of the smaller projects that come in and we increase the number of countries around the world. One thing that's probably -- we just -- AES together with Mitsubishi inaugurated India's first energy storage project, last week in Delhi and this, with -- together with Tata Power. And this project is, I think, very important for India because it's, sort of, establishing how energy storage would work on that grid and getting the regulations in place. And as you know, India has -- it is actually building out 200 gigawatts of renewables, probably, 80, I think, are in the bag.

Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call.  Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts.  We continue to transform the company, growing our renewable LNG businesses, simp",1582,"Good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call.  
Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts.  We continue to transform the company, growing our renewable LNG businesses, simplifying and streamlining our portfolio, reducing costs and improving our overall risk profile.  Specifically, we reported first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.28 and remain confident in our full year outlook.  We're on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020.  We signed long-term contracts for approximately 500 megawatts of renewable capacity, increasing our backlog to 6.2 gigawatts.  We signed a 12-year agreement to sell up to 18 tera BTUS of LNG annually in the Caribbean beginning in 2020.  
Today, we're announcing a target of $100 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized by 2022 as a result of our digital initiatives.  And we agreed to sell our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland for $211 million.  Gustavo will discuss our financial results and capital allocation plan in more detail following my remarks.  
Turning to Slide 4.  Our core strategy continues to revolve around 3 themes: first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio to deliver attractive returns; second, increasing our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and third, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading positions.  Today, I will review the progress we've made since our last call in support of these themes.  
Turning to Slide 5.  We continue to take steps to derisk our portfolio and make it even more resilient.  We remain on track to attain investment-grade ratings by 2020 supported not only by ur financial metrics, but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio.  
We expect to achieve our carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022 and 70% by 2030, reducing potential regulatory risk and attracting a broader investment -- investor base.  One of the ways we are reducing our carbon intensity is through our 'green blend and extend' strategy where we are negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers.  Through this win-win strategy, we preserve the value of our existing contracts while extending our average contract life and earning a return on our incremental capital investments.  We are currently in advanced discussions for additional large 'green blend and extend' contracts in Chile and Mexico.  Separately, we just initiated similar conversations on 'green blend and extend' in Puerto Rico.  
Another way we're transforming our portfolio is by exiting businesses.  For example, in late April, we announced the sale of more than 2 gigawatts of overwhelmingly thermal generation in Jordan and Northern Ireland.  These sales decrease our merchant exposure, lower our carbon intensity and reduce our presence to 13 countries.  In line with our capital allocation framework, we will primarily invest these proceeds in renewables in the Americas.  
Turning to Slide 6.  As we've discussed previously, we're focused on growing our business through long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts with limited merchant commodity and hydrology exposure.  One additional initiative that I would like to mention today is the expansion of our business with commercial and industrial customers.  This approach further enhances our resilience by diversifying our customer base and providing greater protection from regulatory and macroeconomic factors in our markets.  
Now turning to our backlog.  Our growth in renewables continues as can be seen on the Slide 7.  During the first quarter, we signed new long-term PPAs for approximately 500 megawatts of renewables, consistent with our expectations.  
Turning to Slide 8, we now have a total backlog of 6.2 gigawatts, and we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year for a total of approximately 12 gigawatts of new capacity by 2022.  By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about 1/3 today.  
Now to our projects under construction beginning on the Slide 9.  Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, approximately 40% is now renewables.  This percentage will grow as we bring online the large conventional thermal plants we contracted a number of years ago while adding new wind, solar and energy storage projects.  
As you can see on the Slide 10, the renewable projects under construction are split equally between the U.S. and international.  All of these projects are expected to come online in the next 18 months.  We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction.  
For example, as you can see on Slide 11, we received all necessary permits for sPower's 700-megawatt Highlander solar project in Virginia, the largest solar project in the Mid-Atlantic.  This product has long-term contracts with C&I  customers such as Apple and Microsoft, and we expect to begin construction this summer with completion targeted for 2020 and 2021.  
Turning to Slide 12 and our conventional projects under construction.  Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the testing phase and is running at full load.  The plant is expected to be operational later this month and will deliver much needed power to the Indian grid.  Our Southland repowering project in Southern California is approximately 90% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year.  And our hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 78% complete with 72% of the work done.  
Turning now to our LNG business on the Slide 13.  You see the expansion of the LNG projects is complementary to our renewable businesses as it provides capacity while displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas.  This business is based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk.  Another benefit of our LNG projects is that once they are built, they can be scaled up at relatively low cost as most other key infrastructure is already in place.  
We are focusing our LNG growth on 2 major markets.  First in Vietnam where we are making very good progress towards the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity and 2 gigawatts of associated combined-cycle gas plants.  We expect this project to significantly contribute to our growth beginning in 2023.  
Second, in the Caribbean and Central America, where we have a total of 150 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic.  Our guidance assumes that we would contract some of the excess capacity available at these 2 terminals.  In fact since our last call, we signed a 12-year contract for up to 18 tera BTUs of annual capacity.  With this contract, we have already locked in the terminal capacity payments that are assumed in our guidance through 2022.  The remaining uncontracted capacity provides us with $0.03 of potential EPS upside relative to our guidance.  
Turning to Slide 14.  The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our market-leading position and realize commercial and operational efficiencies.  As most of you know, AES is at the forefront of battery-based storage.  Fluence, our energy storage joint venture is the leading provider of storage in the world with 81 projects in 18 countries totaling 776 megawatts deployed or awarded.  
Now let me say a few words on the recent thermal incident at our 2-megawatt energy storage facility we installed for Arizona Public Service, which resulted in serious injuries of 4 first responders last month.  Of course, our top priority is the health, safety and recovery of the first responders.  Fortunately, we understand from statements made by the hospital that all are expected to make a full recovery.  
Regarding the event itself, Fluence immediately dispatched a team of technical and operational experts to support in the incident cause investigation.  AES and Fluence are committed to share what they can with the investigation, especially insights that will be helpful to the entire industry and first responders in efforts to prevent similar incidents anywhere in the world.  AES has been safely operating a fleet of battery-based energy storage systems for over a decade and today has storage systems operating in multiple countries, uses and environments.  We continue to believe in the use of lithium ion batteries for energy storage and continue to see rapidly growing demand for this technology and its many applications.  
Finally, turning to Slide 15.  Today, we announced the launch of an additional $100 million annual cost savings program.  Our savings target is based on our current digital initiatives, which are expected to be fully implemented by 2022.  Although we have significantly reduced costs over the last several years, we are taking our efforts to the next level by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base.  As most of our business is long-term contracted in fixed U.S. prices, much of the benefits from these digital initiatives will flow through our bottom line.  Specifically, the main activities include utilizing AI for predictive maintenance and outage prevent (sic), using technologies such as robotics and drones for solar and wind maintenance and inspection, and implementing process in administrative and support functions.  On an annual basis, we are targeting a 5% reduction in the total expense for these activities, net of any costs we achieve it.  So we feel very confident about our ability to achieve $100 million in annual run rate savings by 2022.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."
35312,609584186,1722744,"The AES Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 07, 2019",2019-05-07,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andrés.  Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation.  In the first quarter, we make solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40 as shown on the Slide 17, adjusted EPS",955,"Thank you, Andrés.  Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation.  In the first quarter, we make solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40 as shown on the Slide 17, adjusted EPS was $0.28 primarily reflecting the benefits of improving efficiencies and lower parent interest expense resulting from about $1 billion in debt paydown.  This improvement was offset by the impact of asset sales and shutdowns.  With our first quarter results and 2.2 gigawatt coming online in the year to go, we are on track to achieve our full year guidance.  
Turning to Slide 18.  Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $272 million for the quarter, a decrease of $16 million.  I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 19.  
In the US and Utilities SBU, relatively flat PTC reflects higher rates following the resolutions of rate cases late last year [at DPL and IPL as well as lower expected asset retirement obligations at DPL.  These impacts were partially offset by the assets of coal-fired generation at  DPL . 
Regarding DPL's DMR extension filing, there is not much to report.  We expect activity to increase as the transition in the commission is complete and the chairman is now in place.  Accordingly, we remain  track for an expected ruling in 2020, and we continue to feel confident about the merits of our case.  
At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by Argentina where we saw lower dispatch at our plants.  These generation profile was in line with our projections and was expected to impact the first quarter only.  Relatively flat PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean or MCAC SBU reflects an extended planned outage for maintenance and repairs at our hydro plant in Panama.  This was partially offset by the commencement of operations at AES Colón last year and outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic.
Finally, in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and the Netherlands as well as the shutdown of 300 megawatts of capacity at Northern Ireland.  In Bulgaria, there have been no significant developments since our last call.  Our plant continues to be highly dispatched, reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid, and we are being paid on time.  
Turning to our improving credit profile on the Slide 23.  Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016, we have reduced parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%.  We continue to have ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and remain confident in our ability to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020.  We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also to enhance our equity valuation.  Over the next 2 years, we expect our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent cash flow as well as modest additional delevering.  
While parent credit improvement is a key focus of ours, we are constantly looking for opportunities to strengthen the capital structure of our subsidiaries.  This is demonstrated by the $1.5 billion of liability management transactions we have executed so far this year at 3 businesses alone, Gener, Tietê and DPL.  In all cases, we were able to take advantage of good market conditions to extend maturities and lower interest rates.  For instance at DPL, we refinanced $400 million of the holdco 2021 notes, increasing the term by 8 years and reducing interest rate by 290 basis points.  
Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on the Slide 24.  Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow.  Sources also include $384 million in asset sale proceeds, which is [ $16 million ] higher than our previous disclosure for 2019.  Proceeds include approximately $170 million from the selldown of our operating portfolio and $211 million from the sale of our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland announced a couple of weeks ago.  
Now to use on the right-hand side.  Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year.  We expect to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics.  And we plan to invest over $400 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.  
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 25.  We expect that our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap.  About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow.  The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.  
Turning to the uses of discretionary cash on the Slide 26.  Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends.  Looking forward subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average.  
We expect to use $300 million for debt reduction, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales.  We are also planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projected PPAs.  Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.  The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.  
With that, I'll turn on the call back over to Andrés."

You have a long-term terminal contract where we really make our returns on the capacity maintenance and energy is a pass-through.  So we basically go to the client and say we will replace a portion of the energy being generated by the thermal plant with renewable energy if you sign a long-term PPA.  So this is a win-win for both because we get a new contract for a renewable and get a return on that, and we still get our capacity payment.  So part of this is you have to -- we learn how to run our formal plants at a lower [MIN] to make space for the renewable.  Now in the case of Mexico, we have that which are thermal plants.  In Chile, we have a number of thermal plants where we've already been applying this with our large commercial and industrial customers.  And in Puerto Rico, you may have seen we are in discussions with PURPA to see how we can some modifications to allow for green blend and extend as well.  Basically, we are reacting to customers' desires for more green energy.  In many cases, the cost of the energy is lower than the variable costs of running the thermal plant and we're lowering carbon footprints in line with what they desire.  And importantly, we're keeping the capacity.  Because when everybody talks about renewables, that's great for energy, but what about capacity, the ability to maintain the lights on 24/7.? so we feel there are 2 ways to do it, green blend and extend, or energy storage.

And we've seen a slight degradation, only $0.02 from let's say where we were thinking year ago.  So Argentine assets are excellent assets and it's a very robust business.  Since I've been involved in the Argentine business since the year 2000, we made money every year.  We've paid dividends every year.  We did have 3 years where we weren't able to convert those dividends into dollars because there were currency restrictions in place.  So to put it into perspective, first, it's a very resilient business.  And depending on government policies, there could be some degradation, but it's not a binary issue, I believe.  
I think with the political situation in Argentina having elections in October, we'll see who wins, whether it's a continuation of the current president.  it could be [Labania] or you could have Cristina Kirchner who is running on her own.  So we'll have to see.  I don't think there will be any immediate -- regardless of who wins, immediate outcome or changes in this sector that would require laws for it to change.  I think -- as I said in the past when people got very worried about the exchange rate in Argentina, [looking like they had] terrible harvest, 30% lower, but they are increasing -- if they have normal harvest.  And with the increase in their natural gas exports, reaching exports of natural gas eliminating imports, I think that side looks a lot stronger.  So it's really a question of what -- how the change in the regulatory structure is.  We've been there before and as I said, it's not a binary issue.  Overall, we feel cautiously optimistic that things will continue more or less as they are today."

Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call.Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, sim",1587,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call.
Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, simplifying and streamlining our portfolio, reducing costs and improving our overall risk profile.
Specifically, we reported first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.28 and remain confident in our full year outlook. We're on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. We signed long-term contracts for approximately 500 megawatts of renewable capacity, increasing our backlog to 6.2 gigawatts. We signed a 12-year agreement to sell up to 18 tera BTUS of LNG annually in the Caribbean beginning in 2020. 
Today, we're announcing a target of $100 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized by 2022 as a result of our digital initiatives. And we agreed to sell our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland for $211 million. Gustavo will discuss our financial results and capital allocation plan in more detail following my remarks.
Turning to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around 3 themes: first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio to deliver attractive returns; second, increasing our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and third, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading positions. Today, I will review the progress we've made since our last call in support of these themes.
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to take steps to derisk our portfolio and make it even more resilient. We remain on track to attain investment-grade ratings by 2020 supported not only by our financial metrics, but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio.
We expect to achieve our carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022 and 70% by 2030, reducing potential regulatory risk and attracting a broader investor base. One of the ways we are reducing our carbon intensity is through our Green Blend and Extend strategy where we are negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers.
Through this win-win strategy, we preserve the value of our existing contracts while extending our average contract life and earning a return on our incremental capital investments. We are currently in advanced discussions for additional large Green Blend and Extend contracts in Chile and Mexico. Separately, we just initiated similar conversations on Green Blend and Extend with PREPA in Puerto Rico.
Another way we're transforming our portfolio is by exiting businesses. For example, in late April, we announced the sale of more than 2 gigawatts of overwhelmingly thermal generation in Jordan and Northern Ireland. These sales decrease our merchant exposure, lower our carbon intensity and reduce our presence to 13 countries. In line with our capital allocation framework, we will primarily invest these proceeds in renewables in the Americas.
Turning to Slide 6. As we've discussed previously, we're focused on growing our business through long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts with limited merchant, commodity and hydrology exposure. One additional initiative that I would like to mention today is the expansion of our business with commercial and industrial customers. This approach further enhances our resilience by diversifying our customer base and providing greater protection from regulatory and macroeconomic factors in our markets.
Now turning to our backlog. Our growth in renewables continues as can be seen on Slide 7. During the first quarter, we signed new long-term PPAs for approximately 500 megawatts of renewables, consistent with our expectations.
Turning to Slide 8. We now have a total backlog of 6.2 gigawatts, and we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year for a total of approximately 12 gigawatts of new capacity by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about 1/3 today. 
Now to our projects under construction, beginning on Slide 9. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, approximately 40% is now renewables. This percentage will grow as we bring online the large conventional thermal plants we contracted a number of years ago while adding new wind, solar and energy storage projects.
As you can see on Slide 10, the renewable projects under construction are split equally between the U.S. and international. All of these projects are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction.
For example, as you can see on Slide 11, we received all necessary permits for sPower's 500-megawatt Highlander Solar Project in Virginia, the largest solar project in the Mid-Atlantic. This project has long-term contracts with C&I  customers such as Apple and Microsoft, and we expect to begin construction this summer with completion targeted for 2020 and 2021.
Turning to Slide 12 and our conventional projects under construction. Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the testing phase and is running at full load. The plant is expected to be operational later this month and will deliver much needed power to the Indian grid. Our Southland repowering project in Southern California is approximately 90% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 78% complete with 72% of the tunneling work done.
Turning now to our LNG business on Slide 13. You see the expansion of our LNG projects is complementary to our renewable businesses as it provides capacity while displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. This business is based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk. Another benefit of our LNG projects is that once they are built, they can be scaled up at relatively low cost as most of the key infrastructure is already in place.
We are focusing our LNG growth on 2 major markets. First in Vietnam where we are making very good progress towards the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity and 2 gigawatts of associated combined cycle gas plants. We expect this project to significantly contribute to our growth beginning in 2023.
Second, in the Caribbean and Central America, where we have a total of 150 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Our guidance assumes that we would contract some of the excess capacity available at these 2 terminals. In fact, since our last call, we signed a 12-year contract for up to 18 tera BTUs of annual capacity. With this contract, we have already locked in the terminal capacity payments that are assumed in our guidance through 2022. The remaining uncontracted capacity provides us with $0.03 of potential EPS upside relative to our guidance.
Turning to Slide 14. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our market-leading position and realize commercial and operational efficiencies. As most of you know, AES is at the forefront of battery-based energy storage. Fluence, our energy storage joint venture, is the leading provider of grid-scale storage in the world with 81 projects in 18 countries totaling 776 megawatts deployed or awarded.
Now let me say a few words on the recent thermal incident at our 2-megawatt energy storage facility we installed for Arizona Public Service, which resulted in serious injuries of 4 first responders last month. Of course, our top priority is the health, safety and recovery of the first responders. Fortunately, we understand from statements made by the hospital that all are expected to make a full recovery.
Regarding the event itself, Fluence immediately dispatched a team of technical and operational experts to support APS in the incident root cause investigation. AES and Fluence have committed to share what they can from the investigation, especially insights that will be helpful to the entire industry and first responders in efforts to prevent similar incidents anywhere in the world.
AES has been safely operating a fleet of battery-based energy storage systems for over a decade and today has storage systems operating in multiple countries, uses and environments. We continue to believe in the use of lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and continue to see rapidly growing demand for this technology and its many applications.
Finally, turning to Slide 15. Today, we announced the launch of an additional $100 million annual cost savings program. Our savings target is based on our current digital initiatives, which are expected to be fully implemented by 2022. Although we have significantly reduced costs over the last several years, we're taking our efforts to the next level by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base.
As most of our business is long-term contracted at fixed U.S. prices, much of the benefits from these digital initiatives will flow to our bottom line. Specifically, the main activities include utilizing AI for predictive maintenance in outage [ prevention ], using technologies such as robotics and drones for solar and wind maintenance and inspection and implementing process in administrative and support functions. On an annual basis, we are targeting a 5% reduction in the total expense for these activities, net of any costs to achieve. So we feel very confident about our ability to achieve $100 million in annual run rate savings by 2022.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

In the first quarter, we make solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40.As shown on Slide 17, adjusted EPS was",961,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. In the first quarter, we make solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40.
As shown on Slide 17, adjusted EPS was $0.28 primarily reflecting the benefits of improving efficiencies and lower parent interest expense resulting from about $1 billion in debt paydown. This improvement was offset by the impact of asset sales and shutdowns. With our first quarter results and 2.2 gigawatt coming online in the year to go, we are on track to achieve our full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 18. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $272 million for the quarter, a decrease of $16 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 19.
In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, relatively flat PTC reflects higher rates following the resolutions of rate cases late last year at DPL and IPL as well as lower expected asset retirement obligations at DPL. These impacts were partially offset by the exits of coal-fired generation at DPL and Shady Point.
Regarding DPL's DMR extension filing, there is not much to report but expect activity to increase as the transition at the commission is complete and the new chairman is now in place. Accordingly, we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020, and we continue to feel confident about the merits of our case.
At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by Argentina where we saw lower dispatch at our plants. This generation profile was in line with our projections and was expected to impact the first quarter only. Relatively flat PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean or MCAC SBU reflects an extended planned outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama. This was partially offset by the commencement of operations at AES Colón CCGT last year and outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic.
Finally, in Eurasia, lower results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and the Netherlands as well as the shutdown of 300 megawatts of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In Bulgaria, there have been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be highly dispatched, reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid, and we are being paid on time.
Turning to our improving credit profile on the Slide 23. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016, we have reduced parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and remain confident in our ability to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next 2 years, we expect our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering.
While parent credit improvement is a key focus of ours, we are also constantly looking for opportunities to strengthen the capital structure of our subsidiaries. This is demonstrated by the $1.5 billion of liability management transactions we have executed so far this year at 3 businesses alone, Gener, Tietê and DPL. In all cases, we're able to take advantage of good market conditions to extend maturities and lower interest rates. For instance, at DPL, we refinanced $400 million of the holdco 2021 notes, increasing the term by 8 years and reducing the interest rate by 290 basis points.
Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 24. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $384 million in asset sale proceeds, which is $60 million higher than our previous disclosure for 2019. Proceeds include approximately $170 million from the sell-down of sPower's operating portfolio and $211 million from the sale of our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland announced a couple of weeks ago.
Now to use on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expected allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics. And we plan to invest over $400 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 25. We expected that our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on the Slide 26. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average.
We expected to use $300 million for debt reduction, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales. We are also planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. 
With that, I'll turn on the call back over to Andrés."

We are growing the distribution business, IPL, DPL as well. So that's the main driver.
As we've mentioned in the last call, from our perspective, a lot of the renewable is outside the U.S. So the growth is not really, from an ITC, PTC recognition, not really a major driver for our 7% to 9%. And a lot of the growth, the 7% to 9%, we do have a lot of deals already in the pocket like Southland coming online, OPGC, cost cutting, things like that.
So it's not a major driver in our case because as I said, 50% is in the U.S. Even in the U.S., you have 40% wind, which has a low impact. And I think what is more important, our cash flow has also grown at 7% to 9% ratio, which kind of reinforced the quality of the earnings."

You have a long-term thermal contract where we really make our returns on the capacity payments and energy is the pass-through. So we basically go to the client and say we will replace a portion of the energy being generated by the thermal plant with renewable energy if you sign a long-term PPA.
So this is a win-win for both because we get a new contract for a renewable and get a return on that and we still get our capacity payment. So part of this is that you have to -- we learned how to run our formal plants at a lower [ min ] to make space for the renewable.
Now in the case of Mexico, we have TEG/TEP which are thermal plants. Of course, in Chile, we have a number of thermal plants where we've already been applying this with our large commercial and industrial customers. And in Puerto Rico, you may have seen that we're in discussions with PREPA to see how we could some modifications to allow for Green Blend and Extend as well.
So basically, we are reacting to customers' desires for more green energy. In many cases, the cost of the energy is lower than the variable cost of running the thermal plant, and we're lowering carbon footprints in line with what they desire. And very importantly, we're keeping the capacity. Because when everybody talks about renewables, that's great for energy, but what about capacity, the ability to maintain the lights on 24/7? So we really feel that there are 2 ways to do it, Green Blend and Extend or energy storage, and I think we're well positioned in both sides."

So really, the question, is there any degradation in the earnings? And we've seen a slight degradation, $0.01 or $0.02 from, let's say, where we were thinking maybe a year ago.
So our Argentine assets are excellent assets and it's a very robust business. Since I've been involved in the Argentine business since the year 2000, we've made money every year. We've paid dividends every year. We did have 3 years where we're able to convert those dividends into dollars because there were currency restrictions in place so to put it into perspective.
So first, it's a very resilient business. And depending on government policies, there could be some degradation, but it's not a binary issue, I believe. I think with the political situation in Argentina, they're having elections in October, and we'll see who wins, whether it's a continuation of the current president. It could be Lavagna who's a Peronist or you could have Cristina Kirchner who's running on her own.
And so we'll have to see. I don't think there will be any immediate -- regardless of who wins, I don't think there'll be any immediate outcome or changes in this sector that would require laws for it to change. I think that the -- as I said in the past, when people got very worried about the exchange rate in Argentina, [ sort of ] looking like they had a terrible harvest, 30% lower, but they're -- if they have normal harvest and with the increase in their natural gas exports -- actually reaching exports of natural gas eliminating imports, I think that side looks a lot stronger.
So it's really a question of what -- how the change in the regulatory structure is. We've been there before, and as I said, it's not a binary issue. Overall, we feel cautiously optimistic that things will continue more or less as they are today."

So we have to investigate what was it that occurred in this event, exactly what was the root cause and make sure that we engineer or take all precautions to really minimize the likelihood of such an event in the past.
Things are changing in terms of some of the technologies, but we've had lithium-ion batteries on a grid scale, 10 to 40 megawatts operating for 10 years already without an incident. So we're investigating it. There's not much I can say at this point.

Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call.Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, sim",1589,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call.
Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, simplifying and streamlining our portfolio, reducing costs and improving our overall risk profile.
Specifically, we reported first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.28 and remain confident in our full year outlook. We're on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. We signed long-term contracts for approximately 500 megawatts of renewable capacity, increasing our backlog to 6.2 gigawatts. We signed a 12-year agreement to sell up to 18 tera BTUs of LNG annually in the Caribbean beginning in 2020. 
Today, we're announcing a target of $100 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized by 2022 as a result of our digital initiatives. And we agreed to sell our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland for $211 million. Gustavo will discuss our financial results and capital allocation plan in more detail following my remarks.
Turning to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around 3 themes: first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio to deliver attractive returns; second, increasing our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and third, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading positions. Today, I will review the progress we've made since our last call in support of these themes.
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to take steps to derisk our portfolio and make it even more resilient. We remain on track to attain investment-grade ratings by 2020 supported not only by our financial metrics, but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio.
We expect to achieve our carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022 and 70% by 2030, reducing potential regulatory risk and attracting a broader investor base. One of the ways we are reducing our carbon intensity is through our Green Blend and Extend strategy where we are negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers.
Through this win-win strategy, we preserve the value of our existing contracts while extending our average contract life and earning a return on our incremental capital investments. We are currently in advanced discussions for additional large Green Blend and Extend contracts in Chile and Mexico. Separately, we just initiated similar conversations on Green Blend and Extend with PREPA in Puerto Rico.
Another way we're transforming our portfolio is by exiting certain businesses. For example, in late April, we announced the sale of more than 2 gigawatts of overwhelmingly thermal generation in Jordan and Northern Ireland. These sales decrease our merchant exposure, lower our carbon intensity and reduce our presence to 13 countries. In line with our capital allocation framework, we will primarily invest these proceeds in renewables in the Americas.
Turning to Slide 6. As we've discussed previously, we're focused on growing our business through long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts with limited merchant, commodity and hydrology exposure. One additional initiative that I would like to mention today is the expansion of our business with commercial and industrial customers. This approach further enhances our resilience by diversifying our customer base and providing greater protection from regulatory and macroeconomic factors in our markets.
Now turning to our backlog. Our growth in renewables continues as can be seen on Slide 7. During the first quarter, we signed new long-term PPAs for approximately 500 megawatts of renewables, consistent with our expectations.
Turning to Slide 8. We now have a total backlog of 6.2 gigawatts, and we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year for a total of approximately 12 gigawatts of new capacity by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about 1/3 today. 
Now to our projects under construction, beginning on Slide 9. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, approximately 40% is now renewables. This percentage will grow as we bring online the large conventional thermal plants we contracted a number of years ago while adding new wind, solar and energy storage projects.
As you can see on Slide 10, the renewable projects under construction are split equally between the U.S. and international. All of these projects are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction.
For example, as you can see on Slide 11, we received all necessary permits for sPower's 500-megawatt Highlander Solar Project in Virginia, the largest solar project in the Mid-Atlantic. This project has long-term contracts with C&I customers such as Apple and Microsoft, and we expect to begin construction this summer with completion targeted for 2020 and 2021.
Turning to Slide 12 and our conventional projects under construction. Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the testing phase and is running at full load. The plant is expected to be operational later this month and will deliver much needed power to the Indian grid. Our Southland repowering project in Southern California is approximately 90% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 78% complete with 72% of the tunneling work done.
Turning now to our LNG business on Slide 13. You see the expansion of our LNG projects is complementary to our renewable businesses as it provides capacity while displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. This business is based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk. Another benefit of our LNG projects is that once they are built, they can be scaled up at relatively low cost as most of the key infrastructure is already in place.
We are focusing our LNG growth on 2 major markets. First in Vietnam where we are making very good progress towards the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity and 2 gigawatts of associated combined cycle gas plants. We expect this project to significantly contribute to our growth beginning in 2023.
Second, in the Caribbean and Central America, where we have a total of 150 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Our guidance assumes that we would contract some of the excess capacity available at these 2 terminals. In fact, since our last call, we signed a 12-year contract for up to 18 tera BTUs of annual capacity. With this contract, we have already locked in the terminal capacity payments that are assumed in our guidance through 2022. The remaining uncontracted capacity provides us with $0.03 of potential EPS upside relative to our guidance.
Turning to Slide 14. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our market-leading position and realize commercial and operational efficiencies. As most of you know, AES is at the forefront of battery-based energy storage. Fluence, our energy storage joint venture, is the leading provider of grid-scale storage in the world with 81 projects in 18 countries totaling 776 megawatts deployed or awarded.
Now let me say a few words on the recent thermal incident at our 2-megawatt energy storage facility we installed for Arizona Public Service, which resulted in serious injuries of 4 first responders last month. Of course, our top priority is the health, safety and recovery of the first responders. Fortunately, we understand from statements made by the hospital that all are expected to make a full recovery.
Regarding the event itself, Fluence immediately dispatched a team of technical and operational experts to support APS in the incident root cause investigation. APS and Fluence have committed to share what they can from the investigation, especially insights that would be helpful to the entire industry and first responders in efforts to prevent similar incidents anywhere in the world.
AES has been safely operating a fleet of battery-based energy storage systems for over a decade and today has storage systems operating in multiple country users and environments. We continue to believe in the use of lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and continue to see rapidly growing demand for this technology and its many applications.
Finally, turning to Slide 15. Today, we announced the launch of an additional $100 million annual cost savings program. Our savings target is based on our current digital initiatives, which are expected to be fully implemented by 2022. Although we have significantly reduced costs over the last several years, we're taking our efforts to the next level by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base.
As most of our business is long-term contracted at fixed U.S. prices, much of the benefits from these digital initiatives will flow to our bottom line. Specifically, the main activities include utilizing AI for predictive maintenance and outage [ preventage ], using technologies such as robotics and drones for solar and wind maintenance and inspection and implementing process automation in administrative and support functions. On an annual basis, we are targeting a 5% reduction in the total expense for these activities, net of any costs to achieve. So we feel very confident about our ability to achieve $100 million in annual run rate savings by 2022.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. In the first quarter, we made solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40.As shown on Slide 17, adjusted EPS was",960,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. In the first quarter, we made solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40.
As shown on Slide 17, adjusted EPS was $0.28 primarily reflecting the benefits of improving efficiencies and lower parent interest expense resulting from about $1 billion in debt paydown. This improvement was offset by the impact of asset sales and shutdowns. With our first quarter results and 2.2 gigawatt coming online in the year to go, we are on track to achieve our full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 18. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $272 million for the quarter, a decrease of $16 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 19.
In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, relatively flat PTC reflects higher rates following the resolutions of rate cases late last year at DPL and IPL as well as lower expected asset retirement obligations at DPL. These impacts were partially offset by the exits of coal-fired generation at DPL and Shady Point.
Regarding DPL's DMR extension filing, there is not much to report but expect activity to increase as the transition at the commission is complete and the new chairman is now in place. Accordingly, we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020, and we continue to feel confident about the merits of our case.
At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by Argentina where we saw lower dispatch at our plants. This generation profile was in line with our projections and was expected to impact the first quarter only. Relatively flat PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean or MCAC SBU reflects an extended planned outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama. This was partially offset by the commencement of operations at AES Colón CCGT last year and outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic.
Finally, in Eurasia, lower results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and the Netherlands as well as the shutdown of 300 megawatts of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In Bulgaria, there have been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be highly dispatched, reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid, and we are being paid on time.
Turning to our improving credit profile on Slide 23. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016, we have reduced parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and remain confident in our ability to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years, we expect our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering.
While parent credit improvement is a key focus of ours, we are also constantly looking for opportunities to strengthen the capital structure of our subsidiaries. This is demonstrated by the $1.5 billion of liability management transactions we have executed so far this year at 3 businesses alone, Gener, Tietê and DPL. In all cases, we're able to take advantage of good market conditions to extend maturities and lower interest rates. For instance, at DPL, we refinanced $400 million of the holdco 2021 notes, increasing the term by 8 years and reducing the interest rate by 290 basis points.
Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 24. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $384 million in asset sale proceeds, which is $60 million higher than our previous disclosure for 2019. Proceeds include approximately $170 million from the sell-down of sPower's operating portfolio and $211 million from the sale of our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland announced a couple of weeks ago.
Now to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics. And we plan to invest over $400 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 25. We expect that our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on the Slide 26. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average.
We expected to use $300 million for debt reduction, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales. We are also planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

As we've mentioned in the last call, from our perspective, a lot of the renewable is outside the U.S. So the growth is not really -- from an ITC, PTC recognition, not really a major driver for our 7% to 9%. And a lot of the growth, the 7% to 9%, we do have a lot of deals already in the pocket like Southland coming online, OPGC, cost cutting, things like that.
So it's not a major driver in our case because as I said, 50% is in the U.S. Even in the U.S., you have 40% wind, which has a low impact. And I think what is more important, our cash flow has also grown at 7% to 9% ratio, which kind of reinforced the quality of the earnings."

You have a long-term thermal contract where we really make our returns on the capacity payments and energy is a pass-through. So we basically go to the client and say we will replace a portion of the energy being generated by the thermal plant with renewable energy if you sign a long-term PPA.
So this is a win-win for both because we get a new contract for a renewable and get a return on that and we still get our capacity payment. So part of this is that you have to -- we learned how to run our thermal plants at a lower [ min ] to make space for the renewable.
Now in the case of Mexico, we have TEG/TEP which are thermal plants. Of course, in Chile, we have a number of thermal plants where we've already been applying this with our large commercial and industrial customers. And in Puerto Rico, you may have seen that we're in discussions with PREPA to see how we could have some modifications to allow for Green Blend and Extend as well.
So basically, we are reacting to customers' desires for more green energy. In many cases, the cost of the energy is lower than the variable cost of running the thermal plant, and we're lowering carbon footprints in line with what they desire. And very importantly, we're keeping the capacity. Because when everybody talks about renewables, that's great for energy, but what about capacity, the ability to maintain the lights on 24/7? So we really feel that there are 2 ways to do it, Green Blend and Extend or energy storage, and I think we're well positioned in both sides."

So really, the question, is there any degradation in the earnings? And we've seen a slight degradation, $0.01 or $0.02 from, let's say, where we were thinking maybe a year ago.
So our Argentine assets are excellent assets and it's a very robust business. Since I've been involved in the Argentine business since the year 2000, we've made money every year. We've paid dividends every year. We did have 3 years where we're unable to convert those dividends into dollars because there were currency restrictions in place so to put it into perspective.
So first, it's a very resilient business. And depending on government policies, there could be some degradation, but it's not a binary issue, I believe. I think with the political situation in Argentina, they're having elections in October, and we'll see who wins, whether it's a continuation of the current president. It could be Lavagna who's a Peronist or you could have Cristina Kirchner who's running on her own.
And so we'll have to see. I don't think there will be any immediate -- regardless of who wins, I don't think there'll be any immediate outcome or changes in this sector. This would require laws for it to change. I think that the -- as I said in the past, when people got very worried about the exchange rate in Argentina, I said, look, they had a terrible harvest, 30% lower, but they're increasing their -- if they have normal harvest and with the increase in their natural gas exports -- actually reaching exports of natural gas eliminating imports, I think that side looks a lot stronger.
So it's really a question of what -- how the change in the regulatory structure is. We've been there before, and as I said, it's not a binary issue. Overall, we feel cautiously optimistic that things will continue more or less as they are today."

Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call.Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, sim",1587,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call.
Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, simplifying and streamlining our portfolio, reducing costs and improving our overall risk profile.
Specifically, we reported first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.28 and remain confident in our full year outlook. We're on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. We signed long-term contracts for approximately 500 megawatts of renewable capacity, increasing our backlog to 6.2 gigawatts. We signed a 12-year agreement to sell up to 18 tera BTUs of LNG annually in the Caribbean beginning in 2020. 
Today, we're announcing a target of $100 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized by 2022 as a result of our digital initiatives. And we agreed to sell our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland for $211 million. Gustavo will discuss our financial results and capital allocation plan in more detail following my remarks.
Turning to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around 3 themes: first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio to deliver attractive returns; second, increasing our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and third, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading positions. Today, I will review the progress we've made since our last call in support of these themes.
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to take steps to derisk our portfolio and make it even more resilient. We remain on track to attain investment-grade ratings by 2020 supported not only by our financial metrics, but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio.
We expect to achieve our carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022 and 70% by 2030, reducing potential regulatory risk and attracting a broader investor base. One of the ways we are reducing our carbon intensity is through our Green Blend and Extend strategy where we are negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers.
Through this win-win strategy, we preserve the value of our existing contracts while extending our average contract life and earning a return on our incremental capital investments. We are currently in advanced discussions for additional large Green Blend and Extend contracts in Chile and Mexico. Separately, we just initiated similar conversations on Green Blend and Extend with PREPA in Puerto Rico.
Another way we're transforming our portfolio is by exiting certain businesses. For example, in late April, we announced the sale of more than 2 gigawatts of overwhelmingly thermal generation in Jordan and Northern Ireland. These sales decrease our merchant exposure, lower our carbon intensity and reduce our presence to 13 countries. In line with our capital allocation framework, we will primarily invest these proceeds in renewables in the Americas.
Turning to Slide 6. As we've discussed previously, we're focused on growing our business through long-term, U.S.-dollar-denominated contracts with limited merchant, commodity and hydrology exposure. One additional initiative that I would like to mention today is the expansion of our business with commercial and industrial customers. This approach further enhances our resilience by diversifying our customer base and providing greater protection from regulatory and macroeconomic factors in our markets.
Now turning to our backlog. Our growth in renewables continues as can be seen on Slide 7. During the first quarter, we signed new long-term PPAs for approximately 500 megawatts of renewables, consistent with our expectations.
Turning to Slide 8. We now have a total backlog of 6.2 gigawatts, and we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year for a total of approximately 12 gigawatts of new capacity by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about 1/3 today. 
Now to our projects under construction, beginning on Slide 9. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, approximately 40% is now renewables. This percentage will grow as we bring online the large conventional thermal plants we contracted a number of years ago while adding new wind, solar and energy storage projects.
As you can see on Slide 10, the renewable projects under construction are split equally between the U.S. and international. All of these projects are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction.
For example, as you can see on Slide 11, we received all necessary permits for sPower's 500-megawatt Highlander Solar Project in Virginia, the largest solar project in the Mid-Atlantic. This project has long-term contracts with C&I customers such as Apple and Microsoft, and we expect to begin construction this summer with completion targeted for 2020 and 2021.
Turning to Slide 12 and our conventional projects under construction. Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the testing phase and is running at full load. The plant is expected to be operational later this month and will deliver much needed power to the Indian grid. Our Southland repowering project in Southern California is approximately 90% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 78% complete with 72% of the tunneling work done.
Turning now to our LNG business on Slide 13. You see the expansion of our LNG projects is complementary to our renewable businesses as it provides capacity while displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. This business is based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk. Another benefit of our LNG projects is that once they are built, they can be scaled up at relatively low cost as most of the key infrastructure is already in place.
We are focusing our LNG growth on 2 major markets. First in Vietnam where we are making very good progress towards the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity and 2 gigawatts of associated combined cycle gas plants. We expect this project to significantly contribute to our growth beginning in 2023.
Second, in the Caribbean and Central America, where we have a total of 150 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Our guidance assumes that we would contract some of the excess capacity available at these 2 terminals. In fact, since our last call, we signed a 12-year contract for up to 18 tera BTUs of annual capacity. With this contract, we have already locked in the terminal capacity payments that are assumed in our guidance through 2022. The remaining uncontracted capacity provides us with $0.03 of potential EPS upside relative to our guidance.
Turning to Slide 14. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our market-leading position and realize commercial and operational efficiencies. As most of you know, AES is at the forefront of battery-based energy storage. Fluence, our energy storage joint venture, is the leading provider of grid-scale storage in the world with 81 projects in 18 countries totaling 776 megawatts deployed or awarded.
Now let me say a few words on the recent thermal incident at our 2-megawatt energy storage facility we installed for Arizona Public Service, which resulted in serious injuries of 4 first responders last month. Of course, our top priority is the health, safety and recovery of the first responders. Fortunately, we understand from statements made by the hospital that all are expected to make a full recovery.
Regarding the event itself, Fluence immediately dispatched a team of technical and operational experts to support APS in the incident root cause investigation. APS and Fluence have committed to share what they can from the investigation, especially insights that would be helpful to the entire industry and first responders in efforts to prevent similar incidents anywhere in the world.
AES has been safely operating a fleet of battery-based energy storage systems for over a decade and today has storage systems operating in multiple country users and environments. We continue to believe in the use of lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and continue to see rapidly growing demand for this technology and its many applications.
Finally, turning to Slide 15. Today, we announced the launch of an additional $100 million annual cost savings program. Our savings target is based on our current digital initiatives, which are expected to be fully implemented by 2022. Although we have significantly reduced costs over the last several years, we're taking our efforts to the next level by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base.
As most of our business is long-term contracted at fixed U.S. prices, much of the benefits from these digital initiatives will flow to our bottom line. Specifically, the main activities include utilizing AI for predictive maintenance and outage [ preventage ], using technologies such as robotics and drones for solar and wind maintenance and inspection and implementing process automation in administrative and support functions. On an annual basis, we are targeting a 5% reduction in the total expense for these activities, net of any costs to achieve. So we feel very confident about our ability to achieve $100 million in annual run rate savings by 2022.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. In the first quarter, we made solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40.As shown on Slide 17, adjusted EPS was",960,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. In the first quarter, we made solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40.
As shown on Slide 17, adjusted EPS was $0.28 primarily reflecting the benefits of improving efficiencies and lower parent interest expense resulting from about $1 billion in debt paydown. This improvement was offset by the impact of asset sales and shutdowns. With our first quarter results and 2.2 gigawatt coming online in the year to go, we are on track to achieve our full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 18. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $272 million for the quarter, a decrease of $16 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 19.
In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, relatively flat PTC reflects higher rates following the resolutions of rate cases late last year at DPL and IPL as well as lower expected asset retirement obligations at DPL. These impacts were partially offset by the exits of coal-fired generation at DPL and Shady Point.
Regarding DPL's DMR extension filing, there is not much to report but expect activity to increase as the transition at the commission is complete and the new chairman is now in place. Accordingly, we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020, and we continue to feel confident about the merits of our case.
At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by Argentina where we saw lower dispatch at our plants. This generation profile was in line with our projections and was expected to impact the first quarter only. Relatively flat PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean or MCAC SBU reflects an extended planned outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama. This was partially offset by the commencement of operations at AES Colón CCGT last year and outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic.
Finally, in Eurasia, lower results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and the Netherlands as well as the shutdown of 300 megawatts of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In Bulgaria, there have been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be highly dispatched, reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid, and we are being paid on time.
Turning to our improving credit profile on Slide 23. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016, we have reduced parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and remain confident in our ability to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years, we expect our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering.
While parent credit improvement is a key focus of ours, we are also constantly looking for opportunities to strengthen the capital structure of our subsidiaries. This is demonstrated by the $1.5 billion of liability management transactions we have executed so far this year at 3 businesses alone, Gener, Tietê and DPL. In all cases, we're able to take advantage of good market conditions to extend maturities and lower interest rates. For instance, at DPL, we refinanced $400 million of the holdco 2021 notes, increasing the term by 8 years and reducing the interest rate by 290 basis points.
Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 24. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $384 million in asset sale proceeds, which is $60 million higher than our previous disclosure for 2019. Proceeds include approximately $170 million from the sell-down of sPower's operating portfolio and $211 million from the sale of our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland announced a couple of weeks ago.
Now to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics. And we plan to invest over $400 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 25. We expect that our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on the Slide 26. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average.
We expected to use $300 million for debt reduction, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales. We are also planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

We are growing the distribution business, IPL, DPL as well. So that's the main driver.
As we've mentioned in the last call, from our perspective, a lot of the renewable is outside the U.S. So the growth is not really -- from an ITC, PTC recognition, not really a major driver for our 7% to 9%. And a lot of the growth, the 7% to 9%, we do have a lot of deals already in the pocket like Southland coming online, OPGC, cost cutting, things like that.
So it's not a major driver in our case because as I said, 50% is in the U.S. Even in the U.S., you have 40% wind, which has a low impact. And I think what is more important, our cash flow has also grown at 7% to 9% ratio, which kind of reinforced the quality of the earnings."

You have a long-term thermal contract where we really make our returns on the capacity payments and energy is a pass-through. So we basically go to the client and say we will replace a portion of the energy being generated by the thermal plant with renewable energy if you sign a long-term PPA.
So this is a win-win for both because we get a new contract for a renewable and get a return on that and we still get our capacity payment. So part of this is that you have to -- we learned how to run our thermal plants at a lower [ min ] to make space for the renewable.
Now in the case of Mexico, we have TEG/TEP which are thermal plants. Of course, in Chile, we have a number of thermal plants where we've already been applying this with our large commercial and industrial customers. And in Puerto Rico, you may have seen that we're in discussions with PREPA to see how we could have some modifications to allow for Green Blend and Extend as well.
So basically, we are reacting to customers' desires for more green energy. In many cases, the cost of the energy is lower than the variable cost of running the thermal plant, and we're lowering carbon footprints in line with what they desire. And very importantly, we're keeping the capacity. Because when everybody talks about renewables, that's great for energy, but what about capacity, the ability to maintain the lights on 24/7? So we really feel that there are 2 ways to do it, Green Blend and Extend or energy storage, and I think we're well positioned in both sides."

So really, the question, is there any degradation in the earnings? And we've seen a slight degradation, $0.01 or $0.02 from, let's say, where we were thinking maybe a year ago.
So our Argentine assets are excellent assets and it's a very robust business. Since I've been involved in the Argentine business since the year 2000, we've made money every year. We've paid dividends every year. We did have 3 years where we're unable to convert those dividends into dollars because there were currency restrictions in place so to put it into perspective.
So first, it's a very resilient business. And depending on government policies, there could be some degradation, but it's not a binary issue, I believe. I think with the political situation in Argentina, they're having elections in October, and we'll see who wins, whether it's a continuation of the current president. It could be Lavagna who's a Peronist or you could have Cristina Kirchner who's running on her own.
And so we'll have to see. I don't think there will be any immediate -- regardless of who wins, I don't think there'll be any immediate outcome or changes in this sector. This would require laws for it to change. I think that the -- as I said in the past, when people got very worried about the exchange rate in Argentina, I said, look, they had a terrible harvest, 30% lower, but they're increasing their -- if they have normal harvest and with the increase in their natural gas exports -- actually reaching exports of natural gas eliminating imports, I think that side looks a lot stronger.
So it's really a question of what -- how the change in the regulatory structure is. We've been there before, and as I said, it's not a binary issue. Overall, we feel cautiously optimistic that things will continue more or less as they are today."

Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call. Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, si",1588,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call.
 Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, simplifying and streamlining our portfolio, reducing costs and improving our overall risk profile.
 Specifically, we reported first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.28 and remain confident in our full year outlook. We're on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. We signed long-term contracts for approximately 500 megawatts of renewable capacity, increasing our backlog to 6.2 gigawatts. We signed a 12-year agreement to sell up to 18 tera BTUs of LNG annually in the Caribbean beginning in 2020. 
Today, we're announcing a target of $100 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized by 2022 as a result of our digital initiatives. And we agreed to sell our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland for $211 million. Gustavo will discuss our financial results and capital allocation plan in more detail following my remarks.
 
Turning to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around 3 themes: first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio to deliver attractive returns; second, increasing our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and third, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading positions. Today, I will review the progress we've made since our last call in support of these themes.
 
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to take steps to derisk our portfolio and make it even more resilient. We remain on track to attain investment-grade ratings by 2020 supported not only by our financial metrics, but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio.
 
We expect to achieve our carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022 and 70% by 2030, reducing potential regulatory risk and attracting a broader investor base. One of the ways we are reducing our carbon intensity is through our Green Blend and Extend strategy where we are negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers.
 Through this win-win strategy, we preserve the value of our existing contracts while extending our average contract life and earning a return on our incremental capital investments. We are currently in advanced discussions for additional large Green Blend and Extend contracts in Chile and Mexico. Separately, we just initiated similar conversations on Green Blend and Extend with PREPA in Puerto Rico.
 
 Another way we're transforming our portfolio is by exiting certain businesses. For example, in late April, we announced the sale of more than 2 gigawatts of overwhelmingly thermal generation in Jordan and Northern Ireland. These sales decrease our merchant exposure, lower our carbon intensity and reduce our presence to 13 countries. In line with our capital allocation framework, we will primarily invest these proceeds in renewables in the Americas.
 
 Turning to Slide 6. As we've discussed previously, we're focused on growing our business through long-term, U.S. dollar-denominated contracts with limited merchant, commodity and hydrology exposure. One additional initiative that I would like to mention today is the expansion of our business with commercial and industrial customers. This approach further enhances our resilience by diversifying our customer base and providing greater protection from regulatory and macroeconomic factors in our markets.
 
Now turning to our backlog. Our growth in renewables continues as can be seen on Slide 7. During the first quarter, we signed new long-term PPAs for approximately 500 megawatts of renewables, consistent with our expectations.
 
 Turning to Slide 8. We now have a total backlog of 6.2 gigawatts, and we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year for a total of approximately 12 gigawatts of new capacity by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about 1/3 today. 
Now to our projects under construction, beginning on Slide 9. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, approximately 40% is now renewables. This percentage will grow as we bring online the large conventional thermal plants we contracted a number of years ago while adding new wind, solar and energy storage projects.
 
 As you can see on Slide 10, the renewable projects under construction are split equally between the U.S. and international. All of these projects are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction.
 
For example, as you can see on Slide 11, we received all necessary permits for sPower's 500-megawatt Highlander Solar Project in Virginia, the largest solar project in the Mid-Atlantic. This project has long-term contracts with C&I customers such as Apple and Microsoft, and we expect to begin construction this summer with completion targeted for 2020 and 2021.
 
Turning to Slide 12 and our conventional projects under construction. Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the testing phase and is running at full load. The plant is expected to be operational later this month and will deliver much needed power to the Indian grid. Our Southland repowering project in Southern California is approximately 90% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 78% complete with 72% of the tunneling work done.
 
Turning now to our LNG business on Slide 13. You see the expansion of our LNG projects is complementary to our renewable businesses as it provides capacity while displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. This business is based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk. Another benefit of our LNG projects is that once they are built, they can be scaled up at relatively low cost as most of the key infrastructure is already in place.
 
We are focusing our LNG growth on 2 major markets. First in Vietnam where we are making very good progress towards the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity and 2 gigawatts of associated combined cycle gas plants. We expect this project to significantly contribute to our growth beginning in 2023.
 
 Second, in the Caribbean and Central America, where we have a total of 150 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Our guidance assumes that we would contract some of the excess capacity available at these 2 terminals. In fact, since our last call, we signed a 12-year contract for up to 18 tera BTUs of annual capacity. With this contract, we have already locked in the terminal capacity payments that are assumed in our guidance through 2022. The remaining uncontracted capacity provides us with $0.03 of potential EPS upside relative to our guidance.
 
Turning to Slide 14. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our market-leading position and realize commercial and operational efficiencies. As most of you know, AES is at the forefront of battery-based energy storage. Fluence, our energy storage joint venture, is the leading provider of grid-scale storage in the world with 81 projects in 18 countries totaling 776 megawatts deployed or awarded.
 
Now let me say a few words on the recent thermal incident at our 2-megawatt energy storage facility we installed for Arizona Public Service, which resulted in serious injuries of 4 first responders last month. Of course, our top priority is the health, safety and recovery of the first responders. Fortunately, we understand from statements made by the hospital that all are expected to make a full recovery.
 
 Regarding the event itself, Fluence immediately dispatched a team of technical and operational experts to support APS in the incident root cause investigation. APS and Fluence have committed to share what they can from the investigation, especially insights that would be helpful to the entire industry and first responders in efforts to prevent similar incidents anywhere in the world.
 AES has been safely operating a fleet of battery-based energy storage systems for over a decade and today has storage systems operating in multiple country users and environments. We continue to believe in the use of lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and continue to see rapidly growing demand for this technology and its many applications.
 
Finally, turning to Slide 15. Today, we announced the launch of an additional $100 million annual cost savings program. Our savings target is based on our current digital initiatives, which are expected to be fully implemented by 2022. Although we have significantly reduced costs over the last several years, we're taking our efforts to the next level by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base.
 As most of our business is long-term contracted at fixed U.S. prices, much of the benefits from these digital initiatives will flow to our bottom line. Specifically, the main activities include utilizing AI for predictive maintenance and outage [ preventage ], using technologies such as robotics and drones for solar and wind maintenance and inspection and implementing process automation in administrative and support functions. On an annual basis, we are targeting a 5% reduction in the total expense for these activities, net of any costs to achieve. So we feel very confident about our ability to achieve $100 million in annual run rate savings by 2022.
 
 Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."
35312,609584186,1751420,"The AES Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 07, 2019",2019-05-07,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. In the first quarter, we made solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40.  As shown on Slide 17, adjusted EPS",960,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. In the first quarter, we made solid progress towards our full year guidance range of $1.28 to $1.40.
 
 As shown on Slide 17, adjusted EPS was $0.28 primarily reflecting the benefits of improving efficiencies and lower parent interest expense resulting from about $1 billion in debt paydown. This improvement was offset by the impact of asset sales and shutdowns. With our first quarter results and 2.2 gigawatt coming online in the year to go, we are on track to achieve our full year guidance.
 
 Turning to Slide 18. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $272 million for the quarter, a decrease of $16 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 19.
 
 In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, relatively flat PTC reflects higher rates following the resolutions of rate cases late last year at DPL and IPL as well as lower expected asset retirement obligations at DPL. These impacts were partially offset by the exits of coal-fired generation at DPL and Shady Point.
 
Regarding DPL's DMR extension filing, there is not much to report but expect activity to increase as the transition at the commission is complete and the new chairman is now in place. Accordingly, we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020, and we continue to feel confident about the merits of our case.
 
 At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by Argentina where we saw lower dispatch at our plants. This generation profile was in line with our projections and was expected to impact the first quarter only. Relatively flat PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean or MCAC SBU reflects an extended planned outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama. This was partially offset by the commencement of operations at AES Colón CCGT last year and outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic.
Finally, in Eurasia, lower results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and the Netherlands as well as the shutdown of 300 megawatts of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In Bulgaria, there have been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be highly dispatched, reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid, and we are being paid on time.
 
Turning to our improving credit profile on Slide 23. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016, we have reduced parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and remain confident in our ability to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years, we expect our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering.
 
While parent credit improvement is a key focus of ours, we are also constantly looking for opportunities to strengthen the capital structure of our subsidiaries. This is demonstrated by the $1.5 billion of liability management transactions we have executed so far this year at 3 businesses alone, Gener, Tietê and DPL. In all cases, we're able to take advantage of good market conditions to extend maturities and lower interest rates. For instance, at DPL, we refinanced $400 million of the holdco 2021 notes, increasing the term by 8 years and reducing the interest rate by 290 basis points.
 
Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 24. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $384 million in asset sale proceeds, which is $60 million higher than our previous disclosure for 2019. Proceeds include approximately $170 million from the sell-down of sPower's operating portfolio and $211 million from the sale of our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland announced a couple of weeks ago.
 
Now to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics. And we plan to invest over $400 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.
 
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 25. We expect that our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
 
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on the Slide 26. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average.
 
We expected to use $300 million for debt reduction, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales. We are also planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

So we feel very confident because a lot of these are things which some other companies have done, and so we're really leapfrogging here to put ourselves at the leading edge.
 As you know, we hired a new Chief Information Digital Officer, Sanjeev Addala. He's working hand in hand with our Chief Operational Officer, Bernerd Da Santos. So we feel very good about this in going forward and we've identified where the savings would come from. And it's also quite frankly leapfrogging and catching up with the leading edge of all of our -- other companies around the world."

We are growing the distribution business, IPL, DPL as well. So that's the main driver.
 As we've mentioned in the last call, from our perspective, a lot of the renewable is outside the U.S. So the growth is not really -- from an ITC, PTC recognition, not really a major driver for our 7% to 9%. And a lot of the growth, the 7% to 9%, we do have a lot of deals already in the pocket like Southland coming online, OPGC, cost cutting, things like that.
 So it's not a major driver in our case because as I said, 50% is in the U.S. Even in the U.S., you have 40% wind, which has a low impact. And I think what is more important, our cash flow has also grown at 7% to 9% ratio, which kind of reinforced the quality of the earnings."

You have a long-term thermal contract where we really make our returns on the capacity payments and energy is a pass-through. So we basically go to the client and say we will replace a portion of the energy being generated by the thermal plant with renewable energy if you sign a long-term PPA.
 So this is a win-win for both because we get a new contract for a renewable and get a return on that and we still get our capacity payment. So part of this is that you have to -- we learned how to run our thermal plants at a lower [ min ] to make space for the renewable.
 Now in the case of Mexico, we have TEG/TEP which are thermal plants. Of course, in Chile, we have a number of thermal plants where we've already been applying this with our large commercial and industrial customers. And in Puerto Rico, you may have seen that we're in discussions with PREPA to see how we could have some modifications to allow for Green Blend and Extend as well.
 So basically, we are reacting to customers' desires for more green energy. In many cases, the cost of the energy is lower than the variable cost of running the thermal plant, and we're lowering carbon footprints in line with what they desire. And very importantly, we're keeping the capacity. Because when everybody talks about renewables, that's great for energy, but what about capacity, the ability to maintain the lights on 24/7? So we really feel that there are 2 ways to do it, Green Blend and Extend or energy storage, and I think we're well positioned in both sides."

So really, the question, is there any degradation in the earnings? And we've seen a slight degradation, $0.01 or $0.02 from, let's say, where we were thinking maybe a year ago.
 So our Argentine assets are excellent assets and it's a very robust business. Since I've been involved in the Argentine business since the year 2000, we've made money every year. We've paid dividends every year. We did have 3 years where we're unable to convert those dividends into dollars because there were currency restrictions in place so to put it into perspective.
 
So first, it's a very resilient business. And depending on government policies, there could be some degradation, but it's not a binary issue, I believe. I think with the political situation in Argentina, they're having elections in October, and we'll see who wins, whether it's a continuation of the current president. It could be Lavagna who's a Peronist or you could have Cristina Kirchner who's running on her own.
 And so we'll have to see. I don't think there will be any immediate -- regardless of who wins, I don't think there'll be any immediate outcome or changes in this sector. This would require laws for it to change. I think that the -- as I said in the past, when people got very worried about the exchange rate in Argentina, I said, look, they had a terrible harvest, 30% lower, but they're increasing their -- if they have normal harvest and with the increase in their natural gas exports -- actually reaching exports of natural gas eliminating imports, I think that side looks a lot stronger.
 So it's really a question of what -- how the change in the regulatory structure is. We've been there before, and as I said, it's not a binary issue. Overall, we feel cautiously optimistic that things will continue more or less as they are today."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 financial review call. I am pleased to report that based on our year-to-date results and our expected growth in the second half of the year, we are on track to achieve our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with the midpoint of $1.34, and our parent free cash flow target with the midpoint of $725 million. We are also confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022.
Turning to Slide 4. Since our last call, we have continued to make great progress on our 3 key strategic objectives. These are: First, becoming investment-grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio; second, positioning the company for sustained growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects; and third, improving our competitiveness by deploying innovative technologies.
Now allow me to provide some color on each 1 starting with our first objective of becoming investment-grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio on Slide 5. We have already achieved a key investment-grade metric, and we are on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. Our improved credit metrics reflect the growth of our free cash flow, paying down 43% of our recourse debt and an almost 70% decrease in our exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrology over the past 8 years.
A good example of this last point is bringing LNG to Panama with the commissioning of the AES Colón terminal and combined cycle power plant. This new facility has our reduced our exposure to pour hydrology in Panama by 70%, by providing far less expensive energy to supply our Hydro PTAs in times of drought. Such has occur ed in 2014 and is occurring again this year. It is not only good for AES, but it is expected to say Panama, more than $400 million a year in imported fuel expenses.
We are further enhancing the resilience of our portfolio by decreasing our carbon intensity. This year alone, we have announced the sale of 2.4 gigawatts of thermal generation in Northern Ireland, Jordan and Oklahoma.
As you can see on Slide 6 as a result of our actions, we expect to reduce our carbon intensity by 50% from 2016 levels by 2022. By that date, we also expect that coal will represent less than 30% of our total generation by megawatt hour.
Now to our second objectives, positioning the company for sustainable growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects beginning on Slide 7. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts of mostly renewable projects. This number encompasses projects under construction or with signed PPAs, all of which are expected to be online by 2023. We are now on track to become one of the 5 largest renewable developers in the world outside of China.
As we discussed on our last call, we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of renewables per year, split roughly 50-50 between wind and solar and likewise, between the U.S. and international. So far this year, we have signed 1 gigawatt of renewable PPAs, including about 500 megawatts since our last call. This new capacity includes 181 megawatts of renewable energy signed in Chile as part of our Green Blend and Extend strategy. Through this win-win approach, we preserve the value of our existing contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewables. In exchange, our customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation. We expect to see meaningful progress on the Green Blend and Extend opportunity in the coming months.
Now to our projects under construction beginning on Slide 8. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, 43% are renewables. This percentage will continue to grow as we complete the large conventional thermal plants we started a number of years ago, while adding new wind, solar and energy storage. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we have been able to transition projects from development to construction.
Now on to Slide 9. We are reaching key milestones on our conventional projects under construction. We have completed the construction of our OPGC 2 plant in India with 1 unit already online and the second unit in the final commissioning phase.
Our Southland repowering project in California continues to progress well and is now approximately 95% complete. We recently achieved first fire and the project is on track to come online in the first quarter of next year, ahead of our original schedule.
I'm also pleased to announce that just yesterday, the storage tank at our AES Colón LNG regasification facility in Panama came online, replacing the temporary floating storage unit we have been using.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now approximately 80% complete. As you may remember, is the most difficult aspect of construction, and we now have completed 36 miles with only 5 miles to go until initial COD. Additionally, we broke ground on a 10-megawatt energy storage project that will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world. This innovative project is for our Hydro plant, which is part of the Alto Maipo complex. It will store 5 hours of energy during periods of low demand and inject that energy into the great hours of peak demand, providing the run of the river plant with many of the same capabilities as the reservoir. We have the potential to increase the virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts of 5-hour energy storage at the Alto Maipo complex.
Turning to Slide 11. Another component of our contracted growth strategy is investing in LNG, which we see as complementary to our renewables business. Not only does LNG displays heavy fuel oil and diesel with less volatile, cheaper and cleaner natural gas, but the investments are based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk.
I have previously mentioned that once our LNG import terminals and regasification facilities are built, they can be scaled up at a relatively low cost as much of the key infrastructure is already in place. We are working on expanding our LNG storage capacity in the Dominican Republic by 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or are in advanced negotiations for [ 30 ] tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES and is expected to be completed by 2022. Once fully contracted, this expansion will provide $0.02 of incremental EPS. This is up above the $0.03 of potential upside on our existing LNG facilities in the region we had already discussed.
In Vietnam, we're making excellent progress toward the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage and 2 gigawatts of combined cycle power plants. We expect to achieve this critical milestone this year. And once completed, this project will be an important contributor to our earnings growth beyond 2022.
Now to our third strategic objective of deploying new technologies to maintain our market-leading positions beginning on Slide 12. We are complementing and enhancing our current businesses by incorporating digital capabilities and by growing in adjacent areas. As we discussed on our last call by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base, this is a primary driver of our $100 million annual cost savings initiative. We are on track to fully achieve these savings by 2022.
One example of our investment in new technologies in our energy storage business. We are now the undisputed global leader in the sector as both an owner of projects and through Fluence, the energy storage provider that we jointly owned [indiscernible] Fluence has now surpassed 1 gigawatt of projects either awarded or delivered, including more than 400 megawatts of projects awarded in the first half of 2019 alone. With the current backlog of nearly $700 million and a growing pipeline of activity, Fluence is cash positive, self-funding and has the potential to a rapidly increase value as demand for energy storage accelerates.
Now to Slide 13. Another example is our investment in Simple Energy, a company that provides utility customers a marketplace for energy efficiency products. There's great demand for digital solutions that enable energy users to be more efficient and Simple Energy has grown even faster than we anticipated. Since our last call, Simple Energy has merged with other companies to form a company called Uplight. Uplight is now a market leader in providing cloud-based energy solutions in the United States, serving 85 electric and gas utilities with more than 100 million customers. Through this transaction, the implied value of our equity in Simple Energy nearly doubled in little over a year since our initial investment.
In digital business such as Uplight is capitalized, largely self-funding and we expect Uplight's annual revenue to grow significantly from its current base of over $100 million.
Finally, turning to Slide 14. AES' excess success a technology leader was recently recognized when we were awarded our industry's top honor, AEI Edison award. We were honored for our innovation in advancing round-the-clock renewables at our solar storage, which is already operational in Hawaii. We see renewables plus storage as an increasingly important for our sector, and AES is well positioned to gain significant market share in this space.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.As",1039,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our financial results, outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.
As shown on Slide 16 in the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.26, primarily reflecting higher contributions from the U.S. in the lower tax rate. This was partially offset by the impact of asset sales as well is planted outages in Panama and Northern Ireland. In the second half, we expect to post stronger results as a benefit from the plant in Panama returning to our operations, with continued cost savings initiatives and 2 gigawatts of new projects reaching COD.
Turning to Slide 17, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $240 million for the quarter, a decrease of $50 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S. [indiscernible] increased PTC reflects the resolution of regulated rate cases last year, contributions from new renewable projects and higher energy sales at Southland. These impacts were partially offset by the access of coal-fired generation at DPL and Shady Point.
Regarding DPL's DMR extension filing, there is not much to report but we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020. And continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL to turn from its electric grid while continue to meet the energy needs of its customers with inclusive service reliability, efficiency and safety.
The plan calls for $1.2 billion of investment over 70 years with a mechanism recovering 80% of discussed between rate case. AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan would be a key component of the mid-single-digit rate base growth we have discussed in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020.
At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and energy price in Colombia as well as lower volumes in Chile. Lower PTC at our Mexico Central America, the Caribbean or MCC SBU reflects an extended expected outage for maintenance and repairs our Hydro plant in Panama.
Finally. [indiscernible] lower results primarily reflect planted outages at Calvert and the shutdown of 300 megawatts of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In Mid-June, we closed the sale of these businesses for total proceeds of $120 million.
In Bulgaria, there has been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be dispatched reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid and we are being on time.
Lastly, we recently took advantage of strong market demand for infrastructure project in Vietnam to refinance $1.1 billion of project [indiscernible] at The issuance was 4x oversubscribed and enabled us to lower our interest rate, while improving financial flexibility. This is just another example of our continued liability management effort across our portfolio, capitalizing on a low interest rate environment.
Now to Slide 22. To summarize, our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.53 versus $0.52 last year. Relative to 2018, we expect the strong growth in the second half of 2019, primarily driven by contributions for new businesses, continued cost savings initiatives and the timing of our major outages, particularly in Panama and the Dominican Republic.
As you may have seen in our press release, we are affirming the $1.34 midpoint of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. We are also narrowing the range by $0.04 to $1.28 -- $1.28 to $1.40, $1.30 to $1.38, given our confidence in the outlook for the second half of the year. I would also highlight that we are reaffirming our 2019 parent free cash flow target of $700 million to $750 million.
Turning to 2019. Parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left-hand side, reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also consider $369 million in asset sale proceeds, which include Northern Ireland, and it's an sPower sell down, both of which have closed, as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year end.
Now on the right-hand side. Included a 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect to allocate another $150 million to parent debt paydown, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics, and we plan to invest $415 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 24. We expect our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sales proceeds about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
In addition to this, we are making very good progress on the third-party capital initiative we have discussed previously and expect the formal announcement later this year. As we have said before, the goal is to provide a more systematic and cost-effective source of capital that will be incremental to the $4 billion I just mentioned.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We plan to use $300 million for debt reduction, half of which we expect to compete in 2019. The other half will be used to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales.
We are also expecting to use $1.5 billion for our equity investment in our backlog and projected PPAs. And an additional $200 million to fund investments at IPL was completed all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $470 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Look, whatever occurs, will continue to be very important for Puerto Rico. We have the most reliable and by far, the cheapest energy on the island. To replace our coal plant in Puerto Rico by burning heavy fuel, which is what the other plants mainly burn besides some gas, would cost about an additional $300 million to $400 million a year important fuel bills. So that would have to pay an additional $300 million to $400 million per year, which will be passed on to consumers. I think what's also very important is of the large plants, there are only 2, which are EPA compliant, most of the plans in Puerto Rico, because they're burning heavy fuel oil have excess emissions of socks, so they're not EPA compliant. And for that reason, the air in San Juan and 2 main cities is not compliant. So while there's been knows about our coal ash on the island, really, this plant is very necessary.

But we'll be conscious of that, but I think it's moving very well.

Let's take this multi-faceted question part by part. I think regarding get on, as you know, when President Trump visited Vietnam, there was a letter of intent signed for these projects, and it was, I'd say, one of the marquee projects that the 2 countries had agreed to. So energy demand in Vietnam is growing around 10%. Quite frankly, Vietnam is one of the beneficiaries of some of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. So expect demand to go even faster. Vietnam does not have a sufficient domestic LNG, doesn't even have sufficient coal facility. Vietnam is moving towards LNG and renewables as well. So this is a very necessary project, it's going to start supplying not only the new combined cycle gas plants, which are part of this initiative but existing ones, which are running out of offshore gas as well. So again, I think it's very necessary, it's also a project that's very important for both countries, for the U.S. and for Vietnam. So the next things is expect a further progress in terms of announcements between the 2 countries and us that this is going to be moving forward with what Vietnamese partners are involved. Vietnam is a country of consensus, as I said. So it takes time, but they move and they move in a very steady but very certain fashion. So that's what I would say sort of stay tuned. And it will, of course, we have to -- we are part of the Vietnamese government's master electricity plan, and that will also involve how much LNG is imported and the phasing in of the combined cycle plants. On the second, I will pass this to Gustavo. What I would say is that a big part of the $1.2 billion at IPL is actually, it's a Smart Grid infrastructure. So I'll pass it to Gustavo."

Well pump storage in either reservoir, you've got to put that water somewhere, and you have to build pipelines, and you have to use electricity get up there. So there's friction, just the physics of storing electrons is superior to than storing molecules because of the virtual dam is basically the idea to combine one of the river facility such as the whole Alto Maipo complex, it's about 750 megawatts. And then you have a associated energy storage. Now if you have a 5-hour storage, what I would remind people, that means is 5 hours at 100% discharge. If you discharge it at 50%, you actually have energy storage capabilities for 10 hours. So what this will allow is run of the river is constant and what we will be doing is injecting energy into the grid when the prices are best. That's basically it, and really providing capacity. I mean, the one big issue with the renewables is that they don't really provide you round-the-clock capacity. So this will provide us -- our run of the river does have actually capacity but this will allow us to inject that energy when it's most needed. So this is a very exciting technology, and it will be, I'm sure, copied. And if we end up with a 250 megawatts of our present at the Alto Maipo complex, that makes the economics much more attractive."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 financial review call. I am pleased to report that based on our year-to-date results and our expected growth in the second half of the year, we are on track to ach",1591,"Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 financial review call. I am pleased to report that based on our year-to-date results and our expected growth in the second half of the year, we are on track to achieve our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with the midpoint of $1.34, and our parent free cash flow target with the midpoint of $725 million. We are also confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022.
Turning to Slide 4. Since our last call, we have continued to make great progress on our 3-key strategic objectives. These are: first, becoming investment-grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio; second, positioning the company for sustained growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects; and third, improving our competitiveness by deploying innovative technologies.
Now allow me to provide some color on each one starting with our first objective of becoming investment-grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio on Slide 5. We have already achieved a key investment-grade metric, and we are on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. Our improved credit metrics reflect the growth of our free cash flow, paying down 43% of our recourse debt and an almost 70% decrease in our exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrology over the past 8 years.
A good example of this last point is bringing LNG to Panama with the commissioning of the AES Colón terminal, a combined cycle power plant. This new facility has our reduced our exposure to pour hydrology in Panama by 70%, by providing far less expensive energy to supply our hydro PPAs in times of drought. Such has occurred in 2014 and is occurring again this year. It is not only good for AES, but it is expected to say Panama, more than $400 million a year in imported fuel expenses.
We are further enhancing the resilience of our portfolio by decreasing our carbon intensity. This year alone, we have announced the sale of 2.4 gigawatts of thermal generation in Northern Ireland, Jordan and Oklahoma.
As you can see on Slide 6 as a result of our actions, we expect to reduce our carbon intensity by 50% from 2016 levels by 2022. By that date, we also expect that coal will represent less than 30% of our total generation by megawatt hour.
Now to our second objectives, positioning the company for sustainable growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects beginning on Slide 7. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts of mostly renewable projects. This number encompasses projects under construction or with signed PPAs, all of which are expected to be online by 2023. We are now on track to become one of the 5 largest renewable developers in the world outside of China.
As we discussed on our last call, we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of renewables per year, split roughly 50-50 between wind and solar and likewise, between the U.S. and international. 
So far this year, we have signed 1 gigawatt of renewable PPAs, including about 500 megawatts since our last call. This new capacity includes 181 megawatts of renewable energy signed in Chile as part of our Green Blend and Extend strategy. Through this win-win approach, we preserve the value of our existing contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewables. In exchange, our customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation. We expect to see meaningful progress on the Green Blend and Extend opportunity in the coming months.
Now to our projects under construction beginning on Slide 8. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, 43% are renewables. This percentage will continue to grow as we complete the large conventional thermal plants we started a number of years ago, while adding new wind, solar and energy storage. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we have been able to transition projects from development to construction.
Now on to Slide 9. We are reaching key milestones on our conventional projects under construction. We have completed the construction of our OPGC 2 plant in India with 1 unit already online and the second unit in the final commissioning phase.
Our Southland repowering project in California continues to progress well and is now approximately 95% complete. We recently achieved first fire and the project is on track to come online in the first quarter of next year, ahead of our original schedule.
I'm also pleased to announce that just yesterday, the storage tank at our AES Colón LNG regasification facility in Panama came online, replacing the temporary floating storage unit we have been using.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned, and is now approximately 80% complete. As you may remember, tunneling is the most difficult aspect of construction, and we now have completed 36 miles with only 5 miles to go until initial COD. Additionally, we broke ground on a 10-megawatt energy storage project that will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world. This innovative project is for our Alfalfal hydro plant, which is part of the Alto Maipo complex. It will store 5 hours of energy during periods of low demand and inject that energy into the great 3 hours of peak demand, providing the run-of-the-river plant with many of the same capabilities as the reservoir. We have the potential to increase the virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts of 5-hour energy storage at the Alto Maipo complex.
Turning to Slide 11. Another component of our contracted growth strategy is investing in LNG, which we see as complementary to our renewables business. Not only does LNG displays heavy fuel oil and diesel with less volatile, cheaper and cleaner natural gas, but the investments are based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk.
I have previously mentioned that once our LNG import terminals and regasification facilities are built, they can be scaled up at a relatively low cost as much of the key infrastructure is already in place. We are working on expanding our LNG storage capacity in the Dominican Republic by 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or are in advanced negotiations for 30 tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES and is expected to be completed by 2022. Once fully contracted, this expansion will provide $0.02 of incremental EPS. This is up above the $0.03 of potential upside at our existing LNG facilities in the region we had already discussed.
In Vietnam, we're making excellent progress toward the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage and 2 gigawatts of combined cycle power plants. We expect to achieve this critical milestone this year. And once completed, this project will be an important contributor to our earnings growth beyond 2022.
Now to our third strategic objective of deploying new technologies to maintain our market-leading positions beginning on Slide 12. We are complementing and enhancing our current businesses by incorporating digital capabilities and by growing in adjacent areas. As we discussed on our last call, by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base, this is a primary driver of our $100 million annual cost savings initiative. We are on track to fully achieve these savings by 2022.
One example of our investment in new technologies is our energy storage business. We are now the undisputed global leader in the sector, as both an owner of projects and through Fluence, the energy storage provider that we jointly owned Siemens. Fluence has now surpassed 1 gigawatt of projects either awarded or delivered, including more than 400 megawatts of projects awarded in the first half of 2019 alone. With the current backlog of nearly $700 million and a growing pipeline of activity, Fluence is cash-positive, self-funding and has the potential to a rapidly increase in value as demand for energy storage accelerates.
Now to Slide 13. Another example is our investment in Simple Energy, a company that provides utility customers a marketplace for energy efficiency products. There is great demand for digital solutions that enable energy users to be more efficient and Simple Energy has grown even faster than we anticipated. Since our last call, Simple Energy has merged with other companies to form a company called Uplight. Uplight is now the market leader in providing cloud-based energy solutions in the United States, serving 85 electric and gas utilities with more than 100 million customers. Through this transaction, the implied value of our equity in Simple Energy nearly doubled in a little over a year since our initial investment.
In digital business such as Uplight, it's capital-light, largely self-funding and we expect Uplight's annual revenue to grow significantly from its current base of over $100 million.
Finally, turning to Slide 14. AES' success as a technology leader was recently recognized when we were awarded our industry's top honor, EEI's Edison award. We were honored for our innovation in advancing round-the-clock renewables at our Lawa’i solar + storage project, which is already operational in Hawaii. We see renewables plus storage as an increasingly important part of our sector, and AES is well positioned to gain significant market share in this space.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I'll cover our financial results, outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.As",1049,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our financial results, outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.
As shown on Slide 16, in the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.26, primarily reflecting higher contributions from the U.S. in the lower tax rate. This was partially offset by the impact of asset sales as well as planned outages in Panama and Northern Ireland. In the second half, we expect to post stronger results as a benefit from the plant in Panama returning to operations, our continued cost-saving initiatives and 2 gigawatts of new projects reaching COD.
Turning to Slide 17, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $240 million for the quarter, a decrease of $15 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 18. 
In the U.S. & Utilities SBU increased PTC reflects the resolution of regulated rate cases last year, contributions from new renewable projects and higher energy sales at Southland. These impacts were partially offset by the access of coal-fired generation at DPL and Shady Point.
Regarding DPL's DMR extension filing, there is not much to report but we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020 and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL recently filed a plan to transform its electric grid while continue to meet the energy needs of its customers with inclusive service reliability, efficiency and safety. The plan calls for $1.2 billion of T&D investment over 7 years with a TRECA mechanism recovering 80% of discussed between rate case. 
AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan would be a key component of the mid-single-digit rate base growth we have discussed in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020.
At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and energy price in Colombia as well as lower volumes in Chile. Lower PTC at our Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean or MCC SBU reflects an extended planned outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama.
Finally, Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect planned outages at Kilroot and the shutdown of 300 megawatts of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In mid-June, we closed the sale of these businesses for total proceeds of $120 million.
In Bulgaria, there has been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be dispatched reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid and we are being paid on time.
Lastly, we recently took advantage of strong market demand for infrastructure project in Vietnam to refinance $1.1 billion of project back at Mong Duong. The issuance was 4x oversubscribed and enabled us to lower our interest rate, while improving financial flexibility. This is just another example of our continued liability management effort across our portfolio, capitalizing on a low-interest rate environment.
Now to Slide 22. To summarize, our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.53 versus $0.52 last year. Relative to 2018, we expect the strong growth in the second half of 2019, primarily driven by contributions for new businesses, continued cost-savings initiatives and the timing of our major outages, particularly in Panama and the Dominican Republic.
As you may have seen in our press release, we are reaffirming the $1.34 midpoint of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. We are also narrowing the range by $0.04 to $1.28 -- $1.28 to $1.40, $1.30 to $1.38, given our confidence in the outlook for the second half of the year. I would also highlight that we are reaffirming our 2019 parent free cash flow target of $700 million to $750 million.
Turning to 2019. Parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left-hand side, source reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also consider $369 million in asset sale proceeds, which include Northern Ireland, and its sPower sell down, both of which have closed, as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year-end.
Now to use on the right-hand side. Included a 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect to allocate another $150 million to parent debt paydown, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics, and we plan to invest $415 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 24. We expect our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sales proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
In addition to this, we are making very good progress on the third-party capital initiative we have discussed previously and expect the formal announcement later this year. As we have said before, the goal is to provide a more systematic and cost-effective source of capital that will be incremental to the $4 billion I just mentioned.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We plan to use $300 million for debt reduction, half of which we expect to complete in 2019. The other half will be used to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales.
We are also expecting to use $1.5 billion for our equity investment in our backlog and projected PPAs. And an additional $200 million to fund T&D investments at IPL was completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $470 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

And so what's been challenged in the court is not the legality of the DMR. So we have a very specific and narrow claim there. The discussion is around if the DMR should be included or not in the SEET test. So from our perspective, and there are presidents in Ohio in which charge similar to the DMRs should not be included in the SEET test, so we feel good about that. In any case, we don't think this is a binary outcome, right? So we'd have to run this through the SEET test at the end just to see the final impact. And our view is that decision will probably become towards year-end. But again, it's not a challenging regarding the legality of the DMR, it's just a very important clarification. 
Next question is a separate discussion, right? So we've got the initial 3 years under the assumption that would be very specific in terms of the uses of the proceeds. So we've done, we've used 100% of the proceeds for debt paydown. We've got the complex back to investment-grade. And from our perspective, it is necessary to secure the extension for the complex to maintain the investment-grade and position the [ IPL ] with modernization. You may recall, we filed last year an investment on smart grid. And for us, continue with those investments. It's fundamental that we secure the extension. So we feel we have a very good case but then we'll have to run its due process."

Look, whatever occurs, we'll continue to be very important for Puerto Rico. We have the most reliable and by far, the cheapest energy on the island. To replace our coal plant in Puerto Rico by burning heavy fuel oil, which is what the other plants mainly burn besides some gas, would cost about an additional $300 million to $400 million a year in important fuel bills. So Puerto would have to pay an additional $300 million to $400 million per year, which will be passed on to consumers. I think what's also very important is of the large plants, there are only 2, which are EPA compliant, most of the plants in Puerto Rico, because they're burning heavy fuel oil have excess emissions of sacs, so they're not EPA compliant. And for that reason, the air in San Juan and Ponce, 2 main cities is not compliant. So while there's been noise about our coal ash on the island, really, this plant is very necessary.

Let's take this multi-faceted question part by part. I think regarding Vietnam, as you know, when President Trump visited Vietnam, there was a letter of intent signed for these projects, and it was, I'd say, one of the marquee projects that the 2 countries had agreed to. So energy demand in Vietnam is growing around 10%. Quite frankly, Vietnam is one of the beneficiaries of some of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. So expect demand to go even faster. Vietnam does not have a sufficient domestic LNG, doesn't even have sufficient coal facility. Vietnam is moving towards LNG and renewables as well. So this is a very necessary project, it's going to start supplying not only the new combined cycle gas plants, which are part of this initiative but existing ones, which are running out of offshore gas as well. So again, I think it's very necessary, it's also a project that's very important for both countries, for the U.S. and for Vietnam. So the next things is expect a further progress in terms of announcements between the 2 countries and us that this is going to be moving forward with what Vietnamese partners are involved. Vietnam is a country of consensus, as I said. So it takes time, but they move and they move in a very steady but very certain fashion. So that's what I would say sort of stay tuned. And it will, of course, we have to -- we are part of the Vietnamese government's master electricity plan, and that will also involve how much LNG is imported and the phasing in of the combined cycle plants. 
On the second, I will pass this to Gustavo. What I would say is that a big part of the $1.2 billion at IPL is actually, it's smart grid infrastructure. So I'll pass it to Gustavo."

We're selling, for example, in the Philippines where you have many isolated positions. You have different applications such as community solar. You have, quite frankly, SunFlex, which is slightly different project -- product than our advancing product. So the margins will differ depending on the market, depending on the exact product. But basically, we see the cost curve coming down. Because as we come up with our next-generation of product here, it's going to be more productized, it's going to be more prefab and it's going to be less customized as we've learned more about what is optimal for our customers in different situations. So more customization will be on the software and less will be on the hardware. So I would say expect margins to continue to improve, not actually go down even though we're seeing some, in some cases, people are bidding very low prices for integration of energy storage. Basically, to say that they have enough product up and operating. Many of those cases, we don't compete because we would do -- require margin from our projects."

So basically, it changes -- its difference from pumped storage, well pump storage need a reservoir. You've got to put that water somewhere, and you have to build pipelines, and you have to use electricity get it up there. So there's friction, just the physics of storing electrons is superior to that of storing molecules so the virtual dam is basically the idea to combine a one of the river facility such as the whole Alto Maipo complex, it's about 750 megawatts. And then you have a associated energy storage. Now if you have a 5-hour storage, what I would remind people, that means it's 5 hours at 100% discharge. If you discharge it at 50%, you actually have energy storage capabilities for 10 hours. So what this will allow is run-of-the-river is constant, and what we will be doing is injecting energy into the grid when the prices are best. That's basically it, and really providing capacity. I mean, the one big issue with renewables is that they don't really provide you round-the-clock capacity. So this will provide us -- our run-of-the-river does have actually round-the-clock capacity but this will allow us to inject that energy when it's most needed. So this is a very exciting technology, and it will be, I'm sure, copied. And if we end up with a 250 megawatts 5-hour facility at the Alto Maipo complex, that makes the economics much more attractive."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 financial review call. I am pleased to report that based on our year-to-date results and our expected growth in the second half of the year, we are on track to ach",1593,"Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 financial review call. I am pleased to report that based on our year-to-date results and our expected growth in the second half of the year, we are on track to achieve our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with the midpoint of $1.34, and our parent free cash flow target with the midpoint of $725 million. We are also confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022.
Turning to Slide 4. Since our last call, we have continued to make great progress on our 3-key strategic objectives. These are: first, becoming investment-grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio; second, positioning the company for sustained growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects; and third, improving our competitiveness by deploying innovative technologies.
Now allow me to provide some color on each one starting with our first objective of becoming investment-grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio on Slide 5. We have already achieved a key investment-grade metric, and we are on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. Our improved credit metrics reflect the growth of our free cash flow, paying down 43% of our recourse debt and an almost 70% decrease in our exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrology over the past 8 years.
A good example of this last point is bringing LNG to Panama with the commissioning of the AES Colón terminal, a combined cycle power plant. This new facility has reduced our exposure to pour hydrology in Panama by 70%, by providing far less expensive energy to supply our hydro PPAs in times of drought. Such has occurred in 2014 and is occurring again this year. It is not only good for AES, but it is expected to save Panama more than $400 million a year in imported fuel expenses.
We are further enhancing the resilience of our portfolio by decreasing our carbon intensity. This year alone, we have announced the sale of 2.4 gigawatts of thermal generation in Northern Ireland, Jordan and Oklahoma.
As you can see on Slide 6 as a result of our actions, we expect to reduce our carbon intensity by 50% from 2016 levels by 2022. By that date, we also expect that coal will represent less than 30% of our total generation by megawatt hour.
Now to our second objectives, positioning the company for sustainable growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects beginning on Slide 7. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts of mostly renewable projects. This number encompasses projects under construction or with signed PPAs, all of which are expected to be online by 2023. We are now on track to become one of the 5 largest renewable developers in the world outside of China.
As we discussed on our last call, we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of renewables per year, split roughly 50-50 between wind and solar and likewise, between the U.S. and international. 
So far this year, we have signed 1 gigawatt of renewable PPAs, including about 500 megawatts since our last call. This new capacity includes 181 megawatts of renewable energy signed in Chile as part of our Green Blend and Extend strategy. Through this win-win approach, we preserve the value of our existing contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewables. In exchange, our customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation. We expect to see meaningful progress on the Green Blend and Extend opportunity in the coming months.
Now to our projects under construction beginning on Slide 8. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, 43% are renewables. This percentage will continue to grow as we complete the large conventional thermal plants we started a number of years ago, while adding new wind, solar and energy storage. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we have been able to transition projects from development to construction.
Now on to Slide 9. We are reaching key milestones on our conventional projects under construction. We have completed the construction of our OPGC 2 plant in India with 1 unit already online and the second unit in the final commissioning phase.
Our Southland repowering project in California continues to progress well and is now approximately 95% complete. We recently achieved first fire and the project is on track to come online in the first quarter of next year, ahead of our original schedule.
I'm also pleased to announce that just yesterday, the storage tank at our AES Colón LNG regasification facility in Panama came online, replacing the temporary floating storage unit we have been using.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned, and is now approximately 80% complete. As you may remember, tunneling is the most difficult aspect of construction, and we now have completed 36 miles with only 5 miles to go until initial COD. Additionally, we broke ground on a 10-megawatt energy storage project that will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world. This innovative project is for our Alfalfal hydro plant, which is part of the Alto Maipo complex. It will store 5 hours of energy during periods of low demand and inject that energy into the grid during hours of peak demand, providing the run-of-the-river plant with many of the same capabilities as the reservoir. We have the potential to increase the virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts of 5-hour energy storage at the Alto Maipo complex.
Turning to Slide 11. Another component of our contracted growth strategy is investing in LNG, which we see as complementary to our renewables business. Not only does LNG displace heavy fuel oil and diesel with less volatile, cheaper and cleaner natural gas, but the investments are based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk.
I have previously mentioned that once our LNG import terminals and regasification facilities are built, they can be scaled up at a relatively low cost as much of the key infrastructure is already in place. We are working on expanding our LNG storage capacity in the Dominican Republic by 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or are in advanced negotiations for 30 tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES and is expected to be completed by 2022. Once fully contracted, this expansion will provide $0.02 of incremental EPS. This is up and above the $0.03 of potential upside at our existing LNG facilities in the region we had already discussed.
In Vietnam, we're making excellent progress toward the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage and 2 gigawatts of combined cycle power plants. We expect to achieve this critical milestone this year. And once completed, this project will be an important contributor to our earnings growth beyond 2022.
Now to our third strategic objective of deploying new technologies to maintain our market-leading positions beginning on Slide 12. We are complementing and enhancing our current businesses by incorporating digital capabilities and by growing in adjacent areas. As we discussed on our last call, by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base, this is a primary driver of our $100 million annual cost savings initiative. We are on track to fully achieve these savings by 2022.
One example of our investment in new technologies is our energy storage business. We are now the undisputed global leader in the sector, as both an owner of projects and through Fluence, the energy storage provider that we jointly own with Siemens. Fluence has now surpassed 1 gigawatt of projects either awarded or delivered, including more than 400 megawatts of projects awarded in the first half of 2019 alone. With the current backlog of nearly $700 million and a growing pipeline of activity, Fluence is cash-positive, self-funding and has the potential to a rapidly increase in value as demand for energy storage accelerates.
Now to Slide 13. Another example is our investment in Simple Energy, a company that provides utility customers a marketplace for energy efficiency products. There is great demand for digital solutions that enable energy users to be more efficient and Simple Energy has grown even faster than we anticipated. Since our last call, Simple Energy has merged with other companies to form a new company called Uplight. Uplight is now the market leader in providing cloud-based energy solutions in the United States, serving 85 electric and gas utilities with more than 100 million customers. Through this transaction, the implied value of our equity in Simple Energy nearly doubled in a little over a year since our initial investment.
In digital business such as Uplight, it's capital-light, largely self-funding and we expect Uplight's annual revenue to grow significantly from its current base of over $100 million.
Finally, turning to Slide 14. AES' success as a technology leader was recently recognized when we were awarded our industry's top honor, EEI's Edison award. We were honored for our innovation in advancing round-the-clock renewables at our Lawa’i solar + storage project, which is already operational in Hawaii. We see renewables plus storage as an increasingly important part of our sector, and AES is well positioned to gain significant market share in this space.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I'll cover our financial results, outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.
As shown on Slide 16, in the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.26, primarily reflecting higher contributions from the U.S. and the lower tax rate. This was partially offset by the impact of asset sales as well as planned outages in Panama and Northern Ireland. In the second half, we expect to post stronger results as a benefit from the plant in Panama returning to operations, our continued cost-saving initiatives and 2 gigawatts of new projects reaching COD.
Turning to Slide 17, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $240 million for the quarter, a decrease of $15 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 18. 
In the U.S. & Utilities SBU increased PTC reflects the resolution of regulated rate cases last year, contributions from new renewable projects and higher energy sales at Southland. These impacts were partially offset by the access of coal-fired generation at DPL and Shady Point.
Regarding DPL's DMR extension filing, there is not much to report but we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020 and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL recently filed a plan to transform its electric grid while continue to meet the energy needs of its customers with improved service reliability, efficiency and safety. The plan calls for $1.2 billion of T&D investment over 7 years with a TRECA mechanism recovering 80% of these costs between rate case. 
AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan would be a key component of the mid-single-digit rate base growth we have discussed in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020.
At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and energy price in Colombia as well as lower volumes in Chile. Lower PTC at our Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean or MCC SBU reflects an extended planned outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama.
Finally, Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect planned outages at Kilroot and the shutdown of 300 megawatts of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In mid-June, we closed the sale of these businesses for total proceeds of $120 million.
In Bulgaria, there has been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be dispatched reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid and we are being paid on time.
Lastly, we recently took advantage of strong market demand for infrastructure project in Vietnam to refinance $1.1 billion of project back at Mong Duong. The issuance was 4x oversubscribed and enabled us to lower our interest rate, while improving financial flexibility. This is just another example of our continued liability management effort across our portfolio, capitalizing on a low-interest rate environment.
Now to Slide 22. To summarize, our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.53 versus $0.52 last year. Relative to 2018, we expect the strong growth in the second half of 2019, primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, continued cost-savings initiatives and the timing of our major outages, particularly in Panama and the Dominican Republic.
As you may have seen in our press release, we are reaffirming the $1.34 midpoint of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. We are also narrowing the range by $0.04 to $1.28 -- $1.28 to $1.40, $1.30 to $1.38, given our confidence in the outlook for the second half of the year. I would also highlight that we are reaffirming our 2019 parent free cash flow target of $700 million to $750 million.
Turning to 2019. Parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left-hand side, source reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also consider $369 million in asset sale proceeds, which include Northern Ireland, and its sPower sell down, both of which have closed, as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year-end.
Now to use on the right-hand side. Included a 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect to allocate another $150 million to parent debt paydown, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics, and we plan to invest $415 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 24. We expect our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sales proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
In addition to this, we are making very good progress on the third-party capital initiative we have discussed previously and expect the formal announcement later this year. As we have said before, the goal is to provide a more systematic and cost-effective source of capital that will be incremental to the $4 billion I just mentioned.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We plan to use $300 million for debt reduction, half of which we expect to complete in 2019. The other half will be used to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales.
We are also expecting to use $1.5 billion for our equity investment in our backlog and projected PPAs. And an additional $200 million to fund T&D investments at IPL was completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.

Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. In the first half of the year, we made very good progress on our strategic objectives and expect to accomplish significant milestones in the remainder of the year. We are enhancing the resilience of our portfolio, and we are on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. We are increasing our backlog of long-term contracted projects to sustain profitable growth, including advancing renewables and LNG infrastructure. And we are deploying innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading positions. Accordingly, we are confident in our ability to achieve our 2019 guidance. We are also confident that we will deliver 7% to 9% growth in cash flow and adjusted earnings per share through 2022. Therefore, we believe AES offers a compelling investment thesis, yielding double-digit total returns that will serve our investors well for years to come."

And so what's been challenged in the court is not the legality of the DMR. So we have a very specific and narrow claim there. The discussion is around if the DMR should be included or not in the SEET test. So from our perspective, and there are precedents in Ohio in which charts similar to the DMRs should not be included in the SEET test, so we feel good about that. In any case, we don't think this is a binary outcome, right? So we'd have to run this through the SEET test at the end just to see the final impact. And our view is that decision will probably become towards year-end. But again, it's not a challenging regarding the legality of the DMR, it's just a very important clarification. 
Next question is a separate discussion, right? So we've got the initial 3 years under the assumption that would be very specific in terms of the uses of the proceeds. So we've done, we've used 100% of the proceeds for debt paydown. We've got the complex back to investment-grade. And from our perspective, it is necessary to secure the extension for the complex to maintain the investment-grade and position the [IPL] for grid modernization. You may recall, we filed last year an investment on smart grid. And for us, continue with those investments. It's fundamental that we secure the extension.

Look, whatever occurs, we'll continue to be very important for Puerto Rico. We have the most reliable and by far, the cheapest energy on the island. To replace our coal plant in Puerto Rico by burning heavy fuel oil, which is what the other plants mainly burn besides some gas, would cost about an additional $300 million to $400 million a year in imported fuel bills. So PREPA would have to pay an additional $300 million to $400 million per year, which will be passed on to consumers. I think what's also very important is of the large plants, there are only 2 which are EPA compliant, most of the plants in Puerto Rico, because they're burning heavy fuel oil have excess emissions of SOX, so they're not EPA compliant. And for that reason, the air in San Juan and Ponce, 2 main cities is not compliant. So while there's been noise about our coal ash on the island, really, this plant is very necessary. We're working with PREPA to see about Green Blend and Extend as a way of reducing total emissions on the island, and we'll continue to work with them. So stay tuned and this plant is important, it is producing the most reliable and the cheapest energy on the island."

Let's take this multi-faceted question part by part. I think regarding Vietnam, as you know, when President Trump visited Vietnam, there was a letter of intent signed for these projects, and it was, I'd say, one of the marquee projects that the 2 countries had agreed to. So energy demand in Vietnam is growing around 10%. Quite frankly, Vietnam is one of the beneficiaries of some of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. So expect demand to go even faster. Vietnam does not have a sufficient domestic LNG, doesn't even have sufficient coal. Vietnam is moving towards LNG and renewables as well. So this is a very necessary project, it's going to start supplying not only the new combined cycle gas plants, which are part of this initiative but existing ones, which are running out of offshore gas as well. So again, I think it's very necessary, it's also a project that's very important for both countries, for the U.S. and for Vietnam. So the next things is expect a further progress in terms of announcements between the 2 countries and us that this is going to be moving forward with what Vietnamese partners are involved. Vietnam is a country of consensus, as I said. So it takes time, but they move and they move in a very steady but very certain fashion. So that's what I would say sort of stay tuned.

Basically, to say that they have enough product up and operating. Many of those cases, we don't compete because we would do -- require margin from our projects."

So basically, it changes -- its difference from pumped storage, well pump storage need a reservoir.

So basically, it changes -- its difference from pumped storage, well pump storage need a reservoir. You've got to put that water somewhere, and you have to build pipelines, and you have to use electricity get it up there. So there's friction, just the physics of storing electrons is superior to that of storing molecules so the virtual dam is basically the idea to combine a run of the river facility such as the whole Alto Maipo complex, it's about 750 megawatts. And then you have an associated energy storage. Now if you have a 5-hour storage, what I would remind people, that means it's 5 hours at 100% discharge. If you discharge it at 50%, you actually have energy storage capabilities for 10 hours. So what this will allow is run-of-the-river is constant, and what we will be doing is injecting energy into the grid when the prices are best. That's basically it, and really providing capacity. I mean, the one big issue with renewables is that they don't really provide you round-the-clock capacity. So this will provide us -- our run-of-the-river does have actually round-the-clock capacity but this will allow us to inject that energy when it's most needed. So this is a very exciting technology, and it will be, I'm sure, copied. And if we end up with a 250 megawatts 5-hour facility at the Alto Maipo complex, that makes the economics much more attractive."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 financial review call. I am pleased to report that based on our year-to-date results and our expected growth in the second half of the year, we are on track to ach",1593,"Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 financial review call. I am pleased to report that based on our year-to-date results and our expected growth in the second half of the year, we are on track to achieve our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with the midpoint of $1.34, and our parent free cash flow target with the midpoint of $725 million. We are also confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022.
Turning to Slide 4. Since our last call, we have continued to make great progress on our 3-key strategic objectives. These are: first, becoming investment-grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio; second, positioning the company for sustained growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects; and third, improving our competitiveness by deploying innovative technologies.
Now allow me to provide some color on each one starting with our first objective of becoming investment-grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio on Slide 5. We have already achieved a key investment-grade metric, and we are on track to attain investment-grade ratings in 2020. Our improved credit metrics reflect the growth of our free cash flow, paying down 43% of our recourse debt and an almost 70% decrease in our exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrology over the past 8 years.
A good example of this last point is bringing LNG to Panama with the commissioning of the AES Colón terminal, a combined cycle power plant. This new facility has reduced our exposure to pour hydrology in Panama by 70%, by providing far less expensive energy to supply our hydro PPAs in times of drought. Such has occurred in 2014 and is occurring again this year. It is not only good for AES, but it is expected to save Panama more than $400 million a year in imported fuel expenses. We are further enhancing the resilience of our portfolio by decreasing our carbon intensity. This year alone, we have announced the sale of 2.4 gigawatts of thermal generation in Northern Ireland, Jordan and Oklahoma.
As you can see on Slide 6 as a result of our actions, we expect to reduce our carbon intensity by 50% from 2016 levels by 2022. By that date, we also expect that coal will represent less than 30% of our total generation by megawatt hour.
Now to our second objectives, positioning the company for sustainable growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects beginning on Slide 7. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts of mostly renewable projects. This number encompasses projects under construction or with signed PPAs, all of which are expected to be online by 2023. We are now on track to become one of the 5 largest renewable developers in the world outside of China. As we discussed on our last call, we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of renewables per year, split roughly 50-50 between wind and solar and likewise, between the U.S. and international. 
So far this year, we have signed 1 gigawatt of renewable PPAs, including about 500 megawatts since our last call. This new capacity includes 181 megawatts of renewable energy signed in Chile as part of our Green Blend and Extend strategy. Through this win-win approach, we preserve the value of our existing contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewables. In exchange, our customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation. We expect to see meaningful progress on the Green Blend and Extend opportunity in the coming months.
Now to our projects under construction beginning on Slide 8. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, 43% are renewables. This percentage will continue to grow as we complete the large conventional thermal plants we started a number of years ago, while adding new wind, solar and energy storage. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we have been able to transition projects from development to construction.
Now on to Slide 9. We are reaching key milestones on our conventional projects under construction. We have completed the construction of our OPGC 2 plant in India with 1 unit already online and the second unit in the final commissioning phase. Our Southland repowering project in California continues to progress well and is now approximately 95% complete. We recently achieved first fire and the project is on track to come online in the first quarter of next year, ahead of our original schedule. I'm also pleased to announce that just yesterday, the storage tank at our AES Colón LNG regasification facility in Panama came online, replacing the temporary floating storage unit we have been using.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned, and is now approximately 80% complete. As you may remember, tunneling is the most difficult aspect of construction, and we now have completed 36 miles with only 5 miles to go until initial COD. Additionally, we broke ground on a 10-megawatt energy storage project that will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world. This innovative project is for our Alfalfal hydro plant, which is part of the Alto Maipo complex. It will store 5 hours of energy during periods of low demand and inject that energy into the grid during hours of peak demand, providing the run-of-the-river plant with many of the same capabilities as the reservoir. We have the potential to increase the virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts of 5-hour energy storage at the Alto Maipo complex.
Turning to Slide 11. Another component of our contracted growth strategy is investing in LNG, which we see as complementary to our renewables business. Not only does LNG displace heavy fuel oil and diesel with less volatile, cheaper and cleaner natural gas, but the investments are based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk.
I have previously mentioned that once our LNG import terminals and regasification facilities are built, they can be scaled up at a relatively low cost as much of the key infrastructure is already in place. We are working on expanding our LNG storage capacity in the Dominican Republic by 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or are in advanced negotiations for 30 tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES and is expected to be completed by 2022. Once fully contracted, this expansion will provide $0.02 of incremental EPS. This is up and above the $0.03 of potential upside at our existing LNG facilities in the region we had already discussed.
In Vietnam, we're making excellent progress toward the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage and 2 gigawatts of combined cycle power plants. We expect to achieve this critical milestone this year. And once completed, this project will be an important contributor to our earnings growth beyond 2022.
Now to our third strategic objective of deploying new technologies to maintain our market-leading positions beginning on Slide 12. We are complementing and enhancing our current businesses by incorporating digital capabilities and by growing in adjacent areas. As we discussed on our last call, by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base, this is a primary driver of our $100 million annual cost savings initiative. We are on track to fully achieve these savings by 2022.
One example of our investment in new technologies is our energy storage business. We are now the undisputed global leader in the sector, as both an owner of projects and through Fluence, the energy storage provider that we jointly own with Siemens. Fluence has now surpassed 1 gigawatt of projects either awarded or delivered, including more than 400 megawatts of projects awarded in the first half of 2019 alone. With the current backlog of nearly $700 million and a growing pipeline of activity, Fluence is cash-positive, self-funding and has the potential to a rapidly increase in value as demand for energy storage accelerates.
Now to Slide 13. Another example is our investment in Simple Energy, a company that provides utility customers a marketplace for energy efficiency products. There is great demand for digital solutions that enable energy users to be more efficient and Simple Energy has grown even faster than we anticipated. Since our last call, Simple Energy has merged with other companies to form a new company called Uplight. Uplight is now the market leader in providing cloud-based energy solutions in the United States, serving 85 electric and gas utilities with more than 100 million customers. Through this transaction, the implied value of our equity in Simple Energy nearly doubled in a little over a year since our initial investment. In digital business such as Uplight, it's capital-light, largely self-funding and we expect Uplight's annual revenue to grow significantly from its current base of over $100 million.
Finally, turning to Slide 14. AES' success as a technology leader was recently recognized when we were awarded our industry's top honor, EEI's Edison award. We were honored for our innovation in advancing round-the-clock renewables at our Lawa’i solar + storage project, which is already operational in Hawaii. We see renewables plus storage as an increasingly important part of our sector, and AES is well positioned to gain significant market share in this space.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.As",1050,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our financial results, outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.
As shown on Slide 16, in the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.26, primarily reflecting higher contributions from the U.S. and the lower tax rate. This was partially offset by the impact of asset sales as well as planned outages in Panama and Northern Ireland. In the second half, we expect to post stronger results as a benefit from the plant in Panama returning to operations, our continued cost-saving initiatives and 2 gigawatts of new projects reaching COD.
Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $240 million for the quarter, a decrease of $15 million. 
I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S. & Utilities SBU increased PTC reflects the resolution of regulated rate cases last year, contributions from new renewable projects and higher energy sales at Southland. These impacts were partially offset by the access of coal-fired generation at DPL and Shady Point.
Regarding DPL's DMR extension filing, there is not much to report but we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020 and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL recently filed a plan to transform its electric grid while continue to meet the energy needs of its customers with improved service reliability, efficiency and safety. The plan calls for $1.2 billion of T&D investment over 7 years with a TRECA mechanism recovering 80% of these costs between rate case. 
AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan would be a key component of the mid-single-digit rate base growth we have discussed in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020.
At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and energy price in Colombia as well as lower volumes in Chile. Lower PTC at our Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean or MCC SBU reflects an extended planned outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama. Finally, Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect planned outages at Kilroot and the shutdown of 300 megawatts of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In mid-June, we closed the sale of these businesses for total proceeds of $120 million.
In Bulgaria, there has been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be dispatched reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid and we are being paid on time. Lastly, we recently took advantage of strong market demand for infrastructure project in Vietnam to refinance $1.1 billion of project back at Mong Duong. The issuance was 4x oversubscribed and enabled us to lower our interest rate, while improving financial flexibility. This is just another example of our continued liability management effort across our portfolio, capitalizing on a low-interest rate environment.
Now to Slide 22. To summarize, our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.53 versus $0.52 last year. Relative to 2018, we expect the strong growth in the second half of 2019, primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, continued cost-savings initiatives and the timing of our major outages, particularly in Panama and the Dominican Republic.
As you may have seen in our press release, we are reaffirming the $1.34 midpoint of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. We are also narrowing the range by $0.04 to $1.28 -- $1.28 to $1.40, $1.30 to $1.38, given our confidence in the outlook for the second half of the year. I would also highlight that we are reaffirming our 2019 parent free cash flow target of $700 million to $750 million.
Turning to 2019. Parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left-hand side, source reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also consider $369 million in asset sale proceeds, which include Northern Ireland, and its sPower sell down, both of which have closed as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year-end.
Now to use on the right-hand side. Included a 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect to allocate another $150 million to parent debt paydown, largely to strengthen our investment-grade metrics, and we plan to invest $415 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 24. We expect our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sales proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
In addition to this, we are making very good progress on the third-party capital initiative we have discussed previously and expect the formal announcement later this year. As we have said before, the goal is to provide a more systematic and cost-effective source of capital that will be incremental to the $4 billion I just mentioned.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We plan to use $300 million for debt reduction, half of which we expect to complete in 2019. The other half will be used to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales.
We are also expecting to use $1.5 billion for our equity investment in our backlog and projected PPAs. And an additional $200 million to fund T&D investments at IPL was completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $470 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

And so what's been challenged in the court is not the legality of the DMR. So we have a very specific and narrow claim there.

So from our perspective, and there are precedents in Ohio in which charts similar to the DMRs should not be included in the SEET test, so we feel good about that. In any case, we don't think this is a binary outcome, right? So we'd have to run this through the SEET test at the end just to see the final impact. And our view is that decision will probably become towards year-end. But again, it's not a challenging regarding the legality of the DMR, it's just a very important clarification. 
Next question is a separate discussion, right? So we've got the initial 3 years under the assumption that would be very specific in terms of the uses of the proceeds. So we've done, we've used 100% of the proceeds for debt paydown. We've got the complex back to investment-grade. And from our perspective, it is necessary to secure the extension for the complex to maintain the investment-grade and position the [ IPL ] for grid modernization. You may recall, we filed last year an investment on smart grid. And for us, continue with those investments. It's fundamental that we secure the extension. So we feel we have a good case but then we'll have to run its due process."

Look, whatever occurs, we'll continue to be very important for Puerto Rico. We have the most reliable and by far, the cheapest energy on the island. To replace our coal plant in Puerto Rico by burning heavy fuel oil, which is what the other plants mainly burn besides some gas, would cost about an additional $300 million to $400 million a year in imported fuel bills. So PREPA would have to pay an additional $300 million to $400 million per year, which will be passed on to consumers. 
I think what's also very important is of the large plants, there are only 2 which are EPA compliant, most of the plants in Puerto Rico, because they're burning heavy fuel oil have excess emissions of SOX, so they're not EPA compliant. And for that reason, the air in San Juan and Ponce, 2 main cities is not compliant. So while there's been noise about our coal ash on the island, really, this plant is very necessary. We're working with PREPA to see about Green Blend and Extend as a way of reducing total emissions on the island, and we'll continue to work with them. So stay tuned and this plant is important, it is producing the most reliable and the cheapest energy on the island."

Let's take this multi-faceted question part by part. I think regarding Vietnam, as you know, when President Trump visited Vietnam, there was a letter of intent signed for these projects, and it was, I'd say, one of the marquee projects that the 2 countries had agreed to. So energy demand in Vietnam is growing around 10%. Quite frankly, Vietnam is one of the beneficiaries of some of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. So expect demand to go even faster. Vietnam does not have a sufficient domestic LNG, doesn't even have sufficient coal. Vietnam is moving towards LNG and renewables as well. 
So this is a very necessary project, it's going to start supplying not only the new combined cycle gas plants, which are part of this initiative but existing ones, which are running out of offshore gas as well. So again, I think it's very necessary, it's also a project that's very important for both countries, for the U.S. and for Vietnam. So the next things is expect a further progress in terms of announcements between the 2 countries and us that this is going to be moving forward with what Vietnamese partners are involved. Vietnam is a country of consensus, as I said. So it takes time, but they move and they move in a very steady but very certain fashion. So that's what I would say sort of stay tuned. And it will, of course, we have to -- we are part of the Vietnamese government's master electricity plan, and that will also involve how much LNG is imported and the phasing in of the combined cycle plants.

But basically, we see the cost curve coming down. Because as we come up with our next-generation of product here, it's going to be more productized, it's going to be more prefab and it's going to be less customized as we've learned more about what is optimal for our customers in different situations. So more customization will be on the software and less will be on the hardware. So I would say expect margins to continue to improve, not actually go down even though we're seeing some, in some cases, people are bidding very low prices for integration of energy storage.

So basically, it changes -- its difference from pumped storage, well pump storage need a reservoir. You've got to put that water somewhere, and you have to build pipelines, and you have to use electricity get it up there. So there's friction, just the physics of storing electrons is superior to that of storing molecules so the virtual dam is basically the idea to combine a run of the river facility such as the whole Alto Maipo complex, it's about 750 megawatts. And then you have an associated energy storage. Now if you have a 5-hour storage, what I would remind people, that means it's 5 hours at 100% discharge. If you discharge it at 50%, you actually have energy storage capabilities for 10 hours. 
So what this will allow is run-of-the-river is constant, and what we will be doing is injecting energy into the grid when the prices are best. That's basically it, and really providing capacity. I mean the one big issue with renewables is that they don't really provide you round-the-clock capacity. So this will provide us -- our run-of-the-river does have actually round-the-clock capacity but this will allow us to inject that energy when it's most needed. So this is a very exciting technology, and it will be, I'm sure, copied. And if we end up with a 250 megawatts 5-hour facility at the Alto Maipo complex, that makes the economics much more attractive."

Today, I will walk through the highlights of the quarter and how we are delivering on our commitments and successfully executing on our strategy. Gustavo will",1247,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 financial review call. Today, I will walk through the highlights of the quarter and how we are delivering on our commitments and successfully executing on our strategy. Gustavo will then follow with a detailed description of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results.
Our adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.48, which is 37% higher than our results for the same quarter last year. On our prior call, we mentioned that much of our growth would be in the second half of the year, and our strong third quarter results are in line with our expectations. We're on track to deliver on our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with a midpoint of $1.34, and our parent free cash flow target with a midpoint of $725 million. And we are confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022.
I am pleased to report that we're making good progress on the strategy we laid out on our previous calls. Allow me to walk you through step by step. First, turning to Slide 4. Let us talk about our progress towards becoming investment grade. As you may have seen in this morning's press release, we received an investment-grade rating for the first time in AES' history. I'm very pleased to have achieved this milestone reflects a multiyear transformation strategy to make our business simpler and more predictable. We not only significantly strengthen our balance sheet, but we have also materially reduced our exposure to risks such as hydrology, foreign currencies and commodities.
Moving to Slide 5 and our growth in renewables. This quarter, we signed over 900 megawatts of new renewable power purchase agreements, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.9 gigawatts. We are fully confident that we will consistently deliver 2 to 3 gigawatts of new renewable capacity every year. As of today, our backlog of projects is 6 gigawatts, half of which are under construction and have signed PPAs. As anticipated, about half of these projects are in the U.S. and half are international. We see ourselves as uniquely positioned in the renewable space to take advantage of synergies and economies of scale, whilst also benefiting from sufficient geographical diversity.
Looking at this from another perspective on Slide 6. Approximately 80% of our 6-gigawatt backlog or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables. Split between hydro, solar, wind and energy storage. We expect the majority of our backlog to be online by the end of 2022.
Now on to specific large projects. On Slide 7, we can see that the 1.3 gigawatt Southland plant project is virtually complete, and we are currently in the final commissioning stage. We're on track to begin commercial operations in early 2020.
Turning to Slide 8. AES air is also making good progress on the Altamira Electric project. The project is 82% complete, including 37 miles of tunneling and both caverns for the powerhouses. Less than 4 miles of tunneling remain to finish Phase I by year-end 2020. At which time, the construction of all 531 megawatts of capacity will be completed. In parallel, they're progressing well on the tunneling of Phase 2, which will provide additional water to the project.
Let us now discuss the advances we are making on our LNG strategy and turn to Slide 9. Last month, we received approval from the government of Vietnam to develop and build a 2.2 gigawatt combined cycle gas turbine project alongside our previously-approved 480 tera BTU LNG regasification and storage terminal. This complex will have a 20-year U.S. dollar-denominated contract with no commodity exposure. We expect to see financial close in 2021 and commercial operations in 2024. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business is complementary to our renewables growth strategy by offering a clean, predictable and low-cost fuel that provides capacity and flexibility to the system. We are focusing our LNG business on 3 markets, the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural gas to supply new generation and to displace higher cost diesel fuel oil.
A good example of how we're benefiting from this growing demand is the Dominican Republic. As shown on Slide 10, this quarter, we finalized a joint venture with other local generators. As a result of this JV, we will build a second LNG storage tank, expanding our capacity into Dominican Republic by 80% or an additional 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or in advanced negotiations for 3 tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES, and we expect to break ground in the first quarter of 2020, with completion in late 2022.
As we had previously mentioned, our LNG business is easily scalable, which allows us to increase our margin while requiring relatively little investment from AES. While we are delivering on our commitments in our guidance period, we're also making investments to maintain our leadership in new technologies, which will contribute to our earnings growth in future years. We are currently the global market leader in energy storage and the market leader for cloud-based energy efficiency solutions in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 11. Today, we're announcing a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business line. We will be working together to find new solutions to accelerate the broad adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. AES will collaborate with Google Cloud on energy management and opportunities to develop, own and operate projects in targeted markets in the U.S. and Latin America that has the potential to help people meet its clean energy objectives.
In addition to providing the potential for additional revenues for AES, this alliance will put both of us on the front line of innovation in the industry, allowing us to further reduce costs, optimize operations and meet changing customer expectations.
On Slide 12, we can see that our strategic investment in the leading U.S. cloud-based digital solutions provider in our sector is progressing well. This is a business that is growing rapidly from a piece of $100 million in annual revenue. It is cash and margin positive and will provide broad insights into customer behavior and energy efficiency.
Our energy storage business, Fluence, continues to be the global market leader. Through Fluence, our 50-50 joint venture with Siemens, we are able to capture the accelerated growth in demand for this technology. As you can see on Slide 13, in the first 3 quarters of 2019 alone, Fluence One contracts for 806 megawatts. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, Fluence has tripled its backlog, which now stands at a record high of more than 1 gigawatt with a combined value of roughly $1 billion. Fluence is cash and variable margin positive and continuing to expand its capabilities in order to meet the scale requirements of the business.
Our leading position in energy storage is providing us with a competitive advantage in other aspects of our business. We're seeing that nearly half of all solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. Based on our scale and more than 10 years of experience in integrating energy storage, we are very well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I will cover our financial results outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives. As shown on Slide 15, in the third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.48, primarily reflecting contributions from new businesses, including AES Colón and renewables in the U.S. and a lower tax rate. The timing of outages, net of related insurance recovery, also had a positive impact on the results in our region.
In the third quarter of 2018, a free lightening strike caused major damage at our Andres plant in the Dominican Republic. [indiscernible] it offline with a roughly $0.04 impact.
In Panama, our Changuinola plant has been an extended planned outage for most of this year, while we have insurance to offset a large portion of these outages, the timing of recognition is not always evenly distributed throughout the year. On our second quarter call, we indicated that we expected the recovery in the second half related to these outages. And in fact, the majority of this occurred in the third quarter. This was about $0.05, which effectively catches us up for the first half of the year.
As seen on Slide 16, on a year-to-date basis, the net impact of losses versus insurance recovery is slightly negative at $0.01. Importantly, our Andrews facility is fully online and our Changuinola plant is on track to come back online in early 2020.
Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $426 million for the quarter, an increase of $99 million or 30%. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 18.
In the U.S. and utilities SBU, increase at PTC reflects contributions from new renewable projects as well as the resolution of regulated rate cases last year. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of 360 megawatts of coal-fired generation at share point.
Regarding this DPL's VMR extension filing, we remain on track for an expected ruling in the first half of 2020, and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL's plan to modernize its electric grid, which costs for $1.2 billion of T&D investment over 7 years, will go to hearing on November 14. Costs would be recovered through an 80% tracker mechanism between rate cases, and AES investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan will be a key component of the mid-single-digit rate base growth we have discussed it in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020.
At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by improved margins at and lower interest in Chile as well as higher pricing in Colombia.
I would like to take a moment now to discuss recent developments in Argentina. As you know, Argentina recently elected Alberto Fernandez as the new President as expected. The policies of the incoming government are yet to be defined, but we do not expect a meaningful impact on our outlook. Especially given the quality of our assets and the material improvement we have achieved in AES' portfolio over the last several years. Right now, current controls are in place, and we will face restrictions in sending dividends out of Argentina. But as a result of our diversified portfolio, we'll be able to mitigate the impact and continue to deliver strong cash flow growth to our shareholders.
Turning back to our quarterly results. As discussed earlier, higher PTC at our MCCS view reflects the outages in the Dominican Republic and Panama, net of related insurance recovery, as well as the commencement of operations at AES Colón.
Finally, in Eurasia, low results primarily reflect a onetime transmission charge and lower capacity, doing testing and commissioning at OPGC 2.
Now to Slide 22. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $1.02 versus $0.80 -- $0.88 last year. In the fourth quarter, we expected a higher quarterly tax rate versus the 24% we saw last year, and an impact from the planned outage at our facility in the U.S.
On a full year basis for 2019, we feel very confident in reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.30 to $1.38. Further, based on our achievements to date and current outlook, we are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022. Consistent with our prior proxy, we will provide specific guidance for 2020 on our fourth quarter call.
Turning to 2019, parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our last call. Additionally, we are able to take advantage of available debt capacity at one of our subsidiaries that bring $200 million in return of capital to the parent. The majority of our discretionary cash continues to come from the roughly $725 million of parent free cash flow and $350 million of asset sale proceeds. Asset sales, including Northern Ireland and the sPower sell down, both of which have closed as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year-end.
Now to the uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders. We allocated $450 million to parent debt paid down versus our prior target of $150 million for this year to accelerate our credit improvement and reinforce our commitment to achieve investment-grade ratings. As a result, we expected to end the year at 3.5x parent leverage and 22% FFO to debt, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively.
To that end, as Andres mentioned, we are very pleased to see positive actions by the rating agencies, including an investment-grade rating front reach. We are also investing $450 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $50 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on Slide 24. We expected our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, which is, again, consistent with our last call, plus the addition of $200 million in return of Capital I just mentioned. More than 3/4 of our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from current free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
Turning to the use of the discretionary cash on Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to any review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We have completed $450 million of parent debt prepayment this year. This is an increase versus our prior target of $300 million. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new project PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $300 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

So basically, we filled up our 70 tera BTU tank there. So basically, it's at full capacity. By signing this joint venture with other local generators, we need additional capacity. So we're going to build a second tank with 50 tera BTUs capacity and about 30 tera BTUs, is that -- is either agreed to or in the process of signing agreements for. So that's already quite taking up 60% of the new capacity of the tank. So this -- in the Dominican Republic, I think we have really follow through on what we said was possible.
In the case of Panama, we have an 80 tera BTU tank. Right now, that's at most about 30% used. And so there's considerable capacity to put other generators on gas. And so Panama does have other natural gas projects. It also has a lot of diesel plants, not too far from our plant. So really, it's a question of how fast we can connect those. It also has the capacity for re export, just like we have in the Dominican Republic, and also for C&G and in terms of trucks and local industry. So I think the point is that in the Dominican Republic, we do have capacity now for once we complete this tank for another 20 tera Btus, and we continue to have about 50 terabytes in Panama that are available. So it's going to be a combination of, as we did in the Dominican Republic, local demand, additional power plant. It's going to be additional industries and transportation. And I think growing over time is the reexport. So we are exporting natural gas from the Dominican Republic to, for example, Guyana, Barbados, Haiti and there are other possibilities as well.

We really go to the fundamentals, what does this mean? Now this is a preliminary announcement. It has many components to it, and we will be providing color as things develop and things materialize. But realize, first, that we are sort of uniquely positioned to help Google meet its 24/7 renewable 0 carbon energy across the globe. So you we're uniquely positioned to do that. We recently won a bid in Chile for about 125 megawatts to do exactly that. So this is -- that was the first stage concrete. There will be others, we believe. And as I said, it'll be in targeted U.S. and Latin American markets. Second is to realize that the figure -- the fastest-growing sector of corporate demand is web services. So I believe Google has announced about 6 gigawatts of need across the globe. So this is a big target. It's growing. And this is the fastest-growing corporate sector. What they want is renewable energy around the clock, we are uniquely well positioned to deliver that. So again, there will be follow-ons to the Chile deal, we believe. And you'll stay tuned to that. In addition, there's some elements of energy management in these locations for us, using our portfolio to provide carbon-free around the clock energy. Then there is also, I would say, on our platform, the opportunity to optimize and continue to deliver cost reductions. So we've been doing spending gears, quite frankly, cleaning up data. Because again, there are a lot of buzzwords that people throw out AI and machine learning. Well, it's only as good as the data you have. So we've been cleaning up the laborious and very hard task of having the right data in place. So we believe by combining our 2 capabilities. We've been the leader in new applications in our sector will give us really a boost to the cost-saving initiatives we have mentioned. It will also give us a boost in terms of delivering on -- we're continually changing customer expectations. So expect this alliance to make very concrete announcements into the future. So this is not just sort of a feel good PR announcement. It really is that the 2 of us combined, we're leaders in certain areas such as energy storage, energy efficiency solutions in the U.S. So I think it makes a whole lot of sense. This is sort of 2 plus 2 plus 2 equal 6. And this is really -- all of this will be basic upside to what we have in our numbers, and we're going to dedicate people and resources to make sure this is something very concrete.
In terms of when it would really make an impact on our earnings. That's probably, I'd say, 2 or 3 years out at a minimum because this is really sort of setting the groundwork. Because even if you win new power purchase agreements, you have to build and these are requiring additionality. So just to put that in context, I think it's very important, but it's not going to have an immediate impact on us."

My last question for you. On the Fluence JV, obviously, making good progress. It doesn't sound like, right now, it's actually creating any concrete economic value in terms of cash distributions or earnings contributions to AES Corp., but when do we get to a tipping point where it's either potentially a significant cash flow earnings contributor? Or is there another way that we monetize this value for shareholders? Like could this be a stand-alone sort of public market IPO at some point, if it really gets to critical mass? I mean, what are the different ways now that you're really making headway selling the product globally that you can monetize that value for shareholders?"

This is not a regulated asset, that's a marginal contributor. We have to think about it differently. So we've created a market leader in a market that's growing at 100% per year. It's going to have a major impact on the future of our sector. So again, it's not a sort of a marginal investment. You have to think about all the value we're creating by this. As we mentioned, we are not -- it is cash and variable margins positive, but that money is going into the business to prepare it for really scaling up. I mean, it grew a 100% last year. So you have to scale it up. So I think it's creating a lot of value for our shareholders directly in the business. And some point, it will probably make sense to really have a marker out there so you guys can get a feeling for what it's worth because we think we've created a lot of value in the business. There are various ways to do that. But I think a marker would be very good to be able to put it into what's its value within the AES portfolio. But I have no doubt that this is going to be a major part of our business going forward -- in our sector going forward. And do realize that it is giving us a competitive advantage in winning renewable PPAs because we know as much as anybody about how to integrate energy storage and some very exciting developments coming in the fluid space. So stay tuned in terms of products in terms of new ideas. So for example, one in Chile, we're making the world's first virtual reservoir, where you can take a run of the River, hydro, which is [indiscernible] and really, instead of having to dispatch the energy 24/7. You can, quite frankly, not dispatch it when energy prices are low, mostly due to solar and inject that energy when prices are much higher. So there's a lot of innovation going on. It's very exciting."

What we had said in the past, as you know, that we had 3 years where we did not distribute dollar dividends from Argentina. And so there was a catch-up in recent years. Now having a portfolio like ours, as Gustavo mentioned in his speech, we don't expect this to affect us. So Argentina is one that is a little bit of up and downs. We've been there in good times, we've been there in bad times. We've always made money. Even in 2002, we made money in Argentina that, that, I think, reflects the quality of our assets and the fact that they're very lowly levered. So this is not sort of the run rate. With current exchange controls in place, we don't expect to be paying a material dividends out of Argentina. Certainly, next year. But we've always again, operated well there. We have put a big back office there. And so that's one way of, quite frankly, if you will, dollarizing is by using our pesos in Argentina to get services, which are worth dollars to us. So that helps offset some of this. So to be clear, in Argentina, we've always made money. We've always been capable of paying dividends, just we haven't always been able to buy the dollar. So if you look historically, the average is more like $70 million or so, and it's been like 5% to 6% of subsidiary distributions over time. So -- and this is quite frankly, what I expect in Argentina is kind of up and downs, but it's -- we've operated well there.

So the first is the 480 tera BTU regasification and storage terminal. So to put that in context, today, we have about 150 tera BTUs between Panama and the Dominican Republic. With the additional 50 tera BTUs, that will go up to about 200. So this is a very large project.
Now in this case, we have about 38% of the project, and Petrovietnam has the remainder. So we have a partner in this project. So where will the gas go? There's about 6 gigawatts, I believe, of gas-fired turbines in Vietnam that have been using offshore gas, which is running out. So there will be immediately a demand for the LNG terminal. In addition to our 2.2 gigawatts of combined cycle gas plants, which would be using that gas.
Now on the second project, on the combined cycle gas turbine plants, the 2.2 gigawatts, we own 100% of that. So when we talk about contracts, there are different contracts here. So one would be, of course, the contract between the LNG terminal and the generators, including ourselves. Then there's the offtake of the energy and capacity coming from the 2.2 gigawatts of new generation. And I realize we have a 1.3 gigawatt plant already in Vietnam, [indiscernible] 2, which has done very well, performing as one of the best performers in the country. We built it on time and on budget, has a long-term dollar-based contract that's been paying on time. So basically, it will be like a repeat of [indiscernible] 2, only burning gas this time. The other contracts, for example, between the supply of gas to -- this is -- so in -- 2 is the name of the terminal, that contracts have yet to be negotiated. And obviously, it'd be Petrovietnam and ourselves negotiating with U.S. gas suppliers. So those have yet been negotiated. But in general, the -- it's a very firm commitment by us and by the government of Vietnam. To do this project. And so I'd say the 1 thing that distinguishes it from, say, the projects in Panama and the Dominican Republic, is that the demand is there. So it's not a question of building terminal storage facility, where the anchor tenant plant that you build is 30% of it. In this case, it's going to be used -- the use is going to be much, much faster, getting to the 90%-plus usage."

35312,639620768,1854755,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2019",2019-11-06,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 financial review call.

Gustavo will",1252,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 financial review call. Today, I will walk through the highlights of the quarter and how we are delivering on our commitments and successfully executing on our strategy. Gustavo will then follow with a detailed description of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results.
Our adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.48, which is 37% higher than our results for the same quarter last year. On our prior call, we mentioned that much of our growth would be in the second half of the year, and our strong third quarter results are in line with our expectations. We're on track to deliver on our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with a midpoint of $1.34, and our parent free cash flow target with a midpoint of $725 million. And we are confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022.
I am pleased to report that we're making good progress on the strategy we laid out on our previous calls. Allow me to walk you through step by step. First, turning to Slide 4. Let us talk about our progress towards becoming investment grade. As you may have seen in this morning's press release, we received an investment-grade rating for the first time in AES' history. I'm very pleased to have achieved this milestone, reflects a multiyear transformation strategy to make our business simpler and more predictable. We not only significantly strengthened our balance sheet, but we have also materially reduced our exposure to risks such as hydrology, foreign currencies and commodities.
Moving to Slide 5 and our growth in renewables. This quarter, we signed over 900 megawatts of new renewable power purchase agreements, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.9 gigawatts. We're fully confident that we will consistently deliver 2 to 3 gigawatts of new renewable capacity every year. As of today, our backlog of projects is 6 gigawatts, half of which are under construction and half have signed PPAs. As anticipated, about half of these projects are in the U.S. and half are international. We see ourselves as uniquely positioned in the renewable space to take advantage of synergies and economies of scale, whilst also benefiting from sufficient geographical diversity.
Looking at this from another perspective on Slide 6. Approximately 80% of our 6-gigawatt backlog or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables. Split between hydro, solar, wind and energy storage. We expect the majority of our backlog to be online by the end of 2022.
Now on to specific large projects. On Slide 7, we can see that the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project is virtually complete, and we are currently in the final commissioning stage. We're on track to begin commercial operations in early 2020.
Turning to Slide 8. AES Gener is also making good progress on the Alto Maipo hydro project. The project is 82% complete, including 37 miles of tunneling and both cabins -- caverns for the powerhouses. Less than 4 miles of tunneling remain to finish Phase I by year-end 2020. At which time, the construction of all 531 megawatts of capacity will be completed. In parallel, they're progressing well on the tunneling of Phase II, which will provide additional water to the project.
Let us now discuss the advances we are making on our LNG strategy and turn to Slide 9. Last month, we received approval from the government of Vietnam to develop and build a 2.2 gigawatt combined cycle gas turbine project alongside our previously-approved 480 tera BTU LNG regasification and storage terminal. This complex will have a 20-year U.S. dollar-denominated contract with no commodity exposure. We expect to see financial close in 2021 and commercial operations in 2024. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business is complementary to our renewables growth strategy by offering a clean, predictable and low-cost fuel that provides capacity and flexibility to the system. We are focusing our LNG business on 3 markets: The Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural gas to supply new generation and to displace higher cost diesel fuel oil.
A good example of how we're benefiting from this growing demand is the Dominican Republic. As shown on Slide 10, this quarter, we finalized a joint venture with other local generators. As a result of this JV, we will build a second LNG storage tank, expanding our capacity in the Dominican Republic by 80% or an additional 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or in advanced negotiations for 30 tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES, and we expect to break ground in the first quarter of 2020, with completion in late 2022.
As we had previously mentioned, our LNG business is easily scalable, which allows us to increase our margin while requiring relatively little investment from AES. While we are delivering on our commitments in our guidance periods, we're also making investments to maintain our leadership in new technologies, which will contribute to our earnings growth in future years. We are currently the global market leader in energy storage and the market leader for cloud-based energy efficiency solutions in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 11. Today, we're announcing a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business line. We will be working together to find new solutions to accelerate the broad adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. AES will collaborate with Google Cloud on energy management and opportunities to develop, own and operate projects in targeted markets in the U.S. and Latin America that has the potential to help Google meet its clean energy objectives.
In addition to providing the potential for additional revenues for AES, this alliance will put both of us on the front line of innovation in the industry, allowing us to further reduce costs, optimize operations and meet changing customer expectations.
On Slide 12, we can see that our strategic investment in the leading U.S. cloud-based digital solutions provider in our sector, Uplight, is progressing well. This is a business that is growing rapidly from a base of $100 million in annual revenue. It is cash and margin positive and will provide broad insights into customer behavior and energy efficiency.
Our energy storage business, Fluence, continues to be the global market leader. Through Fluence, our 50-50 joint venture with Siemens, we are able to capture the accelerated growth in demand for this technology. 
As you can see on Slide 13, in the first 3 quarters of 2019 alone, Fluence won contracts for 806 megawatts. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, Fluence has tripled its backlog, which now stands at a record high of more than 1 gigawatt with a combined value of roughly $1 billion. Fluence is cash and variable margin positive and continuing to expand its capabilities in order to meet the scale requirements of the business.
Our leading position in energy storage is providing us with a competitive advantage in other aspects of our business. We're seeing that nearly half of all solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. Based on our scale and more than 10 years of experience in integrating energy storage, we are very well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I will cover our financial results outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives. 
As shown on Slide 15, in the third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.48, primarily reflecting contributions from new businesses, including AES Colón and renewables in the U.S. and a lower tax rate. The timing of outages, net of related insurance recovery, also had a positive impact on the results in our MCAC region.
In the third quarter of 2018, a freak lightning strike caused major damage at our Andres plant in the Dominican Republic. Forcing it offline with a roughly $0.04 impact.
In Panama, our Changuinola plant has been on an extended planned outage for most of this year. While we have insurance to offset a large portion of these outages, the timing of recognition is not always evenly distributed throughout the year. 
On our second quarter call, we indicated that we expected the recovery in the second half related to these outages. And in fact, the majority of this occurred in the third quarter. This was about $0.05, which effectively catches us up for the first half of the year.
As seen on Slide 16, on a year-to-date basis, the net impact of losses versus insurance recovery is slightly negative at $0.01. Importantly, our Andres facility is fully online and our Changuinola plant is on track to come back online in early 2020.
Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $426 million for the quarter, an increase of $99 million or 30%. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 18.
In the U.S. and utilities SBU, increased PTC reflects contributions from new renewable projects as well as the resolution of regulated rate cases last year. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of 360 megawatts of coal-fired generation at Shady Point.
Regarding this DPL's DMR extension filing, we remain on track for an expected ruling in the first half of 2020, and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL's plan to modernize its electric grid, which costs for $1.2 billion of T&D investment over 7 years, will go to hearing on November 14. Costs would be recovered through an 80% tracker mechanism between rate cases, and AES investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan will be a key component of the mid-single-digit rate base growth we have discussed it in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020.
At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by improved margins at Guacolda and lower interest in Chile as well as higher pricing in Colombia.
I would like to take a moment now to discuss recent developments in Argentina. As you know, Argentina recently elected Alberto Fernandez as the new President as expected. The policies of the incoming government are yet to be defined, but we do not expect a meaningful impact on our outlook. Especially given the quality of our assets and the material improvement we have achieved in AES' portfolio over the last several years. Right now, current controls are in place, and we will face restrictions in sending dividends out of Argentina. But as a result of our diversified portfolio, we'll be able to mitigate the impact and continue to deliver strong cash flow growth to our shareholders.
Turning back to our quarterly results. As discussed earlier, higher PTC at our [ MCCS ] view reflects the outages in the Dominican Republic and Panama, net of related insurance recovery, as well as the commencement of operations at AES Colón.
Finally, in Eurasia, low results primarily reflect a onetime transmission charge and lower capacity, doing testing and commissioning at OPGC 2.
Now to Slide 22. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $1.02 versus $0.80 -- $0.88 last year. In the fourth quarter, we expected a higher quarterly tax rate versus the 24% we saw last year, and an impact from the planned outage at our Warrior Run facility in the U.S.
On a full year basis for 2019, we feel very confident in reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.30 to $1.38. Further, based on our achievements to date and current outlook, we are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022. Consistent with our prior proxy, we will provide specific guidance for 2020 on our fourth quarter call.
Turning to 2019, parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our last call. Additionally, we are able to take advantage of available debt capacity at one of our subsidiaries to spring $200 million in return of capital to the parent. The majority of our discretionary cash continues to come from the roughly $725 million of parent free cash flow and $350 million of asset sale proceeds. Asset sales, including Northern Ireland and the sPower sell down, both of which have closed as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year-end.
Now to the uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders. We allocated $450 million to parent debt paid down versus our prior target of $150 million for this year to accelerate our credit improvement and reinforce our commitment to achieve investment-grade ratings. As a result, we expected to end the year at 3.5x parent leverage and 22% FFO to debt, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively.
To that end, as Andrés  mentioned, we are very pleased to see positive actions by the rating agencies, including an investment-grade rating from Fitch. We are also investing $450 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $50 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on Slide 24. We expected our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, which is, again, consistent with our last call, plus the addition of $200 million in return of capital I just mentioned. More than 3/4 of our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
Turning to the use of this discretionary cash on Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We have completed $450 million of parent debt prepayment this year. This is an increase versus our prior target of $300 million. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $300 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

So basically, we filled up our 70 tera BTU tank there. So basically, it's at full capacity. By signing this joint venture with other local generators, we need additional capacity. So we're going to build a second tank with 50 tera BTUs capacity and about 30 tera BTUs, is that -- is either agreed to or in the process of that signing agreements for. So that's already quite taking up 60% of the new capacity of the tank. So this -- in the Dominican Republic, I think we have really followed through on what we said was possible.
In the case of Panama, we have an 80 tera BTU tank. Right now, that's at most about 30% used. And so there's considerable capacity to put other generators on gas. And so Panama does have other natural gas projects. It also has a lot of diesel plants, not too far from our plant. So really, it's a question of how fast we can connect those. It also has the capacity for reexport, just like we have in the Dominican Republic, and also for CNG and in terms of trucks and local industry. So I think the point is that in the Dominican Republic, we do have capacity now for once we complete this tank for another 20 tera BTUs, and we continue to have about 50 tera BTUs in Panama that are available. So it's going to be a combination of, as we did in the Dominican Republic, local demand, additional power plant. It's going to be additional industries and transportation. And I think growing over time is the reexport. So we are exporting natural gas from the Dominican Republic to, for example, Guyana, Barbados, Haiti and there are other possibilities as well. And obviously, the Central American region has possibilities as well for the export of natural gas."

But realize, first, that we are sort of uniquely positioned to help Google meet its 24/7 renewable 0 carbon energy across the globe. So -- we're uniquely positioned to do that. We recently won a bid in Chile for about 125 megawatts to do exactly that. So this is -- that was the first stage, concrete. There will be others, we believe. And as I said, it'll be in targeted U.S. and Latin American markets. 
Second is to realize that the figure -- the fastest-growing sector of corporate demand is web services. So I believe Google has announced about 6 gigawatts of need across the globe. So this is a big target. It's growing. And this is the fastest-growing corporate sector. What they want is renewable energy around the clock. We are uniquely well positioned to deliver that. So again, there will be follow-ons to the Chile deal, we believe and stay tuned to that. 
In addition, there's some elements of energy management in these locations for us, using our portfolio to provide carbon-free around-the-clock energy. Then there is also, I would say, on our platform, the opportunity to optimize and continue to deliver cost reductions. So we've been doing spending years, quite frankly, cleaning up data. Because again, there are a lot of buzzwords that people throw out, AI, machine learning. Well, it's only as good as the data you have. So we've been cleaning up the laborious and very hard task of having the right data in place. So we believe by combining our 2 capabilities, we've been the leader in new applications in our sector, will give us really a boost to the cost-saving initiatives we have mentioned. It will also give us a boost in terms of delivering on -- we're continually changing customer expectations. So expect this alliance to make very concrete announcements into the future. So this is not just sort of a feel good PR announcement. It really is that the 2 of us combined, we're leaders in certain areas such as energy storage, energy efficiency solutions in the U.S. So I think it makes a whole lot of sense. This is sort of 2 plus 2 equals 6. And this is really -- all of this will be basic upside to what we have in our numbers, and we're going to dedicate people and resources to make sure this is something very concrete.
In terms of when it would really make an impact on our earnings. That's probably, I'd say, 2 or 3 years out at a minimum because this is really sort of setting the groundwork. Because even if you win new power purchase agreements, you have to build them. These are requiring additionality. So just to put that in context, I think it's very important, but it's not going to have an immediate impact on us."

My last question for you. On the Fluence JV, obviously, making good progress. It doesn't sound like, right now, it's actually creating any concrete economic value in terms of cash distributions or earnings contributions to AES Corp., but when do we get to a tipping point where it's either potentially a significant cash flow earnings contributor? Or is there another way that we monetize this value for shareholders? Like could this be a stand-alone sort of public market IPO at some point if it really gets to critical mass? I mean, what are the different ways now that you're really making headway selling the product globally that you can monetize that value for shareholders?"

This is not a regulated asset that's a marginal contributor. We have to think about it differently. So we've created a market leader in a market that's growing at 100% per year. It's going to have a major impact on the future of our sector. So again, it's not a sort of a marginal investment. You have to think about all the value we're creating by this. As we mentioned, we are not -- it is cash- and variable-margin positive, but that money is going into the business to prepare it for really scaling up. I mean, it grew a 100% last year. So you have to scale it up. So I think it's creating a lot of value for our shareholders directly in the business. 
And some point, it will probably make sense to really have a marker out there so you guys can get a feeling for what it's worth because we think we've created a lot of value in the business. There are various ways to do that. But I think a marker would be very good to be able to put it into what's its value within the AES portfolio. But I have no doubt that this is going to be a major part of our business going forward, and I mean in our sector going forward. And do realize that it is giving us a competitive advantage in winning renewable PPAs because we know as much as anybody about how to integrate energy storage and some very exciting developments coming in the Fluence space. So stay tuned in terms of products and in terms of new ideas. So for example, one in Chile, we're making the world's first virtual reservoir, where you can take a run-of-the-river hydro, which is Las Lajas and really, instead of having to dispatch the energy 24/7. You can, quite frankly, not dispatch it when energy prices are low, mostly due to solar, and inject that energy when prices are much higher. So there's a lot of innovation going on. It's very exciting."

What we had said in the past, as you know, that we had 3 years where we did not distribute dollar dividends from Argentina. And so there was a catch-up in recent years. Now having a portfolio like ours, as Gustavo mentions in his speech, we don't expect this to affect us. So Argentina is one that is a little bit of up and down. We've been there in good times, we've been there in bad times. We've always made money. Even in 2002, we made money in Argentina and that, I think, reflects the quality of our assets in the fact that they're very lowly levered. So this is not the -- sort of the run rate. 
With current exchange controls in place, we don't expect to be paying a material dividends out of Argentina, certainly, next year. But we've always again, operated well there. We have put a big back office there. And so that's one way of, quite frankly, if you will, dollarizing is by using our pesos in Argentina to get services, which are worth dollars to us. So that helps offset some of this. 
So to be clear, in Argentina, we've always made money. We've always been capable of paying dividends, just we haven't always been able to buy the dollar. So if you look historically, the average is more like $70 million or so, and it's been like 5% to 6% of subsidiary distributions over time. So -- and this is quite frankly, what I expect in Argentina. It's kind of up and down, but it's -- we've operated well there.

So the first is the 480 tera BTU regasification and storage terminal. So to put that in context, today, we have about 150 tera BTUs between Panama and the Dominican Republic. With the additional 50 tera BTUs, that will go up to about 200. So this is a very large project.
Now in this case, we have about 38% of the project, and PetroVietnam has the remainder. So we have a partner in this project. So where will the gas go? There's about 6 gigawatts, I believe, of gas-fired turbines in Vietnam that have been using offshore gas, which is running out. So there will be immediately a demand for the LNG terminal in addition to our 2.2 gigawatts of combined cycle gas plants, which would be using that gas.
Now on the second project, the combined cycle gas turbine plants, the 2.2 gigawatts, we own 100% of that. So when we talk about contracts, there are different contracts here. So one would be, of course, the contract between the LNG terminal and the generators, including ourselves. Then there's the offtake of the energy and capacity coming from the 2.2 gigawatts of new generation. And I realize we have a 1.3 gigawatt plant already in Vietnam, Mong Duong II, which has done very well, performing -- is one of the best performers in the country. We built it on time and on budget, has a long-term dollar-based contract that's been paying on time. So basically, it would be like a repeat of Mong Duong II, only burning gas this time. 
The other contracts, for example, between the supply of gas to -- this is Son My -- Son My 2 is the name of the terminal, that contracts have yet to be negotiated. And obviously, it'd be PetroVietnam and ourselves negotiating with U.S. gas suppliers. So those have to yet be negotiated. 
But in general, the -- it's a very firm commitment by us and by the government of Vietnam.to do this project. And so I'd say the 1 thing that distinguishes it from, say, the projects in Panama and the Dominican Republic, is that the demand is there. So it's not a question of building terminal storage facility where the anchor tenant plant that you build is 30% of it. In this case, it's going to be used -- the use is going to be much, much faster, getting to the 90%-plus usage."

Today, I will walk through the highlights of the quarter and how we are delivering on our commitments and successfully executing on our strategy. Gustavo will",1252,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 financial review call. Today, I will walk through the highlights of the quarter and how we are delivering on our commitments and successfully executing on our strategy. Gustavo will then follow with a detailed description of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results.
Our adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.48, which is 37% higher than our results for the same quarter last year. On our prior call, we mentioned that much of our growth would be in the second half of the year, and our strong third quarter results are in line with our expectations. We're on track to deliver on our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with a midpoint of $1.34, and our parent free cash flow target with a midpoint of $725 million. And we are confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022.
I am pleased to report that we're making good progress on the strategy we laid out on our previous calls. Allow me to walk you through step by step. 
First, turning to Slide 4. Let us talk about our progress towards becoming investment grade. As you may have seen in this morning's press release, we received an investment-grade rating for the first time in AES' history. I'm very pleased to have achieved this milestone, reflects a multiyear transformation strategy to make our business simpler and more predictable. We not only significantly strengthened our balance sheet, but we have also materially reduced our exposure to risks such as hydrology, foreign currencies and commodities.
Moving to Slide 5 and our growth in renewables. This quarter, we signed over 900 megawatts of new renewable power purchase agreements, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.9 gigawatts. We're fully confident that we will consistently deliver 2 to 3 gigawatts of new renewable capacity every year. As of today, our backlog of projects is 6 gigawatts, half of which are under construction and half have signed PPAs. As anticipated, about half of these projects are in the U.S. and half are international. We see ourselves as uniquely positioned in the renewable space to take advantage of synergies and economies of scale, whilst also benefiting from sufficient geographical diversity.
Looking at this from another perspective on Slide 6. Approximately 80% of our 6-gigawatt backlog or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables. Split between hydro, solar, wind and energy storage. We expect the majority of our backlog to be online by the end of 2022.
Now on to specific large projects. On Slide 7, we can see that the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project is virtually complete, and we are currently in the final commissioning stage. We're on track to begin commercial operations in early 2020.
Turning to Slide 8. AES Gener is also making good progress on the Alto Maipo hydroelectric project. The project is 82% complete, including 37 miles of tunneling and both cabins -- caverns for the powerhouses. Less than 4 miles of tunneling remain to finish Phase 1 by year-end 2020 at which time, the construction of all 531 megawatts of capacity will be completed. In parallel, they're progressing well on the tunneling of Phase 2, which will provide additional water to the project.
Let us now discuss the advances we are making on our LNG strategy and turn to Slide 9. Last month, we received approval from the government of Vietnam to develop and build a 2.2 gigawatt combined cycle gas turbine project alongside our previously-approved 480 tera BTU LNG regasification and storage terminal. This complex will have a 20-year U.S. dollar-denominated contract with no commodity exposure. We expect to see financial close in 2021 and commercial operations in 2024. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business as complementary to our renewables growth strategy by offering a clean, predictable and low-cost fuel that provides capacity and flexibility to the system. 
We are focusing our LNG business on 3 markets: The Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural gas to supply new generation and to displace higher cost diesel fuel oil.
A good example of how we're benefiting from this growing demand is the Dominican Republic. As shown on Slide 10, this quarter we finalized a joint venture with other local generators. As a result of this JV, we will build a second LNG storage tank, expanding our capacity in the Dominican Republic by 80% or an additional 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or in advanced negotiations for 30 tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES, and we expect to break ground in the first quarter of 2020, with completion in late 2022.
As we had previously mentioned, our LNG business is easily scalable, which allows us to increase our margin while requiring relatively little investment from AES. While we are delivering on our commitments in our guidance periods, we're also making investments to maintain our leadership in new technologies, which will contribute to our earnings growth in future years. We are currently the global market leader in energy storage and the market leader for cloud-based energy efficiency solutions in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 11. Today, we're announcing a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business line. We will be working together to find new solutions to accelerate the broad adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. AES will collaborate with Google Cloud on energy management and opportunities to develop, own and operate projects in targeted markets in the U.S. and Latin America that has the potential to help Google meet its clean energy objectives.
In addition to providing the potential for additional revenues for AES, this alliance will put both of us on the front line of innovation in the industry, allowing us to further reduce costs, optimize operations and meet changing customer expectations.
On Slide 12, we can see that our strategic investment in the leading U.S. cloud-based digital solutions provider in our sector, Uplight, is progressing well. This is a business that is growing rapidly from a base of $100 million in annual revenue. It is cash and margin positive and will provide broad insights into customer behavior and energy efficiency.
Our energy storage business, Fluence, continues to be the global market leader. Through Fluence, our 50-50 joint venture with Siemens, we are able to capture the accelerated growth in demand for this technology. 
As you can see on Slide 13, in the first 3 quarters of 2019 alone, Fluence won contracts for 806 megawatts. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, Fluence has tripled its backlog, which now stands at a record high of more than 1 gigawatt with a combined value of roughly $1 billion. Fluence is cash and variable margin positive and continuing to expand its capabilities in order to meet the scale requirements of the business.
Our leading position in energy storage is providing us with a competitive advantage in other aspects of our business. We're seeing that nearly half of all solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. Based on our scale and more than 10 years of experience in integrating energy storage, we are very well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I will cover our financial results, outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives. 
As shown on Slide 15, in the third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.48, primarily reflecting contributions from new businesses, including AES Colón and renewables in the U.S. and a lower tax rate. The timing of outages, net of related insurance recovery, also had a positive impact on the results in our MCAC region.
In the third quarter of 2018, a freak lightning strike caused major damage at our Andres plant in the Dominican Republic forcing it off-line with a roughly $0.04 impact.
In Panama, our Changuinola plant has been on an extended planned outage for most of this year. While we have insurance to offset a large portion of these outages, the timing of recognition is not always evenly distributed throughout the year. 
On our second quarter call, we indicated that we expected the recovery in the second half related to these outages. And in fact, the majority of this occurred in the third quarter. This was about $0.05, which effectively catches us up for the first half of the year.
As seen on Slide 16, on a year-to-date basis, the net impact of losses versus insurance recovery is slightly negative at $0.01. Importantly, our Andres facility is fully online and our Changuinola plant is on track to come back online in early 2020.
Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $426 million for the quarter, an increase of $99 million or 30%. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 18.
In the U.S. and utilities SBU, increased PTC reflects contributions from new renewable projects as well as the resolution of regulated rate cases last year. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of 360 megawatts of coal-fired generation at Shady Point.
Regarding this DPL's DMR extension filing, we remain on track for an expected ruling in the first half of 2020, and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL's plan to modernize its electric grid, which calls for $1.2 billion of T&D investment over 7 years, will go to hearing on November 14. Costs would be recovered through an 80% tracker mechanism between rate cases, and AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan will be a key component of the mid-single-digit rate base growth we have discussed in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020.
At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by improved margins at Guacolda and lower interest in Chile as well as higher pricing in Colombia.
I would like to take a moment now to discuss recent developments in Argentina. As you know, Argentina recently elected Alberto Fernández as the new President as expected. The policies of the incoming government are yet to be defined, but we do not expect a meaningful impact on our outlook. Especially given the quality of our assets and the material improvement we have achieved in AES' portfolio over the last several years. Right now, current controls are in place, and we will face restrictions in sending dividends out of Argentina. But as a result of our diversified portfolio, we'll be able to mitigate the impact and continue to deliver strong cash flow growth to our shareholders.
Turning back to our quarterly results. As discussed earlier, higher PTC at our MCAC BU reflects the outages in the Dominican Republic and Panama, net of related insurance recovery, as well as the commencement of operations at AES Colón.
Finally, in Eurasia, low results primarily reflect a onetime transmission charge and lower capacity, doing testing and commissioning at OPGC 2.
Now to Slide 22. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $1.02 versus $0.80 -- $0.88 last year. In the fourth quarter, we expected a higher quarterly tax rate versus the 24% we saw last year, and an impact from the planned outage at our Warrior Run facility in the U.S.
On a full year basis for 2019, we feel very confident in reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.30 to $1.38. Further, based on our achievements to date and current outlook, we are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022. Consistent with our prior proxy, we will provide specific guidance for 2020 on our fourth quarter call.
Turning to 2019, parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect the $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our last call. Additionally, we are able to take advantage of available debt capacity at one of our subsidiaries to [ upstream ] $200 million in return of capital to the parent. The majority of our discretionary cash continues to come from the roughly $725 million of parent free cash flow and $350 million of asset sale proceeds. Asset sales, include Northern Ireland and the sPower sell down, both of which have closed as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year-end.
Now to the uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders. We allocated $450 million to parent debt paid down versus our prior target of $150 million for this year to accelerate our credit improvement and reinforce our commitment to achieve investment-grade ratings. As a result, we expected to end the year at 3.5x parent leverage and 22% FFO to debt, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively.
To that end, as Andrés mentioned, we are very pleased to see positive actions by the rating agencies, including an investment-grade rating from Fitch. We are also investing $450 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $50 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on Slide 24. We expected our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, which is, again, consistent with our last call, plus the addition of $200 million in return of capital I just mentioned. More than 3/4 of our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
Turning to the use of this discretionary cash on Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We have completed $450 million of parent debt prepayment this year. This is an increase versus our prior target of $300 million. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $300 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

So basically, we filled up our 70 tera BTU tank there. So basically, it's at full capacity. By signing this joint venture with other local generators, we need additional capacity. So we're going to build a second tank with 50 tera BTUs capacity and about 30 tera BTUs, is that -- is either agreed to or in the process of that signing agreements for. 
So that's already quite taking up 60% of the new capacity of the tank. So this -- in the Dominican Republic, I think we have really followed through on what we said was possible.
In the case of Panama, we have an 80 tera BTU tank. Right now, that's at most about 30% used. And so there's considerable capacity to put other generators on gas. And so Panama does have other natural gas projects. It also has a lot of diesel plants, not too far from our plant. So really, it's a question of how fast we can connect those. 
It also has the capacity for reexport, just like we have in the Dominican Republic, and also for CNG in terms of trucks and local industry. 
So I think the point is that in the Dominican Republic, we do have capacity now for once we complete this tank for another 20 tera BTUs, and we continue to have about 50 tera BTUs in Panama that are available. So it's going to be a combination of, as we did in the Dominican Republic, local demand, additional power plant. It's going to be additional industries and transportation. And I think growing over time is the reexport. So we are exporting natural gas from the Dominican Republic to, for example, Guyana, Barbados, Haiti and there are other possibilities as well. And obviously, the Central American region has possibilities as well for the export of natural gas."

We really go to the fundamentals, what does this mean? Now this is a preliminary announcement. It has many components to it, and we will be providing color as things develop and things materialize. But realize, first, that we are sort of uniquely positioned to help Google meet its 24/7 renewable 0 carbon energy across the globe. So -- we're uniquely positioned to do that. We recently won a bid in Chile for about 125 megawatts to do exactly that. So this is -- that was the first stage, concrete. There will be others, we believe. And as I said, it'll be in targeted U.S. and Latin American markets. 
Second is to realize that the figure -- the fastest-growing sector of corporate demand is web services. So I believe Google has announced about 6 gigawatts of need across the globe. So this is a big target. It's growing. And this is the fastest-growing corporate sector. What they want is renewable energy around the clock. We are uniquely well positioned to deliver that. So again, there will be follow-ons to the Chile deal, we believe and stay tuned to that. 
In addition, there's some elements of energy management in these locations for us, using our portfolio to provide carbon-free around-the-clock energy. Then there is also, I would say, on the -- on our platform, the opportunity to optimize and continue to deliver cost reductions. So we've been doing -- spending years, quite frankly, cleaning up data. Because again, there are a lot of buzzwords that people throw out, AI, machine learning. Well, it's only as good as the data you have. So we've been cleaning up the laborious and very hard task of having the right data in place. 
So we believe by combining our 2 capabilities, we've been the leader in new applications in our sector, will give us really a boost to the cost-saving initiatives we have mentioned. It will also give us a boost in terms of delivering on -- we're continually changing customer expectations. So expect this alliance to make very concrete announcements into the future. So this is not just sort of a feel-good PR announcement. It really is that the 2 of us combined, we're leaders in certain areas such as energy storage, energy efficiency solutions in the U.S. So I think it makes a whole lot of sense. This is sort of 2 plus 2 equals 6. And this is really -- all of this will be basically upside to what we have in our numbers, and we're going to dedicate people and resources to make sure this is something very concrete.
In terms of when it would really make an impact on our earnings. That's probably, I'd say, 2 or 3 years out at a minimum because this is really sort of setting the groundwork. Because even if you win new power purchase agreements, you have to build them. These are -- require additionality. So just to put that in context, I think it's very important, but it's not going to have an immediate impact on us."

Last question for you. On the Fluence JV, obviously, making good progress. It doesn't sound like, right now, it's actually creating any concrete economic value in terms of cash distributions or earnings contributions to AES Corp., but when do we get to a tipping point where it's either potentially a significant cash flow earnings contributor? Or is there another way that we monetize this value for shareholders? Like could this be a stand-alone sort of public market IPO at some point if it really gets to critical mass? I mean, what are the different ways now that you're really making headway selling the product globally that you can monetize that value for shareholders?"

This is not a regulated asset that's a marginal contributor. We have to think about it differently. So we've created a market leader in a market that's growing at 100% per year. It's going to have a major impact on the future of our sector. So again, it's not a sort of a marginal investment. You have to think about all the value we're creating by this. As we mentioned, we are not -- it is cash- and variable-margin positive, but that money is going into the business to prepare it for really scaling up. I mean, it grew 100% last year. So you have to scale it up. So I think it's creating a lot of value for our shareholders directly in the business. 
And at some point, it will probably make sense to really have a marker out there so you guys can get a feeling for what it's worth because we think we've created a lot of value in the business. There are various ways to do that. But I think a marker would be very good to be able to put it into what's its value within the AES portfolio. But I have no doubt that this is going to be a major part of our business going forwards, and -- I mean in our sector going forward. And do realize that it is giving us a competitive advantage in winning renewable PPAs because we know as much as anybody about how to integrate energy storage and there's some very exciting developments coming in the Fluence space. So stay tuned in terms of products and in terms of new ideas. So for example, one in Chile, we're making the world's first virtual reservoir, where you can take a run of the river hydro, which is Las Lajas and really, instead of having to dispatch the energy 24/7, you can quite frankly, not dispatch it when energy prices are low, mostly due to solar, and inject that energy when prices are much higher. So there's a lot of innovation going down. It's very exciting."

What we had said in the past, as you know, that we had 3 years where we did not distribute dollar dividends from Argentina. And so there was a catch-up in recent years. Now having a portfolio like ours, as Gustavo mentions in his speech, we don't expect this to affect us. So Argentina is one that is a little bit of a up and down. We've been there in good times, we've been there in bad times. We've always made money. Even in 2002, we made money in Argentina and that, I think, reflects the quality of our assets and the fact that they're very lowly levered. So this is not the -- sort of the run rate. 
With current exchange controls in place, we don't expect to be paying material dividends out of Argentina, certainly, next year. But we've always again, operated well there. We have put a big back office there. And so that's one way of, quite frankly, if you will, dollarizing is by using our pesos in Argentina to get services, which are worth dollars to us. So that helps offset some of this. 
So to be clear, in Argentina, we've always made money. We've always been capable of paying dividends, just we haven't always been able to buy the dollar. So if you look historically, the average is more like $70 million or so, and it's been like 5% to 6% of subsidiary distributions over time. So -- and this is quite frankly, what I expect in Argentina. It's kind of up and downs, but it's -- we've operated well there.

So the first is the 480 tera BTU regasification and storage terminal. So to put that in context, today, we have about 150 tera BTUs between Panama and the Dominican Republic. With the additional 50 tera BTUs, that will go up to about 200. So this is a very large project.
Now in this case, we have about 38% of the project, and PetroVietnam has the remainder. So we have a partner in this project. So where will the gas go? There's about 6 gigawatts, I believe, of gas-fired turbines in Vietnam that have been using offshore gas, which is running out. So there will be immediately a demand for the LNG terminal in addition to our 2.2 gigawatts of combined cycle gas plants, which would be using that gas.
Now on the second project, on the combined cycle gas turbine plants, the 2.2 gigawatts, we own 100% of that. So when we talk about contracts, there are different contracts here. So one would be, of course, the contract between the LNG terminal and the generators, including ourselves. Then there's the offtake of the energy and capacity coming from the 2.2 gigawatts of new generation. Now realize we have a 1.3 gigawatt plant already in Vietnam, Mong Duong 2, which has done very well, performing -- is one of the best performers in the country. We built it on time and on budget, has a long-term dollar-based contract that's been paying on time. So basically, it would be like a repeat of Mong Duong 2, only burning gas this time. 
The other contracts, for example, between the supply of gas to -- this is Son My -- Son My 2 is the name of the terminal, that contracts have yet to be negotiated. And obviously, it'd be PetroVietnam and ourselves negotiating with U.S. gas suppliers. So those have to yet be negotiated. 
But in general, the -- it's a very firm commitment by us and by the government of Vietnam, to do this project. And so I'd say the one thing that distinguishes it from, say, the projects in Panama and the Dominican Republic, is that the demand is there. So it's not a question of building a terminal storage facility where the anchor tenant plant that you build is 30% of it. In this case, it's going to be used -- the use is going to be much, much faster, getting to the 90%-plus usage."

Today, I will walk through the highlights of the quarter and how we are delivering on our commitments and successfully executing on our strategy. Gustavo will then follow with a detailed description of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results.
Our adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.48, which is 37% higher than our results for the same quarter last year. On our prior call, we mentioned that much of our growth would be in the second half of the year, and our strong third quarter results are in line with our expectations. We're on track to deliver on our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with a midpoint of $1.34, and our parent free cash flow target with a midpoint of $725 million. And we are confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022.
I am pleased to report that we're making good progress on the strategy we laid out on our previous calls. Allow me to walk you through step by step. 
First, turning to Slide 4. Let us talk about our progress towards becoming investment grade. As you may have seen in this morning's press release, we received an investment-grade rating for the first time in AES' history. I'm very pleased to have achieved this milestone, reflects a multiyear transformation strategy to make our business simpler and more predictable. We not only significantly strengthened our balance sheet, but we have also materially reduced our exposure to risks such as hydrology, foreign currencies and commodities.
Moving to Slide 5 and our growth in renewables. This quarter, we signed over 900 megawatts of new renewable power purchase agreements, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.9 gigawatts. We're fully confident that we will consistently deliver 2 to 3 gigawatts of new renewable capacity every year. As of today, our backlog of projects is 6 gigawatts, half of which are under construction and half have signed PPAs. As anticipated, about half of these projects are in the U.S. and half are international. We see ourselves as uniquely positioned in the renewable space to take advantage of synergies and economies of scale, whilst also benefiting from sufficient geographical diversity.
Looking at this from another perspective on Slide 6. Approximately 80% of our 6-gigawatt backlog or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables. Split between hydro, solar, wind and energy storage. We expect the majority of our backlog to be online by the end of 2022.
Now on to specific large projects. On Slide 7, we can see that the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project is virtually complete, and we are currently in the final commissioning stage. We're on track to begin commercial operations in early 2020.
Turning to Slide 8. AES Gener is also making good progress on the Alto Maipo hydroelectric project. The project is 82% complete, including 37 miles of tunneling and both cabins -- caverns for the powerhouses. Less than 4 miles of tunneling remain to finish Phase 1 by year-end 2020 at which time, the construction of all 531 megawatts of capacity will be completed. In parallel, they're progressing well on the tunneling of Phase 2, which will provide additional water to the project.
Let us now discuss the advances we are making on our LNG strategy and turn to Slide 9. Last month, we received approval from the government of Vietnam to develop and build a 2.2 gigawatt combined cycle gas turbine project alongside our previously-approved 480 tera BTU LNG regasification and storage terminal. This complex will have a 20-year U.S. dollar-denominated contract with no commodity exposure. We expect to see financial close in 2021 and commercial operations in 2024. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business as complementary to our renewables growth strategy by offering a clean, predictable and low-cost fuel that provides capacity and flexibility to the system. 
We are focusing our LNG business on 3 markets: The Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural gas to supply new generation and to displace higher cost diesel fuel oil.
A good example of how we're benefiting from this growing demand is the Dominican Republic. As shown on Slide 10, this quarter we finalized a joint venture with other local generators. As a result of this JV, we will build a second LNG storage tank, expanding our capacity in the Dominican Republic by 80% or an additional 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or in advanced negotiations for 30 tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES, and we expect to break ground in the first quarter of 2020, with completion in late 2022.
As we had previously mentioned, our LNG business is easily scalable, which allows us to increase our margin while requiring relatively little investment from AES. While we are delivering on our commitments in our guidance periods, we're also making investments to maintain our leadership in new technologies, which will contribute to our earnings growth in future years. We are currently the global market leader in energy storage and the market leader for cloud-based energy efficiency solutions in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 11. Today, we're announcing a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business line. We will be working together to find new solutions to accelerate the broad adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. AES will collaborate with Google Cloud on energy management and opportunities to develop, own and operate projects in targeted markets in the U.S. and Latin America that has the potential to help Google meet its clean energy objectives.
In addition to providing the potential for additional revenues for AES, this alliance will put both of us on the front line of innovation in the industry, allowing us to further reduce costs, optimize operations and meet changing customer expectations.
On Slide 12, we can see that our strategic investment in the leading U.S. cloud-based digital solutions provider in our sector, Uplight, is progressing well. This is a business that is growing rapidly from a base of $100 million in annual revenue. It is cash and margin positive and will provide broad insights into customer behavior and energy efficiency.
Our energy storage business, Fluence, continues to be the global market leader. Through Fluence, our 50-50 joint venture with Siemens, we are able to capture the accelerated growth in demand for this technology. 
As you can see on Slide 13, in the first 3 quarters of 2019 alone, Fluence won contracts for 806 megawatts. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, Fluence has tripled its backlog, which now stands at a record high of more than 1 gigawatt with a combined value of roughly $1 billion. Fluence is cash and variable margin positive and continuing to expand its capabilities in order to meet the scale requirements of the business.
Our leading position in energy storage is providing us with a competitive advantage in other aspects of our business. We're seeing that nearly half of all solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. Based on our scale and more than 10 years of experience in integrating energy storage, we are very well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity.
Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I will cover our financial results, outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives. 
As shown on Slide 15, in the third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.48, primarily reflecting contributions from new businesses, including AES Colón and renewables in the U.S. and a lower tax rate. The timing of outages, net of related insurance recovery, also had a positive impact on the results in our MCAC region.
In the third quarter of 2018, a freak lightning strike caused major damage at our Andres plant in the Dominican Republic forcing it off-line with a roughly $0.04 impact.
In Panama, our Changuinola plant has been on an extended planned outage for most of this year. While we have insurance to offset a large portion of these outages, the timing of recognition is not always evenly distributed throughout the year. 
On our second quarter call, we indicated that we expected the recovery in the second half related to these outages. And in fact, the majority of this occurred in the third quarter. This was about $0.05, which effectively catches us up for the first half of the year.
As seen on Slide 16, on a year-to-date basis, the net impact of losses versus insurance recovery is slightly negative at $0.01. Importantly, our Andres facility is fully online and our Changuinola plant is on track to come back online in early 2020.
Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $426 million for the quarter, an increase of $99 million or 30%. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 18.
In the U.S. and utilities SBU, increased PTC reflects contributions from new renewable projects as well as the resolution of regulated rate cases last year. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of 360 megawatts of coal-fired generation at Shady Point.
Regarding this DPL's DMR extension filing, we remain on track for an expected ruling in the first half of 2020, and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL's plan to modernize its electric grid, which calls for $1.2 billion of T&D investment over 7 years, will go to hearing on November 14. Costs would be recovered through an 80% tracker mechanism between rate cases, and AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan will be a key component of the mid-single-digit rate base growth we have discussed in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020.
At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by improved margins at Guacolda and lower interest in Chile as well as higher pricing in Colombia.
I would like to take a moment now to discuss recent developments in Argentina. As you know, Argentina recently elected Alberto Fernández as the new President as expected. The policies of the incoming government are yet to be defined, but we do not expect a meaningful impact on our outlook. Especially given the quality of our assets and the material improvement we have achieved in AES' portfolio over the last several years. Right now, current controls are in place, and we will face restrictions in sending dividends out of Argentina. But as a result of our diversified portfolio, we'll be able to mitigate the impact and continue to deliver strong cash flow growth to our shareholders.
Turning back to our quarterly results. As discussed earlier, higher PTC at our MCAC BU reflects the outages in the Dominican Republic and Panama, net of related insurance recovery, as well as the commencement of operations at AES Colón.
Finally, in Eurasia, low results primarily reflect a onetime transmission charge and lower capacity, doing testing and commissioning at OPGC 2.
Now to Slide 22. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $1.02 versus $0.80 -- $0.88 last year. In the fourth quarter, we expected a higher quarterly tax rate versus the 24% we saw last year, and an impact from the planned outage at our Warrior Run facility in the U.S.
On a full year basis for 2019, we feel very confident in reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.30 to $1.38. Further, based on our achievements to date and current outlook, we are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022. Consistent with our prior proxy, we will provide specific guidance for 2020 on our fourth quarter call.
Turning to 2019, parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect the $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our last call. Additionally, we are able to take advantage of available debt capacity at one of our subsidiaries to [ upstream ] $200 million in return of capital to the parent. The majority of our discretionary cash continues to come from the roughly $725 million of parent free cash flow and $350 million of asset sale proceeds. Asset sales, include Northern Ireland and the sPower sell down, both of which have closed as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year-end.
Now to the uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders. We allocated $450 million to parent debt paid down versus our prior target of $150 million for this year to accelerate our credit improvement and reinforce our commitment to achieve investment-grade ratings. As a result, we expected to end the year at 3.5x parent leverage and 22% FFO to debt, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively.
To that end, as Andrés mentioned, we are very pleased to see positive actions by the rating agencies, including an investment-grade rating from Fitch. We are also investing $450 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $50 million of unallocated cash.
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on Slide 24. We expected our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, which is, again, consistent with our last call, plus the addition of $200 million in return of capital I just mentioned. More than 3/4 of our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.
Turning to the use of this discretionary cash on Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We have completed $450 million of parent debt prepayment this year. This is an increase versus our prior target of $300 million. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $300 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

So basically, we filled up our 70 tera BTU tank there. So basically, it's at full capacity. By signing this joint venture with other local generators, we need additional capacity. So we're going to build a second tank with 50 tera BTUs capacity and about 30 tera BTUs, is that -- is either agreed to or in the process of that signing agreements for. 
So that's already quite taking up 60% of the new capacity of the tank. So this -- in the Dominican Republic, I think we have really followed through on what we said was possible.
In the case of Panama, we have an 80 tera BTU tank. Right now, that's at most about 30% used. And so there's considerable capacity to put other generators on gas. And so Panama does have other natural gas projects. It also has a lot of diesel plants, not too far from our plant. So really, it's a question of how fast we can connect those. 
It also has the capacity for reexport, just like we have in the Dominican Republic, and also for CNG in terms of trucks and local industry. 
So I think the point is that in the Dominican Republic, we do have capacity now for once we complete this tank for another 20 tera BTUs, and we continue to have about 50 tera BTUs in Panama that are available. So it's going to be a combination of, as we did in the Dominican Republic, local demand, additional power plant. It's going to be additional industries and transportation. And I think growing over time is the reexport. So we are exporting natural gas from the Dominican Republic to, for example, Guyana, Barbados, Haiti and there are other possibilities as well. And obviously, the Central American region has possibilities as well for the export of natural gas."

We really go to the fundamentals, what does this mean? Now this is a preliminary announcement. It has many components to it, and we will be providing color as things develop and things materialize. But realize, first, that we are sort of uniquely positioned to help Google meet its 24/7 renewable 0 carbon energy across the globe. So -- we're uniquely positioned to do that. We recently won a bid in Chile for about 125 megawatts to do exactly that. So this is -- that was the first stage, concrete. There will be others, we believe. And as I said, it'll be in targeted U.S. and Latin American markets. 
Second is to realize that the figure -- the fastest-growing sector of corporate demand is web services. So I believe Google has announced about 6 gigawatts of need across the globe. So this is a big target. It's growing. And this is the fastest-growing corporate sector. What they want is renewable energy around the clock. We are uniquely well positioned to deliver that. So again, there will be follow-ons to the Chile deal, we believe and stay tuned to that. 
In addition, there's some elements of energy management in these locations for us, using our portfolio to provide carbon-free around-the-clock energy. Then there is also, I would say, on the -- on our platform, the opportunity to optimize and continue to deliver cost reductions. So we've been doing -- spending years, quite frankly, cleaning up data. Because again, there are a lot of buzzwords that people throw out, AI, machine learning. Well, it's only as good as the data you have. So we've been cleaning up the laborious and very hard task of having the right data in place. 
So we believe by combining our 2 capabilities, we've been the leader in new applications in our sector, will give us really a boost to the cost-saving initiatives we have mentioned. It will also give us a boost in terms of delivering on -- we're continually changing customer expectations. So expect this alliance to make very concrete announcements into the future. So this is not just sort of a feel-good PR announcement. It really is that the 2 of us combined, we're leaders in certain areas such as energy storage, energy efficiency solutions in the U.S. So I think it makes a whole lot of sense. This is sort of 2 plus 2 equals 6. And this is really -- all of this will be basically upside to what we have in our numbers, and we're going to dedicate people and resources to make sure this is something very concrete.
In terms of when it would really make an impact on our earnings. That's probably, I'd say, 2 or 3 years out at a minimum because this is really sort of setting the groundwork. Because even if you win new power purchase agreements, you have to build them. These are -- require additionality. So just to put that in context, I think it's very important, but it's not going to have an immediate impact on us."

It doesn't sound like, right now, it's actually creating any concrete economic value in terms of cash distributions or earnings contributions to AES Corp., but when do we get to a tipping point where it's either potentially a significant cash flow earnings contributor?

This is not a regulated asset that's a marginal contributor. We have to think about it differently. So we've created a market leader in a market that's growing at 100% per year. It's going to have a major impact on the future of our sector. So again, it's not a sort of a marginal investment. You have to think about all the value we're creating by this. As we mentioned, we are not -- it is cash- and variable-margin positive, but that money is going into the business to prepare it for really scaling up. I mean, it grew 100% last year. So you have to scale it up. So I think it's creating a lot of value for our shareholders directly in the business. 
And at some point, it will probably make sense to really have a marker out there so you guys can get a feeling for what it's worth because we think we've created a lot of value in the business. There are various ways to do that. But I think a marker would be very good to be able to put it into what's its value within the AES portfolio. But I have no doubt that this is going to be a major part of our business going forwards, and -- I mean in our sector going forward. And do realize that it is giving us a competitive advantage in winning renewable PPAs because we know as much as anybody about how to integrate energy storage and there's some very exciting developments coming in the Fluence space. So stay tuned in terms of products and in terms of new ideas. So for example, one in Chile, we're making the world's first virtual reservoir, where you can take a run of the river hydro, which is Las Lajas and really, instead of having to dispatch the energy 24/7, you can quite frankly, not dispatch it when energy prices are low, mostly due to solar, and inject that energy when prices are much higher. So there's a lot of innovation going down. It's very exciting."

What we had said in the past, as you know, that we had 3 years where we did not distribute dollar dividends from Argentina. And so there was a catch-up in recent years. Now having a portfolio like ours, as Gustavo mentions in his speech, we don't expect this to affect us. So Argentina is one that is a little bit of an up and down. We've been there in good times, we've been there in bad times. We've always made money. Even in 2002, we made money in Argentina and that, I think, reflects the quality of our assets and the fact that they're very lowly levered. So this is not the -- sort of the run rate. 
With current exchange controls in place, we don't expect to be paying material dividends out of Argentina, certainly, next year. But we've always again, operated well there. We have put a big back office there. And so that's one way of, quite frankly, if you will, dollarizing is by using our pesos in Argentina to get services, which are worth dollars to us. So that helps offset some of this. 
So to be clear, in Argentina, we've always made money. We've always been capable of paying dividends, just we haven't always been able to buy the dollar. So if you look historically, the average is more like $70 million or so, and it's been like 5% to 6% of subsidiary distributions over time. So -- and this is quite frankly, what I expect in Argentina. It's kind of up and downs, but it's -- we've operated well there.

So the first is the 480 tera BTU regasification and storage terminal. So to put that in context, today, we have about 150 tera BTUs between Panama and the Dominican Republic. With the additional 50 tera BTUs, that will go up to about 200. So this is a very large project.
Now in this case, we have about 38% of the project, and PetroVietnam has the remainder. So we have a partner in this project. So where will the gas go? There's about 6 gigawatts, I believe, of gas-fired turbines in Vietnam that have been using offshore gas, which is running out. So there will be immediately a demand for the LNG terminal in addition to our 2.2 gigawatts of combined cycle gas plants, which would be using that gas.
Now on the second project, on the combined cycle gas turbine plants, the 2.2 gigawatts, we own 100% of that. So when we talk about contracts, there are different contracts here. So one would be, of course, the contract between the LNG terminal and the generators, including ourselves. Then there's the offtake of the energy and capacity coming from the 2.2 gigawatts of new generation. Now realize we have a 1.3 gigawatt plant already in Vietnam, Mong Duong 2, which has done very well, performing -- is one of the best performers in the country. We built it on time and on budget, has a long-term dollar-based contract that's been paying on time. So basically, it would be like a repeat of Mong Duong 2, only burning gas this time. 
The other contracts, for example, between the supply of gas to -- this is Son My -- Son My 2 is the name of the terminal, that contracts have yet to be negotiated. And obviously, it'd be PetroVietnam and ourselves negotiating with U.S. gas suppliers. So those have to yet be negotiated. 
But in general, the -- it's a very firm commitment by us and by the government of Vietnam, to do this project. And so I'd say the one thing that distinguishes it from, say, the projects in Panama and the Dominican Republic, is that the demand is there. So it's not a question of building a terminal storage facility where the anchor tenant plant that you build is 30% of it. In this case, it's going to be used -- the use is going to be much, much faster, getting to the 90%-plus usage."

Now our contracts, generally, we make our money on the capacity payment, energy as a pass-through. So for our contract, they have to make us whole if they're not going to use our capacity.

We think it's sort of around $800 million, but this is yet to be negotiated. But basically, this shows, I think, the strength of our contracts in Chile.
