Consumer preference beverage -- consumer beverage preferences and types are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. Net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $8.5 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Net and gross sales for the 3 months ended December 31, 2018, were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 2018, which affected our fourth quarter. The company estimates such impact to net and gross sales was approximately $16 million and $18 million, respectively.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales were $924.2 million, up 14.1% from $810.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 15.1%. Net sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $14.4 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $1.06 billion, up 13.7% from $934.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $16.2 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter was 59.7% compared to 62.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.1% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in input -- certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operation generally has lower gross margins; domestic product sales mix; and the $8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales, due to the adoption of ASC 606.
The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increases in domestic sales process as well as the decrease in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 3.6% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 13.6% in the same quarter in 2017.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 11.9% in the second quarter in 2017. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.2% compared to 7.7% in the same period in 2017. Payroll costs increased $4.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.
Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $13 million in the same quarter in 2017. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $3.1 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 23.1% in the 2018 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. In addition, the compare to 2017 fourth quarter effective tax rate included a onetime provisional charge related to the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, and the onetime charge for the deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was also partially offset by a decrease in the stock-based compensation tax deduction.
Net income was $239.1 million in the 2018 fourth quarter compared to net income of $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of 18.8%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 3 -- from 475 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 556.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 fourth quarter increased 22.7% to $0.43 from $0.55 in the fourth quarter of 2017.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores.
In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are playing further international launches later this year in the EMEA.
We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand in South Africa in the fourth quarter, and plan to launch in certain surrounding countries in the first quarter of 2019.
We're also planning launches of Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. We are now on track to launch Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We're planning to launch Monster in the Dominican Republic and Paraguay in the second quarter of 2019.
In China, we have a limited launch of Monster Ultra Light in the fourth quarter to further appeal to Monster's primary target of young affluent consumers. All those innovations has facilitated expanded shelf space in the targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We are continuing to expand the rollout of Monster after this quarter, and are planning further innovation through the launch of Mango Loco in China during the second quarter of 2019.
We continue to rollout Monster across India, with expansion to top 50 cities. Monster is now selling in approximately 90% of the country, with marketing initiatives now in full swing.
I wanted to take a moment to address an issue previously covered on our last call, and that's our investor presentation in New York in January concerning our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company.
As we reported, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the Energy Drink category with certain exceptions.
Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply to those energy products. As a result, we have a disagreement with Coca-Cola over the interpretation of that exception.
While mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018, and that process is underway with the parties participating cooperatively.
Coca-Cola had indicated that it had suspended the proposed launch of its proposed energy product until April 2019. We cannot predict for certainty when the result of the arbitration will be published, but we reasonably expect a resolution of the issue in the second quarter of 2019. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transhipped to their military and their customers overseas.
In the EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues. Although listed in the 2018 third quarter, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in the number of out of stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing throughout the supply chain and production issues. Certain of our cofactors that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Java Swiss Chocolate, a line extension of our Java Monster family, as an exclusive launch with certain customers and are now in the national launch of Java Swiss Chocolate. Initial results have been positive.
We're currently in the process of launching Ultra Paradise, a line extension in our ultra family as well as Hydro Manic Mellon and Hydro Mean Green in 24-ounce PET bottles. In addition, we are currently launching NOS Sonic Sour, a new flavor in the NOS family as well as rebranding NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch.
We're planning to launch our total body fuel in 6 flavors. We are also planning on launching 2 flavors in our Dragon Tea line in March, namely Green Tea and [indiscernible] We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea as White Tea.
During January 2019, in Canada, we launched 2 additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March of 2019, we are planning on launching 3 flavors of our Cafe Monster line in the 13.7-ounce resealable glass package in Canada.
In Mexico, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton energy drink. Initial results have been positive. We're planning on launching Monster Mango Loco this quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Belgium, Ireland and South Africa. Monster Mango Loco will be widely available across Europe in the first half of 2019. Monster mega was launched in the Adriatics. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in selected accounts in Great Britain. Espresso Monster has also just launched in Germany this month. We are planning to launch our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the first half of 2019.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched [indiscernible] in Russia, BPM Orange 0 in Ireland, Power Play Mango in South Africa and Burn Mango in the Baltics.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a limited launch of Monster Energy Pipeline Punch with the convenience and gas retailer in Australia. In January of 2019, we distributed Monster Energy Pipeline Punch nationally. In the fourth quarter of 2018 in New Zealand, we launched Pipeline Punch and Mango Loco market-wide. We have experienced manufacturing issues related to our Mango Loco product in Australia. We are anticipating that we will be able to resolve these issues and resume products applied to both Australia, New Zealand in the second quarter, and relaunch at retail in the third quarter 2019.
As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are pleased with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotion expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the quarter. We increased in the process of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%.
We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle lines.
We estimate the January 2019 gross sales to be approximately 2.7% higher than January 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 4.6% higher in comparable January 2018 gross sales.
In this regard, we note, and as explained in our fourth quarter 2017 call, that the increase in gross sales of 27.9% in January 2018 as compared to January 2017 ForEx adjusted to 25.1%, [indiscernible] due to the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 by certain of our international distributors. The initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster, which we launched in January 2018, and see more of our innovation in 2017 had a more substantial impact on January 2018 sales than innovation in 2018 has had on our January 2019 sales. No new innovation was launched by in the U.S. in January 2019. This year, our innovation in the U.S. namely Monster Ultra Paradise and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate is being launched nationally this week. And Rain and 2 additional varieties of Monster Dragon Tea will be launched in March. Thus the increase in January 2019 sales over January 2018 sales mentioned above should be evaluated in the context of the above factors that impacted January 2018 sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores; distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $56.99 per share for a total of $536.9 million, excluding broker commissions. Between January 1, 2019, and February 26, 2019, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million, excluding broker commissions.
As of February 26, 2019, approximately 20.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On February 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in light of the earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brand and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plan to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands.

Secondly was our geographic sales mix, where our international sales are increasing as a percentage of our total sales and our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins, as you heard on the call. And the third reason was the domestic product sales mix. So while it was definitely a factor and will continue to be a factor with the different products that the company has launched, in the fourth quarter, it was the third reason and was not the first or the second reason.

We already have an extensive range of product in Monster that appeal to consumers, they have their own outlook and identity. So we just felt that this was the appropriate thing for us to do. This doesn't mean that in the future, depending on this performance category, its longevity and the size that it grows to what, we believe it will expand in the energy category. What it does is how we will look to what we want to do in the Monster range. There is no limitation on us in having line extensions or maybe a subfamily of products in this performance energy range with BCAAs or whatever else we want to do with this sort of a slightly different energy formula -- formulation. And that's something that we're looking at and open to doing. So that doesn't preclude us, we just feel it is better and it does enable us to position the brand differently and give more shelf space. We think that would have been more pressure on our existing shelf space had we simply launch line extensions.  We do have a number of additional line extensions which we are all planning for Monster. We already described a number of them to that we are ready launch. We actually have additional launches and subbranches planned for Monster later in the year.

Consumer preference beverage -- consumer beverage preferences and types are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. Net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $8.5 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Net and gross sales for the 3 months ended December 31, 2018, were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 2018, which affected our fourth quarter. The company estimates such impact to net and gross sales was approximately $16 million and $18 million, respectively.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales were $924.2 million, up 14.1% from $810.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 15.1%. Net sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $14.4 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $1.06 billion, up 13.7% from $934.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $16.2 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter was 59.7% compared to 62.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.1% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in input -- certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins; domestic product sales mix; and the $8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increases in domestic sales prices as well as the decrease in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 3.6% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 13.6% in the same quarter in 2017. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 11.9% in the same quarter in 2017. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.2% compared to 7.7% in the same period in 2017. Payroll costs increased $4.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.
Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $13 million in the same quarter in 2017. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $3.1 million in the quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 23.1% in the 2018 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. In addition, the comparative 2017 fourth quarter effective tax rate included a onetime provisional charge related to the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, and the onetime charge for the deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was also partially offset by a decrease in the stock-based compensation tax deduction.
Net income was $239.1 million in the 2018 fourth quarter compared to net income of $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of 18.8%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 556.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 fourth quarter increased 22.7% to $0.43 from $0.55 in the fourth quarter of 2017.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA.
We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand in South Africa, in the fourth quarter and plan to launch in certain surrounding countries in the first quarter of 2019. We are also planning launches of Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout 2019.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. We are now on track to launch Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We are planning to launch Monster in the Dominican Republic and Paraguay in the second quarter of 2019.
In China, we had a limited launch of Monster Ultra White in the fourth quarter to further appeal to Monster's primary target of young affluent consumers. Ultra's innovation has facilitated expanded shelf space in the targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We are continuing to expand the rollout of Monster all through this quarter and are planning further innovation through the launch of Mango Loco in China during the second quarter of 2019.
We continued the rollout of Monster across India with expansion to top 50 cities. Monster is now selling in approximately 90% of the country with marketing initiatives now in full swing.
I wanted to take a moment to address an issue previously covered on our last call, and that's our investor presentation in New York in January concerning our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we reported, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions.
Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply to those energy products. As a result, we have a disagreement with Coca-Cola over the interpretation of that exception. By mutual agreement, to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018, and that process is underway with the parties participating cooperatively.
Coca-Cola had indicated that it had suspended the proposed launch of its proposed energy product until April 2019. We cannot predict with certainty when the result of the arbitration will be published but reasonably expect a resolution of the issue in the second quarter of 2019. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners.

Sales of our Java Monster alone were 15.5% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 29.2% higher, while our sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 11.7% higher.

Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended January 26, 2019, was 50.1%, down 2.4 points, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 41.9%, down 3.5 points.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending January 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11% to 12.7% in Belgium, from 24.3% to 24.8% in France, from 18.8% to 20.3% in Great Britain, from 7.1% to 7.3% in the Netherlands and from 28.9% to 30.3% in Spain.

Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 15.9% from $736.1 million to $853.3 million from the comparable period in 2017. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $3.2 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.

Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $14.4 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 third quarter, which not only affected our sales but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing throughout the supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity.
In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and increased 23.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.8% in dollars and 28.1% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 42.1% compared to 47.5% in the same quarter in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44.4% for the fourth quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our Strategic Brands in the region.
We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Java Swiss Chocolate, a line extension of our Java Monster family, as an exclusive launch with certain customers and are now in the process of a national launch of Java Swiss Chocolate. Initial results have been positive.
We're currently in the process of launching Ultra Paradise, a line extension in our Ultra family, as well as Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4-ounce PET bottles. In addition, we are currently launching NOS Sonic Sour, a new flavor in the NOS family, as well as rebranding NOS [ Rowdy Punch ] to NOS [ Power Punch ].
In March, we are planning to launch our Reign total body fuel in 6 flavors. We are also planning on launching 2 flavors in our Dragon Tea line in March, namely Green Tea and Yerba Mate. We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line as White Tea.
During January 2019, in Canada, we launched 2 additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March of 2019, we are planning on launching 3 flavors of our Caffe Monster line in the 13.7-ounce resealable glass package in Canada.
In Mexico, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton energy drink. Initial results have been positive. We are planning on launching Monster Mango Loco this quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Belgium, Ireland and South Africa. Monster Mango Loco will be widely available across Europe in the first half of 2019. Monster Mega was launched in the Adriatics. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in selected accounts in Great Britain. Espresso Monster has also just launched in Germany this month. We are planning to launch our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the first half of 2019.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched [ Burn Lemonade ] in Russia, BPM Orange Zero in Ireland, Power Play Mango in South Africa and Burn Mango in the Baltics.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a limited launch of Monster Energy Pipeline Punch with the convenience and gas retailer in Australia. In January of 2019, we distributed Monster Energy Pipeline Punch nationally. In the fourth quarter of 2018 in New Zealand, we launched Pipeline Punch and Mango Loco market-wide. We have experienced manufacturing issues related to our Mango Loco product in Australia. We are anticipating that we will be able to resolve these issues and resume product supply to both Australia and New Zealand in the second quarter and relaunch at retail in the third quarter of 2019.
As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are pleased with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the quarter. We increased in the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle lines.
We estimate the January 2019 gross sales to be approximately 2.7% higher than January 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 4.6% higher in comparable January 2018 gross sales.
In this regard, we note, and as explained on our fourth quarter 2017 call, that the increase in gross sales of 27.9% in January 2018 as compared to January 2017 ForEx adjusted to 25.1% was in part due to the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 by certain of our international distributors; b, initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster, which we launched in January 2018; and c, more of innovation in 2017 had a more substantial impact on January 2018 sales than innovation in 2018 has had on our January 2019 sales.
No new innovation was launched by us in the U.S. in January 2019. This year, our innovation in the U.S., namely Monster Ultra Paradise and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, is being launched nationally this week. And Reign and 2 additional varieties of Monster Dragon Tea will be launched in March. Thus, the increase in January 2019 sales over January 2018 sales mentioned above should be evaluated in the context of the above factors that impacted January 2018 sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $56.99 per share for a total of $536.9 million, excluding broker commissions. Between January 1, 2019, and February 26, 2019, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million, excluding broker commissions.
As of February 26, 2019, approximately $20.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On February 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brand and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plan to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year-end. Thank you."

And what we are also seeing is that Ultra is being accretive. It's not cannibalizing Green, which is also positive for us. And it actually has been well received from a taste profile. So we are quite positive about Ultra and actually very excited about the launch of Mango Loco there, which has got a really attractive can. We think that the 3 products in the black, white and turquoise cans, [indiscernible] cans will start to have a much bigger impact on shelf and give us much more recognition on shelf. So we are continuing to be positive about China and the prospect for increased sales in China."

I think most will get the freight piece. But what we don't see is how much inventory for aluminum you bought in 2018 potentially had much higher prices. So maybe if you could talk a bit about the cadence of that kind of cycling through and when kind of directionally some of that's should lessen. So without actually giving guidance but just in terms of the input, puts and takes to how long before you start seeing lower-priced inventory kind of work through would be helpful."

We, from time to time, execute hedges with our aluminum can companies. And we had some hedges in place for the fourth quarter of last year really to protect ourselves against aluminum going significantly growing up as it had been for most of the year. So that's the picture of aluminum. Aluminum coming down. We are buying at various prices, including one of our hedges hitting in at a higher price than the market price for a portion, not for all but for a portion of our aluminum. So as we head into 2019, aluminum, in our books, will definitely start coming down. But by how much, I really can't say and I'm not at liberty to say. But it will be coming down in 2019."

And you'll notice from the call that, number one was the increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans trading in other input costs. Secondly was our geographic sales mix, where our international sales are increasing as a percentage of our total sales, and our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins, as you heard on the call. And the third reason was the domestic product sales mix. So while it was definitely a factor and will continue to be a factor with the different products that the company has launched, but in the fourth quarter, it was the third reason and was not the first or the second reason. And I'd also like to stop there because when you look at our new products that will be rolled out this year, particularly the new Ultra Paradise and the Reign product, they will all be at the more traditional Monster margins and not at the coffee margins.

And we've made the strategic decision to not, in fact, make Reign a line extension of Monster. It needs to -- we think it should be positioned, have its own positioning, its own marketing, create its own personality. And that, we believe, will give us it its best chance of success. We already have an extensive range of products in Monster that appeal to consumers. They have their own personality and identity. So we just felt that this was the appropriate thing for us to do. This doesn't mean that in the future, depending on this performance category, its longevity and the size that it grows to, what it -- we believe it will expand the energy category, what it does, we will look to what we want to do in the Monster range. There is no limitation on us in having line extensions or maybe a subfamily of products in this performance energy range with BCAAs or whatever else we want to do with sort of a slightly different energy formula -- formulation. And that's something that we're looking at and open to doing. So that doesn't preclude us. We just feel that -- and in fact, it's better and it does enable us to position the brand differently and give more shelf space. We think that it would have been more pressure on our existing shelf space had we simply launched line extensions. And we do have a number of additional line extensions which we are planning for Monster. We already described a number of them to you that are being launched. We actually have additional launches and subbranches planned for Monster later in the year. So we've got quite a full plate for Monster. And you can't do everything under one brand, and that's the reason that we positioned it as we have."

Red Bull obviously has made a strategic decision once we had announced our increase to be aggressive in some of their promotions more so than in previous year and to try and pick up some volume and share, which they have been losing for some time. We've seen that. It doesn't affect us. We've, I think, been successful at what we strategically intended to achieve. And we are not intending to roll back any pricing at this time. We are satisfied with where we've got with pricing, and we think the pricing is fine. And so we don't believe that Red Bull will continue because it's going to hurt their margins. And they won't continue indefinitely, but we can't speculate as to what's in their heads. But whether they do so or not, we don't believe that would be a factor for us of any materiality, quite frankly. And so we're moving forward with our plans."

You know that aluminum's coming down. We've said that freight costs are continuing to increase. You know our geographical sales mix because we've spoken about that.

Consumer preference beverage -- consumer beverage preferences and types are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. Net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $8.5 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Net and gross sales for the 3 months ended December 31, 2018, were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 2018, which affected our fourth quarter. The company estimates such impact to net and gross sales was approximately $16 million and $18 million, respectively.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales were $924.2 million, up 14.1% from $810.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 15.1%. Net sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $14.4 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $1.06 billion, up 13.7% from $934.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $16.2 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter was 59.7% compared to 62.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.1% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in input -- certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins; domestic product sales mix; and the $8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increases in domestic sales prices as well as the decrease in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 3.6% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 13.6% in the same quarter in 2017. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 11.9% in the same quarter in 2017. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.2% compared to 7.7% in the same period in 2017. Payroll costs increased $4.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.
Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $13 million in the same quarter in 2017. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $3.1 million in the quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 23.1% in the 2018 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. In addition, the comparative 2017 fourth quarter effective tax rate included a onetime provisional charge related to the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, and the onetime charge for the deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was also partially offset by a decrease in the stock-based compensation tax deduction.
Net income was $239.1 million in the 2018 fourth quarter compared to net income of $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of 18.8%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 556.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 fourth quarter increased 22.7% to $0.43 from $0.35 in the fourth quarter of 2017.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA.
We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand in South Africa, in the fourth quarter and plan to launch in certain surrounding countries in the first quarter of 2019. We are also planning launches of Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout 2019.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. We are now on track to launch Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We are planning to launch Monster in the Dominican Republic and Paraguay in the second quarter of 2019.
In China, we had a limited launch of Monster Ultra White in the fourth quarter to further appeal to Monster's primary target of young affluent consumers. Ultra's innovation has facilitated expanded shelf space in the targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We are continuing to expand the rollout of Monster all through this quarter and are planning further innovation through the launch of Mango Loco in China during the second quarter of 2019.
We continued the rollout of Monster across India with expansion to the top 50 cities. Monster is now selling in approximately 90% of the country with marketing initiatives now in full swing.
I wanted to take a moment to address an issue previously covered on our last call, and that's our investor presentation in New York in January concerning our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we reported, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions.
Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply to those energy products. As a result, we have a disagreement with Coca-Cola over the interpretation of that exception. By mutual agreement, to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018, and that process is underway with the parties participating cooperatively.
Coca-Cola had indicated that it had suspended the proposed launch of its proposed energy products until April 2019. We cannot predict with certainty when the result of the arbitration will be published but reasonably expect a resolution of the issue in the second quarter of 2019. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners.

Sales of our Java Monster alone were 15.5% higher than in the same period the previous year.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2019, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 11% to 12.7% in Belgium, from 24.3% to 24.8% in France, from 18.8% to 20.3% in Great Britain, from 7.1% to 7.3% in the Netherlands and from 28.9% to 30.3% in Spain.

Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 15.9% from $736.1 million to $853.3 million from the comparable period in 2017. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $3.2 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 16.4%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $12.4 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $65.8 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $69.6 million in the same quarter in 2017. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $274.3 million in the 2018 fourth quarter compared to $210.4 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $14.4 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 third quarter, which not only affected our sales but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing throughout these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity.
In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and increased 23.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.8% in dollars and 28.1% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 42.1% compared to 47.5% in the same quarter in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44.4% for the fourth quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our Strategic Brands in the region.
We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 68.4% in dollars and 73.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2017.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $320.7 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017.
Net accounts receivable increased to $484.6 million at December 31, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 41.4 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $277.7 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 67.2 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Java Swiss Chocolate, a line extension of our Java Monster family, as an exclusive launch with certain customers and are now in the process of a national launch of Java Swiss Chocolate. Initial results have been positive.
We're currently in the process of launching Ultra Paradise, a line extension in our Ultra family, as well as Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4-ounce PET bottles. In addition, we are currently launching NOS Sonic Sour, a new flavor in the NOS family, as well as rebranding NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch.
In March, we are planning to launch our Reign total body fuel in 6 flavors. We are also planning on launching 2 flavors in our Dragon Tea line in March, namely Green Tea and Yerba Mate. We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line as White Tea.
During January 2019, in Canada, we launched 2 additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March of 2019, we are planning on launching 3 flavors of our Caffe Monster line in the 13.7-ounce resealable glass package in Canada.
In Mexico, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton energy drink. Initial results have been positive. We are planning on launching Monster Mango Loco this quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Belgium, Ireland and South Africa. Monster Mango Loco will be widely available across Europe in the first half of 2019. Monster Mega was launched in the Adriatics. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in selected accounts in Great Britain. Espresso Monster has also just launched in Germany this month. We are planning to launch our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the first half of 2019.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Burn Lemonade in Russia, BPM Orange Zero in Ireland, Power Play Mango in South Africa and Burn Mango in the Baltics.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a limited launch of Monster Energy Pipeline Punch with the convenience and gas retailer in Australia. In January of 2019, we distributed Monster Energy Pipeline Punch nationally. In the fourth quarter of 2018 in New Zealand, we launched Pipeline Punch and Mango Loco market-wide. We have experienced manufacturing issues related to our Mango Loco product in Australia. We are anticipating that we will be able to resolve these issues and resume product supply to both Australia and New Zealand in the second quarter and relaunch at retail in the third quarter of 2019.
As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are pleased with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the quarter. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle lines.
We estimate the January 2019 gross sales to be approximately 2.7% higher than January 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 4.6% higher than comparable January 2018 gross sales.
In this regard, we note, and as explained on our fourth quarter 2017 call, that the increase in gross sales of 27.9% in January 2018 as compared to January 2017, ForEx adjusted to 25.1% was in part due to the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 by certain of our international distributors; b, initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster, which we launched in January 2018; and c, more of our innovation in 2017 had a more substantial impact on January 2018 sales than innovation in 2018 has had on our January 2019 sales.
No new innovation was launched by us in the U.S. in January 2019. This year, our innovation in the U.S., namely Monster Ultra Paradise and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, is being launched nationally this week. And Reign and 2 additional varieties of Monster Dragon Tea will be launched in March. Thus, the increase in January 2019 sales over January 2018 sales mentioned above should be evaluated in the context of the above factors that impacted January 2018 sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $56.99 per share for a total of $536.9 million, excluding broker commissions. Between January 1, 2019, and February 26, 2019, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million, excluding broker commissions.
As of February 26, 2019, approximately $20.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On February 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brand and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year-end. Thank you."

And we had some hedges in place for the fourth quarter of last year really to protect ourselves against aluminum going significantly up as it had been for most of the year. So that's the picture of aluminum. Aluminum coming down. We are buying at various prices, including one of our hedges hitting in at a higher price than the market price for a portion, not for all but for a portion of our aluminum. So as we head into 2019, aluminum, in our books, will definitely start coming down. But by how much, I really can't say and I'm not at liberty to say. But it will be coming down in 2019."

And you'll notice from the call that, number one was the increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freighting and other input costs. Secondly was our geographic sales mix, where our international sales are increasing as a percentage of our total sales, and our foreign operations generally have lower growth margins, as you heard on the call. And the third reason was the domestic product sales mix. So while it was definitely a factor and will continue to be a factor with the different products that the company has launched, but in the fourth quarter, it was the third reason and was not the first or the second reason. And I'd also like to stop there because when you look at our new products that will be rolled out this year, particularly the new Ultra Paradise and the Reign product, they will all be at the more traditional Monster margins and not at the coffee margins. So they will be higher than the coffee margins."

And we've made the strategic decision to not, in fact, make Reign a line extension of Monster. It needs to -- we think it should be positioned, have its own positioning, its own marketing, create its own personality. And that, we believe, will give it its best chance of success. We already have an extensive range of products in Monster that appeal to consumers. They have their own personality and identity. So we just felt that this was the appropriate thing for us to do. This doesn't mean that in the future, depending on this performance category, its longevity and the size that it grows to, and what it -- we believe it will expand the energy category, what it does, we will look to what we want to do in the Monster range. There is no limitation on us in having line extensions or maybe a subfamily of products in this performance energy range with BCAAs or whatever else we want to do with sort of a slightly different energy formula -- formulation. And that's something that we're looking at and open to doing. So that doesn't preclude us. We just feel that -- and in fact, it's better and it does enable us to position the brand differently and give more shelf space. We think that it would have been more pressure on our existing shelf space had we simply launched line extensions. And we do have a number of additional line extensions which we are planning for Monster. We've already -- I've described a number of them to you that are being launched. We actually have additional launches and subbranches planned for Monster later in the year. So we've got quite a full plate for Monster. And you can't do everything under one brand, and that's the reason that we positioned it as we have."

Red Bull obviously has made a strategic decision once we had announced our increase to be aggressive in some of their promotions, more so than in previous year and to try and pick up some volume and share, which they had been losing for some time. We've seen that. It doesn't affect us. We've, I think, been successful at what we strategically intended to achieve. And we are not intending to roll back any pricing at this time. We are satisfied with where we've got with pricing, and we think the pricing is fine. And so we don't believe that Red Bull will continue because it's going to hurt their margins. And they won't continue indefinitely, but we can't speculate as to what's in their heads. But whether they do so or not, we don't believe that would be a factor for us of any materiality, quite frankly. And so we're moving forward with our plans."

So if you look at the pricing and the 4% that we implemented, the objective was to get pretty close to where Red Bull had their product priced in the market. And obviously, we're only talking about the U.S. And then on your other points on gross margin, Kevin, I don't have to give you guidance because we don't give guidance. But you've got all the facts. You know that aluminum's coming down. We've said that freight costs are continuing to increase. You know our geographical sales mix because we've spoken about that.

Consumer preference beverage -- consumer beverage preferences and types are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. Net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $8.5 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.
Net and gross sales for the 3 months ended December 31, 2018, were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 2018, which affected our fourth quarter. The company estimates such impact to net and gross sales was approximately $16 million and $18 million, respectively.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales were $924.2 million, up 14.1% from $810.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 15.1%. Net sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $14.4 million of foreign currency movements.
The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $1.06 billion, up 13.7% from $934.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $16.2 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter was 59.7% compared to 62.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.1% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in input -- certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins; domestic product sales mix; and the $8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increases in domestic sales prices as well as the decrease in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 3.6% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 13.6% in the same quarter in 2017. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 11.9% in the same quarter in 2017. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.2% compared to 7.7% in the same period in 2017. Payroll costs increased $4.9 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally.
Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $13 million in the same quarter in 2017. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $3.1 million in the quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 23.1% in the 2018 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. In addition, the comparative 2017 fourth quarter effective tax rate included a onetime provisional charge related to the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, and the onetime charge for the deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was also partially offset by a decrease in the stock-based compensation tax deduction.
Net income was $239.1 million in the 2018 fourth quarter compared to net income of $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of 18.8%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 556.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 fourth quarter increased 22.7% to $0.43 from $0.35 in the fourth quarter of 2017.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA.
We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand in South Africa, in the fourth quarter and plan to launch in certain surrounding countries in the first quarter of 2019. We are also planning launches of Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout 2019.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. We are now on track to launch Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We are planning to launch Monster in the Dominican Republic and Paraguay in the second quarter of 2019.
In China, we had a limited launch of Monster Ultra White in the fourth quarter to further appeal to Monster's primary target of young affluent consumers. Ultra's innovation has facilitated expanded shelf space in the targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We are continuing to expand the rollout of Monster all through this quarter and are planning further innovation through the launch of Mango Loco in China during the second quarter of 2019.
We continued the rollout of Monster across India with expansion to the top 50 cities. Monster is now selling in approximately 90% of the country with marketing initiatives now in full swing.
I wanted to take a moment to address an issue previously covered on our last call, and that's our investor presentation in New York in January concerning our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we reported, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions.
Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply to those energy products. As a result, we have a disagreement with Coca-Cola over the interpretation of that exception. By mutual agreement, to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018, and that process is underway with the parties participating cooperatively.
Coca-Cola had indicated that it had suspended the proposed launch of its proposed energy products until April 2019. We cannot predict with certainty when the result of the arbitration will be published but reasonably expect a resolution of the issue in the second quarter of 2019. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners.
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through January 26, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 11.3% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended January 26, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 21% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 15.5% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 29.2% higher, while our sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 11.7% higher. Our company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted for the 4 weeks ended January 26, 2019, was 58%, up 3.7 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended January 26, 2019, was 50.1%, down 2.4 points, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 41.9%, down 3.5 points.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended February 2, 2019, the Energy Drink category increased 7% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 13% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 2.1 share points to 34.5%. NOS' sales increased 1%, and its market share decreased 0.1 share points to 3%.

Our market share in value decreased 1.3 points to 30.5% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 18.6%. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 points to 1.2%.

Vault's sales increased 59.9%, and its market share increased 4.1 share points to 14%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.2 points to 11.6%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 15.9% from $736.1 million to $853.3 million from the comparable period in 2017. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $3.2 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 16.4%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $12.4 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $65.8 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $69.6 million in the same quarter in 2017. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.

Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.1 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $4.7 million in the same quarter in 2017.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $274.3 million in the 2018 fourth quarter compared to $210.4 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $14.4 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 third quarter, which not only affected our sales but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing throughout these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity.
In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and increased 23.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.8% in dollars and 28.1% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 42.1% compared to 47.5% in the same quarter in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44.4% for the fourth quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our Strategic Brands in the region.
We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 68.4% in dollars and 73.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 70% in dollars and 75.1% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 46.1%. This is 32.4% over the same period in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 46.6%.

Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.3%.
Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 30.3% in dollars and 58.7% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 48.6% in dollars and 60.9% in local currency in the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $320.7 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017.
Net accounts receivable increased to $484.6 million at December 31, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 41.4 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $277.7 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 67.2 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Java Swiss Chocolate, a line extension of our Java Monster family, as an exclusive launch with certain customers and are now in the process of a national launch of Java Swiss Chocolate. Initial results have been positive.
We're currently in the process of launching Ultra Paradise, a line extension in our Ultra family, as well as Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4-ounce PET bottles. In addition, we are currently launching NOS Sonic Sour, a new flavor in the NOS family, as well as rebranding NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch.
In March, we are planning to launch our Reign total body fuel in 6 flavors. We are also planning on launching 2 flavors in our Dragon Tea line in March, namely Green Tea and Yerba Mate. We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line as White Tea.
During January 2019, in Canada, we launched 2 additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March of 2019, we are planning on launching 3 flavors of our Caffe Monster line in the 13.7-ounce resealable glass package in Canada.
In Mexico, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton energy drink. Initial results have been positive. We are planning on launching Monster Mango Loco this quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Belgium, Ireland and South Africa. Monster Mango Loco will be widely available across Europe in the first half of 2019. Monster Mega was launched in the Adriatics. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in selected accounts in Great Britain. Espresso Monster has also just launched in Germany this month. We are planning to launch our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the first half of 2019.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Burn Lemonade in Russia, BPM Orange Zero in Ireland, Power Play Mango in South Africa and Burn Mango in the Baltics.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a limited launch of Monster Energy Pipeline Punch with the convenience and gas retailer in Australia. In January of 2019, we distributed Monster Energy Pipeline Punch nationally. In the fourth quarter of 2018 in New Zealand, we launched Pipeline Punch and Mango Loco market-wide. We have experienced manufacturing issues related to our Mango Loco product in Australia. We are anticipating that we will be able to resolve these issues and resume product supply to both Australia and New Zealand in the second quarter and relaunch at retail in the third quarter of 2019.
As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are pleased with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the quarter. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle lines.
We estimate the January 2019 gross sales to be approximately 2.7% higher than January 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 4.6% higher than comparable January 2018 gross sales.
In this regard, we note, and as explained on our fourth quarter 2017 call, that the increase in gross sales of 27.9% in January 2018 as compared to January 2017, ForEx adjusted to 25.1% was in part due to the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 by certain of our international distributors; b, initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster, which we launched in January 2018; and c, more of our innovation in 2017 had a more substantial impact on January 2018 sales than innovation in 2018 has had on our January 2019 sales.
No new innovation was launched by us in the U.S. in January 2019. This year, our innovation in the U.S., namely Monster Ultra Paradise and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, is being launched nationally this week. And Reign and 2 additional varieties of Monster Dragon Tea will be launched in March. Thus, the increase in January 2019 sales over January 2018 sales mentioned above should be evaluated in the context of the above factors that impacted January 2018 sales.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2018 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $56.99 per share for a total of $536.9 million, excluding broker commissions. Between January 1, 2019, and February 26, 2019, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million, excluding broker commissions.
As of February 26, 2019, approximately $20.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On February 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brand and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year-end. Thank you."

We are buying at various prices, including one of our hedges hitting in at a higher price than the market price for a portion, not for all but for a portion of our aluminum.

And you'll notice from the call that, number one was the increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freighting and other input costs. Secondly was our geographic sales mix, where our international sales are increasing as a percentage of our total sales, and our foreign operations generally have lower growth margins, as you heard on the call. And the third reason was the domestic product sales mix. So while it was definitely a factor and will continue to be a factor with the different products that the company has launched, but in the fourth quarter, it was the third reason and was not the first or the second reason. And I'd also like to stop there because when you look at our new products that will be rolled out this year, particularly the new Ultra Paradise and the Reign product, they will all be at the more traditional Monster margins and not at the coffee margins. So they will be higher than the coffee margins."

And we've made the strategic decision to not, in fact, make Reign a line extension of Monster. It needs to -- we think it should be positioned, have its own positioning, its own marketing, create its own personality. And that, we believe, will give it its best chance of success. We already have an extensive range of products in Monster that appeal to consumers. They have their own personality and identity. So we just felt that this was the appropriate thing for us to do. This doesn't mean that in the future, depending on this performance category, its longevity and the size that it grows to, and what it -- we believe it will expand the energy category, what it does, we will look to what we want to do in the Monster range. There is no limitation on us in having line extensions or maybe a subfamily of products in this performance energy range with BCAAs or whatever else we want to do with sort of a slightly different energy formula -- formulation. And that's something that we're looking at and open to doing. So that doesn't preclude us. We just feel that -- and in fact, it's better and it does enable us to position the brand differently and give more shelf space. We think that it would have been more pressure on our existing shelf space had we simply launched line extensions. And we do have a number of additional line extensions which we are planning for Monster. We've already -- I've described a number of them to you that are being launched. We actually have additional launches and subbranches planned for Monster later in the year. So we've got quite a full plate for Monster. And you can't do everything under one brand, and that's the reason that we positioned it as we have."

Red Bull obviously has made a strategic decision once we had announced our increase to be aggressive in some of their promotions, more so than in previous year and to try and pick up some volume and share, which they had been losing for some time. We've seen that. It doesn't affect us. We've, I think, been successful at what we strategically intended to achieve. And we are not intending to roll back any pricing at this time. We are satisfied with where we've got with pricing, and we think the pricing is fine. And so we don't believe that Red Bull will continue because it's going to hurt their margins. And they won't continue indefinitely, but we can't speculate as to what's in their heads. But whether they do so or not, we don't believe that would be a factor for us of any materiality, quite frankly. And so we're moving forward with our plans."

So if you look at the pricing and the 4% that we implemented, the objective was to get pretty close to where Red Bull had their product priced in the market. And obviously, we're only talking about the U.S. And then on your other points on gross margin, Kevin, I don't have to give you guidance because we don't give guidance. But you've got all the facts. You know that aluminum's coming down. We've said that freight costs are continuing to increase. You know our geographical sales mix because we've spoken about that.

Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the first quarter of 2019, net sales were $946 million, up 11.2% from $850.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 16.6% compared to 3 months ended March 31, 2019 on March 31, 2010. For the quarter ended March 21, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our product sold in North America, and to a lesser extent, product sales mix.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical sales mix and increases in certain input costs. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 3.8% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 3.9% in the 2018 first quarter.
Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 11.5% in the same quarter in 2010. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 12.9% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 12.3% in the same quarter in 2018.
In the quarter, payroll expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 7.7% compared to 7.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $8.6 million, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes.
Stock-based compensation, this is a noncash item, was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.4 million in the same quarter of 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter to 16.8% in the 2019 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the deductions for equity compensation as well as the increasing profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than in United States.
Net income was $261.5 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to net income of $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 first quarter increased 26.7% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. In March 2019, we agreed to the assignment of the Coca-Cola Bottlers group's distribution to Coke's Bottlers in the southwestern United States.
We incurred no distributed admission costs and received no deferred revenue connection with this assignment. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from which is a New York metro markets to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to old Coca-Cola network bottlers.
In the second quarter 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in and Saudi Arabia. we are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand in the in the first quarter of 2019. We're also planning launches of Predator in certain markets in Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2019 as well as in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019.
We launched Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We also launched Monster in Paraguay last week, and anticipate launching in the in the second quarter.
In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we also began the launch of Monster Mango, which will continue throughout the second quarter of 2019. We're significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts.
We continue the rollout of Monster across India, and Monster is now available in approximately 90% of the country. We are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019.
I'll now provide a quick update on our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we stated, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category, with certain exceptions, including an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy drink product that it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand.
We believe that the exception does not apply. By mutual agreement, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018 for the determination of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market and distribute these products. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing on the bodies agreed 2 months ago. Once we expect a decision from the arbitrators before the end of the second quarter. Although Coca-Cola has announced this proceeding to launch new energy drinks in certain countries without waiting for the arbitration panel to rule on the issue, Coca-Cola to continue to sell such things will be governed by the outcome of the arbitration.
We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners. I also wanted to take a moment to address a matter that has received some attention. Monster's litigation with Inc. BPH, the maker of energy drinks. Monster losses against in September 2018 for false advertising, including false and unsupported claims that contains ingredients that it does not have and provide benefit that it does not generate.
BPH has continually attempted to delay are also. In April, we filed a margin for preliminary injunction, which is for hearing in June 2019. In March 2019, BPH filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster. I have 2 comments to make. Firstly, the lawsuit is meritless. Months after months the publicly announced launch of Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in mid January 2019, a company related to be allegedly purchased an unrelated Reign trademark for a different of products, namely dietary supplements.
Monster holds trademark and use priority over for its Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in the clause that covers these beverages. We recently applied to complaint with set for our opposition in detail, and asserts contemplate us against BP ask with trademarking infringement and unfair competition.
Secondly, this lawsuit will not impede or slow the launch Reign Total Body Fuel. As our litigation with and the and the arbitration with Coca-Cola are we will not be answering questions on these matters on the call.

In view of the recent launch of Reign, we're giving you an update on its performance. According to the Nielsen, for the 1-week ended April 20, 2019, in the convenience and gas channel, Reign's market share in dollars for the one-week is already 2.5%, while market share in dollars and that week is 8.3%.

sales increased 75.6% and its market share increased 6.1 share points to 16.8%, while market share decreased 0.6 points to 7.7%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period, that may also be materially influence positively and/or negatively by sales in convenience chain, which dominates the market.
Sales in the convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions. It maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, subsectors of these could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11.5% to 13.2% in Belgium, from 25.6% to 26.4% in France, from 16% to 17.2% in Germany, from 18.7% to 20% in Brazil, from 7% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 16.3% to 18.8% in Norway, from 8.3% to 12.4% in Poland, from 15.6% to 16.3% in South Africa, from 29.3% to 30.3% in Spain, and from 12% to 13.2% in Sweden.

In the EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 fourth quarter. It not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out of stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in the EMEA.

We have launched Monster Energy out of line extension in our Monster Ultra family in February 2019 as well 2 -- an additional 2 flavors of Hydro and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4 ounce of bottles. In addition, we booked out the last family in the quarter with the launch of NOS Sonic Sour and the re-branding of NOS Punch to NOS Power Punch. We also extended the Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, lead launch from 2018 to all customers in February 2019 and added 2 flavors in our Dragon Tea line, green tea and Yerba Mate, which launched in March.
We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea including the new Monster Dragon Tea line. Finally, in March, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in 6 flavors, initial results have been positive. During January 2019 in Canada, we launched 2 additional line extensions of Monster Hydro and Purple Fashion and Zero Sugar as well as Monster White Dragon Tea.

Monster Mango Loco will be launched in another 12 EMEA markets in the second quarter 2019. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Ireland.
We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in Germany and Spain. We are planning to continue to rollout of our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the second quarter of 2019. We launched Black Monster Ultra in Russia in the first quarter of 2019 and continued the rollout of additional SKUs in the Monster ultra range in EMEA markets, specifically in Monster ultra blue and gray Brazil in Ireland and Monster Ultra Violet in the Baltics in the first quarter of 2019.
There is SKUs in the Monster Ultra line 39 EMEA markets. In Australia, we successfully launched the new flavor across in February with good initial results. We launched Monster Mango in China in March and continue with our rollout of Monster Ultra. We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year. As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our used customers effective November 1, 2018.
We are satisfied with the initial results for the implementation of this price increase. For Monster expenses as percentage of gross sales decreased in the first quarter of 2019. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%.
We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for the Monster Energy NOS and Full Throttle lines. We estimate April 2019 gross sales to be approximately 15.6% higher than in April 2018. On of foreign currency-adjusted basis, April  2019 gross sales would have been approximately 18.9% higher than comparable April 2018 gross sales. It was one more selling day in April 2019 than in April 2018.
In this regard, we cautioned the guiding that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and for promotional retail stores. Distributing incentives as well as shift in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the day which we such bottlers as very inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
During the 2019 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of 54.18 per share for a total of $139 million, excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2019, approximately $520.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously-authorized repurchase program.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize a recent positive points. One, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods.
Two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company sales. Three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Four, in particular, initial results for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, which launched in March are positive and we are encouraged by the prospect for this line.
Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we're continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain new markets. Seven, we're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally and also evaluating the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in countries outside of the U.S.A. in the second half of 2019.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And then depending on the response we get. In some countries, we get really good response to Ultra. We then change the track and basically start to launch more of the Ultra product and perhaps some years ago, we were launching more of the juice product. And so the order is changed a little bit. Mango has got very well received. Popcorn is being very well received And so we really elevated those SKUs, basically looking in some countries. There are some countries where we are finding directly there is a good reception to our Rehab line. Now Rehab, it may not go into that it may go in the form a tea likers. Rehab has less meaning in foreign countries than it has in the U.S. because of the -- the origin of Rehab. But there is some opportunities for tea line in some countries and we are looking at that into noncore. And as you've been seen, we have taken the step also some testing to look at coffee. In Europe, we think that market is -- we're going to expand that market with Espresso. And we're also looking at some other potential coffee products into the U.K. market. Again, looking at shelves and keeping abreast of growth and innovation. In those markets, we do see good opportunities for that. And once we look at that, and again, reach the right progression in other countries, we will look at other growth opportunities in -- but we're going to follow our policy of looking at it country-by-country as we have launched in the country as the bottle is able to handle it and we feel it's right to continue to grow. That we'll continue to build out over years -- our portfolio is going to continue to grow -- continue to build out internationally. In the U.S., while we've launched -- we believe there is -- the energy shelf is pretty impacted at the moment. So we're looking to get new space for this high-performance category incremental. In some cases, in order to -- because of timing and because of reset, in order to get products on shelf, it has been put on to the energy shelf. But in many cases, we are achieving additional space and we also have -- we believe most of the retailers are agreed that there should be additional space allocated to this high-performance category.

Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the first quarter of 2019, net sales were $946 million, up 11.2% from $850.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 60.6% compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2018. For the quarter ended March 21, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in North America and, to a lesser extent, product sales mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical sales mix and increases in certain input costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.8% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 3.9% in the 2018 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 11.5% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 12.3% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.7% compared to 7.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $8.6 million in dollars, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes.
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter to 16.8% in the 2019 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the deductions for equity compensation as well as the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the United States.
Net income was $261.5 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to net income of $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 first quarter increased 26.7% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. In March 2019, we agreed to the assignment of the Kalil Bottling Group's distribution territories to Coca-Cola Bottlers in the southwestern United States.
We incurred no distributed termination costs and received no deferred revenue in connection with this assignment. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in New York metro markets, to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to old Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA.
We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand, in Namibia and Mozambique in the first quarter of 2019. We're also planning launches of Predator in certain markets in Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2019 as well as in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019. We launched Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We also launched Monster in Paraguay last week and anticipate launching in the Dominican Republic in the second quarter.
In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we also began the launch of Monster Mango, which we'll continue throughout the second quarter of 2019. We've significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and Monster is now available in approximately 90% of the country. We are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019.
I will now provide a quick update on our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we've stated, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions, including an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy drink product that it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply.
By mutual agreement, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018 for a determination of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute these products. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing. On the schedule, the bodies agreed 2 months ago. Monster expects a decision from the arbitrators before the end of the second quarter. Although Coca-Cola has announced it is proceeding to launch its new energy drinks in certain countries without waiting for the arbitration panel to rule on the issue, Coca-Cola's entitlement to continue to sell such drinks will be governed by the outcome of the arbitration. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate to work together as partners.
I also wanted to take a moment to address a matter that has received some attention, Monster's litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising, including false and unsupported claims, that Bang contains ingredients that it does not have and provides benefit that it does not generate. VPX has continually attempted to delay our lawsuit. In April, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which is scheduled for hearing in June 2019.
In March 2019, VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster. I have 2 comments to make. Firstly, the lawsuit is meritless. Months after Monster publicly announced the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in mid January 2019, a company related to VPX allegedly purchased an unrelated Reign trademark for a different class of products, namely powdered dietary supplements. Monster holds trademark and use priority over VPX for its Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in the clause that covers these beverages.
We recently filed a reply to VPX's complaint which sets forth our opposition in detail and asserts counterclaims against VPX for trademark infringement and unfair competition. Secondly, this lawsuit will not impede or slow the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel. As our litigation with VPX and the arbitration with Coca-Cola are [ subjudicate ], we will not be answering questions on these matters on the call.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 20, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.8% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars decreased by 4 points over the same period the previous year to 34.1%. NOS' share declined 0.5 share points to 3.7%, and Full Throttle's share declined 0.2 points to 0.8%. Red Bull's share decreased 0.7 of a point to 33.9%, Rockstar share was down 1.5 points to 5.5%, 5-Hour share was lower by 1.1 points at 5.7%, and Amp share decreased 0.4 of a point to 0.4%. VPX Bang's share is 8.3% and Reign's share is 1.7%.
In view of the recent launch of Reign, we are giving an update on its performance. According to Nielsen, for the 1-week ended April 20, 2019, in the convenience and gas channel, Reign's market share in dollars for the one-week is already 2.5%, while Bang's market share in dollars in that week is 8.3%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, sales of coffee plus the energy drinks, which now includes Caffé Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 9.1% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 1.3% higher, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 9.3% higher.
Our company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffé Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 53.5%, down 3.5 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 47.3%, up 0.5 of a point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 43.4%, up 0.6 of a point.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 11.5% during the month of March 2019. Monster sales increased 13%. Our market share in value increased 0.4 points to 29.1% against the comparable period of previous year. Sales of Burn were down 30%. Burn's market share decreased 0.7 points to 1.2%. Red Bull's sales decreased 7.3% as market share decreased by 1.9 points to 9.4%. Vive 100 sales increased 2.4% and its market share decreased 3 points to 34.2%.
Vault's sales increased 75.6% and its market share increased 6.1 share points to 16.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.6 points to 7.7%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11.5% to 13.2% in Belgium, from 25.6% to 26.4% in France, from 16% to 17.2% in Germany, from 18.7% to 20% in Great Britain, from 7% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 16.3% to 18.8% in Norway, from 8.3% to 12.4% in Poland, from 15.6% to 16.3% in South Africa, from 29.3% to 30.3% in Spain, and from 12% to 13.2% in Sweden.

According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2019 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 34.4% to 35.9% compared to the same period the previous year.
According to Nielsen in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of February increased from 13.5% to 20.2% as compared to the same period the previous year. We launched Monster Energy in Argentina in mid-February 2018.

According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ending April 7, 2019, increased from 8.5% to 8.8% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.3% to 12.9% during the same period. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ending March 24, 2019, increased from 6% to 7.9% as compared to the same period the previous year.

According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel grew from 47.9% in the 2018 first quarter to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2019. We again point out that in certain market, statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions and/or other trading factors during those months.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $284.1 million, 30% of total net sales in the 2019 first quarter from $242.1 million which was 28.5% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $22 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 fourth quarter, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing through these supply chain and production issues.
Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity. In EMEA, net sales in the first quarter increased 12.5% in dollars and increased 22.3% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 43.2% compared to 44.5% in the same quarter in 2018.
Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our Strategic Brands in the region. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.

Inventories increased to $300.8 million at March 31, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 72.7 days at March 31, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018.
We have successfully launched Monster Energy Ultra Paradise, a line extension in our Monster Ultra family in February 2019 as well as 2 -- an additional 2 flavors of Hydro, Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green, in 25.4 ounce PET bottles. In addition, we brought out the NOS family in the quarter with the launch of NOS Sonic Sour and the rebranding of NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch. We also extended the Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, lead launch from 2018, to all customers in February 2019 and added 2 flavors in our Dragon Tea line, Green Tea and Yerba Mate, which launched in March.
We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line. Finally, in March, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in 6 flavors. Initial results have been positive. During January 2019 in Canada, we launched 2 additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March, we launched our Caffé Monster line in 13.7-ounce resealable glass packages.
In Mexico, we launched Mango Loco in April 2019. During the first quarter of 2019, we launched Pacific Punch in the Caribbean and extended our range in Puerto Rico. In Chile, during the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Absolutely Zero. In Argentina, we launched Monster Ultra. Initial results have been positive. In the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and the Baltics. Monster Mango Loco will be launched in another 12 EMEA markets in the second quarter of 2019. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Ireland.
We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in Germany and Spain. We are planning to continue the rollout of our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the second quarter of 2019. We launched Black Monster Ultra in Russia in the first quarter of 2019 and continued the rollout of additional SKUs in the Monster Ultra range in EMEA markets, specifically Monster Ultra Blue in Great Britain and Ireland and Monster Ultra Violet in the Baltics in the first quarter of 2019. Various SKUs in the Monster Ultra line are now sold in 39 EMEA markets.
In Australia, we successfully launched a new Mother flavor, Tropical Blast, in February with good initial results. We launched Monster Mango in China in March and continue with our rollout of Monster Ultra. We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year. As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are satisfied with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the first quarter of 2019. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%.
We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for the Monster Energy NOS and Full Throttle lines. We estimate April 2019 gross sales to be approximately 15.6% higher than in April 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April  2019 gross sales would have been approximately 18.9% higher than comparable April 2018 gross sales. There was one more selling day in April 2019 than in April 2018.
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2019 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million, excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2019, approximately 520.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Four, in particular initial results for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, which launched in March, are positive, and we are encouraged by the prospects for this line.
Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we're continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. Seven, we're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally and also evaluating the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in countries outside of the U.S.A. in the second half of 2019.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

We obviously try and launch with Monster Green to establish the Monster brand because that's what it stands for. But from then on, we look at the individual countries, the flavor preferences, and you'll find that our second and third SKU in many countries differ from country-to-country. And then depending on the response we get, in some countries, we've had really good response to Ultra, we then change the track and basically start to launch more of the Ultra products. And perhaps some years ago, we were launching more of the juice product. And so the order has changed a little bit.
Mango has got very well received. Power Punch has been very well received in some instance that we really elevated those SKUs basically looking in some countries. There are some countries where we are finding directly there is a good reception to our Rehab line. Now Rehab, it may not go into that form. It may go in the form of a tea line, because Rehab has less meaning in foreign countries than it has in the U.S. because of the origin of Rehab. But there is some opportunities for tea lines in some countries, and we are looking at that into noncore. And as you then see, we have taken the step, offer some testing to look at coffee.
In Europe, we think that market is -- we're going to expand that market with Espresso. And we are also looking at some other potential coffee products into the U.K. market. Again, looking at shelves and keeping abreast of growth and innovation. In those markets, we do see good opportunity for that. And once we look at that and again reach the right progression in other countries, we will look at other growth opportunities in -- but we're going to follow our policy of looking at it country-by-country as we have launched in the country, as the bottler is able to handle it and we feel it's right to continue to grow. Then we'll continue to build out over years -- our portfolio is going to continue to grow -- continue to build out internationally.
In the U.S., while we've launched and we believe there is -- the energy shelf is pretty impacted at the moment. So we're looking to get new space for this high-performance category incremental. In some cases, in order to -- because of timing and because of resets, in order to get products on shelf, it has been put on to the energy shelf. But in many cases, we are achieving additional space, and we also have -- we believe most of the retailers are agreed that there should be additional space allocated to this high-performance category. It is a profitable category for the retailers. It's hiring. And so we believe we will see additional space being allocated to energy basically to accommodate the new high-performance products that we believe we will end up with -- overall end up with increased shelf space."

That's a great result just after 6 weeks, especially as you are roughly in just half of the stores Bang is available by your count. So do you have any qualitative feedback at least from retailers in term of sales, especially in stores that sell both Bang and Reign that you could share with us, that would be helpful."

But we do -- the numbers we are seeing out of the top change is showing a higher -- as I said a higher comparable number, which is positive for us. And I think we just got to be a bit patient and wait for the numbers to start coming through generally. And then we'll start seeing the south point as well as the distribution overall."

Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the first quarter of 2019, net sales were $946 million, up 11.2% from $850.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 60.6% compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2018. For the quarter ended March 31, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in North America and, to a lesser extent, product sales mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical sales mix and increases in certain input costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.8% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 3.9% in the 2018 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 11.5% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 12.3% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.7% compared to 7.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $8.6 million in dollars, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes.
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter to 16.8% in the 2019 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the deductions for equity compensation as well as the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower-tax jurisdictions than the United States.
Net income was $261.5 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to net income of $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 first quarter increased 26.7% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018. 
We continue to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. In March 2019, we agreed to the assignment of the Kalil Bottling Group's distribution territories to Coca-Cola Bottlers in the southwestern United States. We incurred no distributor termination costs and received no deferred revenue in connection with this assignment. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy Drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in the New York metro markets, to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to all Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA.
We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand, in Namibia and Mozambique in the first quarter of 2019. We're also planning launches of Predator in certain markets in Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2019 as well as in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019. We launched Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We also launched Monster in Paraguay last week and anticipate launching in the Dominican Republic in the second quarter.
In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we also began the launch of Monster Mango, which we'll continue throughout the second quarter of 2019. We've significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India, and Monster is now available in approximately 90% of the country. We are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019.
I will now provide a quick update on our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we've stated, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions, including an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy drink products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply.
By mutual agreement, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018 for a determination of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute these products. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing on the schedule the parties agreed 2 months ago. Monster expects a decision from the arbitrators before the end of the second quarter. Although Coca-Cola has announced it is proceeding to launch its new energy drinks in certain countries without waiting for the arbitration panel to rule on the issue, Coca-Cola's entitlement to continue to sell such drinks will be governed by the outcome of the arbitration. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate to work together as partners.
I also wanted to take a moment to address a matter that has received some attention, Monster's litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising, including false and unsupported claims that Bang contains ingredients that it does not have and provides benefit that it does not generate. VPX has continually attempted to delay our lawsuit. In April, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which is scheduled for hearing in June 2019.
In March 2019, VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster. I have 2 comments to make. Firstly, the lawsuit is meritless. Months after Monster publicly announced the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in mid-January 2019, a company related to VPX allegedly purchased an unrelated Reign trademark for a different class of products, namely powdered dietary supplements. Monster holds trademark and use priority over VPX for its Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in the clause that covers these beverages. We recently filed a reply to VPX' complaint which sets forth our opposition in detail and asserts counterclaims against VPX for trademark infringement and unfair competition. 
Secondly, this lawsuit will not impede or slow the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel. As our litigation with VPX and the arbitration with Coca-Cola are sub judice, we will not be answering questions on these matters on the call.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 20, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.8% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars decreased by 4 points over the same period the previous year to 34.1%. NOS' share declined 0.5 share points to 3.7%, and Full Throttle's share declined 0.2 points to 0.8%. Red Bull's share decreased 0.7 point to 33.9%, Rockstar share was down 1.5 points to 5.5%, 5-Hour share was lower by 1.1 points at 5.7%, and Amp share decreased 0.4 point to 0.4%. VPX Bang's share is 8.3%, and Reign's share is 1.7%.
In view of the recent launch of Reign, we are giving an update on its performance. According to Nielsen, for the 1 week ended April 20, 2019, in the convenience and gas channel, Reign's market share in dollars for the 1 week is already 2.5%, while Bang's market share in dollars in that week is 8.3%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now includes Caffé Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 9.1% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 1.3% higher, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 9.3% higher.
Our company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffé Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 53.5%, down 3.5 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 47.3%, up 0.5 point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 43.4%, up 0.6 point.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 30, 2019, the energy drink category increased 4% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 7% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 0.9 share point to 33.9%. NOS' sales increased 2%, and its market share increased 0.1 share points to 3%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 11.5% during the month of March 2019. Monster sales increased 13%. Our market share in value increased 0.4 points to 29.1% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 30%. Burn's market share decreased 0.7 points to 1.2%. Red Bull's sales decreased 7.3% as market share decreased by 1.9 points to 9.4%. Vive 100 sales increased 2.4%, and its market share decreased 3 points to 34.2%. Vault's sales increased 75.6%, and its market share increased 6.1 share points to 16.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.6 points to 7.7%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11.5% to 13.2% in Belgium, from 25.6% to 26.4% in France, from 16% to 17.2% in Germany, from 18.7% to 20% in Great Britain, from 7% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 16.3% to 18.8% in Norway, from 8.3% to 12.4% in Poland, from 15.6% to 16.3% in South Africa, from 29.3% to 30.3% in Spain and from 12% to 13.2% in Sweden.

According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2019 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 34.4% to 35.9% compared to the same period the previous year.
According to Nielsen in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of February increased from 13.5% to 20.2% as compared to the same period the previous year. We launched Monster Energy in Argentina in mid-February 2018. According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 4% to 23.6% compared to the same period the previous year.
According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ending April 7, 2019, increased from 8.5% to 8.8% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.3% to 12.9% during the same period. 
According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ending March 24, 2019, increased from 6% to 7.9% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+ market share in value decreased from 9.8% to 9%, and Mother's market share in value increased from 6.4% to 7.5%.

According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel grew from 47.9% in the 2018 first quarter to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2019. We again point out that in certain market, statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions and/or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter 2019 increased 11.5% from $780.5 million to $870.4 million from the comparable period in 2018. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $18.2 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $70.3 million for the first quarter as compared to $65.8 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the first quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.8 million of foreign currency movements. 
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.3 million in the first quarter as compared to $4.7 million in the same quarter in 2018.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $284.1 million, 30% of total net sales in the 2019 first quarter compared to $242.1 million, which was 28.5% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $22 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 fourth quarter, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing through these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity. 
In EMEA, net sales in the first quarter increased 12.5% in dollars and increased 22.3% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 43.2% compared to 44.5% in the same quarter in 2018.
Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our Strategic Brands in the region. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 29.6% in dollars and 34.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2018.

Short-term investments were $263.7 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $596.7 million at March 31, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 49.9 days at March 31, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $300.8 million at March 31, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 72.7 days at March 31, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018.
We have successfully launched Monster Energy Ultra Paradise, a line extension in our Monster Ultra family in February 2019 as well as 2 -- an additional 2 flavors of Hydro, Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green, in 25.4-ounce PET bottles. In addition, we built out the NOS family in the quarter with the launch of NOS Sonic Sour and the rebranding of NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch. We also extended the Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, lead launch from 2018, to all customers in February 2019 and added 2 flavors in our Dragon Tea line, Green Tea and Yerba Mate, which launched in March.
We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line. Finally, in March, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in 6 flavors. Initial results have been positive. During January 2019 in Canada, we launched 2 additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March, we launched our Caffé Monster line in 13.7-ounce resealable glass packages.
In Mexico, we launched Mango Loco in April 2019. During the first quarter of 2019, we launched Pacific Punch in the Caribbean and extended our range in Puerto Rico. In Chile, during the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Absolutely Zero. In Argentina, we launched Monster Ultra. Initial results have been positive. In the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and the Baltics. Monster Mango Loco will be launched in another 12 EMEA markets in the second quarter of 2019. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Ireland.
We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in Germany and Spain. We are planning to continue the rollout of our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the second quarter of 2019. We launched Black Monster Ultra in Russia in the first quarter of 2019 and continued the rollout of additional SKUs in the Monster Ultra range in EMEA markets, specifically Monster Ultra Blue in Great Britain and Ireland and Monster Ultra Violet in the Baltics in the first quarter of 2019. Various SKUs in the Monster Ultra line are now sold in 39 EMEA markets.
In Australia, we successfully launched a new Mother flavor, Tropical Blast, in February with good initial results. We launched Monster Mango in China in March and continue with our rollout of Monster Ultra. We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are satisfied with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the first quarter of 2019. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for the Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle lines. 
We estimate April 2019 gross sales to be approximately 15.6% higher than in April 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 18.9% higher than comparable April 2018 gross sales. 
There was 1 more selling day in April 2019 than in April 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
During the 2019 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million, excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2019, approximately 520.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Four, in particular, initial results for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, which launched in March, are positive, and we are encouraged by the prospects for this line. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we're continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets.

We obviously try and launch with Monster Green to establish the Monster brand because that's what it stands for. But from then on, we look at the individual countries, the flavor preferences, and you'll find that our second and third SKU in many countries differ from country to country. And then depending on the response we get, in some countries, we've had really good response to Ultra, we then change track and basically start to launch more of the Ultra product than perhaps some years ago, we were launching more of the juice product. And so the order has changed a little bit.
Mango has got very well received. Pipeline has been very well received in select cities. So we really elevated those SKUs basically looking in some countries. There are some countries where we are finding directly there is a good reception to our Rehab line. Now Rehab, it may not go into that form. It may go in the form of a tea line, because Rehab has less meaning in foreign countries than it has in the U.S. because of the origin of Rehab. But there is some opportunities for tea lines in some countries, and we are looking at that into noncore. 
And as you then see, we have taken the step, offer some testing to look at coffee. In Europe, we think that market is -- we're going to expand that market with Espresso. And we are also looking at some other potential coffee products into the U.K. market, again, looking at shelves and keeping abreast of growth and innovation. In those markets, we do see good opportunity for that. And once we look at that and again reach the right progression with -- in other countries, we will look at other growth opportunities in -- but we're going to follow our policy of looking at it country by country. As we have launched in the country, as the bottler is able to handle it and we feel it's right to continue to grow, then we'll continue to build out. Over the years, our portfolio is going to continue to grow -- continue to build out internationally.
In the U.S., while we've launched and we believe there is -- the energy shelf is pretty impacted at the moment. So we're looking to get new space for this high-performance category incremental. In some cases, in order to -- because of timing and because of resets, in order to get products on shelf, it has to be put on to the energy shelf. But in many cases, we are achieving additional space, and we also have -- we believe most of the retailers are -- agree that there should be additional space allocated to this high-performance category. It is a profitable category for the retailers. It's hiring. And so we believe we will see additional space being allocated to energy basically to accommodate the new high-performance products that we believe we will end up with -- overall end up with increased shelf space."

Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the first quarter of 2019, net sales were $946 million, up 11.2% from $850.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million of foreign currency movements.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 60.6% compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2018. For the quarter ended March 31, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in North America and, to a lesser extent, product sales mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical sales mix and increases in certain input costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.8% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 3.9% in the 2018 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 11.5% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 12.3% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.7% compared to 7.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $8.6 million in dollars, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes.
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter to 16.8% in the 2019 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the deductions for equity compensation as well as the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower-tax jurisdictions than the United States.
Net income was $261.5 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to net income of $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 first quarter increased 26.7% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018. 
We continue to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. In March 2019, we agreed to the assignment of the Kalil Bottling Group's distribution territories to Coca-Cola Bottlers in the southwestern United States. We incurred no distributor termination costs and received no deferred revenue in connection with this assignment. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy Drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in the New York metro markets, to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to all Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA.
We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand, in Namibia and Mozambique in the first quarter of 2019. We're also planning launches of Predator in certain markets in Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2019 as well as in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019. We launched Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We also launched Monster in Paraguay last week and anticipate launching in the Dominican Republic in the second quarter.
In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we also began the launch of Monster Mango, which we'll continue throughout the second quarter of 2019. We've significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India, and Monster is now available in approximately 90% of the country. We are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019.
I will now provide a quick update on our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we've stated, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions, including an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy drink products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply.
By mutual agreement, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018 for a determination of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute these products. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing on the schedule the parties agreed 2 months ago. Monster expects a decision from the arbitrators before the end of the second quarter. Although Coca-Cola has announced it is proceeding to launch its new energy drinks in certain countries without waiting for the arbitration panel to rule on the issue, Coca-Cola's entitlement to continue to sell such drinks will be governed by the outcome of the arbitration. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate to work together as partners.
I also wanted to take a moment to address a matter that has received some attention, Monster's litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising, including false and unsupported claims that Bang contains ingredients that it does not have and provides benefit that it does not generate. VPX has continually attempted to delay our lawsuit. In April, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which is scheduled for hearing in June 2019.
In March 2019, VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster. I have 2 comments to make. Firstly, the lawsuit is meritless. Months after Monster publicly announced the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in mid-January 2019, a company related to VPX allegedly purchased an unrelated Reign trademark for a different class of products, namely powdered dietary supplements. Monster holds trademark and use priority over VPX for its Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in the clause that covers these beverages. We recently filed a reply to VPX' complaint which sets forth our opposition in detail and asserts counterclaims against VPX for trademark infringement and unfair competition. 
Secondly, this lawsuit will not impede or slow the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel. As our litigation with VPX and the arbitration with Coca-Cola are sub judice, we will not be answering questions on these matters on the call.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 20, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.8% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Red Bull were up 6.7%, Rockstar was down 14.6%, 5-Hour was down 8.1%, and Amp was down 44.4%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars decreased by 4 points over the same period the previous year to 34.1%. NOS' share declined 0.5 share points to 3.7%, and Full Throttle's share declined 0.2 points to 0.8%. Red Bull's share decreased 0.7 point to 33.9%, Rockstar share was down 1.5 points to 5.5%, 5-Hour share was lower by 1.1 points at 5.7%, and Amp share decreased 0.4 point to 0.4%. VPX Bang's share is 8.3%, and Reign's share is 1.7%.
In view of the recent launch of Reign, we are giving an update on its performance. According to Nielsen, for the 1 week ended April 20, 2019, in the convenience and gas channel, Reign's market share in dollars for the 1 week is already 2.5%, while Bang's market share in dollars in that week is 8.3%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now includes Caffé Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 9.1% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 1.3% higher, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 9.3% higher.
Our company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffé Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 53.5%, down 3.5 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 47.3%, up 0.5 point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 43.4%, up 0.6 point.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 30, 2019, the energy drink category increased 4% in dollars. Monster's sales increased 7% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 0.9 share point to 33.9%. NOS' sales increased 2%, and its market share increased 0.1 share points to 3%. Full Throttle's sales decreased 7%, and its market share decreased 0.2 points to 1.4%. Red Bull's sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.3 points to 35.8%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 11.5% during the month of March 2019. Monster sales increased 13%. Our market share in value increased 0.4 points to 29.1% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 30%. Burn's market share decreased 0.7 points to 1.2%. Red Bull's sales decreased 7.3% as market share decreased by 1.9 points to 9.4%. Vive 100 sales increased 2.4%, and its market share decreased 3 points to 34.2%. Vault's sales increased 75.6%, and its market share increased 6.1 share points to 16.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.6 points to 7.7%.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11.5% to 13.2% in Belgium, from 25.6% to 26.4% in France, from 16% to 17.2% in Germany, from 18.7% to 20% in Great Britain, from 7% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 16.3% to 18.8% in Norway, from 8.3% to 12.4% in Poland, from 15.6% to 16.3% in South Africa, from 29.3% to 30.3% in Spain and from 12% to 13.2% in Sweden.

According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2019 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 34.4% to 35.9% compared to the same period the previous year.

We launched Monster Energy in Argentina in mid-February 2018. According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 4% to 23.6% compared to the same period the previous year.
According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ending April 7, 2019, increased from 8.5% to 8.8% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.3% to 12.9% during the same period. 
According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last 4 weeks ending March 24, 2019, increased from 6% to 7.9% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+ market share in value decreased from 9.8% to 9%, and Mother's market share in value increased from 6.4% to 7.5%.

According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel grew from 47.9% in the 2018 first quarter to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2019. We again point out that in certain market, statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions and/or other trading factors during those months.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter 2019 increased 11.5% from $780.5 million to $870.4 million from the comparable period in 2018. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $18.2 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $70.3 million for the first quarter as compared to $65.8 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the first quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.8 million of foreign currency movements. 
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.3 million in the first quarter as compared to $4.7 million in the same quarter in 2018.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $284.1 million, 30% of total net sales in the 2019 first quarter compared to $242.1 million, which was 28.5% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $22 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 fourth quarter, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing through these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity. 
In EMEA, net sales in the first quarter increased 12.5% in dollars and increased 22.3% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 43.2% compared to 44.5% in the same quarter in 2018.
Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our Strategic Brands in the region. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 29.6% in dollars and 34.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2018.

Short-term investments were $263.7 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $596.7 million at March 31, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 49.9 days at March 31, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $300.8 million at March 31, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 72.7 days at March 31, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018.
We have successfully launched Monster Energy Ultra Paradise, a line extension in our Monster Ultra family in February 2019 as well as 2 -- an additional 2 flavors of Hydro, Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green, in 25.4-ounce PET bottles. In addition, we built out the NOS family in the quarter with the launch of NOS Sonic Sour and the rebranding of NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch. We also extended the Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, lead launch from 2018, to all customers in February 2019 and added 2 flavors in our Dragon Tea line, Green Tea and Yerba Mate, which launched in March.
We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line. Finally, in March, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in 6 flavors. Initial results have been positive. During January 2019 in Canada, we launched 2 additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March, we launched our Caffé Monster line in 13.7-ounce resealable glass packages.
In Mexico, we launched Mango Loco in April 2019. During the first quarter of 2019, we launched Pacific Punch in the Caribbean and extended our range in Puerto Rico. In Chile, during the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Absolutely Zero. In Argentina, we launched Monster Ultra. Initial results have been positive. In the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and the Baltics. Monster Mango Loco will be launched in another 12 EMEA markets in the second quarter of 2019. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Ireland.
We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in Germany and Spain. We are planning to continue the rollout of our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the second quarter of 2019. We launched Black Monster Ultra in Russia in the first quarter of 2019 and continued the rollout of additional SKUs in the Monster Ultra range in EMEA markets, specifically Monster Ultra Blue in Great Britain and Ireland and Monster Ultra Violet in the Baltics in the first quarter of 2019. Various SKUs in the Monster Ultra line are now sold in 39 EMEA markets.
In Australia, we successfully launched a new Mother flavor, Tropical Blast, in February with good initial results. We launched Monster Mango in China in March and continue with our rollout of Monster Ultra. We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are satisfied with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the first quarter of 2019. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019, by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019, for the Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle lines. 
We estimate April 2019 gross sales to be approximately 15.6% higher than in April 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 18.9% higher than comparable April 2018 gross sales. 
There was 1 more selling day in April 2019 than in April 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
During the 2019 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million, excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2019, approximately 520.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. Two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Four, in particular, initial results for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, which launched in March, are positive, and we are encouraged by the prospects for this line. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we're continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. Seven, we're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally and also evaluating the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in countries outside of the U.S.A. in the second half of 2019.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

We obviously try and launch with Monster Green to establish the Monster brand because that's what it stands for. But from then on, we look at the individual countries, the flavor preferences, and you'll find that our second and third SKU in many countries differ from country to country. And then depending on the response we get, in some countries, we've had really good response to Ultra, we then change track and basically start to launch more of the Ultra product than perhaps some years ago, we were launching more of the juice product. And so the order has changed a little bit.
Mango has got very well received. Pipeline has been very well received in select cities. So we really elevated those SKUs basically looking in some countries. There are some countries where we are finding directly there is a good reception to our Rehab line. Now Rehab, it may not go into that form. It may go in the form of a tea line, because Rehab has less meaning in foreign countries than it has in the U.S. because of the origin of Rehab. But there is some opportunities for tea lines in some countries, and we are looking at that into noncore. 
And as you then see, we have taken the step, offer some testing to look at coffee. In Europe, we think that market is -- we're going to expand that market with Espresso. And we are also looking at some other potential coffee products into the U.K. market, again, looking at shelves and keeping abreast of growth and innovation. In those markets, we do see good opportunity for that. And once we look at that and again reach the right progression with -- in other countries, we will look at other growth opportunities in -- but we're going to follow our policy of looking at it country by country. As we have launched in the country, as the bottler is able to handle it and we feel it's right to continue to grow, then we'll continue to build out. Over the years, our portfolio is going to continue to grow -- continue to build out internationally.
In the U.S., while we've launched and we believe there is -- the energy shelf is pretty impacted at the moment. So we're looking to get new space for this high-performance category incremental. In some cases, in order to -- because of timing and because of resets, in order to get products on shelf, it has to be put on to the energy shelf. But in many cases, we are achieving additional space, and we also have -- we believe most of the retailers are -- agree that there should be additional space allocated to this high-performance category. It is a profitable category for the retailers. It's hiring. And so we believe we will see additional space being allocated to energy basically to accommodate the new high-performance products that we believe we will end up with -- overall end up with increased shelf space."

Consumer beverage preferences and tastes are continuing to evolve and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the second quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.1 billion, up 8.7% from $1.02 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Net sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $25.9 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 11.2%.
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 second quarter, was 59.9% compared with 61.1% in the 2018 second quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in the United States and Canada as well as by reduced aluminum costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical and product sales mix and increases in certain input costs.
Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 3.7% in the 2018 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to the 11.4% in the same quarter in 2018.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.9% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 10.7% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.6% compared to 6.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $7.4 million in dollars primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes.
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $15.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $14.9 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter to 23.4% in the 2019 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower-tax jurisdictions than the United States.
Net income was $292.5 million in the 2019 second quarter compared to net income of $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter, an increase of 8.3%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 second quarter increased 11.9% to $0.53 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2018.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We positioned the distribution of Monster Energy group from Big Geyser's territory which is located in the New York metro markets to Liberty Coca-Cola in the early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States was fully transitioned to a Coca-Cola network bottlers. 
In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by Coke bottlers in Azerbaijan, Paraguay and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand, in the second quarter of 2019 in certain markets in Europe namely Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019. 
In China we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the second quarter and also launched Monster Mango. We have significantly expanded our sales pace for Monster for 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and are planning additional SK launches in the India in 2019. 
I will now briefly discuss our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company and litigation with Vital Pharmaceutical, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. As we have previously disclosed, in October 2018, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company mutually agreed to submit to arbitration the issue of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market sell or distribute energy drink products it had developed under the Coca-Cola brand. On June 28, 2019, the arbitration panel issued a final award in favor of Coca-Cola. Regardless of this outcome, Monster and Coca-Cola value their relationship and look forward to continuing their partnership.
I have also previously addressed the lawsuit filed against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX' trademark lawsuits against Monster filed in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. In one of the court filings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign for June and July was solid as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers, were lower than our initial expectations. As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors including authorizations, the date or dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections, and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. As our litigation with VPX is subjugated, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 27, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots, increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year ago.

Our company share of coffee plus energy category which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted for the 4 weeks ended July 20, 2019, was 49.1%, down 6.5 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, was 43.9%, down 1.3 points while Starbucks Energy's share was 47.7%, up 3.4 points.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular months. Consequently, such activities could have had significant impact from the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and also our reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.

We again [indiscernible] that certain market statistics that covers single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.

In EMEA, supply chain and production issues were considerably reduced versus the previous quarters but still continue to affect performance in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to manage through and reduce these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in the part -- in the past to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are continuing to secure additional production capacity.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $888.3 million at June 30, 2019 compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $358 million at June 30, 2019 compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. 
Net accounts receivable increased to $688.2 million at June 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.5 days at June 30, 2019 compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. 
Inventories increased to $299.5 million at June 30, 2019 from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 60.9 days at June 30, 2019 compared to 67 days at December 31, 2018.
We estimate July 2019 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in July 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 17.4% higher than comparable July 2018 gross sales. There was 1 more selling day in July 2019 that in July 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to are regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2019 second quarter, no shares repurchased under the previously authorized share repurchase program. As of August 7, 2019, approximately 520.6 million shares remain available for -- sorry $520.6 million, remain available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase programs.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. While encouraged with the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel, high-performance energy drinks and note that Reign launched at Walmart last week. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain new markets. We are pursuing with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also pursuing with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.A.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And a lot of it depends on timing, getting our products onto the shelves space as we launched it greater space into many cases to the products still working to schematics are being reset now and later in the year. So those things will continue I think affect the performance of the energy category.
Now there are a number of other performance energy drinks, there's Bang, and there are also some other performance energy drinks that are seeking to obtain listings in space in the convenience channel such as Celsius and C4 and others. And so we think that they will ultimately be an additional space allocated to the performance energy drinks. As part of the broader energy drink category in the existing space, all probably will start seeing some additional space being allocated in the C stores and coolers alongside or adjacent to the energy space. We think there will be some development of a sort of subset or category of performance-based that will be lumped together. They are also taking into account products we think like Hydro and other performance energy drinks are that are just generally fall outside of the pure carbonated sparkling sort of traditional energy drinks"

So there has been an effect on all of those brands.
The -- when you look at it on a stack basis, Monster Energy category had a really good year in 2018. So you got to look at it all over. It clearly has been an impact in this year and in the second quarter. We are seeing some stabilizing of the other brands. And -- but overall, we look at the business on overall bases. And on an overall basis, the category is continuing to grow. It's -- and we are still participating in our overall brands within the category are continuing to grow. And this is not too dissimilar to certain other markets internationally where you've got disruptors or lower affordable energy brands going to the market. You take a market like Mexico for in the example, while there was an energy premium energy category, shares -- our shares were higher as affordable energy brands got into that market, they grew the market overall and our sales grew -- continue to grow. Although our share of market, if you take those affordable brands and read categories the market to a broader market, obviously our share percentage-wise starts to started to and dropped and lower in Mexico while we continue to see continued increases in and positive sales in Mexico throughout the period that the category has gone through this redefinition.
And so that's where we think we are seeing the category in the U.S. And it will all continue to grow and evolve. But overall we obviously are looking to new innovation. We've got a new innovation planned for later this year and next year, and we do believe that we continue to have -- Monster will continue to grow in the U.S. as well as the other products in our portfolio"

So there are a number of reasons for the decline in international margins, and many of these reasons we've actually spoken about it on previous calls. So we said that our Monster Energy drinks have a lower gross profit percentage than our Strategic Brands which are largely sales of concentrates. So as international sales and Monster grow at a faster pace than the Strategic Brands overall gross profit percentages are negatively impacted. 
Our international innovation in the quarter was in part driven by the juice SKUs which we talked about on this call and Espresso Monster principally in EMEA which also have lower margins in our non-juice Monster SKUs and that's also had an impact on the gross profit percentage in the quarter. Country mix is another factor. We sell in some countries that have lower percentage margins than in other countries. Mark, I'm giving the whole shopping list. In the quarter, FoRex negatively impacted the cost of goods in certain countries particularly in Lat Am then import Finished Products from U.S. and Mexico. This impact obviously was less open certain ingredients only on imported not the finished goods.
In certain overseas countries as you know, we operate at different value sharing models with certain bottlers and that it could have an impact in the quarter. Production issues and capacity constraints in EMEA also impacted margins in the quarter. So some of these items should not be really reoccurring. And frankly, we are confident with the operating model. We've had a number of issues in EMEA which we referred to in the beginning of those we believe. But we are comfortable with the model and also with our ability to manage our costs. So I hope that answers your questions, probably in more detail than you wanted"

Consumer beverage preferences and tastes are continuing to evolve and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the second quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.1 billion, up 8.7% from $1.02 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Net sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $25.9 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 11.2%.
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 second quarter, was 59.9% compared with 61.1% in the 2018 second quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in the United States and Canada as well as by reduced aluminum costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical and product sales mix and increases in certain input costs.
Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 3.7% in the 2018 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to the 11.4% in the same quarter in 2018.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.9% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 10.7% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.6% compared to 6.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $7.4 million, primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes.
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $15.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $14.9 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter to 23.4% in the 2019 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower-tax jurisdictions than the United States.
Net income was $292.5 million in the 2019 second quarter compared to net income of $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter, an increase of 8.3%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 second quarter increased 11.9% to $0.53 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2018.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy Drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in the New York metro markets, to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States was fully transitioned to Coca-Cola network bottlers. 
In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by Coke bottlers in Azerbaijan, Paraguay and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand, in the second quarter of 2019 in certain markets in Europe, namely Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019. 
In China we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the second quarter and also launched Monster Mango. We have significantly expanded our sales pace for Monster with 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and are planning additional SK launches in the India in 2019. 
I will now briefly discuss our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company and litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. As we have previously disclosed, in October 2018, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company mutually agreed to submit to arbitration the issue of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute energy drink products it had developed under the Coca-Cola brand. On June 28, 2019, the arbitration panel issued a final award in favor of Coca-Cola. Regardless of this outcome, Monster and Coca-Cola value their relationship and look forward to continuing their partnership.
I have also previously addressed the lawsuit filed against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX' trademark lawsuit against Monster filed in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. In one of the court filings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign for June and July, while solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers, were lower than our initial expectations. As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors including authorizations, the date or dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections, and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. As our litigation with VPX is sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 27, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots, increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy brands, including Reign, grew 5.6% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster were down 1.4%.

Sales of Red Bull increased 4.6%; sales of Rockstar decreased by 14.4%; sales of 5-Hour decreased 8.1%; and sales of Amp decreased 48.1%. 
As there were no comparable sales to our Reign products last year, we have not included Reign in the above statistics. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 8.1% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's Energy brands, which include Reign, grew 4.7% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster decreased by 3.9% over the same period versus the previous year; NOS was down 1.5%; Full Throttle was down 11.4%; sales of Red Bull up 3.3%; Rockstar was down 18%; 5-Hour was down 10%; and Amp was down 40.9%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, decreased by 1.3 points over the same period the previous year to 41.1%. Monster's share decreased 4.2 share points to 33.5%; Reign's share was 3.4%; NOS' share declined 0.3 of a share point to 3.5%; and Full Throttle's share declined 0.2 of a point to 0.7 of a percent; Red Bull's share decreased 1.6 points to 33.7%; Rockstar's share was down 1.6 points to 4.9%; 5-Hour's share was lower by 1.1 points at 5.4%; and Amp's share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.4%; VPX Bang's share was 8.1%.  
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks which, includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel, increased 9.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 6.6% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our other coffee plus energy drinks were 3% lower while sales of Starbucks energy were 18.3% higher. Our company share of coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted for the 4 weeks ended July 20, 2019, was 49.1%, down 6.5 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, was 43.9%, down 1.3 points while Starbucks Energy's share was 47.7%, up 3.4 points. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 22, 2019,  the energy drink category increased 4% in dollars. Monster's brands sales increased 9% versus a year ago; Monster's market share increased 1.3 share points to 33.6; NOS' sales decreased 4%, and its market share decreased 0.1 of a share point to 2.6%; Full Throttle's sales decreased 17% and its market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 1.2%; Red Bull's sales increased 2% and its market share decreased 0.6 of a point to 36.9%; Rockstar's sales increased 2% and its market share decreased 0.6 points to 16.6%. 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 12.6% during the month of June 2019. Monster's sales increased 11%. Our market share in value decreased 0.4 of a point to 28.6% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 33.8%. Burn's market share decreased 0.6 points to 0.9%; Red Bull's sales decreased 2.9% and its market share decreased by 1.3 points to 8.2%. Vive 100 sales increased 12.5% and its market share remained the same at 38.2%. Vault's sales increased 56.2%, and its market share increased 4.5 share points to 16.1% while Boost's sales increased 4.7% and its market share decreased 0.5 of a point to 7.2%; Amp, an affordable energy brand launched in March, increased its market share to 6.2% in June 2019. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have had significant impact from the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and also are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended July 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.2% to 12.7% in Belgium; from 22.1% to 27.4% in France; from 19.5% to 20.9% in Great Britain; and from 7.2% to 7.3% in the Netherlands; from 17.8% to 24.5% in Norway; and from 30.3% to 32.5% in Spain. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending June 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 16% to 16.1% in Germany; from 11.2% to 14.3% in Poland; from 14.8% to 16.5% in South Africa; and from 12.6% to 12.8% in Sweden.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending May 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 12.6% to 13.4% in the Czech Republic; from 31.8% to 34.7% in Greece; from 14.6% to 17.8% in Ireland; and from 14.3% to 18.5% in Italy. 
According to Nielsen for the month of June 2019 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 34.2% to 37.4% compared to the same period the previous year.
According to Nielsen in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of June 2019 increased from 17.9% to 22.6% as compared to the same period the previous year. We launched Monster Energy in Argentina in mid-February 2018. 
According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 12% to 25.4% compared to the same period the previous year.
According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ending June 30, 2019, increased from 7.7% to 9.3% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value increased from 14.3% to 14.5% during the same period.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.

Included in the reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, supply chain and production issues were considerably reduced versus the previous quarters but still continued to affect performance in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to manage through and reduce these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in the part -- in the past to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are continuing to secure additional production capacity.
In EMEA, net sales in the second quarter increased 10.9% in dollars and increased 21.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.5% compared to 43.8% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix as well as increases in manufacturing costs.
We are pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 35.1% in dollars and 41.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.6% versus 49% over the same period in 2018 as a result of country and product mix.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.3% versus 47.4% over the same period in 2018 largely due to increases in cost of goods affected by adverse foreign exchange rates and country mix.
In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 97.7% in dollars, and increased 126.8% in local currency. Net sales in Chile decreased 2.4% in dollars but increased 8% in local currency in the quarter.
Our new product launches in the U.S. largely took place in the first quarter of 2019. We plan to launch a number of products in the United States later this year, namely Monster Mule, Reign orange dreamsicle, Reign strawberry sublime and Reign mango magic as well as Monster MAXX mango magic and Monster MAXX red red extra strength with zero sugar as well as a new innovative Java Monster line extension, the details of which will be revealed at a later date.

Monster Mango Loco is now available in 31 EMEA markets. We continue to launch different Monster line extensions and our strategic brands in several countries across EMEA markets.
Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in South Africa in the second quarter of 2019, and will be launched in a further 6 markets in the second half of 2019. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in France, Norway and Sweden. We are planning to expand the rollout of our Espresso Monster line in Europe, and we anticipate that Espresso Monster will be available in 29 countries in EMEA by the end of 2019.
We are planning to launch Monster in Israel in the fourth quarter of 2019. We're also planning to launch Predator, our affordable energy brand, in additional markets in EMEA, and Predator should be available in 19 EMEA countries by the end of 2019.
We launched Pipeline Punch in Japan in May for a limited period. We also launched Mango Loco in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and Ultra White in Malaysia and Vietnam in the second quarter.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $888.3 million at June 30, 2019 compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $358 million at June 30, 2019 compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. 
Net accounts receivable increased to $688.2 million at June 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.5 days at June 30, 2019 compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. 
Inventories increased to $299.5 million at June 30, 2019 from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 60.9 days at June 30, 2019 compared to 67 days at December 31, 2018.
We estimate July 2019 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in July 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 17.4% higher than comparable July 2018 gross sales. There was 1 more selling day in July 2019 than in July 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to are regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
During the 2019 second quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized share repurchase program. As of August 7, 2019, approximately 520.6 million shares remain available for -- sorry, $520.6 million, remain available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase programs.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. While encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, and note that Reign launched at Walmart last week. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We are proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.A.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And so we don't believe that the BOGO -- and the tailing off of the BOGOs had a really marked influence on the sale rates. So we're comfortable with the ongoing sale rate of Reign. And a lot of it depends on timing, getting our products onto the shelves, getting shelf space. As we've launched it, we've had to create shelf space. In many cases, the products are still worked into schematics. They are still being -- the schematics are being reset now and later in the year. So those things will continue to, I think, affect the performance of the performance energy category.
Now there are a number of other performance energy drinks, there's Bang, and there are also some other performance energy drinks that are seeking to obtain listings in space in the convenience channel, such as CELSIUS and C4 and others. And so we think that there will ultimately be an additional space allocated to the performance energy drinks. As part of the broader energy drink category in the existing space, all probably will start seeing some additional space being allocated in C stores in coolers alongside or adjacent to the energy space. We think there will be some development of a sort of subset or category of performance-based drinks that will be lumped together. Then we also take into account products we think like Hydro and other performance energy drinks that just generally fall outside of the pure carbonated sparkling sort of traditional energy drinks."

The -- when you look at us on a stacked basis, The Monster Energy category had a really good year in 2018. So you got to look at it all over. There clearly has been an impact in this year and in the second quarter. We are seeing some stabilizing of the other brands. And -- but overall, we look at the business on an overall bases. And on an overall basis, the category is continuing to grow. It's -- we are still participating and our overall brands within the category are continuing to grow. And this is not that dissimilar to certain other markets internationally where you've got disruptors or lower affordable energy brands going into the market. So you take a market like Mexico, for example, while there was an energy -- premium energy category, shares -- our shares were higher. As affordable energy brands got into that market, they grew the market overall and our sales grew -- continued to grow. Although our share of market, if you take those affordable brands and then recategorize the market into a broader market, obviously our share percentage-wise starts -- to started to -- and just dropped and was lower in Mexico, although we've continued to see continued increases and positive sales in Mexico throughout the period that the category has gone through this redefinition.
And so that's where we think we are seeing the category in the U.S. And it will all continue to grow and evolve. But overall we obviously are looking to new innovation.

So there are a number of reasons for the decline in international margins, and many of these reasons we've actually spoken about it on previous calls. So we said that our Monster Energy drinks have a lower gross profit percentage than our Strategic Brands which are largely sales of concentrates. So as international sales and Monster grow at a faster pace than the Strategic Brands, overall gross profit percentages are negatively impacted. 
Our international innovation in the quarter was in part driven by the juice SKUs, which we spoke about on this call; and Espresso Monster, principally in EMEA, which also have lower margins than our non-juice Monster SKUs. This also had an impact on the gross profit percentage in the quarter. Country mix was another factor. We sell in some countries that have lower percentage margins than in other countries. Mark, I'm giving you the whole shopping list. In the quarter, ForEx negatively impacted the cost of goods in certain countries, particularly in Lat Am that import Finished Products from the U.S. and from Mexico. This impact obviously was less when certain ingredients only are imported, not the Finished Goods.
In certain overseas countries, as you know, we operate at different value sharing models with certain bottlers and that could, and did, have an impact in the quarter. Production issues and capacity constraints in EMEA also impacted margins in the quarter. So some of these items should not be really reoccurring. And frankly, we are confident with our operating model. We've had a number of issues in EMEA which we've referred to. We're getting to the end of those, we believe. But we are comfortable with the model and also with our ability to manage our costs. So I hope that answers your question, probably in more detail than you wanted."

Consumer beverage preferences and tastes are continuing to evolve and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the second quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.1 billion, up 8.7% from $1.02 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Net sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $25.9 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 11.2%.
 
 
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 second quarter, was 59.9% compared with 61.1% in the 2018 second quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in the United States and Canada as well as by reduced aluminum costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical and product sales mix and increases in certain input costs.
 
 
Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 3.7% in the 2018 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to the 11.4% in the same quarter in 2018.
 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.9% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 10.7% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.6% compared to 6.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $7.4 million, primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes.
 
 
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $15.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $14.9 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter to 23.4% in the 2019 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower-tax jurisdictions than the United States.
 
 
Net income was $292.5 million in the 2019 second quarter compared to net income of $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter, an increase of 8.3%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 second quarter increased 11.9% to $0.53 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2018.
 
 
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy Drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in the New York metro markets, to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States was fully transitioned to Coca-Cola network bottlers.
 
In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by Coke bottlers in Azerbaijan, Paraguay and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand, in the second quarter of 2019 in certain markets in Europe, namely Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019.
 
In China we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the second quarter and also launched Monster Mango. We have significantly expanded our sales pace for Monster with 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and are planning additional SK launches in the India in 2019.
 
I will now briefly discuss our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company and litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. As we have previously disclosed, in October 2018, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company mutually agreed to submit to arbitration the issue of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute energy drink products it had developed under the Coca-Cola brand. On June 28, 2019, the arbitration panel issued a final award in favor of Coca-Cola. Regardless of this outcome, Monster and Coca-Cola value their relationship and look forward to continuing their partnership.
 
 
I have also previously addressed the lawsuit filed against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX' trademark lawsuit against Monster filed in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. In one of the court filings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign for June and July, while solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers, were lower than our initial expectations. As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors including authorizations, the date or dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections, and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. As our litigation with VPX is sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call.
 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 27, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots, increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Red Bull increased 4.6%; sales of Rockstar decreased by 14.4%; sales of 5-Hour decreased 8.1%; and sales of Amp decreased 48.1%.
As there were no comparable sales to our Reign products last year, we have not included Reign in the above statistics. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 8.1% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's Energy brands, which include Reign, grew 4.7% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel.

Monster's share decreased 4.2 share points to 33.5%; Reign's share was 3.4%; NOS' share declined 0.3 of a share point to 3.5%; and Full Throttle's share declined 0.2 of a point to 0.7 of a percent; Red Bull's share decreased 1.6 points to 33.7%; Rockstar's share was down 1.6 points to 4.9%; 5-Hour's share was lower by 1.1 points at 5.4%; and Amp's share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.4%; VPX Bang's share was 8.1%.  
 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks which, includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel, increased 9.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 6.6% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our other coffee plus energy drinks were 3% lower while sales of Starbucks energy were 18.3% higher. Our company share of coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted for the 4 weeks ended July 20, 2019, was 49.1%, down 6.5 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, was 43.9%, down 1.3 points while Starbucks Energy's share was 47.7%, up 3.4 points.
 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 22, 2019, the energy drink category increased 4% in dollars. Monster's brands sales increased 9% versus a year ago; Monster's market share increased 1.3 share points to 33.6; NOS' sales decreased 4%, and its market share decreased 0.1 of a share point to 2.6%; Full Throttle's sales decreased 17% and its market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 1.2%; Red Bull's sales increased 2% and its market share decreased 0.6 of a point to 36.9%; Rockstar's sales increased 2% and its market share decreased 0.6 points to 16.6%.
 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 12.6% during the month of June 2019. Monster's sales increased 11%. Our market share in value decreased 0.4 of a point to 28.6% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 33.8%. Burn's market share decreased 0.6 points to 0.9%; Red Bull's sales decreased 2.9% and its market share decreased by 1.3 points to 8.2%. Vive 100 sales increased 12.5% and its market share remained the same at 38.2%. Vault's sales increased 56.2%, and its market share increased 4.5 share points to 16.1% while Boost's sales increased 4.7% and its market share decreased 0.5 of a point to 7.2%; Amp, an affordable energy brand launched in March, increased its market share to 6.2% in June 2019.
 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have had significant impact from the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and also are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended July 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.2% to 12.7% in Belgium; from 22.1% to 27.4% in France; from 19.5% to 20.9% in Great Britain; and from 7.2% to 7.3% in the Netherlands; from 17.8% to 24.5% in Norway; and from 30.3% to 32.5% in Spain.

In EMEA, supply chain and production issues were considerably reduced versus the previous quarters but still continued to affect performance in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to manage through and reduce these supply chain and production issues.

Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in South Africa in the second quarter of 2019, and will be launched in a further 6 markets in the second half of 2019.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $888.3 million at June 30, 2019 compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $358 million at June 30, 2019 compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018.
 
Net accounts receivable increased to $688.2 million at June 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.5 days at June 30, 2019 compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018.
 
Inventories increased to $299.5 million at June 30, 2019 from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 60.9 days at June 30, 2019 compared to 67 days at December 31, 2018.
 
 
We estimate July 2019 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in July 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 17.4% higher than comparable July 2018 gross sales. There was 1 more selling day in July 2019 than in July 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to are regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
 
 
During the 2019 second quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized share repurchase program. As of August 7, 2019, approximately 520.6 million shares remain available for -- sorry, $520.6 million, remain available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase programs.
 
 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. While encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, and note that Reign launched at Walmart last week. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We are proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.A.
 
 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

When we look at the BOGO, we looked at -- if you look at the average Reign sales on a weekly basis in Nielsen, it's been reasonably consistent over the past number of weeks. And so we don't believe that the BOGO -- and the tailing off of the BOGOs had a really marked influence on the sale rates. So we're comfortable with the ongoing sale rate of Reign. And a lot of it depends on timing, getting our products onto the shelves, getting shelf space. As we've launched it, we've had to create shelf space. In many cases, the products are still worked into schematics. They are still being -- the schematics are being reset now and later in the year. So those things will continue to, I think, affect the performance of the performance energy category.
 
 
Now there are a number of other performance energy drinks, there's Bang, and there are also some other performance energy drinks that are seeking to obtain listings in space in the convenience channel, such as CELSIUS and C4 and others. And so we think that there will ultimately be an additional space allocated to the performance energy drinks. As part of the broader energy drink category in the existing space, all probably will start seeing some additional space being allocated in C stores in coolers alongside or adjacent to the energy space. We think there will be some development of a sort of subset or category of performance-based drinks that will be lumped together. Then we also take into account products we think like Hydro and other performance energy drinks that just generally fall outside of the pure carbonated sparkling sort of traditional energy drinks."

So there has been an effect on all of those brands.
 
 
The -- when you look at us on a stacked basis, The Monster Energy category had a really good year in 2018. So you got to look at it all over. There clearly has been an impact in this year and in the second quarter. We are seeing some stabilizing of the other brands. And -- but overall, we look at the business on an overall bases. And on an overall basis, the category is continuing to grow. It's -- we are still participating and our overall brands within the category are continuing to grow. And this is not that dissimilar to certain other markets internationally where you've got disruptors or lower affordable energy brands going into the market. So you take a market like Mexico, for example, while there was an energy -- premium energy category, shares -- our shares were higher. As affordable energy brands got into that market, they grew the market overall and our sales grew -- continued to grow. Although our share of market, if you take those affordable brands and then recategorize the market into a broader market, obviously our share percentage-wise starts -- to started to -- and just dropped and was lower in Mexico, although we've continued to see continued increases and positive sales in Mexico throughout the period that the category has gone through this redefinition.
 
And so that's where we think we are seeing the category in the U.S. And it will all continue to grow and evolve. But overall we obviously are looking to new innovation. We've got new innovation planned for later this year and next year, and we do believe that we will continue to have -- Monster will continue to grow in the U.S. as well as the other products in our portfolio"

So maybe give a bit more detail about just what channel inventories look like, what shipments look like. Was there some sort of issue in the quarter in shipping product from a retailer standpoint?

So there are a number of reasons for the decline in international margins, and many of these reasons we've actually spoken about it on previous calls. So we said that our Monster Energy drinks have a lower gross profit percentage than our Strategic Brands which are largely sales of concentrates. So as international sales and Monster grow at a faster pace than the Strategic Brands, overall gross profit percentages are negatively impacted.
 
Our international innovation in the quarter was in part driven by the juice SKUs, which we spoke about on this call; and Espresso Monster, principally in EMEA, which also have lower margins than our non-juice Monster SKUs. This also had an impact on the gross profit percentage in the quarter. Country mix was another factor. We sell in some countries that have lower percentage margins than in other countries. Mark, I'm giving you the whole shopping list. In the quarter, ForEx negatively impacted the cost of goods in certain countries, particularly in Lat Am that import Finished Products from the U.S. and from Mexico. This impact obviously was less when certain ingredients only are imported, not the Finished Goods.
 
 
In certain overseas countries, as you know, we operate at different value sharing models with certain bottlers and that could, and did, have an impact in the quarter. Production issues and capacity constraints in EMEA also impacted margins in the quarter. So some of these items should not be really reoccurring. And frankly, we are confident with our operating model. We've had a number of issues in EMEA which we've referred to. We're getting to the end of those, we believe. But we are comfortable with the model and also with our ability to manage our costs. So I hope that answers your question, probably in more detail than you wanted."

Consumer beverage preferences and tastes are continuing to evolve and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the second quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.1 billion, up 8.7% from $1.02 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Net sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $25.9 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 11.2%.
 
 
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 second quarter, was 59.9% compared with 61.1% in the 2018 second quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in the United States and Canada as well as by reduced aluminum costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical and product sales mix and increases in certain input costs.
 
 
Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 3.7% in the 2018 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to the 11.4% in the same quarter in 2018.
 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.9% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 10.7% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.6% compared to 6.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $7.4 million, primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes.
 
 
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $15.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $14.9 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter to 23.4% in the 2019 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower-tax jurisdictions than the United States.
 
 
Net income was $292.5 million in the 2019 second quarter compared to net income of $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter, an increase of 8.3%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 second quarter increased 11.9% to $0.53 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2018.
 
 
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy Drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in the New York metro markets, to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States was fully transitioned to Coca-Cola network bottlers.
 
In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by Coke bottlers in Azerbaijan, Paraguay and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand, in the second quarter of 2019 in certain markets in Europe, namely Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019.
 
In China we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the second quarter and also launched Monster Mango. We have significantly expanded our sales pace for Monster with 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and are planning additional SK launches in the India in 2019.
 
I will now briefly discuss our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company and litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. As we have previously disclosed, in October 2018, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company mutually agreed to submit to arbitration the issue of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute energy drink products it had developed under the Coca-Cola brand. On June 28, 2019, the arbitration panel issued a final award in favor of Coca-Cola. Regardless of this outcome, Monster and Coca-Cola value their relationship and look forward to continuing their partnership.
 
 
I have also previously addressed the lawsuit filed against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX' trademark lawsuit against Monster filed in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. In one of the court filings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign for June and July, while solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers, were lower than our initial expectations. As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors including authorizations, the date or dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections, and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. As our litigation with VPX is sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call.
 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 27, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots, increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Red Bull increased 4.6%; sales of Rockstar decreased by 14.4%; sales of 5-Hour decreased 8.1%; and sales of Amp decreased 48.1%.
As there were no comparable sales to our Reign products last year, we have not included Reign in the above statistics. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 8.1% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's Energy brands, which include Reign, grew 4.7% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, decreased by 1.3 points over the same period the previous year to 41.1%. Monster's share decreased 4.2 share points to 33.5%; Reign's share was 3.4%; NOS' share declined 0.3 of a share point to 3.5%; and Full Throttle's share declined 0.2 of a point to 0.7 of a percent; Red Bull's share decreased 1.6 points to 33.7%; Rockstar's share was down 1.6 points to 4.9%; 5-Hour's share was lower by 1.1 points at 5.4%; and Amp's share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.4%; VPX Bang's share was 8.1%.  
 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks which, includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel, increased 9.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 6.6% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our other coffee plus energy drinks were 3% lower while sales of Starbucks energy were 18.3% higher. Our company share of coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted for the 4 weeks ended July 20, 2019, was 49.1%, down 6.5 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2019, was 43.9%, down 1.3 points while Starbucks Energy's share was 47.7%, up 3.4 points.
 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 22, 2019, the energy drink category increased 4% in dollars.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have had significant impact from the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and also are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.

In EMEA, supply chain and production issues were considerably reduced versus the previous quarters but still continued to affect performance in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to manage through and reduce these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in the part -- in the past to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are continuing to secure additional production capacity.

Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in South Africa in the second quarter of 2019, and will be launched in a further 6 markets in the second half of 2019.

We are planning to launch Monster in Israel in the fourth quarter of 2019. We're also planning to launch Predator, our affordable energy brand, in additional markets in EMEA, and Predator should be available in 19 EMEA countries by the end of 2019.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $888.3 million at June 30, 2019 compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $358 million at June 30, 2019 compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018.
 
Net accounts receivable increased to $688.2 million at June 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.5 days at June 30, 2019 compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018.
 
Inventories increased to $299.5 million at June 30, 2019 from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 60.9 days at June 30, 2019 compared to 67 days at December 31, 2018.
 
 
We estimate July 2019 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in July 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 17.4% higher than comparable July 2018 gross sales. There was 1 more selling day in July 2019 than in July 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to are regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
 
 
During the 2019 second quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized share repurchase program. As of August 7, 2019, approximately 520.6 million shares remain available for -- sorry, $520.6 million, remain available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase programs.
 
 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. While encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, and note that Reign launched at Walmart last week. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We are proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.A.
 
 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And so we don't believe that the BOGO -- and the tailing off of the BOGOs had a really marked influence on the sale rates. So we're comfortable with the ongoing sale rate of Reign. And a lot of it depends on timing, getting our products onto the shelves, getting shelf space. As we've launched it, we've had to create shelf space. In many cases, the products are still worked into schematics. They are still being -- the schematics are being reset now and later in the year. So those things will continue to, I think, affect the performance of the performance energy category.
 
 
Now there are a number of other performance energy drinks, there's Bang, and there are also some other performance energy drinks that are seeking to obtain listings in space in the convenience channel, such as CELSIUS and C4 and others. And so we think that there will ultimately be an additional space allocated to the performance energy drinks. As part of the broader energy drink category in the existing space, all probably will start seeing some additional space being allocated in C stores in coolers alongside or adjacent to the energy space. We think there will be some development of a sort of subset or category of performance-based drinks that will be lumped together. Then we also take into account products we think like Hydro and other performance energy drinks that just generally fall outside of the pure carbonated sparkling sort of traditional energy drinks."

And this is not that dissimilar to certain other markets internationally where you've got disruptors or lower affordable energy brands going into the market. So you take a market like Mexico, for example, while there was an energy -- premium energy category, shares -- our shares were higher. As affordable energy brands got into that market, they grew the market overall and our sales grew -- continued to grow. Although our share of market, if you take those affordable brands and then recategorize the market into a broader market, obviously our share percentage-wise starts -- to started to -- and just dropped and was lower in Mexico, although we've continued to see continued increases and positive sales in Mexico throughout the period that the category has gone through this redefinition.
 
And so that's where we think we are seeing the category in the U.S. And it will all continue to grow and evolve. But overall we obviously are looking to new innovation. We've got new innovation planned for later this year and next year, and we do believe that we will continue to have -- Monster will continue to grow in the U.S. as well as the other products in our portfolio"

We obviously know what the month of April did. It implies May, June were up like 4% on an all-in basis. U.S. sales, up 6, I guess, sort of in line with scanner data. But if you exclude your commentary about Reign sell-in, it basically implies you didn't sell another product in the quarter. So maybe give a bit more detail about just what channel inventories look like, what shipments look like. Was there some sort of issue in the quarter in shipping product from a retailer standpoint? And then completely different, just what happened in international gross margins? I heard what you said but what specifically is going on there that's driving the overall continued weakness there?"

So there are a number of reasons for the decline in international margins, and many of these reasons we've actually spoken about it on previous calls. So we said that our Monster Energy drinks have a lower gross profit percentage than our Strategic Brands which are largely sales of concentrates. So as international sales and Monster grow at a faster pace than the Strategic Brands, overall gross profit percentages are negatively impacted.
 
Our international innovation in the quarter was in part driven by the juice SKUs, which we spoke about on this call; and Espresso Monster, principally in EMEA, which also have lower margins than our non-juice Monster SKUs. This also had an impact on the gross profit percentage in the quarter. Country mix was another factor. We sell in some countries that have lower percentage margins than in other countries. Mark, I'm giving you the whole shopping list. In the quarter, ForEx negatively impacted the cost of goods in certain countries, particularly in Lat Am that import Finished Products from the U.S. and from Mexico. This impact obviously was less when certain ingredients only are imported, not the Finished Goods.
 
 
In certain overseas countries, as you know, we operate at different value sharing models with certain bottlers and that could, and did, have an impact in the quarter. Production issues and capacity constraints in EMEA also impacted margins in the quarter. So some of these items should not be really reoccurring. And frankly, we are confident with our operating model. We've had a number of issues in EMEA which we've referred to. We're getting to the end of those, we believe. But we are comfortable with the model and also with our ability to manage our costs. So I hope that answers your question, probably in more detail than you wanted."

In the third quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.13 billion, up 11.6% and from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%. 
The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States portion of our products effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%. 
Turning now to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4% compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases as well as reduced input costs. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018. 
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales was 6.5% compared to 6.2% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $10.4 million in dollars primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $16 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018. 
Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as a decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition, the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit. 
Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, an increase of 11.6%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018. 
Now we turn to the Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by or transition to coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019. In China, we completed the rollout of both Monster Ultra White and Monster Mango in the third quarter. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Ultra White into approximately 20% of our accounts in September. We will continue Ultra's expansion into the fourth quarter as well as commencing the launch of Mango Loco to leverage consumer taste preferences in India. 
I'll now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, VPx, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPx in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. In August 2019, VPX filed another lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, alleging a host of legal challenges, including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. Monster will seek the dismissal of VPX's most recent lawsuit. 
In October 2019, the U.S. court -- the U.S. District Court for the Southern District denied VPX's motion for preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In its decision, the court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of our preliminary injunction and felt established that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims. VPX recently announced an intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. We recently filed an expedited motion for preliminary injunction, asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster's trademark rights in this way. 
In light of the court filings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019, were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign through October was solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations. 
As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including retail authorizations, the dates on which listings are secured for products at major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. 
As our litigation with VPX is we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
Now we're going to turn to the Nielsen reports in North America. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 26, 2019, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.1% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars for the convenience and gas channel increased 7.4% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Monster -- Java Monster alone were down from 6% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 5.9% lower, while sales of Starbucks Energy were 18.1% higher.

Java Monster on its own for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, was 44.7% and down 2.6 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 47.9%, up 4.3 points. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 14, 2019, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars.

BVA 100 sales decreased 11.3%, and  its market share decreased by 7.7 points to 27.1%. Sales increased 53.5%, and its market share increased 4.5 share points to 17.5% and while Boost sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 6.9%. Amper and Affordable energy brand launched in March, increased its market share to 8.7% in the month of September 2019.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
Now we turn to EMEA. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. 
According to Nielsen in 13 weeks, ended October 5, 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 12.3% to 12.9% in Belgium, from 23.3% to 27.6% in France, from 20.9% to 21.5% in Great Britain, from 7.1% to 7.2% in the Netherlands, from 18.0% to 23.7% in Norway and from 30.3% to 33.4% in Spain.

Turning to Nielsen in South America. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2019 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 34.5% to 38%, compared to the same month the previous year. According to Nielsen in Brazil, monster's retail market share for the month of September 2019 increased 17.7% to 26.2% as compared to the same month the previous year.

Monster is now the leading energy brand by market share in value in all measured outlets in South Korea. 
According to intage in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the 13-week period ended September 30, 2019, grew from 48.9% to 51.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week period may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. 
So now we're going to turn to sales in the segments. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drink segment for the third quarter of 2019, which include Reign increased 13.5% from $935.1 million to $1.06 billion from the comparable period in 2018. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $10.8 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the Monster Energy Drink segment for the quarter would have been up 14.7%. 
The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, net sales for the Monster Energy Drink segment for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 16.6%. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment, which includes Predator, our affordable energy brand, was $66.3 million for the third quarter as compared to $74.4 million in the same quarter in 2018.

Net sales to customers outside the United States, with $379.8 million, that's 33.5% of total net sales in the 2019 third quarter compared to $283 million or 28.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. 
Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.2 million. Included in reported geographic sales or our sales, the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and shipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Now we turn to sales in EMEA. In EMEA, supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.1% in dollars and increased 40.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.3% compared to 41.3% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix as well as increases in manufacturing costs. 
We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa and Spain. 
Now turning to Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific net sales in the third quarter increased 43.6% in dollars and 43.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2018.

In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 12.8% in dollars and 7.2% in local currencies, although I'd like to point out that Monster increased 4.5% in dollars and 10.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018. 
Now turning to sales in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 41.5% in dollars and 51% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% for both periods. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 80.2% in dollars and increased 82.3% in local currency.

Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Sopris, Croatia, Greece, Poland and Slovenia in the third quarter of 2019 and is now available in 15 markets across EMEA. Espresso Monster was made available in 6 markets in EMEA, France, Great Britain, Germany, Norway, Spain and Sweden in both Mock and Vanilla variance during the 2019 third quarter. We also recently launched both variants in Belgium and Ireland in October 2019, and we'll launch both in Poland this month. We are pleased with the performance of Express Monster in EMEA. 
We are planning to roll out 2 flavors of Espresso Monster further 12 markets in the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020. Additionally, we are looking to launch our new salted Carmel Espresso variant in 8 EMEA markets over the course of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2020. 
Reign is launched in Sweden in the third quarter of 2019 and retaining to launch rain in a further 2 markets by the end of 2019. We're planning to launch Monster in Israel in the fourth quarter of 2019 . We're planning to launch Predator, our affordable energy brand in Ethiopia, Kenya, Poland, Uganda and Zambia in the 2019 fourth quarter. 
Turning to new products in Asia Pacific. We launched Monster Green in 500-milliliter resettable aluminum bottles in Japan during the 2019 third quarter. In Korea, we launched Pipeline Punch with initial positive results we launched Ultra White in India and completed its rollout in Vietnam during the 2019 third quarter. Ultra Paradise launched in Australia in July and in New Zealand, in September, and Mango Loco is successfully relaunched in July after resolution of local production capabilities. 
We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific over the upcoming months, including a full relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in the spring of 2020. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $717.6 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $587.4 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $648 million at September 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 44.6 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $317.7 million at September 30, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory was 62.1 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018. 
Now we're going to talk a little about October 2019 gross sales. We estimate October 2019 gross sales to be approximately 7.3% higher than in October 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, October 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 8.6% higher than comparable October 2018 gross sales. The comparative gross sales in October 2018 included advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, we estimate gross sales for the month of October 2019 would have been approximately 14.6% higher than in October 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail Distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you need actually determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
Share repurchase programs during the 2019 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $58.6 per share for a total of $254.3 million, excluding broker commissions. As of November 6, 2019, approximately $36.6 million remains available for -- $36.6 million remains available for repurchase and our previously authorized repurchase program. On November 6, 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and then Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. #2, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. #3, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020. Fourthly, we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S. but looking further abroad. #5, we're pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. 
Net sales in the third quarter in EMEA increased 40.1% in local currency. In Asia Pacific increased 43.4% in local currency, and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 51% in local currency. We reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. 
And lastly, we're proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy drink brands internationally. We're also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about a quarter."

So -- but if you look at the total category, the total category remains healthy, it's up 9%, which is really good growth. So the category is growing. There's been a shift within the category. We -- you've got to look at brands and whatever we have in the category. So you look at the fact that we're down or some of the individual SKUs are down, but overall, the category is growing, our overall corporate sales are growing, we will address, obviously, individual SKUs. And I think this is an experience that's being experienced by general consumer products for established brands. There's a movement generally on consumers to want to try new products, new flavors, new innovation. And we do have a new innovation, which we -- some of it, we've announced, we've recently launched. We have plans to launch quite a lot of new innovation. I think that in some cases, some of our new innovation that we launched earlier this year, perhaps didn't get in up shelf space or they've been some shelf space taken from our existing products, which I think has affected sales. So looking at -- 1 of the sort of main things, I think we'll look at going forward is improving the quality of our distribution, getting our innovation more efficiently and more effectively on shelves. And as we go forward, we believe there will be additional space allocated to the performance energy category, which will relieve pressure on the space we're looking for our existing energy brands and innovation under the Monster line. ."

Having said that, I just want to reiterate that the category, if you look back 52 weeks, the Energy category has shown incremental growth per Nielsen of $1.3 billion. So this is a grain category. And it's a category that now has a new segment, which is Performance Energy and Performance Energy is growing within that category. And as I look at some of our other competitors, and this is no defense, but as we look, for example, even at Red Bull, which is growing. And we mentioned on the call that it's growing. The Red Bull brands are also not showing growth. The are and their additions are, but in general, the Red Bull brands are also not showing growth and decline.

So if you take that with -- as a growth position, it's going to continue to grow. So we see a lot of runway to grow internationally and to grow the brand.

And then if I could, a related question, building on what you just said, but in the context of Coke Energy, I think that we all appreciate what you and Coke have each said about the intended interplay between Monster and Monster and Reign and Coke Energy and that they're targeted different consumers and designed to minimize cannibalization risk. But given that they'll be going through common distributors, just how confident are you that those new Coke SKUs won't take away from some of your smaller SKUs, whether Monster, Reign, NOS, Full Throttle or otherwise, rather than having them successfully find incremental space in the cooler or take away from competition distributed by others?"

And while it's a good indication of what -- of the movement of sales, it's not an absolute science. And 1 has to be very wary, but we've said this on many calls in the past. One's going to be very careful of trying to balance ourselves, to our partners and our distributors with sales out to the consumer. Nielsen read a sample. They don't read all the channels, they don't read -- the food service, they don't read Amazon, they don't read cost curve, they don't need the home depots and the lowe's and all the other channels where our products are distributed. So it's difficult to draw a comparison from 1 to the other. All we can do is give you the facts and you guys make your assessments from there."

I think that most of the analysts are very up-to-date analyzing Nielsen. Well, they should be looking at analyzing Nielsen around the world, and that would give everybody their own view on what's been happening with the rollout of Coke Energy around the world. We've seen the brand rollout, and we've also seen the rate of sale, not keeping pace with initial sales. The percentage market share has been small and hasn't really had an impact on us. The main impact that, I think we repeatedly said is, that we did have concerns for the sort of noise and in the market and focus from diversion of focus. But ultimately, in Europe, things are settling down. Our growth rates of our brands are on track and have continued. And I think that by and large, the Coke system has pretty much focused on not trying to cannibalize our existing product and take facings from us, and it's worked reasonably well. There've been a few countries where there have been some challenges, and we've addressed them. So again, we don't know. We can't tell what Coke Energy will be in the United States. It's formulated a little differently. It's a little different in sizes. There's 2 variants. But ultimately, we think that we just need to manage the lack of focus or conflict of focusing from to bottlers. Ultimately, we don't think it will have a major impact on our brand, and we will manage it and going forward until you feel."

I mean, we sell concentrates at high margins and through the strategic brands, and we sell finished products at different margins that really are based for a number of factors on the relationships we have developed with the bottlers and distributors in various countries and the cost of production. So it's always -- every quarter, the issue is how much do we sell internationally, which has lower margins, and I'll get on to that. And I think I discussed it on a previous call. And how much strategic brands did we sell as a corporation versus finished goods at Monster Energy. So when we established our model in the United States, the distributors were allocated a margin, which was satisfactory to them, and we had the lion's share of the margin. As we've grown internationally in more virgin territories, the bottlers in the Coke system, where we've transitioned or launched with, they've demanded a higher share of the value chain. And this is something that we've had to deal with, understanding that if we want to launch in various countries internationally that's going to cost us more in margin than in the U.S., where we had a very established business. And the Coca-Cola bottlers into this established business with the same margins. We also have different cost impacts around the world, which we try to manage as best as we can. And then 1 of the other issues that we are facing is that our juice products are doing very well. Our coffee products are doing very well, and they and themselves have lower margins than the traditional Monster beverages, which have -- and of course, the diets have the best margin of all. 
So you have this issue of competing of competing margins. However, there are things we can do with the juice products, we can establish greater efficiencies, we had a big improvement this year in this quarter in the U.S., in fact, in freight, getting product and materials to our co-packers. That was a big benefit. The other benefit that we had in the U.S. was in aluminum. So  there's a difficult range of factors that go into what the overall consolidated margin is. It's not just a simple 1 calculation. But we are working on it. And as we've done in the U.S. and as we've done with freight in, we continue to look at our model internationally and see where we can improve on our gross margin percentages. And as I've always said, Mark, we sell products, and we make gross profit dollars, we don't make gross profit percentages."

In the third quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.13 billion, up 11.6% from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%. 
The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States portion of our products effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign  currency movements, net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%. 
Turning now to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4% compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases as well as reduced input costs. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018. 
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales was 6.5% compared to 6.2% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $10.4 million primarily due to head count growth, both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $16 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018. 
Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as a decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition, the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit. 
Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, an increase of 11.6%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018. 
Now we turn to The Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by or transition to Coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019. In China, we completed the rollout of both Monster Ultra White and Monster Mango in the third quarter. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Ultra White into approximately 20% of our accounts in September. We will continue Ultra's expansion into the fourth quarter as well as commencing the launch of Mango Loco to leverage consumer taste preferences in India. 
I'll now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. 
In August 2019, VPX filed another lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, alleging a host of legal challenges, including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. Monster will seek the dismissal of VPX's most recent lawsuit. 
In October 2019, the U.S. court -- the U.S. District Court for the Southern District denied VPX's motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In its decision, the court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and fail to established that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims. VPX recently announced an intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. We recently filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster's trademark rights in this way. 
In one of the court filings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign through October was solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers, were lower than our initial expectations. 
As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including retail authorizations, the dates on which listings are secured for products at major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. 
As our litigation with VPX is sub judice we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
Now we're going to turn to the Nielsen reports in North America. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 26, 2019, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.1% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of our Monster -- Java Monster alone were down from 6% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 5.9% lower, while sales of Starbucks energy were 18.1% higher. 
Our company's shares of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Cafe Monster, Expresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, was 49.3%, down 7 points. Java Monster share on its own for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, was 44.7% down 2.6 points, while Starbucks energy share was 47.9%, up 4.3 points. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 14, 2019, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars.

Our market share in value decreased by 0.9 points to 29.3%, against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 48%.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
And now we turn to EMEA. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. 
According to Nielsen, the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 12.3% to 12.9% in Belgium, from 23.3% to 27.6% in France, from 20.9% to 21.5% in Great Britain, from 7.1% to 7.2% in The Netherlands, from 18.0% to 23.7% in Norway and from 30.3% to 33.4% in Spain.

According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the 13-week period ended September 30, 2019, grew from 48.9% to 51.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week period may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. 
So now we're going to turn to sales in the segments. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2019, which include Reign increased 13.5% from $935.1 million to $1.06 billion from the comparable period in 2018. 
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $10.8 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the quarter would have been up 14.7%. 
The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 16.6%. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment, which includes Predator, our affordable energy brand, was $66.3 million for the third quarter as compared to $74.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movement.

Net sales to customers outside the United States were $379.8 million, that's 33.5% of total net sales in the 2019 third quarter compared to $283 million or 28.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. 
Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.2 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Now we turn to sales in EMEA. In EMEA, supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. 
In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.1% in dollars and increased 40.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.3% compared to 41.3% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix as well as increases in manufacturing costs. 
We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa and Spain. 
Now turning to Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 43.6% in dollars and 43.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2018.

Now turning to sales in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 41.5% in dollars and 51% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% for both periods. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 80.2% in dollars and increased 82.3% in local currency.

So now turning to new products in North America. In the United States, we launched Monster Mule Ginger Brew nationally, Reign Orange Dreamsicle, Monster MAXX, Mango Magic and Monster MAXX Rad Red extra strength with zero sugar at the end of September. 
In October, we launched Java Monster Farmer's Oats, which contains oat milk and is nondairy and vegan as well as 2 new flavors in the Reign brand family, Strawberry Sublime and Mango Magic. In 2020 in the United States, we will be discontinuing a Cafe Monster line of products and repositioning our Espresso Monster line. 
In Canada, in the third quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Pacific Punch nationally in July as well as Monster Mill Nationally in September. 
During the third quarter of 2019 in Mexico, we launched Pipeline Punch. During the third quarter of 2019 in Brazil, we launched Absolutely Zero, Ultra Violet as well as Mango Loco. 
Now turning to new products in EMEA. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Greece, Poland and Slovenia in the third quarter of 2019 and is now available in 15 markets across EMEA. Espresso Monster was made available in 6 markets in EMEA, France, Great Britain, Germany, Norway, Spain and Sweden in both milk and vanilla variants during the 2019 third quarter. We also recently launched both variants in Belgium and Ireland in October 2019, and we'll launch both in Poland this month. We are pleased with the performance of Espresso Monster in EMEA. 
We are planning to roll out 2 flavors of Espresso Monster into a further 12 markets in the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020. Additionally, we are looking to launch our new salted caramel espresso variant in 8 EMEA markets over the course of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2020. 
Reign was launched in Sweden in the third quarter of 2019 and we're planning to launch Reign in a further 2 markets by the end of 2019. We're planning to launch Monster in Israel in the fourth quarter of 2019. We're planning to launch Predator, our affordable energy brand in Ethiopia, Kenya, Poland, Uganda and Zambia in the 2019 fourth quarter. 
Turning to new products in Asia Pacific. We launched Monster Green in 500-milliliter resealable aluminum bottles in Japan during the 2019 third quarter. In Korea, we launched Pipeline Punch with initial positive results. We launched Ultra White in India and completed its rollout in Vietnam during the 2019 third quarter. Ultra Paradise launched in Australia in July and in New Zealand in September, and Mango Loco was successfully relaunched in July after resolution of local production capabilities. 
We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific over the upcoming months, including a full relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in the spring of 2020. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $717.6 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $587.4 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $648 million at September 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 44.6 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $317.7 million at September 30, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory was 62.1 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018. 
Now we're going to talk a little about our October 2019 gross sales. We estimate October 2019 gross sales to be approximately 7.3% higher than in October 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, October 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 8.6% higher than comparable October 2018 gross sales. The comparative gross sales in October 2018 included advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, we estimate gross sales for the month of October 2019 would have been approximately 14.6% higher than in October 2018. 
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you need to actually determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
Share repurchase programs during the 2019 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $58.6 per share for a total of $254.3 million, excluding broker commissions. 
As of November 6, 2019, approximately $36.6 million remains available for -- $36.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On November 6, 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Number two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Number three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020. Fourthly, we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S. but looking further abroad. Number five, we're pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. 
Net sales in the third quarter in EMEA increased 40.1% in local currency. In Asia Pacific increased 43.4% in local currency, and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 51.0% in local currency. We reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. 
And lastly, we're proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy drink brands internationally. We're also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

So -- but if you look at the total category, the total category remains healthy, it's up 9%, which is really good growth. So the category is growing, there's been a shift within the category. We -- you've got to look at brands and whatever we have in the category. So you look at the fact that we're down or some of the individual SKUs are down, but overall, the category is growing, our overall corporate sales are growing. We will address, obviously, individual SKUs. And I think this is an experience that's being experienced by general consumer products for established brands. There's a movement generally on consumers to want to try new products, new flavors, new innovation. And we do have a new innovation, which we -- some of it, we've announced, we've recently launched. We have plans to launch quite a lot of new innovation. I think that in some cases, some of our new innovation that we launched earlier this year, perhaps didn't get enough shelf space or they've been some shelf space taken from our existing products, which I think has affected sales. 
So looking at -- one of the sort of main things, I think we will look at going forward is improving the quality of our distribution, getting out to our innovation more efficiently and more effectively on the shelves. And as we go forward, we believe there will be additional space allocated to the performance energy category, which will relieve pressure on the space we're looking for, for our existing energy brands and the innovation under the Monster line."

What we have evidence of is that the price increase is stuck. And when you'll get our queue tomorrow, and you can even see it, I think, in the release that the promotional allowances are very much in line with where they should be, and we're not overpromoting. 
Having said that, I just want to reiterate that the category, if you look back 52 weeks, the energy category has shown incremental growth per Nielsen of $1.3 billion. So this is a growing category. And it's a category that now has a new segment, which is performance energy and performance energy is growing within that category. And as I look at some of our other competitors, and this is no defense. But as we look, for example, even at Red Bull, which is growing and we mentioned on the call that it's growing. The Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth. The diet -- their diet SKUs are and their additions are. But in general, the Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth and are in decline. Having said that, we have got plans with our distribution, which has been a challenge to dramatically improve distribution and distribution on shelf and in the coolers."

So just how do you think about that 3% number in light of those factors building on Andrea's question.
And then if I could, a related question, building on what you just said, but in the context of Coke Energy, I think that we all appreciate what you and Coke have each said about the intended interplay between Monster and really Monster and Reign and Coke Energy and that they're targeted different consumers and designed to minimize cannibalization risk. But given that they'll be going through common distributors, just how confident are you that those new Coke SKUs won't take away from some of your smaller SKUs, whether Monster, Reign, NOS, Full Throttle or otherwise, rather than having them successfully find incremental space in the cooler or take away from competition distributed by others?"

Nielsen sells out, ourselves sells to the distributors, the bottlers. We have a slew of unmeasured channels that I mentioned. And while it's a good indication of what -- of the movement of sales, it's not an absolute science. And one has to be very wary and we've said this on many calls in the past. One's got to be very careful of trying to balance ourselves to our bottlers and our distributors with sales out to the consumer. Nielsen read a sample. They don't read all the channels, they don't read, as I said, the foodservice, they don't read Amazon, they don't read Costco, they don't need the Home Depots and the Lowe's and all the other channels where our products are distributed.

I think that most of the analysts are very up-to-date and astute on analyzing Nielsen. Well, they should be looking at analyzing Nielsen around the world, and that would give everybody their own view on what's been happening with the rollout of Coke Energy around the world. 
We've seen the brand rollout, and we've also seen the rate of sale, not keeping pace with initial sales. The percentage market share has been small and hasn't really had an impact on us. The main impact that, I think we've repeatedly said is, that we did have concerns or is the sort of noise and the -- in the market and focus from diversion of focus. But ultimately, in Europe, things are settling down. Our growth rates of our brands are on track and have continued. And I think that by and large, the Coke system has pretty much focused on not trying to cannibalize our existing product and take phasings from us, and it's worked reasonably well. There've been a few countries where there have been some challenges and we've addressed them. 
So again, we don't know. We can't tell what Coke Energy will be in the United States. It's formulated a little differently. It's a little different in sizes. There's 2 variants. But ultimately, we think that we just need to manage the lack of focus or conflict of focusing from -- to bottlers.

I mean, we sell concentrates at high margins and through the strategic brands, and we sell finished products at different margins that really are based for a number of factors on the relationships we have developed with the bottlers and distributors in various countries and the cost of production. So it's always -- every quarter, the issue is how much did we sell internationally which has lower margins, and I'll get on to that. And I think I discussed it on a previous call. And how much strategic brands did we sell as a corporation versus finished goods at Monster Energy. So when we established our model in the United States, the distributors were allocated a margin, which was satisfactory to them, and we had the lion's share of the margin. 
As we've grown internationally in more virgin territories, the bottlers in the Coke system, where we've transitioned or launched with, they've demanded a higher share of the value chain. And this is something that we've had to deal with, understanding that if we want to launch in various countries internationally that's going to cost us more in margin than in the U.S., where we had a very established business. And the Coca-Cola bottlers segued into this established business with the same margins. 
We also have different cost impacts around the world, which we try to manage as best as we can. And then one of the other issues that we are facing is that our juice products are doing very well. 
Our coffee products are doing very well and they themselves have lower margins than the traditional Monster beverages, which have -- and of course, the diets have the best margin of all. 
So you have this issue of competing margins. However, there are things we can do with the juice products, we can establish greater efficiencies. We had a big improvement this year in this quarter in the U.S. In fact, in freight, getting product and raw materials to our co-packers. That was a big benefit. The other benefit that we had in the U.S. was in aluminum. So there's a difficult range of factors that go into what the overall consolidated margin is. It's not just a simple one calculation. But we are working on it. And as we've done in the U.S. and as we've done with freight in, we continue to look at our model internationally and see where we can improve on our gross margin percentages. And as I've always said, Mark, we sell products, and we make gross profit dollars, we don't make gross profit percentages."

In the third quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.13 billion, up 11.6% from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%. 
The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States [ portion ] of our products, effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%. 
Turning now to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4% compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases as well as reduced input costs. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018. 
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales was 6.5% compared to 6.2% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $10.4 million primarily due to head count growth, both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $16 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018. 
Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as a decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition, the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit. 
Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, an increase of 11.6%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018. 
Now we turn to The Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by or transitioned to Coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year. 
We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019. In China, we completed the rollout of both Monster Ultra White and Monster Mango in the third quarter. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Ultra White into approximately 20% of our accounts in September. We will continue Ultra's expansion into the fourth quarter as well as commencing the launch of Mango Loco to leverage consumer taste preferences in India. 
I'll now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. 
In August 2019, VPX filed another lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, alleging a host of legal challenges, including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. Monster will seek the dismissal of VPX's most recent lawsuit. 
In October 2019, the U.S. court -- the U.S. District Court for the Southern District denied VPX's motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In its decision, the court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to established that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims. VPX recently announced an intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. We recently filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster's trademark rights in this way. 
In one of the court filings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign through October was solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers, were lower than our initial expectations. 
As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including retail authorizations, the dates on which listings are secured for products at major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. 
As our litigation with VPX is sub judice we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
Now we're going to turn to the Nielsen reports in North America. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 26, 2019, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.1% versus the same period a year ago. 
Sales of the company's energy brands, including Reign, grew 4.6% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster were down 2.4%. Sales of NOS decreased 1.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 12.8%. Sales of Red Bull increased 6.4%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 10.8%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 9% and sales of Amp decreased 42.4%. As there were no comparable sales of our Reign products last year, we have not referenced Reign. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 6.5% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, which include Reign, grew 2.5% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.6 points over the same period the previous year to 40.7%. Monster's share decreased 4.1 share points to 33.5%, Reign's share was 3%, NOS' share declined 0.4 share points to 3.6%, and Full Throttle share declined 0.2 points to 2.7%. Red Bull share decreased 0.5 points to 33.2%. Rockstar share was down 1.1 points to 5.4%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.9 points at 5.5% and Amp's share decreased 0.2 points to 2.4%. VPX Bang's share increased 4.2 points to 8.2%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which includes Cafe Monster and Espresso Monster in dollars for the convenience and gas channel increased 7.4% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Monster -- Java Monster alone were down from 6% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 5.9% lower, while sales of Starbucks energy were 18.1% higher. 
Our company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Cafe Monster, Expresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, was 49.3%, down 7 points. Java Monster share on its own for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, was 44.7% down 2.6 points, while Starbucks energy share was 47.9%, up 4.3 points. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 14, 2019, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 5% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 37.6%, down 0.7 points. Monster's market share remained the same at 33.9 share points. NOS' sales decreased 7%, and its market share decreased 0.4 share points to 2.6%.

Our market share in value decreased by 0.9 points to 29.3%, against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 48%.

Bolt sales increased 53.5%, and its market share increased 4.5 share points to 17.5% while Boost sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 6.9%. Amper, an affordable energy brand launched in March, increased its market share to 8.7% in the month of September 2019.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
And now we turn to EMEA. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. 
According to Nielsen, the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 12.3% to 12.9% in Belgium, from 23.3% to 27.6% in France, from 20.9% to 21.5% in Great Britain, from 7.1% to 7.2% in The Netherlands, from 18.0% to 23.7% in Norway and from 30.3% to 33.4% in Spain.

According to Nielsen in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of September 2019 increased from 17.7% to 26.2% as compared to the same month the previous year. 
According to Nielsen in Argentina for the month of September 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 13.9% to 27.9% compared to the same month the previous year. 
Turning to Asia Pacific, according to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended September 29, 2019, increased from 9.1% to 9.6% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 13.7% to 12.9% during the same period.

According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the quarter ended September 2019 grew from 38.3% to 40.5% as compared to the same period in the previous year. Monster is now the leading energy brand by market share in value in all measured outlets in South Korea. 
According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the 13-week period ended September 30, 2019, grew from 48.9% to 51.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. 
So now we're going to turn to sales in the segments. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2019, which include Reign, increased 13.5% from $935.1 million to $1.06 billion from the comparable period in 2018. 
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $10.8 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the quarter would have been up 14.7%. 
The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 16.6%. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment, which includes Predator, our affordable energy brand, was $66.3 million for the third quarter as compared to $74.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movement. 
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.9 million in the third quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter in 2018. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $379.8 million, that's 33.5% of total net sales in the 2019 third quarter compared to $283 million or 28.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. 
Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.2 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Now we turn to sales in EMEA. In EMEA, supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.1% in dollars and increased 40.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.3% compared to 41.3% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix as well as increases in manufacturing costs. 
We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa and Spain. 
Now turning to Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 43.6% in dollars and 43.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales, was 40.5% versus 44.1% over the same period in 2018 as a result of country and product mix.

In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 12.8% in dollars and 7.2% in local currencies, although I'd like to point out that Monster increased 4.5% in dollars and 10.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018. 
Now turning to sales in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 41.5% in dollars and 51% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% for both periods. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 80.2% in dollars and increased 82.3% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 70.9% in dollars and increased 84.2% in local currency in the quarter. 
So now turning to new products in North America. In the United States, we launched Monster Mule Ginger Brew nationally, Reign Orange Dreamsicle, Monster MAXX, Mango Magic and Monster MAXX Rad Red extra strength with zero sugar at the end of September. 
In October, we launched Java Monster Farmer's Oats, which contains oat milk and is nondairy and vegan as well as 2 new flavors in the Reign brand family, Strawberry Sublime and Mango Magic. In 2020 in the United States, we will be discontinuing our Cafe Monster line of products and repositioning our Espresso Monster line. 
In Canada, in the third quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Pacific Punch nationally in July as well as Monster Mill nationally in September. 
During the third quarter of 2019 in Mexico, we launched Pipeline Punch. During the third quarter of 2019 in Brazil, we launched Absolutely Zero, Ultra Violet as well as Mango Loco. 
Now turning to new products in EMEA. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Greece, Poland and Slovenia in the third quarter of 2019 and is now available in 15 markets across EMEA. Espresso Monster was made available in 6 markets in EMEA, France, Great Britain, Germany, Norway, Spain and Sweden in both milk and vanilla variants during the 2019 third quarter. We also recently launched both variants in Belgium and Ireland in October 2019, and we'll launch both in Poland this month. We are pleased with the performance of Espresso Monster in EMEA. 
We are planning to roll out 2 flavors of Espresso Monster into a further 12 markets in the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020. Additionally, we are looking to launch our new salted caramel espresso variant in 8 EMEA markets over the course of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2020. 
Reign was launched in Sweden in the third quarter of 2019 and we're planning to launch Reign in a further 2 markets by the end of 2019. We're planning to launch Monster in Israel in the fourth quarter of 2019. We're planning to launch Predator, our affordable energy brand in Ethiopia, Kenya, Poland, Uganda and Zambia in the 2019 fourth quarter. 
Turning to new products in Asia Pacific. We launched Monster Green in 500-milliliter resealable aluminum bottles in Japan during the 2019 third quarter. In Korea, we launched Pipeline Punch with initial positive results. We launched Ultra White in India and completed its rollout in Vietnam during the 2019 third quarter. Ultra Paradise launched in Australia in July and in New Zealand in September, and Mango Loco was successfully relaunched in July after resolution of local production capabilities. 
We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific over the upcoming months, including a full relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in the spring of 2020. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $717.6 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $587.4 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $648 million at September 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 44.6 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $317.7 million at September 30, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory was 62.1 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018. 
Now we're going to talk a little about our October 2019 gross sales. We estimate October 2019 gross sales to be approximately 7.3% higher than in October 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, October 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 8.6% higher than comparable October 2018 gross sales. The comparative gross sales in October 2018 included advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products, effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, we estimate gross sales for the month of October 2019 would have been approximately 14.6% higher than in October 2018. 
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you need to actually determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
Share repurchase programs. During the 2019 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $58.60 per share for a total of $254.3 million, excluding broker commissions. 
As of November 6, 2019, approximately $36.6 million remains available for -- $36.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On November 6, 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Number two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Number three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020. Fourthly, we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S. but looking further abroad. Number five, we're pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. 
Net sales in the third quarter in EMEA increased 40.1% in local currency. In Asia Pacific increased 43.4% in local currency, and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 51.0% in local currency. We reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. 
And lastly, we're proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy drink brands internationally. We're also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

And so if you can help us with the positioning of the core Monster, which I understand correct -- if I understand correctly, it was down 2.4% on outlets and declined 5% in convenience, do you believe that is related to the promotional environment of your main competitor?

You're seeing the increases coming from us and our main competitor coming from new products. So -- but if you look at the total category, the total category remains healthy, it's up 9%, which is really good growth. So the category is growing, there's been a shift within the category. We -- you've got to look at brands and whatever we have in the category. So you look at the fact that we're down or some of the individual SKUs are down, but overall, the category is growing, our overall corporate sales are growing. We will address, obviously, individual SKUs. And I think this is an experience that's been experienced by general consumer products for established brands. There's a movement generally on consumers to want to try new products, new flavors, new innovation. And we do have a new innovation, which we -- some of it, we've announced, we've recently launched. We have plans to launch quite a lot of new innovation. I think that in some cases, some of our new innovation that we launched earlier this year, perhaps didn't get enough shelf space or they've been -- some shelf space taken from our existing products, which I think has affected sales. 
So looking at -- one of the sort of main things, I think we will look at going forward is improving the quality of our distribution, getting out our innovation more efficiently and more effectively on the shelves. And as we go forward, we believe there will be additional space allocated to the performance energy category, which will relieve pressure on the space we're looking for, for our existing energy brands and the innovation under the Monster line."

Having said that, I just want to reiterate that the category, if you look back 52 weeks, the energy category has shown incremental growth per Nielsen of $1.3 billion. So this is a growing category. And it's a category that now has a new segment, which is performance energy and performance energy is growing within that category. And as I look at some of our other competitors, and this is no defense. But as we look, for example, even at Red Bull, which is growing and we mentioned on the call that it's growing. The Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth. The diet SKUs are and their additions are. But in general, the Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth and are in decline. Having said that, we have got plans with our distribution, which has been a challenge to dramatically improve distribution and distribution on shelf and in the coolers."

And then if I could, a related question, building on what you just said, but in the context of Coke Energy, I think that we all appreciate what you and Coke have each said about the intended interplay between Monster and really Monster and Reign and Coke Energy and that they're targeted different consumers and designed to minimize cannibalization risk. But given that they'll be going through common distributors, just how confident are you that those new Coke SKUs won't take away from some of your smaller SKUs, whether Monster, Reign, NOS, Full Throttle or otherwise, rather than having them successfully find incremental space in the cooler or take away from competition distributed by others?"

Nielsen are sales out, our sales are sales to the distributors, the bottlers. We have a slew of unmeasured channels that I mentioned. And while it's a good indication of what -- of the movement of sales, it's not an absolute science. And one has to be very wary and we've said this on many calls in the past. One's got to be very careful of trying to balance our sales to our bottlers and our distributors with sales out to the consumer. Nielsen read a sample. They don't read all the channels. They don't read, as I said, the foodservice, they don't read Amazon, they don't read Costco, they don't read the Home Depots and the Lowe's and all the other channels where our products are distributed. So it's difficult to draw a comparison from one to the other. All we can do is give you the facts and you guys make your own assessments from there."

I think that most of the analysts are very up-to-date and astute on analyzing Nielsen. Well, they should be looking at analyzing Nielsen around the world, and that would give everybody their own view on what's been happening with the rollout of Coke Energy around the world. 
We've seen the brand rollout, and we've also seen the rate of sale, not keeping pace with initial sales. The percentage market share has been small and hasn't really had an impact on us. The main impact that, I think we've repeatedly said is, that we did have concerns for is the sort of noise and the -- in the market and focus from diversion of focus. But ultimately, in Europe, things are settling down. Our growth rates of our brands are on track and have continued. And I think that, by and large, the Coke system has pretty much focused on not trying to cannibalize our existing product and take [ facings ] from us, and it's worked reasonably well. There've been a few countries where there have been some challenges and we've addressed them. 
So again, we don't know. We can't tell what Coke Energy will be in the United States. It's formulated a little differently. It's a little different in sizes. There's 2 variants. But ultimately, we think that we just need to manage the lack of focus or conflict of focusing from -- to bottlers. Ultimately, we don't think it will have a major impact on our brand, and we will manage it and going forward and how you feel..."

So you touched on some of the supply chain issues in EMEA having been resolved and kind of talking directionally to stabilization or at least that's maybe my interpretation of it. LatAm was obviously flat in gross margin. So is the worst behind you at this point? Do you have any more visibility on that? I'm not asking for guidance. I'd love a personal point of view of kind of how we should all think about that since I think it's one of those areas that is a bit more of a black box than others.

I mean, we sell concentrates at high margins and through the strategic brands, and we sell finished products at different margins that really are based for a number of factors on the relationships we have developed with the bottlers and distributors in various countries and the cost of production. So it's always -- every quarter, the issue is how much did we sell internationally which has lower margins, and I'll get on to that. And I think I discussed it on a previous call. And how much strategic brands did we sell as a corporation versus finished goods at Monster Energy. So when we established our model in the United States, the distributors were allocated a margin, which was satisfactory to them, and we had the lion's share of the margin. 
As we've grown internationally in more virgin territories, the bottlers in the Coke system, where we've transitioned or launched with, they've demanded a higher share of the value chain. And this is something that we've had to deal with, understanding that if we want to launch in various countries internationally that's going to cost us more in margin than in the U.S., where we had a very established business. And the Coca-Cola bottlers segued into this established business with the same margins. 
We also have different cost impacts around the world, which we try to manage as best as we can. And then one of the other issues that we are facing is that our juice products are doing very well. 
Our coffee products are doing very well and they themselves have lower margins than the traditional Monster beverages, which have -- and of course, the diets have the best margin of all. 
So you have this issue of competing margins. However, there are things we can do with the juice products. We can establish greater efficiencies. We had a big improvement this year in this quarter in the U.S. In fact, in freight, getting product and raw materials to our co-packers. That was a big benefit. The other benefit that we had in the U.S. was in aluminum. So there's a difficult range of factors that go into what the overall consolidated margin is. It's not just a simple one calculation. But we are working on it. And as we've done in the U.S. and as we've done with [ freight in ], we continue to look at our model internationally and see where we can improve on our gross margin percentages. And as I've always said, Mark, we sell products, and we make gross profit dollars, we don't make gross profit percentages."

In the third quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.13 billion, up 11.6% from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%. 
The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States [ portion ] of our products, effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%. 
Turning now to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4% compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases as well as reduced input costs. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018. 
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales was 6.5% compared to 6.2% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $10.4 million primarily due to head count growth, both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $16 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018. 
Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as a decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition, the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit. 
Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, an increase of 11.6%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018. 
Now we turn to The Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by or transitioned to Coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year. 
We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019. In China, we completed the rollout of both Monster Ultra White and Monster Mango in the third quarter. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Ultra White into approximately 20% of our accounts in September. We will continue Ultra's expansion into the fourth quarter as well as commencing the launch of Mango Loco to leverage consumer taste preferences in India. 
I'll now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. 
In August 2019, VPX filed another lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, alleging a host of legal challenges, including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. Monster will seek the dismissal of VPX's most recent lawsuit. 
In October 2019, the U.S. court -- the U.S. District Court for the Southern District denied VPX's motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In its decision, the court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to established that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims. VPX recently announced an intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. We recently filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster's trademark rights in this way. 
In one of the court filings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign through October was solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers, were lower than our initial expectations. 
As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including retail authorizations, the dates on which listings are secured for products at major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. 
As our litigation with VPX is sub judice we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
Now we're going to turn to the Nielsen reports in North America. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 26, 2019, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.1% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Red Bull increased 6.4%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 10.8%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 9% and sales of Amp decreased 42.4%. As there were no comparable sales of our Reign products last year, we have not referenced Reign. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 6.5% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, which include Reign, grew 2.5% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel.

Rockstar was down 11.2%, 5-Hour was down 7.9%, and Amp was down 35.1%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.6 points over the same period the previous year to 40.7%. Monster's share decreased 4.1 share points to 33.5%, Reign's share was 3%, NOS' share declined 0.4 share points to 3.6%, and Full Throttle share declined 0.2 points to 2.7%. Red Bull share decreased 0.5 points to 33.2%. Rockstar share was down 1.1 points to 5.4%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.9 points at 5.5% and Amp's share decreased 0.2 points to 2.4%. VPX Bang's share increased 4.2 points to 8.2%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which includes Cafe Monster and Espresso Monster in dollars for the convenience and gas channel increased 7.4% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Monster -- Java Monster alone were down from 6% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 5.9% lower, while sales of Starbucks energy were 18.1% higher. 
Our company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Cafe Monster, Expresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, was 49.3%, down 7 points. Java Monster share on its own for the 4 weeks ended October 26, 2019, was 44.7% down 2.6 points, while Starbucks energy share was 47.9%, up 4.3 points. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 14, 2019, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 5% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 37.6%, down 0.7 points. Monster's market share remained the same at 33.9 share points. NOS' sales decreased 7%, and its market share decreased 0.4 share points to 2.6%. Full Throttle sales decreased 15%, and its market share decreased 0.3 points to 1.1%. Red Bull's sales increased 6% and its market share decreased 0.2 points to 37.5%, Rockstar's sales increased 12%, and its market share increased 0.8 points to 15.7%. 
Turning to Mexico. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico. The energy drink category grew 14% for the month of September 2019, Monster sales increased 10.5%. Our market share in value decreased by 0.9 points to 29.3%, against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 48%. Burn's market share decreased 1 point to 0.8%, Red Bull sales decreased 5.1%, and its market share decreased by 1.6 points to 7.8%. Vive 100 sales decreased 11.3%, and its market share decreased by 7.7 points to 27.1%. 
Bolt sales increased 53.5%, and its market share increased 4.5 share points to 17.5% while Boost sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 6.9%. Amper, an affordable energy brand launched in March, increased its market share to 8.7% in the month of September 2019.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
And now we turn to EMEA. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. 
According to Nielsen, the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 12.3% to 12.9% in Belgium, from 23.3% to 27.6% in France, from 20.9% to 21.5% in Great Britain, from 7.1% to 7.2% in The Netherlands, from 18.0% to 23.7% in Norway and from 30.3% to 33.4% in Spain. In the same period, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 13.7% to 13.1% in Sweden. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended in September 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.6% to 15.8% in Germany and from 10.7% to 15% in Poland.

According to Nielsen in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of September 2019 increased from 17.7% to 26.2% as compared to the same month the previous year. 
According to Nielsen in Argentina for the month of September 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 13.9% to 27.9% compared to the same month the previous year. 
Turning to Asia Pacific, according to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended September 29, 2019, increased from 9.1% to 9.6% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 13.7% to 12.9% during the same period. 
According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended September 29, 2019, increased from 5.7% to 6.2% as compared to the same period the previous year. Lift Plus' market share in value decreased from 8.8% to 8.3%, and Mother's market share in value increased from 6.8% to 8%. 
According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the quarter ended September 2019 grew from 38.3% to 40.5% as compared to the same period in the previous year. Monster is now the leading energy brand by market share in value in all measured outlets in South Korea. 
According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the 13-week period ended September 30, 2019, grew from 48.9% to 51.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. 
So now we're going to turn to sales in the segments. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2019, which include Reign, increased 13.5% from $935.1 million to $1.06 billion from the comparable period in 2018. 
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $10.8 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the quarter would have been up 14.7%. 
The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 16.6%. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment, which includes Predator, our affordable energy brand, was $66.3 million for the third quarter as compared to $74.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movement. 
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.9 million in the third quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter in 2018. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $379.8 million, that's 33.5% of total net sales in the 2019 third quarter compared to $283 million or 28.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. 
Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.2 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Now we turn to sales in EMEA. In EMEA, supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.1% in dollars and increased 40.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.3% compared to 41.3% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix as well as increases in manufacturing costs. 
We're also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa and Spain. 
Now turning to Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 43.6% in dollars and 43.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales, was 40.5% versus 44.1% over the same period in 2018 as a result of country and product mix. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 60% in dollars and 55.5% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 15.9% in dollars and 23.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 12.8% in dollars and 7.2% in local currencies, although I'd like to point out that Monster increased 4.5% in dollars and 10.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018. 
Now turning to sales in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 41.5% in dollars and 51% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44% for both periods. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 80.2% in dollars and increased 82.3% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 70.9% in dollars and increased 84.2% in local currency in the quarter. 
So now turning to new products in North America. In the United States, we launched Monster Mule Ginger Brew nationally, Reign Orange Dreamsicle, Monster MAXX, Mango Magic and Monster MAXX Rad Red extra strength with zero sugar at the end of September. 
In October, we launched Java Monster Farmer's Oats, which contains oat milk and is nondairy and vegan as well as 2 new flavors in the Reign brand family, Strawberry Sublime and Mango Magic. In 2020 in the United States, we will be discontinuing our Cafe Monster line of products and repositioning our Espresso Monster line. 
In Canada, in the third quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Pacific Punch nationally in July as well as Monster Mill nationally in September. 
During the third quarter of 2019 in Mexico, we launched Pipeline Punch. During the third quarter of 2019 in Brazil, we launched Absolutely Zero, Ultra Violet as well as Mango Loco. 
Now turning to new products in EMEA. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Greece, Poland and Slovenia in the third quarter of 2019 and is now available in 15 markets across EMEA. Espresso Monster was made available in 6 markets in EMEA, France, Great Britain, Germany, Norway, Spain and Sweden in both milk and vanilla variants during the 2019 third quarter. We also recently launched both variants in Belgium and Ireland in October 2019, and we'll launch both in Poland this month. We are pleased with the performance of Espresso Monster in EMEA. 
We are planning to roll out 2 flavors of Espresso Monster into a further 12 markets in the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020. Additionally, we are looking to launch our new salted caramel espresso variant in 8 EMEA markets over the course of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2020. 
Reign was launched in Sweden in the third quarter of 2019 and we're planning to launch Reign in a further 2 markets by the end of 2019. We're planning to launch Monster in Israel in the fourth quarter of 2019. We're planning to launch Predator, our affordable energy brand in Ethiopia, Kenya, Poland, Uganda and Zambia in the 2019 fourth quarter. 
Turning to new products in Asia Pacific. We launched Monster Green in 500-milliliter resealable aluminum bottles in Japan during the 2019 third quarter. In Korea, we launched Pipeline Punch with initial positive results. We launched Ultra White in India and completed its rollout in Vietnam during the 2019 third quarter. Ultra Paradise launched in Australia in July and in New Zealand in September, and Mango Loco was successfully relaunched in July after resolution of local production capabilities. 
We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific over the upcoming months, including a full relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in the spring of 2020. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $717.6 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $587.4 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $648 million at September 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 44.6 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $317.7 million at September 30, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory was 62.1 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018. 
Now we're going to talk a little about our October 2019 gross sales. We estimate October 2019 gross sales to be approximately 7.3% higher than in October 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, October 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 8.6% higher than comparable October 2018 gross sales. The comparative gross sales in October 2018 included advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products, effective November 1, 2018. 
Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, we estimate gross sales for the month of October 2019 would have been approximately 14.6% higher than in October 2018. 
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you need to actually determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
Share repurchase programs. During the 2019 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $58.60 per share for a total of $254.3 million, excluding broker commissions. 
As of November 6, 2019, approximately $36.6 million remains available for -- $36.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On November 6, 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Number two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Number three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020. Fourthly, we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S. but looking further abroad. Number five, we're pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. 
Net sales in the third quarter in EMEA increased 40.1% in local currency. In Asia Pacific increased 43.4% in local currency, and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 51.0% in local currency. We reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. 
And lastly, we're proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy drink brands internationally. We're also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

You're seeing the increases coming from us and our main competitor coming from new products. So -- but if you look at the total category, the total category remains healthy, it's up 9%, which is really good growth. So the category is growing, there's been a shift within the category. We -- you've got to look at brands and whatever we have in the category. So you look at the fact that we're down or some of the individual SKUs are down, but overall, the category is growing, our overall corporate sales are growing. We will address, obviously, individual SKUs. And I think this is an experience that's been experienced by general consumer products for established brands. There's a movement generally on consumers to want to try new products, new flavors, new innovation. And we do have a new innovation, which we -- some of it, we've announced, we've recently launched. We have plans to launch quite a lot of new innovation. I think that in some cases, some of our new innovation that we launched earlier this year, perhaps didn't get enough shelf space or they've been -- some shelf space taken from our existing products, which I think has affected sales. 
So looking at -- one of the sort of main things, I think we will look at going forward is improving the quality of our distribution, getting out our innovation more efficiently and more effectively on the shelves. And as we go forward, we believe there will be additional space allocated to the performance energy category, which will relieve pressure on the space we're looking for, for our existing energy brands and the innovation under the Monster line."

Having said that, I just want to reiterate that the category, if you look back 52 weeks, the energy category has shown incremental growth per Nielsen of $1.3 billion. So this is a growing category. And it's a category that now has a new segment, which is performance energy and performance energy is growing within that category. And as I look at some of our other competitors, and this is no defense. But as we look, for example, even at Red Bull, which is growing and we mentioned on the call that it's growing. The Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth. The diet SKUs are and their additions are. But in general, the Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth and are in decline. Having said that, we have got plans with our distribution, which has been a challenge to dramatically improve distribution and distribution on shelf and in the coolers."

So just how do you think about that 3% number in light of those factors building on Andrea's question.
And then if I could, a related question, building on what you just said, but in the context of Coke Energy, I think that we all appreciate what you and Coke have each said about the intended interplay between Monster and really Monster and Reign and Coke Energy and that they're targeted different consumers and designed to minimize cannibalization risk. But given that they'll be going through common distributors, just how confident are you that those new Coke SKUs won't take away from some of your smaller SKUs, whether Monster, Reign, NOS, Full Throttle or otherwise, rather than having them successfully find incremental space in the cooler or take away from competition distributed by others?"

And while it's a good indication of what -- of the movement of sales, it's not an absolute science. And one has to be very wary and we've said this on many calls in the past. One's got to be very careful of trying to balance our sales to our bottlers and our distributors with sales out to the consumer. Nielsen read a sample. They don't read all the channels. They don't read, as I said, the foodservice, they don't read Amazon, they don't read Costco, they don't read the Home Depots and the Lowe's and all the other channels where our products are distributed.

I think that most of the analysts are very up-to-date and astute on analyzing Nielsen. Well, they should be looking at analyzing Nielsen around the world, and that would give everybody their own view on what's been happening with the rollout of Coke Energy around the world. 
We've seen the brand rollout, and we've also seen the rate of sale, not keeping pace with initial sales. The percentage market share has been small and hasn't really had an impact on us. The main impact that, I think we've repeatedly said is, that we did have concerns for is the sort of noise and the -- in the market and focus from diversion of focus. But ultimately, in Europe, things are settling down. Our growth rates of our brands are on track and have continued. And I think that, by and large, the Coke system has pretty much focused on not trying to cannibalize our existing product and take [ facings ] from us, and it's worked reasonably well. There've been a few countries where there have been some challenges and we've addressed them. 
So again, we don't know. We can't tell what Coke Energy will be in the United States. It's formulated a little differently. It's a little different in sizes. There's 2 variants. But ultimately, we think that we just need to manage the lack of focus or conflict of focusing from -- to bottlers.

I mean, we sell concentrates at high margins and through the strategic brands, and we sell finished products at different margins that really are based for a number of factors on the relationships we have developed with the bottlers and distributors in various countries and the cost of production. So it's always -- every quarter, the issue is how much did we sell internationally which has lower margins, and I'll get on to that. And I think I discussed it on a previous call. And how much strategic brands did we sell as a corporation versus finished goods at Monster Energy. So when we established our model in the United States, the distributors were allocated a margin, which was satisfactory to them, and we had the lion's share of the margin. 
As we've grown internationally in more virgin territories, the bottlers in the Coke system, where we've transitioned or launched with, they've demanded a higher share of the value chain. And this is something that we've had to deal with, understanding that if we want to launch in various countries internationally that's going to cost us more in margin than in the U.S., where we had a very established business. And the Coca-Cola bottlers segued into this established business with the same margins. 
We also have different cost impacts around the world, which we try to manage as best as we can. And then one of the other issues that we are facing is that our juice products are doing very well. 
Our coffee products are doing very well and they themselves have lower margins than the traditional Monster beverages, which have -- and of course, the diets have the best margin of all. 
So you have this issue of competing margins. However, there are things we can do with the juice products. We can establish greater efficiencies. We had a big improvement this year in this quarter in the U.S. In fact, in freight, getting product and raw materials to our co-packers. That was a big benefit. The other benefit that we had in the U.S. was in aluminum. So there's a difficult range of factors that go into what the overall consolidated margin is. It's not just a simple one calculation. But we are working on it. And as we've done in the U.S. and as we've done with [ freight in ], we continue to look at our model internationally and see where we can improve on our gross margin percentages. And as I've always said, Mark, we sell products, and we make gross profit dollars, we don't make gross profit percentages."

We have -- and as we continue to expand and have sufficient volumes in countries, we are switching to local production in those countries. We've opened up quite a number of additional production facilities in Europe this year and have got a number -- a large number going forward. And as we go forward, we think that will certainly help our margins internationally as well. But at this point, we just don't think there's any numbers we can point you to."
