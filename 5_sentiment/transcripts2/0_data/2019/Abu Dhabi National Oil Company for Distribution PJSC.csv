Thank you for joining us today. Please allow me to start first by introducing Mohammad Al Hashmi, our new Chief Operating Officer, who has joined our leadership team to focus on execution of the company's ambition growth strategy. 
Mohamed is replacing John Carey, who has recently elected to step down as Deputy CEO, but he will continue in an advisory capacity for the time being. Joined at a time of our IPO and has provided an excellent concept and leadership to our business as we successfully completed our [indiscernible] of the security exchange. 
I would like to place on record our thanks to John for his dedicated efforts during an important period of the company's growth and evolution. Before we go into the first half highlights, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. We continue to enhance investment safety solutions. 
So in terms of financial performance, we have delivered a 2.8% increase in EBITDA to USD 404 million in the first of 2019 versus the same period in 2018. Excluding inventory gains, EBITDA grew by 11% to USD 371 million in the first half of 2019 and that is mainly driven by continued cost efficiency improvements across the business and better corporate and nonfuel performance. 
We have also shown continued momentum with the first half of 2019 EBITDA margin, reaching 14.4%, up from the 13.2% during the same period last year. We also made significant progress in our cost savings, with OpEx of USD 36 million on like-to-like basis in the first half of 2019. 
During the first half, we added 3 new service stations and 12 new convenience stores to our current footprint. We are on track to deliver on our transformation initiative and growth plans. During the remainder of 2019, we are focused on the acceleration of our domestic growth network expansion particularly in Dubai and the growth of our own nonfuel business to provide superior experience to our customers. We also continue to explore opportunities to grow internationally, including Saudi Arabia in markets that we deliver against our investment criteria of [ 13% ] IRR threshold. 
Cost efficiencies also remain a core focus, and we will continue to improve our OpEx and CapEx plans. Finally, we try to continue to deliver strong and sustainable growth, while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. This is evidenced by the announcement on [ April ] of a significant increase to our dividend confirming our confidence in our growth strategy and future cash flow generation. I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy execution."

Thank you, Saeed. I am pleased that on my first call with you, we can show solid progress on our growth strategy.

I am pleased that on my first call with you, we can show solid progress on our growth strategy. So I met many of you around the time of the IPO back in 2017 as well as our recent Capital Markets day, both in London and New York. So just to add a bit of background, I was closely involved in the ADNOC Distribution's IPO process, and I've delivered large-scale projects, transactions and partnerships as Senior Vice President of Group's strategic investments for the ADNOC Group. 
More recently, I was also Advisor to the ADNOC Distribution executive committee. This has helped provide me with in-depth knowledge of the ADNOC Distribution business, and more importantly, its plans for growth. ADNOC Distribution remains focused on delivering its ambitious strategy as well as building long-term shareholder value through the next phase of our growth. Now we've delivered strong first half year results with more to come. So let me begin by giving you an update on the retail fuel segment, our first strategic pillar. 
During the Capital Markets Day, we presented a refreshed investment proposition and we announced key initiatives to be implemented during the course of 2019 and beyond. So in line with earlier guidance that most of our new stations will open towards the end of 2019, I'm pleased to announce that we remain on track to open 20 to 30 new stations across the UAE this year, and we are clearly focused on accelerating our footprint in Dubai. 
So in the first half alone, we've opened 3 new stations in UAE and also pleased to announce that we have just opened 2 additional stations in Dubai this week, leading to a total of 6 service stations currently operating in Dubai. So our domestic network expansion track -- target is on track, and we've already identified an in-advance stage of execution on 18 new sites. 
Secondly, on Saudi Arabia, we will provide more color on our expansion plans and operating model during our Q3 results announcement. Our focus at present remains on our whole market. So in the second quarter, we launched a number of marketing promotions to address the anticipated lower retail fuel volume, and we've encouraged our customers to register in our Wallet mobile application towards the enhancement of our overall customer experience. We were pleased to see encouraging results, with fuel retail volumes stable in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019. 
On the Corporate segment, we've achieved 5.5% year-on-year growth in volumes in the first half of 2019. Now this was driven by increased sales of LPG, lubricants as well as base oil. So we expect this trend in corporate volumes to continue during 2019 following significant government investments in the economy. In the first half of 2019, we also entered the commercial [ 100 pound ] cylinder market in Dubai. Now we've chosen to enter the Dubai LPG market by partnering with established distributors, which now gives us a quick route to market and an effective entry. 
So moving on to nonfuel retail. First half of 2019, we opened 12 new convenience stores across the UAE. Now 10 of these were opened in the second quarter of 2019 at our existing retail sites. At the end of the first half 2019, we had a total of 262 convenience stores. Now 14 of these are Géant stores. Our -- the company's convenience stores revitalization programs which I alluded to yesterday, also offers our customers a significantly improved shopping experience. Pleased to say that this is on track and is contributing to positive convenience store performance. 
Improvements were also seen in gross margins and an overall uplift in the average basket size in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Sales revenue for convenience stores was up by 26.17% year-on-year in the first half of 2019. Gross profit increased by 28.9% and the average convenience store basket size increased by 6.8% year-on-year in first half 2019. 
Now this has been achieved through various factors: Improving the look and feel in our stores; better category management adapting to the demand of our customers; and the introduction of fresh grab-and-go concept; positive performance of Géant stores; rewards issued to our customers under the Flex Initiative; and an improved customer value proposition through the introduction of promotions supported by in-store marketing. 
So at the end of the second quarter 2019, ADNOC Flex Premium penetration was 15% to 20% on average, in-line with what we have seen in the first quarter. 
Now to sum up, we are going to continue our expansion, and we remain absolutely committed to our convenience store revitalization program in order to further improve our overall customer experience. 
So finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative, The third pillar of our strategic plan. We have made significant progress in rationalizing our cash OpEx. I'm pleased to say that we've achieved $36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the first half of 2019 mainly driven by cost-optimization initiatives. Now we are on track to achieve around $15 million of OpEx savings in 2019 on a like-for-like basis. 
In terms of capital expenditure, so far, we've spent $38 million of capital in the first half of 2019. As I've stated, we remain focused on defining a network expansion allocation in the first half of 2019. As also mentioned earlier, our network rollout is scheduled for operational deployment towards the end of this year. In line with that, we expect to accelerate our capital expenditure in the second half of 2019. We maintained our guidance on capital expenditure for the year of up to $300 million to boost our network expansion in the UAE and internationally, with 20 to 30 new sites in the UAE, primarily in Dubai, to accelerate our convenience store expansion, to continue to significantly improve our customer experience and to invest in our IT infrastructure and digital initiatives. 
So in addition to the savings we have achieved so far, we see more room to achieve further capital expenditure efficiency in building new sites. So at this point, I will now hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance."

So as Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of our initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive results in the first half despite the decrease in overall fuel volumes. The fi",980,"Many thanks, Mohamed, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. So as Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of our initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive results in the first half despite the decrease in overall fuel volumes. The first half revenues reached [ USD 2.8 billion, ] down by 6.3% compared to the first half of 2018. This decline in revenues was mainly driven by lower fuel volumes sold as well as lower pump average prices. 
We used an example of a [ 95-gasoline ] obtain average pump prices for the first were 8.5% below first half [ 2018. ] Having said that, we saw a continuous improvement in our convenience stores ors business, with an increase in revenues by 26.7% in the first half to [ USD 207 million ] driven by the revitalization program that Mohamed was talking about. 
We do see green shoot in our corporate business. Volumes are up 5.5% year-on-year driven by increasing LPG and lubricant sales following significant government investments in the UAE economy. Our gross profit reached USD 675 million, down 5% compared to the previous year. The decrease is mainly due to the lower inventory gains in the first half, $33 million versus $58 million in 2018 in our regional business. 
Meanwhile, we achieved a 10% increase in our nonfuel gross profit mainly coming from the convenience stores in the first half compared to the 2018 period, and this is driven by the improved category management and our Fuel Rewards program. 
Our gross profit margin has also shown continued momentum and is still to an accelerating level, reaching 24.1% in the first half of 2019, up from 23.8% last year. And this is driven by lower revenue to lower pump prices compared with the secured minimum rates marching as per the Ministry of Energy Regulations in UAE. 
Finally, our total EBITDA for the first half reached $404 million, representing an increase of 2.8% year-on-year driven by the continued cost efficiencies, growth in the corporate segment and more dynamic product pricing. We've made significant progress in rationalizing our OpEx and have stated achieving USD 36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the first half driven by the cost optimization initiatives. Our cash opEx declined by 16.5% in the first half compared to first half last year, reaching $282 million. Excluding the inventory gains of $33 million for Q2 '19 and $58 million for the first half 2018, the underlying EBITDA grew by 11% year-on-year in the first half, once again, driven by the cost efficiency improvements across the whole business. 
Finally, we generated strong free cash flow measured as EBITDA minus CapEx. Free cash flow is up by 21% year-on-year to $366 million in the first half driven by also higher EBITDA and lower CapEx. 
Overall, fuel sales volumes were down in first half by 1.7% driven by a 3.5% decrease in fuel rate volumes mainly due to increased competition as well as the impact of the longer public holiday in the second quarter 2019 compared to the same period last year. 
On the Corporate segment side, volumes increased by 5.5% first half driven by the higher sales of the LPG, lubricant and base oil, as stated earlier. And finally, our [ EBIT ] and segment volumes sold to the strategic customers were marginally up in the first half [ 2019. ] Looking at the gross profit performance by segment. Gross profit for nonfuel retail mainly convenience stores increased by 10% year-on-year in the first half. This is reflecting our diversification strategy towards nonfuel retail and implementation of the new initiatives to improve customer experience, including a much more focused stores revitalization program as well as the positive contribution from our Fuel Rewards program. Our fuel retail gross profit decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by the decrease in fuel retail volumes as well as lower inventory gains as stated earlier in the first half of 2019. In the Corporate segment, gross profit has increased in the first half by 12.3% and margin has increased from 18.5% to 19.8% on the back of the increase in volumes, better inventory management as well as more dynamic product pricing. 
And finally, our aviation gross profit has decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by lower aviation services and civil aviation OpEx recovery under the arrangement we have with the parent company, ADNOC. 
Moving onto EBITDA. Total EBITDA for first half reached $404 million. This is an increase of 2.8% year-on-year. As stated earlier, continued cost efficiencies as well as Corporate segment performance is contributing to this increase, together with higher corporate volumes. 
Our fuel and nonfuel read compact EBITDA increased by 0.3% and Corporate segment by 29.4% year-on-year in the first half. Q2 2019 EBITDA grew -- growth was driven by retail segment, with an increase in EBITDA margins driven by cost efficiencies despite the lower volumes. Q2 '19 Corporate EBITDA was flat due to lower diesel margins partially offset by cost efficiencies and higher volumes. 
And finally, Aviation EBITDA was flat due to stable volumes and cost efficiencies partially offset by lower aviation services revenue. Excluding the inventory gains realized in the second quarter '19 and during the first half 2018, $33 million and $58 million, respectively, underlying EBITDA increased year-on-year by 11% during the first half. 
And finally, a few comments on our cash position and cash flow during the first half. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations partially offset by a decrease in working capital movement as a result of increase in our receivables. 
Overall, strong cash flow generation has resulted in a net to EBITDA ratio of only 0.02x at the end of June 2019. Let me now hand it back over to Saeed to present our outlook for current year."

First to start with in terms of the fuel retail business. Just seems that you're opening your stations but just looking at the throughput per station, it's down 11% year-over-year in Q2, it was down around 9% year-over-year in Q1 2019. I was just trying to get the color that, I mean, the throughput per station is not stabilizing and it's still negative. So I just want to hear your thoughts on that. And I mean, maybe you can elaborate more that as you open maybe more stations in Dubai, less cannibalization, higher throughput, so any color on how we are moving into H2 in terms of throughput per station would be helpful. And if you can also give us some detail on how then the stations in Dubai have been faring, at least the ones that you have opened 6 to 9 months ago. So that's my first question. My second question is on the ADNOC Flex. Just looking at the press releases overall, it seems that you've waved the Flex in July for everyone and for a couple of customers in August. I mean, I just -- I don't know, correct me if I'm wrong, just seems to be counterintuitive to push out Flex during the summer months when should expect seasonality at least to the penetration, so I just want to understand what's the rationale behind that. And we're just still hearing the 15% to 20% penetration since the beginning of the year. I mean, is it taking much more time? I mean, is there any change in terms of the focus of how you're approaching Flex, especially that with expansions in Dubai, my guess is that you wouldn't be rolling out Flex because your competition is not charging premium services. I'll just leave it there and maybe if I get the chance, I'll ask more. And just one follow-up. Can we get a breakdown of the retail revenue between fuel and nonfuel? Just for us to get a better understanding on how the gross margin is doing primarily on the C-Stores, which is an area that you've been executing well. I'll leave it there."

So this is for the, I would say, nonfuel performance because nonfuel is mainly the convenience store as you know. Regarding your question on the throughput per station. So throughput per station is total volume divided by the total of stations that we have. As you know, the retail volumes are down 4.9% year-on-year and the number of stations are up 4.4%, which gives you the 10% decline in the throughput per station. Then I will hand over to Mohamed on the performance of the Dubai stations. But what we expect in a nutshell is in the second half with the new stations in Dubai, where we will have additional volume, higher market share that the volumes will be higher than what we had in the first half."

What's encouraging is that compared to first quarter 2019, our retail volumes in the second quarter have been slightly up. So as you alluded to, we've launched promotions such as Good Morning UAE, that was one. And Fuel Up and Fly Off, that was the second one. These promotions, the intent there was to improve our loyal customer base. So we're also working in parallel on an in hand rewards program as well as a seamless payment system all in order to provide superior customer experience. Now this is where our current promotion, the 11 to 5 campaign that you alluded to, month 1 was to encourage sign-ups. You all customers pulling our previous solicitations were offered the service for free. But month 2, our interns are pushed to get people to sign up for the digital rewards program that we are planning to roll out during Q3. The idea was to encourage our customers more strongly to remove it from our customers over not signing up for the program. Hence, it is no longer free for a certain segment of customers and it continues to be free for those who are signing up for the ADNOC Wallet, that's basically a digital platform. But again, the idea is to drive our customers to move into our loyalty scheme. More details of that will be provided shortly but we are deciding in the phase -- in the final phase designing and ADNOC rewards program and all of our moves are calculated from a ADNOC rewards program. Okay. As far as the summer promotion, the Hello Summer, third quarter of 2019, this has again encouraged our customers to adopt our digital platform, which allows us, our marketing initiatives, to lay the groundwork for the upcoming rewards program. Again, all of it is towards providing a superior experience to our customers. Now what do we expect out of this digital platform? Simple, create customer stickiness. Once they have signed up, we incentivize their constant return and ultimate loyalty to ADNOC Distribution. We expect this to improve the convenience store as well as the allied services Wallet bit. The way the Rewards program is being designed, it will incentivize fuel premiumization, moving up from [ 95 to 98 ] for instance as well as an overall uplift in volumes. It's also complements the expansion at the moment, both in Dubai as well as in Northern Emirates, which is where true organic growth in terms of volumes will come from. In addition to all this, we continue to work on overhauling our total customer experience. We have a vision, that is to be the best-in-class fuel and nonfuel retailer, and we're making very, very good strides against that."

So we have been, in other words, very conservative last year. Now that we are executing our OpEx efficiency savings program, we've identified excessive provisions made earlier and they have been reversed fully evidencing the good progress that we have in our OpEx efficiencies.

What we expect is growth going forward with the forthcoming revitalization of our C stores. If you take now broader view on the contribution of the non-fuel business, which is today just below 10%, and you take the international benchmark, we are talking about more 30% to 50% of the profit for our peers.

These initiatives are really starting to resonate with our customers. So I'm really excited. At present, we have 14 Géant stores but the convenience store revitalization that we're going to do, which is part of our 2019 plan and then continues into 2020, the Oasis stores of course, not the Géant, stores but these are now Oasis stores that are going to be revamped look and feel and the overall customer experience will improve significantly, very excited about what kind of numbers we're going to report back on second half of 2019, but certainly, 2020 as well.

This the first part of the question. And the second part, how different is it in terms of conversion between a normal ADNOC Oasis C-Store, which was just revitalized, and the Géant, which is the 14 stores that you have, which apparently are doing very well? And recently, the new grab-and-go just fresh bakery. If you can just put things in perspective with some numbers on that, that would be very helpful."

So obviously, we are seeing in the C-Store where we had completely changed the look and feel, the assortment, all the products, et cetera, the material increase in our revenues and the profit. So this is the answer. Two, performance, Oasis versus just Géant, we said earlier in Q1 and the Capital Market day that the Géant stores have a higher profitability because we are using the knowledge of the Géant Group in terms of category management and how we organize the C-Stores. But our Oasis stores, which account today for 90% of our coming stores, we have brought new capabilities, people who are expert in the convenience stores, people coming from large retailer and working on the revitalization of the core business of the C-Store, which is Oasis. So we expect good results coming from Oasis, especially that we have, I would say, revitalizing completely the C-Stores, and the upside is, I would say much higher than what you would have for a store that we have with Géant, obviously. Does this answer your question?"

Thank you for joining us today. Please allow me to start first by introducing Mohamed Al Hashimi, our new Chief Operating Officer, who has joined our leadership team to focus on execution of the company's ambitious growth strategy. 
Mohamed is replacing John Carey, who has recently elected to step down as Deputy CEO, but he will continue in an advisory capacity for the time being. John joined us at a time of our IPO and has provided an excellent concept and leadership to our business as we successfully completed our listing on Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. 
I would like to place on record my thanks to John for his dedicated efforts during an important period of the company's growth and evolution. 
Before we go into the first half highlights, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. We continue to enhance and investment in safety solutions. 
So in terms of financial performance, we have delivered a 2.8% increase in EBITDA to USD 404 million in the first of 2019 versus the same period in 2018. Excluding inventory gains, EBITDA grew by 11% to USD 371 million in the first half of 2019, and that is mainly driven by continued cost efficiency improvements across the business and better corporate and nonfuel performance. 
We have also shown continued momentum with the first half of 2019 EBITDA margin, reaching 14.4%, up from the 13.2% during the same period last year. We also made significant progress in our cost savings with OpEx of USD 36 million on like-to-like basis in the first half of 2019. 
During the first half, we added 3 new service stations and 12 new convenience stores to our current footprint. We are on track to deliver on our transformation initiative and growth plans. During the remainder of 2019, we are focused on the acceleration of our domestic growth network expansion particularly in Dubai and the growth of our own nonfuel business to provide superior experience to our customers. We also continue to explore opportunities to grow internationally, including Saudi Arabia and markets that we deliver against our investment criteria of 13% IRR threshold. 
Cost efficiencies also remain a core focus, and we will continue to improve our OpEx and CapEx plans. Finally, we try to continue to deliver strong and sustainable growth while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. This is evidenced by the announcement on April of a significant increase to our dividend confirming our confidence in our growth strategy and future cash flow generation. 
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy execution."

Thank you, Saeed. I am pleased that on my first call with you, we can show solid progress on our growth strategy.

I am pleased that on my first call with you, we can show solid progress on our growth strategy. So I met many of you around the time of the IPO back in 2017 as well as our recent Capital Markets Day, both in London and New York. So just to add a bit of background, I was closely involved in the ADNOC Distribution's IPO process, and I've delivered large-scale projects, transactions and partnerships as Senior Vice President of Group's Strategic Investments for the ADNOC Group. 
More recently, I was also adviser to the ADNOC Distribution executive committee. This has helped provide me with in-depth knowledge of the ADNOC Distribution business, and more importantly, its plans for growth. ADNOC Distribution remains focused on delivering its ambitious strategy as well as building long-term shareholder value through the next phase of our growth. Now we've delivered strong first half year results with more to come. 
So let me begin by giving you an update on the Retail fuel segment, our first strategic pillar. 
During the Capital Markets Day, we presented a refreshed investment proposition, and we announced key initiatives to be implemented during the course of 2019 and beyond. So in line with earlier guidance that most of our new stations will open towards the end of 2019, I'm pleased to announce that we remain on track to open 20 to 30 new stations across the UAE this year, and we are clearly focused on accelerating our footprint in Dubai. 
So in the first half alone, we've opened 3 new stations in UAE and also pleased to announce that we have just opened 2 additional stations in Dubai this week. Leading to a total of 6 service stations currently operating in Dubai. So our domestic network expansion track -- target is on track, and we've already identified an in-advance stage of execution on 18 new sites. 
Secondly, on Saudi Arabia, we will provide more color on our expansion plans and operating model during our Q3 results announcement. Our focus at present remains on our home market. So in the second quarter, we launched a number of marketing promotions to address the anticipated lower retail fuel volumes, and we've encouraged our customers to register in our Wallet mobile application towards the enhancement of our overall customer experience. We were pleased to see encouraging results with fuel retail volumes stable in second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019. 
On the Corporate segment, we've achieved 5.5% year-on-year growth in volumes in the first half of 2019. Now this was driven by increased sales of LPG, lubricants as well as base oil. Now we expect this trend in corporate volumes to continue during 2019 following significant government investments in the economy. 
In first half of 2019, we also entered the commercial 100 lb cylinder market in Dubai. Now we've chosen to enter the Dubai LPG market by partnering with established distributors, which now gives us a quick route to market and an effective entry. 
So moving on to nonfuel retail. First half of 2019, we opened 12 new convenience stores across the UAE. Now 10 of these were opened in the second quarter of 2019 at our existing retail sites. At the end of first half 2019, we had a total of 262 convenience stores. Now 14 of these are Géant stores. Our -- the company's convenience stores revitalization programs, which I alluded to yesterday, also offers our customers a significantly improved shopping experience. Pleased to say that this is on track and is contributing to positive convenience store performance. 
Improvements were also seen in gross margins and an overall uplift in the average basket size in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Sales revenue from convenience stores was up by 26.7% year-on-year in first half of 2019. Gross profit increased by 28.9% and the average convenience store basket size increased by 6.8% year-on-year in first half 2019. 
Now this has been achieved through various factors. Improving the look and feel in our stores, better category management adapting to the demand of our customer, and the introduction of fresh grab-and-go concept, positive performance of Géant stores, rewards issued to our customers under the Flex initiative, and an improved customer value proposition through the introduction of promotions supported by in-store marketing. 
So at the end of the second quarter 2019, ADNOC Flex Premium penetration was 15% to 20% on average, in line with what we have seen in the first quarter. 
Now to sum up, we are going to continue our expansion, and we remain absolutely committed to our convenience store revitalization program in order to further improve our overall customer experience. 
So finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative, the third pillar of our strategic plan. We have made significant progress in rationalizing our cash OpEx. Pleased to say that we've achieved $36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the first half of 2019 mainly driven by cost-optimization initiatives. Now we are on track to achieve around $50 million of OpEx savings in 2019 on a like-for-like basis. 
In terms of capital expenditure, so far we've spent $38 million of capital in the first half of 2019. As I've stated, we remain focused on defining a network expansion allocation in the first half of 2019. As also mentioned earlier, our network rollout is scheduled for operational deployment towards the end of this year. In line with that, we expect to accelerate our capital expenditure in the second half of 2019. We maintained our guidance on capital expenditure for the year of up to $300 million to boost our network expansion in the UAE and internationally with 20 to 30 new sites in the UAE, primarily in Dubai to accelerate our convenience store expansion, to continue to significantly improve our customer experience and to invest in our IT infrastructure and digital initiatives. 
So in addition to the savings we have achieved so far, we see more room to achieve further capital expenditure efficiency in building new sites. 
So at this point, I will now hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance."

So as Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of our initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive results in the first half despite the decrease in overall fuel volumes. The first",966,"Many thanks, Mohamed, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. So as Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of our initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive results in the first half despite the decrease in overall fuel volumes. The first half revenues reached USD 2.8 billion, down by 6.3% when compared to the first half of 2018. This decline in revenues was mainly driven by lower fuel volumes sold as well as lower pump average prices. To use an example, our 95 gasoline octane average pump prices for the first were 8.5% below first half 2018. Having said that, we saw a continuous improvement in our convenience stores business with an increase in revenues by 26.7% in the first half to USD 107 million driven by the revitalization program that Mohamed was talking about. 
We do see green shoot in our Corporate business. Volumes are up 5.5% year-on-year driven by increase in LPG and lubricant sales following significant government investments in the UAE economy. Our gross profit reached USD 675 million, down 5% compared to the previous year. The decrease is mainly due to the lower inventory gains in the first half, $33 million versus $58 million in the 2018 in our Retail business. 
Meanwhile, we achieved a 10% increase in our nonfuel gross profit mainly coming from the convenience stores in the first half compared to the 2018 period, and this is driven by the improved category management and our fuel rewards program. 
Our gross profit margin has also shown continued momentum and is still at an industrial leading level, reaching 24.1% in the first half of 2019, up from 23.8% last year. And this is driven by lower revenue due to lower pump prices compared with the secured minimum retail margin as per the Ministry of Energy regulations here in UAE. 
Finally, our total EBITDA for the first half reached $404 million, representing an increase of 2.8% year-on-year driven by the continued cost efficiencies, growth in the corporate segment and more dynamic product pricing. We've made significant progress in rationalizing our OpEx and have stated achieving USD 36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings during the first half driven by the cost optimization initiatives. Our cash OpEx declined by 16.5% in the first half compared to first half last year, reaching $282 million. Excluding the inventory gains of $33 million for Q2 '19 and $58 million for the first half 2018, the underlying EBITDA grew by 11% year-on-year in the first half, once again, driven by the cost efficiency improvements across the whole business. 
Finally, we generated strong free cash flow measured as EBITDA minus CapEx. Free cash flow is up by 21% year-on-year to $366 million in the first half driven by also higher EBITDA and lower CapEx. 
Overall, fuel sales volumes were down in first half by 1.7% driven by 3.5% decrease in fuel rate volumes mainly due to increased competition as well as the impact of the longer public holiday in second quarter 2019 compared to the same period last year. 
On the Corporate segment side, volumes increased by 5.5% first half driven by the higher sales of the LPG, lubricant and base oil as stated earlier. And finally, our Aviation segment volumes sold to the strategic customers were marginally up in the first half 2019. 
Looking at the gross profit performance by segment. Gross profit for nonfuel retail mainly convenience stores increased by 10% year-on-year in the first half. This is reflecting our diversification strategy towards nonfuel retail and implementation of the new initiatives to improve customer experience, including a much more focused stores revitalization program as well as the positive contribution from our fuel rewards program. Our fuel retail gross profit decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by the decrease in fuel retail volumes as well as lower inventory gains as stated earlier in the first half 2019. In the Corporate segment, gross profit has increased in the first half by 12.3% and margin has increased from 18.5% to 19.8% on the back of the increase in volumes, better inventory management as well as more dynamic product pricing. 
And finally, our Aviation gross profit has decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by lower Aviation services and civil aviation OpEx recovery under the arrangement we have with the parent company, ADNOC. 
Moving on to EBITDA. Total EBITDA for first half reached $404 million. This is an increase of 2.8% year-on-year. As stated earlier, continued cost efficiencies as well as Corporate segment performance is contributing to this increase together with higher Corporate volumes.
Our fuel and nonfuel retail company EBITDA increased by 0.3% and Corporate segment by 29.4% year-on-year in the first half. Q2 2019 EBITDA growth was driven by Retail segment with an increase in EBITDA margins driven by cost efficiencies despite the lower volumes. Q2 '19 Corporate EBITDA was flat due to lower diesel margins partially offset by cost efficiencies and higher volumes. 
And finally, Aviation EBITDA was flat due to stable volumes and cost efficiencies partially offset by lower aviation services revenue. Excluding the inventory gains realized in the second quarter '19 and during the first half 2018, $33 million and $58 million, respectively, underlying EBITDA increased year-on-year by 11% during the first half. 
And finally, a few comments on our cash position and cash flow during the first half. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations partially offset by a decrease in working capital movement as a result of increase in our receivables. 
Overall, strong cash flow generation has resulted in the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.02x at the end of June 2019. 
Let me now hand it back over to Saeed to present our outlook for current year."

First to start with -- in terms of the fuel Retail business. Just seems that you're opening new stations but just looking at the throughput per station, it's down 11% year-over-year in Q2, it was down around 9% year-over-year in Q1 2019. I'm was just trying to get the color that -- I mean the throughput per station is not stabilizing and it's still negative. So I just want to hear your thoughts on that. And I mean maybe you can elaborate more that as you open maybe more stations in Dubai, less cannibalization, higher throughput, so any color on how we're moving into H2 in terms of throughput per station would be helpful. And if you can also give us some detail on how then the stations in Dubai have been faring? At least the ones that you've opened 6 to 9 months ago. So that's my first question. My second question is on the ADNOC Flex. Just looking at the press releases overall, it seems that you've waved the Flex in July for everyone and for a couple of customers in August. I mean I just -- I don't know, correct me if I'm wrong, it just seems to be counterintuitive to push out Flex during the summer months where you should expect seasonality at least to drive penetration up. So I just want to understand what's the rationale behind that? And we're just still hearing the 15% to 20% penetration since the beginning of the year. I mean is it taking much more time? I mean is there any change in terms of the focus or how you're approaching Flex, especially that with expansions in Dubai, my guess is that you wouldn't be rolling out Flex because your competition is not charging premium services? I'll just leave it there and maybe if I get the chance, I'll ask more. And just one follow-up. Can we get a breakdown of the Retail revenue between fuel and nonfuel? Just for us to get a better understanding on how this gross margin is doing primarily on the C-stores, which is an area that you have been executing well. I'll leave it there."

So first of all, on the split of revenues and gross profit, we don't give it. We'll not provide these numbers. But you have the performance of the C-stores in the release actually, and you have, yes, the revenues Page 10. You have the store revenues end of H1, $107 million with gross profit of $32 million, which brings, if I'm correct, 30% gross margin plus 100 basis point versus last year. So this is for the, I would say, nonfuel performance because nonfuel is mainly the convenience store as you know. Regarding your question on the throughput per station. So throughput per station is total volume divided by the total of stations that we have. As you know, the retail volumes are down 4.9% year-on-year and the number of stations are up 4.4%, which gives you the 10% decline in the throughput per station. Then I will hand over to Mohamed on the performance of the Dubai stations. But what we expect in a nutshell is in the second half with the new stations in Dubai, where we'll have additional volume, higher market share, that the volumes will be higher than what we have in the first half."

What's encouraging is that compared to first quarter 2019, our retail volumes in the second quarter have been slightly up. So as you alluded to, we've launched promotions such as good morning UAE, that was one. And Fuel Up and Fly Off, that was the second one. These promotions, the intent there was to improve our loyal customer base. So we're also working in parallel on an enhanced rewards program as well as a seamless payment system all in order to provide a superior customer experience. Now this is where our current promotion, the 11 to 5 campaign that you alluded to. Month 1 was to encourage sign-ups, all customers pulling up to the previous service stations were offered the service for free. But month 2, our intern staff are pushed to get people to sign up for the digital rewards program that we are planning to roll out during Q3. The idea was to encourage our customers more strongly to remove it from our customers who were not signing up for the program. Hence, it is no longer free to a certain segment of the customers and it continues to be free for those who are signing up for the ADNOC Wallet, that's basically our digital platform. But again, the idea is to drive our customers to move into our loyalty scheme. More details of that will be provided shortly, but we are designing in the phase -- final phases of designing an ADNOC rewards program. And all of our moves are calculated from to promote ADNOC rewards program. Okay. As far as the summer promotion, the Hello Summer, third quarter of 2019, this has again encouraged our customers to adopt our digital platform, which allows us, our marketing initiatives, to lay the groundwork for the upcoming rewards program. Again, all of it is towards providing a superior experience to our customers. Now what do we expect out of this digital platform? Simple, create customer stickiness, as in once they are signed up, we incentivize their constant return and ultimate loyalty to ADNOC Distribution. We expect this to improve the convenience store as well as the Allied Services Wallet spend. The way the rewards program is being designed, it will incentivize fuel premiumization, moving up from 95 to 98 for instance as well as an overall uplift in volumes. This also complements the expansion at the moment, both in Dubai as well as the Northern Emirates, which is where true organic growth in terms of volumes will come from. In addition to all this, we continue to work on overhauling our total customer experience. We have a vision that is to be the best-in-class fuel and nonfuel retailer, and we're making very, very good strides against that."

Now that we are executing our OpEx efficiency savings program, we've identified excessive provisions made earlier and they have been reversed fully evidencing the good progress that we have in our OpEx efficiencies.

What we've learned from the promotions that the company has run is we've picked lots and lots of useful information about our customers. One piece of it, they like to be rewarded, they like to be -- for their loyalty to ADNOC Distribution. Two, we also learned that the 14 of our stores, which are Géant stores, experienced such an uplift in sales and those are really starting to come through now. H1 2019, both quarters, first quarter and second quarter, as I've stated 26.7% year-on-year first half in terms of sales revenue. Profit -- gross profit increasing as well. Basket size increasing as well. What that tells me is the revitalization program, the uplift in the stores, the category management, better category management in introducing fresh foods and the grab-and-go concept. These initiatives are really starting to resonate with our customers. So I'm really excited. At present, we have 14 Géant stores, but the convenience store revitalization that we're going to do, which is part of our 2019 plan and then continues into 2020, the Oasis stores of course, not the Géant, stores but these are now Oasis stores that are going to be revamped look and feel and the overall customer experience will improve significantly. Very excited about what kind of numbers we're going to report back on second half of 2019, but certainly, 2020 as well. So what's important is the initiatives we're -- we've undertaken. We already know from having tested the 14 stores as well as from the loyalty programs and the summer promotions, we're doing initiatives which resonate with our customers. So once again, very positive about what's going to happen second half of the year but also what numbers -- what the numbers tell us in 2020."

What we do is only providing -- operating into plane refueling services at multiple airports here in UAE. And this is an illustration of our cost efficiencies. Our costs actually have come down, including in the area of Aviation services, and that is effectively reducing the recovery together plus 8% reported margin that we had on top of these services. However, the impact at EBITDA level is of course relatively marginal because that's where we capture the OpEx savings offsetting the reduced revenue that we get from the services."

So this is the answer. Two, performance, Oasis versus just Géant, we said earlier in Q1 and the Capital Market Day that the Géant stores have a higher profitability because we are using the knowledge of the Géant Group in terms of category management and how we organize the C-stores. But our Oasis stores, which account today for 90% of our convenience stores, we have brought new capabilities, people who are expert in the convenience stores, people coming from large retailer and working on the revitalization of the core business of the C-store, which is Oasis. So we expect good results coming from Oasis because that we have, I would say, revitalizing completely the C-stores. And the upside is, I would say, much higher than what you would have for a store that we have with Géant, obviously. Does it answer your question?"

Thank you for joining us today. Please allow me to start first by introducing Mohamed Al Hashimi, our new Chief Operating Officer, who has joined our leadership team to focus on execution of the company's ambitious growth strategy. 
Mohamed is replacing John Carey, who has recently elected to step down as Deputy CEO, but he will continue in an advisory capacity for the time being. John joined us at a time of our IPO and has provided an excellent [ concept ] and leadership to our business as we successfully completed our listing on Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. 
I would like to place on record my thanks to John for his dedicated efforts during an important period of the company's growth and evolution. 
Before we go into the first half highlights, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. We continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions. 
So in terms of financial performance, we have delivered a 2.8% increase in EBITDA to USD 404 million in the first of 2019 versus the same period in 2018. Excluding inventory gains, EBITDA grew by 11% to USD 371 million in the first half of 2019, and that is mainly driven by continued cost efficiency improvements across the business and better corporate and nonfuel performance. 
We have also shown continued momentum with the first half of 2019 EBITDA margin, reaching 14.4%, up from the 13.2% during the same period last year. We also made significant progress in our cost savings with OpEx of USD 36 million on like-to-like basis in the first half of 2019. 
During the first half, we added 3 new service stations and 12 new convenience stores to our current footprint. We are on track to deliver on our transformation initiative and growth plans. During the remainder of 2019, we are focused on the acceleration of our domestic growth network expansion particularly in Dubai and the growth of our own nonfuel business to provide superior experience to our customers. We also continue to explore opportunities to grow internationally, including Saudi Arabia and markets that we deliver against our investment criteria of 13% IRR threshold. 
Cost efficiencies also remain a core focus, and we will continue to improve our OpEx and CapEx plans. Finally, we try to continue to deliver strong and sustainable growth while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. This is evidenced by the announcement on April of a significant increase to our dividend confirming our confidence in our growth strategy and future cash flow generation. 
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy execution."

I am pleased that on my first call with you, we can show solid progress on our growth strategy. So I met many of you around the time of the IPO back in 2017 as well as our recent Capital Markets Day, both in London and New York. So just to add a bit of background, I was closely involved in the ADNOC Distribution's IPO process, and I've delivered large-scale projects, transactions and partnerships as Senior Vice President of [ Group's ] Strategic Investments for the ADNOC Group. 
More recently, I was also adviser to the ADNOC Distribution executive committee. This has helped provide me with in-depth knowledge of the ADNOC Distribution business, and more importantly, its plans for growth. ADNOC Distribution remains focused on delivering its ambitious strategy as well as building long-term shareholder value through the next phase of our growth. Now we've delivered strong first half year results with more to come. 
So let me begin by giving you an update on the Retail fuel segment, our first strategic pillar. 
During the Capital Markets Day, we presented a refreshed investment proposition, and we announced key initiatives to be implemented during the course of 2019 and beyond. So in line with earlier guidance that most of our new stations will open towards the end of 2019, I'm pleased to announce that we remain on track to open 20 to 30 new stations across the UAE this year, and we are clearly focused on accelerating our footprint in Dubai. 
So in the first half alone, we've opened 3 new stations in UAE and also pleased to announce that we have just opened 2 additional stations in Dubai this week leading to a total of 6 service stations currently operating in Dubai. So our domestic network expansion track -- target is on track, and we've already identified an in-advance stage of execution on 18 new sites. 
Secondly, on Saudi Arabia, we will provide more color on our expansion plans and operating model during our Q3 results announcement. Our focus at present remains on our home market. So in the second quarter, we launched a number of marketing promotions to address the anticipated lower retail fuel volumes, and we've encouraged our customers to register in our Wallet mobile application towards the enhancement of our overall customer experience. We were pleased to see encouraging results with fuel retail volumes stable in second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019. 
On the Corporate segment, we've achieved 5.5% year-on-year growth in volumes in the first half of 2019. Now this was driven by increased sales of LPG, lubricants as well as base oil. Now we expect this trend in corporate volumes to continue during 2019 following significant government investments in the economy. 
In first half of 2019, we also entered the commercial 100 lb cylinder market in Dubai. Now we've chosen to enter the Dubai LPG market by partnering with established distributors, which now gives us a quick route to market and an effective entry. 
So moving on to nonfuel retail. First half of 2019, we opened 12 new convenience stores across the UAE. Now 10 of these were opened in the second quarter of 2019 at our existing retail sites. At the end of first half 2019, we had a total of 262 convenience stores. Now 14 of these are Géant stores. Our -- the company's convenience stores revitalization programs, which I alluded to yesterday, also offers our customers a significantly improved shopping experience. Pleased to say that this is on track and is contributing to positive convenience store performance. 
Improvements were also seen in gross margins and an overall uplift in the average basket size in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Sales revenue from convenience stores was up by 26.7% year-on-year in first half of 2019. Gross profit increased by 28.9% and the average convenience store basket size increased by 6.8% year-on-year in first half 2019. 
Now this has been achieved through various factors. Improving the look and feel of our stores, better category management adapting to the demand of our customers, and the introduction of fresh grab-and-go concept, positive performance of Géant stores, rewards issued to our customers under the Flex initiative, and an improved customer value proposition through the introduction of promotions supported by in-store marketing. 
So at the end of the second quarter 2019, ADNOC Flex Premium penetration was 15% to 20% on average, in line with what we have seen in the first quarter. 
Now to sum up, we are going to continue our expansion, and we remain absolutely committed to our convenience store revitalization program in order to further improve our overall customer experience. 
So finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative, the third pillar of our strategic plan. We have made significant progress in rationalizing our cash OpEx. Pleased to say that we've achieved $36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the first half of 2019 mainly driven by cost-optimization initiatives. Now we are on track to achieve around $50 million of OpEx savings in 2019 on a like-for-like basis. 
In terms of capital expenditure, so far we've spent $38 million of CapEx in the first half of 2019. As I've stated, we remain focused on defining a network expansion allocation in the first half of 2019. As also mentioned earlier, our network rollout is scheduled for operational deployment towards the end of this year. In line with that, we expect to accelerate our capital expenditure in the second half of 2019. We maintained our guidance on capital expenditure for the year of up to $300 million to boost our network expansion in the UAE and internationally with 20 to 30 new sites in the UAE, primarily in Dubai to accelerate our convenience store expansion, to continue to significantly improve our customer experience and to invest in our IT infrastructure and digital initiatives. 
So in addition to the savings we have achieved so far, we see more room to achieve further capital expenditure efficiency in building new sites. 
So at this point, I will now hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance."

So as Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of our initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive results in the first half despite the decrease in overall fuel volumes. The first half revenues reached USD 2.8 billion, down by 6.3% when compared to the first half of 2018. This decline in revenues was mainly driven by lower fuel volumes sold as well as lower pump average prices. To use an example, our 95 gasoline octane average pump prices for the first half of  2019 were 8.5% below first half 2018. Having said that, we saw a continuous improvement in our convenience stores business with an increase in revenues by 26.7% in the first half to USD 107 million driven by the revitalization program that Mohamed was talking about. 
We do see [ green shoot ] in our Corporate business. Volumes are up 5.5% year-on-year driven by increase in LPG and lubricant sales following significant government investments in the UAE economy. Our gross profit reached USD 675 million, down 5% compared to the previous year. The decrease is mainly due to the lower inventory gains in the first half, $33 million versus $58 million in 2018 in our Retail business. 
Meanwhile, we achieved a 10% increase in our nonfuel gross profit mainly coming from the convenience stores in the first half compared to the 2018 period, and this is driven by the improved category management and our fuel rewards program. 
Our gross profit margin has also shown continued momentum and is still at an industrial leading level, reaching 24.1% in the first half of 2019, up from 23.8% last year. And this is driven by lower revenue due to lower pump prices compared with the secured minimum retail margin as per the Ministry of Energy regulations here in UAE. 
Finally, our total EBITDA for the first half reached $404 million, representing an increase of 2.8% year-on-year driven by the continued cost efficiencies, growth in the corporate segment and more dynamic product pricing. We've made significant progress in rationalizing our OpEx and have [ stabilized achieving ] USD 36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings during the first half driven by the cost optimization initiatives. Our cash OpEx declined by 16.5% in the first half compared to first half last year, reaching $282 million. Excluding the inventory gains of $33 million for Q2 '19 and $58 million for the first half 2018, the underlying EBITDA grew by 11% year-on-year in the first half, once again, driven by the cost efficiency improvements across the whole business. 
Finally, we generated strong free cash flow measured as EBITDA minus CapEx. Free cash flow is up by 21% year-on-year to $366 million in the first half driven by also higher EBITDA and lower CapEx. 
Overall, fuel sales volumes were down in first half by 1.7% driven by 3.5% decrease in fuel rate volumes mainly due to increased competition as well as the impact of the longer public holiday in second quarter 2019 compared to the same period last year. 
On the Corporate segment side, volumes increased by 5.5% first half driven by the higher sales of the LPG, lubricant and base oil as stated earlier. And finally, our Aviation segment volumes sold to the strategic customers were marginally up in the first half 2019. 
Looking at the gross profit performance by segment. Gross profit for nonfuel retail mainly convenience stores increased by 10% year-on-year in the first half. This is reflecting our diversification strategy towards nonfuel retail and implementation of the new initiatives to improve customer experience, including a much more focused stores revitalization program as well as the positive contribution from our fuel rewards program. Our fuel retail gross profit decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by the decrease in fuel retail volumes as well as lower inventory gains as stated earlier in the first half 2019. In the Corporate segment, gross profit has increased in the first half by 12.3% and margin has increased from 18.5% to 19.8% on the back of the increase in volumes, better inventory management as well as more dynamic product pricing. 
And finally, our Aviation gross profit has decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by lower Aviation services and civil aviation OpEx recovery under the arrangement we have with the parent company, ADNOC. 
Moving on to EBITDA. Total EBITDA for first half reached $404 million. This is an increase of 2.8% year-on-year. As stated earlier, continued cost efficiencies as well as Corporate segment performance is contributing to this increase together with higher Corporate volumes.
Our fuel and nonfuel retail company EBITDA increased by 0.3% and Corporate segment by 29.4% year-on-year in the first half. Q2 2019 EBITDA growth was driven by Retail segment with an increase in EBITDA margins driven by cost efficiencies despite the lower volumes. Q2 '19 Corporate EBITDA was flat due to lower diesel margins partially offset by cost efficiencies and higher volumes. 
And finally, Aviation EBITDA was flat due to stable volumes and cost efficiencies partially offset by lower aviation services revenue. Excluding the inventory gains realized in the second quarter '19 and during the first half 2018, $33 million and $58 million, respectively, underlying EBITDA increased year-on-year by 11% during the first half. 
And finally, a few comments on our cash position and cash flow during the first half. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations partially offset by a decrease in working capital movement as a result of increase in our receivables. 
Overall, strong cash flow generation has resulted in the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.02x at the end of June 2019. 
Let me now hand it back over to Saeed to present our outlook for current year."

First to start with -- in terms of the fuel Retail business. Just seems that you're opening new stations but just looking at the throughput per station, it's down 11% year-over-year in Q2, it was down around 9% year-over-year in Q1 2019. I'm was just trying to get the color that -- I mean the throughput per station is not stabilizing and it's still negative. So I just want to hear your thoughts on that. And I mean maybe you can elaborate more that as you open maybe more stations in Dubai, less cannibalization, higher throughput, so any color on how we're moving into H2 in terms of throughput per station would be helpful. And if you can also give us some detail on how then the stations in Dubai have been faring? At least the ones that you've opened 6 to 9 months ago. So that's my first question. My second question is on the ADNOC Flex. Just looking at the press releases overall, it seems that you've waived the Flex in July for everyone and for a couple of customers in August. I mean I just -- I don't know, correct me if I'm wrong, it just seems to be counterintuitive to push out Flex during the summer months where you should expect seasonality at least to drive penetration up. So I just want to understand what's the rationale behind that? And we're just still hearing the 15% to 20% penetration since the beginning of the year. I mean is it taking much more time? I mean is there any change in terms of the focus or how you're approaching Flex, especially that with expansions in Dubai, my guess is that you wouldn't be rolling out Flex because your competition is not charging [ for premium ] services? I'll just leave it there and maybe if I get the chance, I'll ask more. And just one follow-up. Can we get a breakdown of the Retail revenue between fuel and nonfuel? Just for us to get a better understanding on how this gross margin is doing primarily on the C-stores, which is an area that you have been executing well. I'll leave it there."

So first of all, on the split of revenues and gross profit, we don't give it. We'll not provide these numbers. But you have the performance of the C-stores in the release actually, and you have, yes, the revenues on Page 10. You have the store revenues end of H1, $107 million with gross profit of $32 million, which brings, if I'm correct, 30% gross margin plus 100 basis point versus last year. So this is for the, I would say, nonfuel performance because nonfuel is mainly the convenience stores as you know. Regarding your question on the throughput per station. So throughput per station is total volume divided by the total of stations that we have. As you know, the retail volumes are down 4.9% year-on-year and the number of stations are up 4.4%, which gives you the 10% decline in the throughput per station. Then I will hand over to Mohamed on the performance of the Dubai stations. But what we expect in a nutshell is in the second half with the new stations in Dubai, where we'll have additional volume, higher market share, that the volumes will be higher than what we have in the first half."

What's encouraging is that compared to first quarter 2019, our retail volumes in the second quarter have been slightly up. So as you alluded to, we've launched promotions such as good morning UAE, that was one. And Fuel Up and Fly Off, that was the second one. These promotions, the intent there was to improve our loyal customer base. So we're also working in parallel on an enhanced rewards program as well as a seamless payment system all in order to provide a superior customer experience. Now this is where our current promotion, the 11 to 5 campaign that you alluded to. Month 1 was to encourage sign-ups, all customers pulling up to the premium service stations were offered the service for free. But month 2, our intern staff are pushed to get people to sign up for the digital rewards program that we are planning to roll out during Q3. The idea was to encourage our customers more strongly to remove it from our customers who were not signing up for the program. Hence, it is no longer free to a certain segment of the customers and it continues to be free for those who are signing up for the ADNOC Wallet, that's basically our digital platform. But again, the idea is to drive our customers to move into our loyalty scheme. More details of that will be provided shortly, but we are designing in the phase -- final phases of designing an ADNOC rewards program. And all of our moves are calculated to promote ADNOC rewards program. Okay. As far as the summer promotion, the Hello Summer, third quarter of 2019, this has again encouraged our customers to adopt our digital platform, which allows us, our marketing initiatives, to lay the groundwork for the upcoming rewards program. Again, all of it is towards providing a superior experience to our customers. Now what do we expect out of this digital platform? Simple, create customer stickiness, as in once they are signed up, we incentivize their constant return and ultimate loyalty to ADNOC Distribution. We expect this to improve the convenience store as well as the Allied Services Wallet spend. The way the rewards program is being designed, it will incentivize fuel premiumization, moving up from 95 to 98 for instance as well as an overall uplift in volumes. This also complements the expansion [ at the moment, ] both in Dubai as well as the Northern Emirates, which is where true organic growth in terms of volumes will come from. In addition to all this, we continue to work on overhauling our total customer experience. We have a vision that is to be the best-in-class fuel and nonfuel retailer, and we're making very, very good strides against that."

So we -- if we benchmark ourselves versus the competitors, what we know is that the other retailers have been experiencing difficult times. We are talking about low single-digit decline for our peers. What we can tell you is that we come from a very low base. We have been saying this since the IPO for the past 18 months, we have been increasing our basket size by double to -- and single digit for this year. What we expect is growth going forward with the forthcoming revitalization of our C-stores. If you take now broader view on the contribution of the nonfuel business, which is today just below 10%, and you take the international benchmark, we are [ talking ] about more [ than ] 30% to 50% of the profit [ of ]  our peers. So obviously, we will not reach the 50% because our margins are much higher in the fuel business given our guaranteed margins versus our peers.

H1 2019, both quarters, first quarter and second quarter, as I've stated 26.7% year-on-year first half in terms of sales revenue. Profit -- gross profit increasing as well. Basket size increasing as well. What that tells me is the revitalization program, the uplift in the stores, the category management, better category management in introducing fresh foods and the grab-and-go concept. These initiatives are really starting to resonate with our customers. So I'm really excited. At present, we have 14 Géant stores, but the convenience store revitalization that we're going to do, which is part of our 2019 plan and then continues into 2020, the Oasis stores of course, not the Géant, stores but these are now Oasis stores that are going to be revamped get a new look and feel and the overall customer experience will improve significantly. Very excited about what kind of numbers we're going to report back on second half of 2019, but certainly, 2020 as well. So what's important is the initiatives we're -- we've undertaken. We already know from having tested the 14 stores as well as from the loyalty programs and the summer promotions, we're doing initiatives which resonate with our customers.

So this is the answer. Two, performance, Oasis versus just Géant, we said earlier in Q1 and the Capital Market Day that the Géant stores have a higher profitability because we are using the knowledge of the Géant Group in terms of category management and how we organize the C-stores. But our Oasis stores, which account today for 90% of our convenience stores, we have brought new capabilities, people who are expert in the convenience stores, people coming from large retailer and working on the revitalization of the core business of the C-store, which is Oasis. So we expect good results coming from Oasis because that we have, I would say, revitalizing completely the C-stores.

Please allow me to start first by introducing Mohamed Al Hashimi, our new Chief Operating Officer, who has joined our leadership team to focus on execution of the company's ambitious growth strategy. 
Mohamed is replacing John Carey, who has recently elected to step down as Deputy CEO, but he will continue in an advisory capacity for the time being. John joined us at a time of our IPO and has provided an excellent [ concept ] and leadership to our business as we successfully completed our listing on Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. 
I would like to place on record my thanks to John for his dedicated efforts during an important period of the company's growth and evolution. 
Before we go into the first half highlights, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. We continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions. 
So in terms of financial performance, we have delivered a 2.8% increase in EBITDA to USD 404 million in the first of 2019 versus the same period in 2018. Excluding inventory gains, EBITDA grew by 11% to USD 371 million in the first half of 2019, and that is mainly driven by continued cost efficiency improvements across the business and better corporate and nonfuel performance. 
We have also shown continued momentum with the first half of 2019 EBITDA margin reaching 14.4%, up from the 13.2% during the same period last year. We also made significant progress in our cost savings with OpEx of USD 36 million on like-to-like basis in the first half of 2019. 
During the first half, we added 3 new service stations and 12 new convenience stores to our current footprint. We are on track to deliver on our transformation initiative and growth plans. During the remainder of 2019, we are focused on the acceleration of our domestic growth network expansion particularly in Dubai and the growth of our own nonfuel business to provide superior experience to our customers. We also continue to explore opportunities to grow internationally, including Saudi Arabia and markets that we deliver against our investment criteria of 13% IRR threshold. 
Cost efficiencies also remain a core focus, and we will continue to improve our OpEx and CapEx plans. Finally, we try to continue to deliver strong and sustainable growth while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. This is evidenced by the announcement on April of a significant increase to our dividend confirming our confidence in our growth strategy and future cash flow generation. 
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy execution."

Thank you, Saeed. I am pleased that on my first call with you, we can show solid progress on our growth strategy. So I met many of you around the time of the IPO back in 2017 as well as our recent Capital Markets Day, both in London and New York. S",1040,"Great. Thank you, Saeed. I am pleased that on my first call with you, we can show solid progress on our growth strategy. So I met many of you around the time of the IPO back in 2017 as well as our recent Capital Markets Day, both in London and New York. So just to add a bit of background, I was closely involved in the ADNOC Distribution's IPO process, and I've delivered large-scale projects, transactions and partnerships as Senior Vice President of [ Group's ] Strategic Investments for the ADNOC Group. 
More recently, I was also adviser to the ADNOC Distribution executive committee. This has helped provide me with in-depth knowledge of the ADNOC Distribution business, and more importantly, its plans for growth. ADNOC Distribution remains focused on delivering its ambitious strategy as well as building long-term shareholder value through the next phase of our growth. Now we've delivered strong first half year results with more to come. 
So let me begin by giving you an update on the Retail fuel segment, our first strategic pillar. 
During the Capital Markets Day, we presented a refreshed investment proposition, and we announced key initiatives to be implemented during the course of 2019 and beyond. So in line with earlier guidance that most of our new stations will open towards the end of 2019, I'm pleased to announce that we remain on track to open 20 to 30 new stations across the UAE this year, and we are clearly focused on accelerating our footprint in Dubai. 
So in the first half alone, we've opened 3 new stations in UAE and also pleased to announce that we have just opened 2 additional stations in Dubai this week leading to a total of 6 service stations currently operating in Dubai. So our domestic network expansion track -- target is on track, and we've already identified an in-advance stage of execution on 18 new sites. 
Secondly, on Saudi Arabia, we will provide more color on our expansion plans and operating model during our Q3 results announcement. Our focus at present remains on our home market. So in the second quarter, we launched a number of marketing promotions to address the anticipated lower retail fuel volumes, and we've encouraged our customers to register in our Wallet mobile application towards the enhancement of our overall customer experience. We were pleased to see encouraging results with fuel retail volumes stable in second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019. 
On the Corporate segment, we've achieved 5.5% year-on-year growth in volumes in the first half of 2019. Now this was driven by increased sales of LPG, lubricants as well as base oil. Now we expect this trend in corporate volumes to continue during 2019 following significant government investments in the economy. 
In first half of 2019, we also entered the commercial 100 lb cylinder market in Dubai. Now we've chosen to enter the Dubai LPG market by partnering with established distributors, which now gives us a quick route to market and an effective entry. 
So moving on to nonfuel retail. First half of 2019, we opened 12 new convenience stores across the UAE. Now 10 of these were opened in the second quarter of 2019 at our existing retail sites. At the end of first half 2019, we had a total of 262 convenience stores. Now 14 of these are Géant stores. Our -- the company's convenience stores revitalization programs, which I alluded to yesterday, also offers our customers a significantly improved shopping experience. Pleased to say that this is on track and is contributing to positive convenience store performance. 
Improvements were also seen in gross margins and an overall uplift in the average basket size in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Sales revenue from convenience stores was up by 26.7% year-on-year in first half of 2019. Gross profit increased by 28.9% and the average convenience store basket size increased by 6.8% year-on-year in first half 2019. 
Now this has been achieved through various factors. Improving the look and feel of our stores, better category management adapting to the demand of our customers, and the introduction of fresh grab-and-go concept, positive performance of Géant stores, rewards issued to our customers under the Flex initiative, and an improved customer value proposition through the introduction of promotions supported by in-store marketing. 
So at the end of the second quarter 2019, ADNOC Flex Premium penetration was 15% to 20% on average, in line with what we have seen in the first quarter. 
Now to sum up, we are going to continue our expansion, and we remain absolutely committed to our convenience store revitalization program in order to further improve our overall customer experience. 
So finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative, the third pillar of our strategic plan. We have made significant progress in rationalizing our cash OpEx. Pleased to say that we've achieved $36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the first half of 2019 mainly driven by cost-optimization initiatives. Now we are on track to achieve around $50 million of OpEx savings in 2019 on a like-for-like basis. 
In terms of capital expenditure, so far we've spent $38 million of CapEx in the first half of 2019. As I've stated, we remain focused on defining a network expansion allocation in the first half of 2019. As also mentioned earlier, our network rollout is scheduled for operational deployment towards the end of this year. In line with that, we expect to accelerate our capital expenditure in the second half of 2019. We maintained our guidance on capital expenditure for the year of up to $300 million to boost our network expansion in the UAE and internationally with 20 to 30 new sites in the UAE, primarily in Dubai to accelerate our convenience store expansion, to continue to significantly improve our customer experience and to invest in our IT infrastructure and digital initiatives. 
So in addition to the savings we have achieved so far, we see more room to achieve further capital expenditure efficiency in building new sites. 
So at this point, I will now hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance."

So as Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of our initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive results in the first half despite the decrease in overall fuel volumes. The first",971,"Many thanks, Mohamed, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. So as Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of our initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive results in the first half despite the decrease in overall fuel volumes. The first half revenues reached USD 2.8 billion, down by 6.3% when compared to the first half of 2018. This decline in revenues was mainly driven by lower fuel volumes sold as well as lower pump average prices. To use an example, our 95 gasoline octane average pump prices for the first half of  2019 were 8.5% below first half 2018. Having said that, we saw a continuous improvement in our convenience stores business with an increase in revenues by 26.7% in the first half to USD 107 million driven by the revitalization program that Mohamed was talking about. 
We do see [ green shoot ] in our Corporate business. Volumes are up 5.5% year-on-year driven by increase in LPG and lubricant sales following significant government investments in the UAE economy. Our gross profit reached USD 675 million, down 5% compared to the previous year. The decrease is mainly due to the lower inventory gains in the first half, $33 million versus $58 million in 2018 in our Retail business. 
Meanwhile, we achieved a 10% increase in our nonfuel gross profit mainly coming from the convenience stores in the first half compared to the 2018 period, and this is driven by the improved category management and our fuel rewards program. 
Our gross profit margin has also shown continued momentum and is still at an industrial-leading level, reaching 24.1% in the first half of 2019, up from 23.8% last year. And this is driven by lower revenue due to lower pump prices compared with the secured minimum retail margin as per the Ministry of Energy regulations here in UAE. 
Finally, our total EBITDA for the first half reached $404 million, representing an increase of 2.8% year-on-year driven by the continued cost efficiencies, growth in the corporate segment and more dynamic product pricing. We've made significant progress in rationalizing our OpEx and have [ stabilized achieving ] USD 36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings during the first half driven by the cost optimization initiatives. Our cash OpEx declined by 16.5% in the first half compared to first half last year, reaching $282 million. Excluding the inventory gains of $33 million for Q2 '19 and $58 million for the first half 2018, the underlying EBITDA grew by 11% year-on-year in the first half, once again, driven by the cost efficiency improvements across the whole business. 
Finally, we generated strong free cash flow measured as EBITDA minus CapEx. Free cash flow is up by 21% year-on-year to $366 million in the first half driven by also higher EBITDA and lower CapEx. 
Overall, fuel sales volumes were down in first half by 1.7% driven by 3.5% decrease in fuel rate volumes mainly due to increased competition as well as the impact of the longer public holiday in second quarter 2019 compared to the same period last year. 
On the Corporate segment side, volumes increased by 5.5% first half driven by the higher sales of the LPG, lubricant and base oil as stated earlier. And finally, our Aviation segment volumes sold to the strategic customers were marginally up in the first half 2019. 
Looking at the gross profit performance by segment. Gross profit for nonfuel retail mainly convenience stores increased by 10% year-on-year in the first half. This is reflecting our diversification strategy towards nonfuel retail and implementation of the new initiatives to improve customer experience, including a much more focused stores revitalization program as well as the positive contribution from our fuel rewards program. Our fuel retail gross profit decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by the decrease in fuel retail volumes as well as lower inventory gains as stated earlier in the first half 2019. In the Corporate segment, gross profit has increased in the first half by 12.3% and margin has increased from 18.5% to 19.8% on the back of the increase in volumes, better inventory management as well as more dynamic product pricing. 
And finally, our Aviation gross profit has decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by lower Aviation services and civil aviation OpEx recovery under the arrangement we have with the parent company, ADNOC. 
Moving on to EBITDA. Total EBITDA for first half reached $404 million. This is an increase of 2.8% year-on-year. As stated earlier, continued cost efficiencies as well as Corporate segment performance is contributing to this increase together with higher Corporate volumes.
Our fuel and nonfuel retail company EBITDA increased by 0.3% and Corporate segment by 29.4% year-on-year in the first half. Q2 2019 EBITDA growth was driven by Retail segment with an increase in EBITDA margins driven by cost efficiencies despite the lower volumes. Q2 '19 Corporate EBITDA was flat due to lower diesel margins partially offset by cost efficiencies and higher volumes. 
And finally, Aviation EBITDA was flat due to stable volumes and cost efficiencies partially offset by lower aviation services revenue. Excluding the inventory gains realized in the second quarter '19 and during the first half 2018, $33 million and $58 million, respectively, underlying EBITDA increased year-on-year by 11% during the first half. 
And finally, a few comments on our cash position and cash flow during the first half. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations partially offset by a decrease in working capital movement as a result of increase in our receivables. 
Overall, strong cash flow generation has resulted in the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.02x at the end of June 2019. 
Let me now hand it back over to Saeed to present our outlook for current year."

First to start with -- in terms of the fuel Retail business. Just seems that you're opening new stations but just looking at the throughput per station, it's down 11% year-over-year in Q2, it was down around 9% year-over-year in Q1 2019. I'm was just trying to get the color that -- I mean the throughput per station is not stabilizing and it's still negative. So I just want to hear your thoughts on that. And I mean maybe you can elaborate more that as you open maybe more stations in Dubai, less cannibalization, higher throughput, so any color on how we're moving into H2 in terms of throughput per station would be helpful. And if you can also give us some detail on how then the stations in Dubai have been faring? At least the ones that you've opened 6 to 9 months ago. So that's my first question. My second question is on the ADNOC Flex. Just looking at the press releases overall, it seems that you've waived the Flex in July for everyone and for a couple of customers in August. I mean I just -- I don't know, correct me if I'm wrong, it just seems to be counterintuitive to push out Flex during the summer months where you should expect seasonality at least to drive penetration up. So I just want to understand what's the rationale behind that? And we're just still hearing the 15% to 20% penetration since the beginning of the year. I mean is it taking much more time? I mean is there any change in terms of the focus or how you're approaching Flex, especially that with expansions in Dubai, my guess is that you wouldn't be rolling out Flex because your competition is not charging [ for premium ] services? I'll just leave it there and maybe if I get the chance, I'll ask more. And just one follow-up. Can we get a breakdown of the Retail revenue between fuel and nonfuel? Just for us to get a better understanding on how this gross margin is doing primarily on the C-stores, which is an area that you have been executing well. I'll leave it there."

So first of all, on the split of revenues and gross profit, we don't give it. We'll not provide these numbers. But you have the performance of the C-stores in the release actually, and you have, yes, the revenues on Page 10. You have the store revenues end of H1, $107 million with gross profit of $32 million, which brings, if I'm correct, 30% gross margin plus 100 basis point versus last year. So this is for the, I would say, nonfuel performance because nonfuel is mainly the convenience stores as you know. Regarding your question on the throughput per station. So throughput per station is total volume divided by the total of stations that we have. As you know, the retail volumes are down 4.9% year-on-year and the number of stations are up 4.4%, which gives you the 10% decline in the throughput per station. Then I will hand over to Mohamed on the performance of the Dubai stations. But what we expect in a nutshell is in the second half with the new stations in Dubai, where we'll have additional volume, higher market share, that the volumes will be higher than what we have in the first half."

But month 2, our intern staff are pushed to get people to sign up for the digital rewards program that we are planning to roll out during Q3. The idea was to encourage our customers more strongly to remove it from our customers who were not signing up for the program. Hence, it is no longer free to a certain segment of the customers and it continues to be free for those who are signing up for the ADNOC Wallet, that's basically our digital platform. But again, the idea is to drive our customers to move into our loyalty scheme. More details of that will be provided shortly, but we are designing in the phase -- final phases of designing an ADNOC rewards program. And all of our moves are calculated to promote ADNOC rewards program. Okay. As far as the summer promotion, the Hello Summer, third quarter of 2019, this has again encouraged our customers to adopt our digital platform, which allows us, our marketing initiatives, to lay the groundwork for the upcoming rewards program. Again, all of it is towards providing a superior experience to our customers. Now what do we expect out of this digital platform? Simple, create customer stickiness, as in once they are signed up, we incentivize their constant return and ultimate loyalty to ADNOC Distribution. We expect this to improve the convenience store as well as the Allied Services Wallet spend. The way the rewards program is being designed, it will incentivize fuel premiumization, moving up from 95 to 98 for instance as well as an overall uplift in volumes. This also complements the expansion [ at the moment, ] both in Dubai as well as the Northern Emirates, which is where true organic growth in terms of volumes will come from. In addition to all this, we continue to work on overhauling our total customer experience. We have a vision that is to be the best-in-class fuel and nonfuel retailer, and we're making very, very good strides against that."

Looking at Q1 '19, there was actually reported negative figure, which was heavily driven by reversal of prior year accruals that we had booked in 2018. So we have been, in other words, very conservative last year. Now that we are executing our OpEx efficiency savings program, we've identified excessive provisions made earlier and they have been reversed fully evidencing the good progress that we have in our OpEx efficiencies. Q2, we have included sort of an excessive business development and consultancy costs that we treat as one-off costs. So then it comes to the like-for-like savings discussed earlier, the $36 million overall for the first half, this is the real underlying comparison of our cost efficiency program and progress."

So we -- if we benchmark ourselves versus the competitors, what we know is that the other retailers have been experiencing difficult times. We are talking about low single-digit decline for our peers. What we can tell you is that we come from a very low base. We have been saying this since the IPO for the past 18 months, we have been increasing our basket size by double to -- and single digit for this year. What we expect is growth going forward with the forthcoming revitalization of our C-stores. If you take now broader view on the contribution of the nonfuel business, which is today just below 10%, and you take the international benchmark, we are [ talking ] about more [ than ] 30% to 50% of the profit [ of ]  our peers.

Basket size increasing as well. What that tells me is the revitalization program, the uplift in the stores, the category management, better category management in introducing fresh foods and the grab-and-go concept. These initiatives are really starting to resonate with our customers. So I'm really excited. At present, we have 14 Géant stores, but the convenience store revitalization that we're going to do, which is part of our 2019 plan and then continues into 2020, the Oasis stores of course, not the Géant, stores but these are now Oasis stores that are going to be revamped get a new look and feel and the overall customer experience will improve significantly. Very excited about what kind of numbers we're going to report back on second half of 2019, but certainly, 2020 as well. So what's important is the initiatives we're -- we've undertaken.

So obviously, we are seeing in the C-store where we had completely changed the look and feel, the assortment, all the products, et cetera, the material increase in our revenues and the profit. So this is the answer. Two, performance, Oasis versus just Géant, we said earlier in Q1 and the Capital Market Day that the Géant stores have a higher profitability because we are using the knowledge of the Géant Group in terms of category management and how we organize the C-stores. But our Oasis stores, which account today for 90% of our convenience stores, we have brought new capabilities, people who are expert in the convenience stores, people coming from large retailer and working on the revitalization of the core business of the C-store, which is Oasis. So we expect good results coming from Oasis because that we have, I would say, revitalizing completely the C-stores. And the upside is, I would say, much higher than what you would have for a store that we have with Géant, obviously. Does it answer your question?"

Thank you for joining us today. Please allow me to start first by introducing Mohamed Al Hashimi, our new Chief Operating Officer, who has joined our leadership team to focus on execution of the company's ambitious growth strategy. 
Mohamed is replacing John Carey, who has recently elected to step down as Deputy CEO, but he will continue in an advisory capacity for the time being. John joined us at a time of our IPO and has provided an excellent [ concept ] and leadership to our business as we successfully completed our listing on Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. 
I would like to place on record my thanks to John for his dedicated efforts during an important period of the company's growth and evolution. 
Before we go into the first half highlights, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business. We continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions. 
So in terms of financial performance, we have delivered a 2.8% increase in EBITDA to USD 404 million in the first of 2019 versus the same period in 2018. Excluding inventory gains, EBITDA grew by 11% to USD 371 million in the first half of 2019, and that is mainly driven by continued cost efficiency improvements across the business and better corporate and nonfuel performance. 
We have also shown continued momentum with the first half of 2019 EBITDA margin reaching 14.4%, up from the 13.2% during the same period last year. We also made significant progress in our cost savings with OpEx of USD 36 million on like-to-like basis in the first half of 2019. 
During the first half, we added 3 new service stations and 12 new convenience stores to our current footprint. We are on track to deliver on our transformation initiative and growth plans. During the remainder of 2019, we are focused on the acceleration of our domestic growth network expansion particularly in Dubai and the growth of our own nonfuel business to provide superior experience to our customers. We also continue to explore opportunities to grow internationally, including Saudi Arabia and markets that we deliver against our investment criteria of 13% IRR threshold. 
Cost efficiencies also remain a core focus, and we will continue to improve our OpEx and CapEx plans. Finally, we try to continue to deliver strong and sustainable growth while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. This is evidenced by the announcement on April of a significant increase to our dividend confirming our confidence in our growth strategy and future cash flow generation. 
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy execution."

Thank you, Saeed. I am pleased that on my first call with you, we can show solid progress on our growth strategy.

I am pleased that on my first call with you, we can show solid progress on our growth strategy. So I met many of you around the time of the IPO back in 2017 as well as our recent Capital Markets Day, both in London and New York. So just to add a bit of background, I was closely involved in the ADNOC Distribution's IPO process, and I've delivered large-scale projects, transactions and partnerships as Senior Vice President of [ Group's ] Strategic Investments for the ADNOC Group. 
More recently, I was also adviser to the ADNOC Distribution executive committee. This has helped provide me with in-depth knowledge of the ADNOC Distribution business, and more importantly, its plans for growth. ADNOC Distribution remains focused on delivering its ambitious strategy as well as building long-term shareholder value through the next phase of our growth. Now we've delivered strong first half year results with more to come. 
So let me begin by giving you an update on the Retail fuel segment, our first strategic pillar. 
During the Capital Markets Day, we presented a refreshed investment proposition, and we announced key initiatives to be implemented during the course of 2019 and beyond. So in line with earlier guidance that most of our new stations will open towards the end of 2019, I'm pleased to announce that we remain on track to open 20 to 30 new stations across the UAE this year, and we are clearly focused on accelerating our footprint in Dubai. 
So in the first half alone, we've opened 3 new stations in UAE and also pleased to announce that we have just opened 2 additional stations in Dubai this week leading to a total of 6 service stations currently operating in Dubai. So our domestic network expansion track -- target is on track, and we've already identified an in-advance stage of execution on 18 new sites. 
Secondly, on Saudi Arabia, we will provide more color on our expansion plans and operating model during our Q3 results announcement. Our focus at present remains on our home market. So in the second quarter, we launched a number of marketing promotions to address the anticipated lower retail fuel volumes, and we've encouraged our customers to register in our Wallet mobile application towards the enhancement of our overall customer experience. We were pleased to see encouraging results with fuel retail volumes stable in second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019. 
On the Corporate segment, we've achieved 5.5% year-on-year growth in volumes in the first half of 2019. Now this was driven by increased sales of LPG, lubricants as well as base oil. Now we expect this trend in corporate volumes to continue during 2019 following significant government investments in the economy. 
In first half of 2019, we also entered the commercial 100 lb cylinder market in Dubai. Now we've chosen to enter the Dubai LPG market by partnering with established distributors, which now gives us a quick route to market and an effective entry. 
So moving on to nonfuel retail. First half of 2019, we opened 12 new convenience stores across the UAE. Now 10 of these were opened in the second quarter of 2019 at our existing retail sites. At the end of first half 2019, we had a total of 262 convenience stores. Now 14 of these are Géant stores. Our -- the company's convenience stores revitalization programs, which I alluded to yesterday, also offers our customers a significantly improved shopping experience. Pleased to say that this is on track and is contributing to positive convenience store performance. 
Improvements were also seen in gross margins and an overall uplift in the average basket size in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Sales revenue from convenience stores was up by 26.7% year-on-year in first half of 2019. Gross profit increased by 28.9% and the average convenience store basket size increased by 6.8% year-on-year in first half 2019. 
Now this has been achieved through various factors. Improving the look and feel of our stores, better category management adapting to the demand of our customers, and the introduction of fresh grab-and-go concept, positive performance of Géant stores, rewards issued to our customers under the Flex initiative, and an improved customer value proposition through the introduction of promotions supported by in-store marketing. 
So at the end of the second quarter 2019, ADNOC Flex Premium penetration was 15% to 20% on average, in line with what we have seen in the first quarter. 
Now to sum up, we are going to continue our expansion, and we remain absolutely committed to our convenience store revitalization program in order to further improve our overall customer experience. 
So finally, let me give you an update on our cost efficiency initiative, the third pillar of our strategic plan. We have made significant progress in rationalizing our cash OpEx. Pleased to say that we've achieved $36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the first half of 2019 mainly driven by cost-optimization initiatives. Now we are on track to achieve around $50 million of OpEx savings in 2019 on a like-for-like basis. 
In terms of capital expenditure, so far we've spent $38 million of CapEx in the first half of 2019. As I've stated, we remain focused on defining a network expansion allocation in the first half of 2019. As also mentioned earlier, our network rollout is scheduled for operational deployment towards the end of this year. In line with that, we expect to accelerate our capital expenditure in the second half of 2019. We maintained our guidance on capital expenditure for the year of up to $300 million to boost our network expansion in the UAE and internationally with 20 to 30 new sites in the UAE, primarily in Dubai to accelerate our convenience store expansion, to continue to significantly improve our customer experience and to invest in our IT infrastructure and digital initiatives. 
So in addition to the savings we have achieved so far, we see more room to achieve further capital expenditure efficiency in building new sites. 
So at this point, I will now hand over to Petri to present the highlights of our financial performance."

So as Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of our initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive results in the first half despite the decrease in overall fuel volumes. The first",971,"Many thanks, Mohamed, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. So as Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of our initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive results in the first half despite the decrease in overall fuel volumes. The first half revenues reached USD 2.8 billion, down by 6.3% when compared to the first half of 2018. This decline in revenues was mainly driven by lower fuel volumes sold as well as lower pump average prices. To use an example, our 95 gasoline octane average pump prices for the first half of  2019 were 8.5% below first half 2018. Having said that, we saw a continuous improvement in our convenience stores business with an increase in revenues by 26.7% in the first half to USD 107 million driven by the revitalization program that Mohamed was talking about. 
We do see [ green shoot ] in our Corporate business. Volumes are up 5.5% year-on-year driven by increase in LPG and lubricant sales following significant government investments in the UAE economy. Our gross profit reached USD 675 million, down 5% compared to the previous year. The decrease is mainly due to the lower inventory gains in the first half, $33 million versus $58 million in 2018 in our Retail business. 
Meanwhile, we achieved a 10% increase in our nonfuel gross profit mainly coming from the convenience stores in the first half compared to the 2018 period, and this is driven by the improved category management and our fuel rewards program. 
Our gross profit margin has also shown continued momentum and is still at an industrial-leading level, reaching 24.1% in the first half of 2019, up from 23.8% last year. And this is driven by lower revenue due to lower pump prices compared with the secured minimum retail margin as per the Ministry of Energy regulations here in UAE. 
Finally, our total EBITDA for the first half reached $404 million, representing an increase of 2.8% year-on-year driven by the continued cost efficiencies, growth in the corporate segment and more dynamic product pricing. We've made significant progress in rationalizing our OpEx and have [ stabilized achieving ] USD 36 million in like-for-like OpEx savings during the first half driven by the cost optimization initiatives. Our cash OpEx declined by 16.5% in the first half compared to first half last year, reaching $282 million. Excluding the inventory gains of $33 million for Q2 '19 and $58 million for the first half 2018, the underlying EBITDA grew by 11% year-on-year in the first half, once again, driven by the cost efficiency improvements across the whole business. 
Finally, we generated strong free cash flow measured as EBITDA minus CapEx. Free cash flow is up by 21% year-on-year to $366 million in the first half driven by also higher EBITDA and lower CapEx. 
Overall, fuel sales volumes were down in first half by 1.7% driven by 3.5% decrease in fuel rate volumes mainly due to increased competition as well as the impact of the longer public holiday in second quarter 2019 compared to the same period last year. 
On the Corporate segment side, volumes increased by 5.5% first half driven by the higher sales of the LPG, lubricant and base oil as stated earlier. And finally, our Aviation segment volumes sold to the strategic customers were marginally up in the first half 2019. 
Looking at the gross profit performance by segment. Gross profit for nonfuel retail mainly convenience stores increased by 10% year-on-year in the first half. This is reflecting our diversification strategy towards nonfuel retail and implementation of the new initiatives to improve customer experience, including a much more focused stores revitalization program as well as the positive contribution from our fuel rewards program. Our fuel retail gross profit decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by the decrease in fuel retail volumes as well as lower inventory gains as stated earlier in the first half 2019. In the Corporate segment, gross profit has increased in the first half by 12.3% and margin has increased from 18.5% to 19.8% on the back of the increase in volumes, better inventory management as well as more dynamic product pricing. 
And finally, our Aviation gross profit has decreased in the first half by 8.7% year-on-year. This is driven by lower Aviation services and civil aviation OpEx recovery under the arrangement we have with the parent company, ADNOC. 
Moving on to EBITDA. Total EBITDA for first half reached $404 million. This is an increase of 2.8% year-on-year. As stated earlier, continued cost efficiencies as well as Corporate segment performance is contributing to this increase together with higher Corporate volumes.
Our fuel and nonfuel retail company EBITDA increased by 0.3% and Corporate segment by 29.4% year-on-year in the first half. Q2 2019 EBITDA growth was driven by Retail segment with an increase in EBITDA margins driven by cost efficiencies despite the lower volumes. Q2 '19 Corporate EBITDA was flat due to lower diesel margins partially offset by cost efficiencies and higher volumes. 
And finally, Aviation EBITDA was flat due to stable volumes and cost efficiencies partially offset by lower aviation services revenue. Excluding the inventory gains realized in the second quarter '19 and during the first half 2018, $33 million and $58 million, respectively, underlying EBITDA increased year-on-year by 11% during the first half. 
And finally, a few comments on our cash position and cash flow during the first half. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations partially offset by a decrease in working capital movement as a result of increase in our receivables. 
Overall, strong cash flow generation has resulted in the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.02x at the end of June 2019. 
Let me now hand it back over to Saeed to present our outlook for current year."

I mean I just -- I don't know, correct me if I'm wrong, it just seems to be counterintuitive to push out Flex during the summer months where you should expect seasonality at least to drive penetration up. So I just want to understand what's the rationale behind that? And we're just still hearing the 15% to 20% penetration since the beginning of the year. I mean is it taking much more time? I mean is there any change in terms of the focus or how you're approaching Flex, especially that with expansions in Dubai, my guess is that you wouldn't be rolling out Flex because your competition is not charging [ for premium ] services? I'll just leave it there and maybe if I get the chance, I'll ask more. And just one follow-up. Can we get a breakdown of the Retail revenue between fuel and nonfuel? Just for us to get a better understanding on how this gross margin is doing primarily on the C-stores, which is an area that you have been executing well. I'll leave it there."

So first of all, on the split of revenues and gross profit, we don't give it. We'll not provide these numbers. But you have the performance of the C-stores in the release actually, and you have, yes, the revenues on Page 10. You have the store revenues end of H1, $107 million with gross profit of $32 million, which brings, if I'm correct, 30% gross margin plus 100 basis point versus last year. So this is for the, I would say, nonfuel performance because nonfuel is mainly the convenience stores as you know. Regarding your question on the throughput per station. So throughput per station is total volume divided by the total of stations that we have. As you know, the retail volumes are down 4.9% year-on-year and the number of stations are up 4.4%, which gives you the 10% decline in the throughput per station. Then I will hand over to Mohamed on the performance of the Dubai stations. But what we expect in a nutshell is in the second half with the new stations in Dubai, where we'll have additional volume, higher market share, that the volumes will be higher than what we have in the first half."

So specifically as far as volumes go by regions, we don't disclose this for competition reasons."

What's encouraging is that compared to first quarter 2019, our retail volumes in the second quarter have been slightly up. So as you alluded to, we've launched promotions such as good morning UAE, that was one. And Fuel Up and Fly Off, that was the second one. These promotions, the intent there was to improve our loyal customer base. So we're also working in parallel on an enhanced rewards program as well as a seamless payment system all in order to provide a superior customer experience. Now this is where our current promotion, the 11 to 5 campaign that you alluded to. Month 1 was to encourage sign-ups, all customers pulling up to the premium service stations were offered the service for free. But month 2, our intern staff are pushed to get people to sign up for the digital rewards program that we are planning to roll out during Q3. The idea was to encourage our customers more strongly to remove it from our customers who were not signing up for the program. Hence, it is no longer free to a certain segment of the customers and it continues to be free for those who are signing up for the ADNOC Wallet, that's basically our digital platform. But again, the idea is to drive our customers to move into our loyalty scheme. More details of that will be provided shortly, but we are designing in the phase -- final phases of designing an ADNOC rewards program. And all of our moves are calculated to promote ADNOC rewards program. Okay. As far as the summer promotion, the Hello Summer, third quarter of 2019, this has again encouraged our customers to adopt our digital platform, which allows us, our marketing initiatives, to lay the groundwork for the upcoming rewards program. Again, all of it is towards providing a superior experience to our customers. Now what do we expect out of this digital platform? Simple, create customer stickiness, as in once they are signed up, we incentivize their constant return and ultimate loyalty to ADNOC Distribution. We expect this to improve the convenience store as well as the Allied Services Wallet spend. The way the rewards program is being designed, it will incentivize fuel premiumization, moving up from 95 to 98 for instance as well as an overall uplift in volumes. This also complements the expansion [ at the moment, ] both in Dubai as well as the Northern Emirates, which is where true organic growth in terms of volumes will come from. In addition to all this, we continue to work on overhauling our total customer experience. We have a vision that is to be the best-in-class fuel and nonfuel retailer, and we're making very, very good strides against that."

These initiatives are really starting to resonate with our customers. So I'm really excited. At present, we have 14 Géant stores, but the convenience store revitalization that we're going to do, which is part of our 2019 plan and then continues into 2020, the Oasis stores of course, not the Géant, stores but these are now Oasis stores that are going to be revamped get a new look and feel and the overall customer experience will improve significantly.

So this is the answer. Two, performance, Oasis versus just Géant, we said earlier in Q1 and the Capital Market Day that the Géant stores have a higher profitability because we are using the knowledge of the Géant Group in terms of category management and how we organize the C-stores. But our Oasis stores, which account today for 90% of our convenience stores, we have brought new capabilities, people who are expert in the convenience stores, people coming from large retailer and working on the revitalization of the core business of the C-store, which is Oasis. So we expect good results coming from Oasis because that we have, I would say, revitalizing completely the C-stores.

Thank you, Athmane, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we go on to the Q3 2019 highlights, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business, and we continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions. In terms of financial performance, we have delivered a strong underlying performance. Excluding the inventory gains, underlying EBITDA grew by 10% to USD 190 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to third quarter of 2018. Fuel volumes grew 3.9% and the third quarter of 2019, including growth in the retail fuel volumes by 1.3% when compared to the same period in 2018. Positive results from our convenience stores also contributed to our higher EBITDA growth. 
Our Board of Directors have approved free assisted fueling to all our customers, which will be implemented beginning this Sunday at 6 a.m. November 3. We are confident this will be very well received by our customers and our investors, facilitating and strengthening our ambitious network expansion and volume growth targets. Providing free assisted fueling also puts us on par with our competition, supports the acceleration of our Dubai network expansion and protect our market share. As a result of the anticipated increases in fuel volumes as well as cost reductions and other initiatives, we do not expect this announcement to have any impact on our profitability or dividend policy. Our continued focus on realizing cost efficiencies, including  across the supply chain and logistics operations has contributed to a 9.3% reduction in like-for-like operating expenses for the first 9 months of 2019 compared to the 9 months of 2018. The improvements in the efficiency of our operations has also benefited our suppliers, which has enabled us to successfully renegotiate our fuel supply costs. In the renegotiated agreement with results and reduction of our retail fuel supply costs by 2 fils per liter. The benefits of which will begin to be seen during Q4 of 2019, leading to a higher fuel margin in the future. 
Moving to the outlook of our business for the remainder of 2019 and 2020, we are focused on acceleration of our domestic network growth expansion, particularly in Dubai, and the growth of our non-fuel business to provide a superior experience to our customers. As part of the evolution of our customer offering, we will launch a new loyalty program, ADNOC Rewards, before the end of 2019, further enhancing our customer experience. Finally, we strive to continue to deliver a strong and sustainable growth while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. This is evidenced by the announcement and effort of our progressive dividend policy, confirming our confidence in our growth strategy and future cash flow generation. I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy."

So I will start off by reiterating that we remain focused on delivering our ambitious growth strategy. And building long-term shareholder value through the next phase of our growth. So we delivered strong underlying results in the third quarter and the 9 months of 2019, and we expect more to come. 
So let me begin by giving you an update on the retail fuel segment, which is, of course, our first strategic pillar. So our UAE network reached 382 retail fuel stations as of 30 September 2019. In the first 9 months of 2019, we opened 6 new stations in UAE, of which 3 are in Dubai as a result of which, we now have a total of 6 stations operating in device. So we've previously had indicated a network expansion target of 20 to 30 new stations by the end of 2019, of which about half were expected in Dubai. So I'm pleased to say that we now have 45 sites in advanced stages of execution, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2020. That's 45 sites in advanced stages of execution. As far as Saudi Arabia, we saw positive development last quarter with regulators approving increase in fuel margins. So under the new margin regime, ADNOC Distribution, it's going to be much more constructive towards the Saudi expansion. This is, of course, subject to Board approval. But our focus right now will remain on the home market. So during 2019, we launched 3 marketing campaigns: that was Good Morning, UAE; Fuel Up and Fly Off; and Hello summer. These were targeted to incentivize station traffic. These marketing campaigns were quite successful, and they generated an increase in retail fuel volumes in the third quarter of 2019 for the first time since our IPO. 
Moving on to the corporate segment, we've achieved 6% year-on-year growth in volumes in the third quarter of 2019, and this was mostly driven by increased sales of diesel. Also during 2019, we entered the commercial 100-pound cylinder market in Dubai, and we've done so, we've entered the Dubai LPG market by partnering with established distributors. This, of course, gives us a quick route to market and a very, very effective entry. Now as mentioned earlier by Saeed, we are -- we will offer free assisted fueling to all our customers, starting 3rd of November 2019. Now let me reiterate, this is absolutely the right decision for the business over the long term. Let me add some color to that. 
Since the launch of our flex offering 16 months ago, the customer adoption rate has been slower than anticipated. So 15% to 20% of total fuel transactions. As of right now, it's stagnating around 15%. We've received negative customer feedback and most importantly, we've lost volume to competitors who do not charge for the premium fueling service. This, coupled with the success that we saw in our recent marketing campaigns, as well as feedback from extensive customer engagement, we are confident that this decision will be well received by our customers and will be very positive for the growth of our business, especially in those areas where we are targeting growth. Over 2019 and 2020, which is Dubai in Northern Emirates, where we have increased competition. 
Now most importantly, this decision we do not expect this to have any impact on our profitability. And here's why, and I'm going to explain why and some qualitative details. So we estimate that our ADNOC Flex offering had been contributing approximately USD 38 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. However, offering this service for free will result in increased fuel volume sales, which in turn will result in increased footfall at our nonfuel retail and other nonfuel services. The increased footfall will contribute approximately USD 12 million to USD 17 million of incremental EBITDA on an annual basis, one. In addition to that, we now have a renegotiated fuel supply agreement with our supplier. This will result in a reduction of our retail fuel supply costs by about 2 fils per liter. The benefits of this, we will begin to see during the fourth quarter of 2019. On an aggregate basis, this translates into approximately USD 35 million of incremental EBITDA. This is based on our last 12 months of volumes. Of course, 2 fils per liter translates into $35 million incremental EBITDA. Now as the volumes go up, which we expect them to, as a result of now offering free assisted fueling, the $35 million, driven by market share gains in the Northern Ameriana Dubai expansion, we expect the EBITDA to increase even further. In aggregate, we expect USD 47 million t USD 52 million growth in EBITDA, which would increase further with growth in volumes. While we lose $38 million from the premium service fees, which is Flex, and we will incur an additional [indiscernible] USD 10 million in staff costs. 
Moving on to nonfuel retail. Nine months, the first 9 months of 2019, I'm pleased to announce that we've opened 14 new convenience stores across the UAE, 2 of which were opened in the third quarter of 2019. At the end of 9 months in 2019, we have a total of 264 convenience stores. Now the company's convenience store revitalization program, which we alluded to during our last conference call, is advancing and contributing to positive convenience store performance. The improvements were seen in gross margins, an uplift in average basket size first 9 months of 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. The sales revenue from convenience stores was up by 23% year-on-year, while gross profit has increased by 27.2% in the first 9 months of 2019. The average convenience store basket size has gone up by 5% year-on-year during the first 9 months of 2019. 
Now how did we do this? We've achieved this through various factors. First and foremost, as we alluded to, the last time we spoke. We've improved the look and feel in our stores. We've improved the category management by adapting to our customers' demand. We have introduced Fresh and Grab and Go concept. Of course, we had the rewards issued to customers under our Flex initiatives and we have an improved customer value proposition through the introduction of promotions supported by in-store marketing. Now we are going to continue to focus on these ongoing improvements. In 2020, and we're going to accelerate our revitalization program for 100 of our convenience stores. And to sub, we're going to enhance and improve the overall customer experience at our network of storage significantly over the remainder of 2019 and definitely all of 2020. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on our cost efficiency initiatives. Now that, of course, is the third pillar of our strategic plan. We've made significant progress in rationalizing our cash OpEx. So we've achieved about $43 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the 9 months of 2019. This was continues to be mainly driven by cost optimization initiatives. I'm confident, we're very confident that we are completely on track to achieve around $15 million of OpEx savings in 2019 on a like-for-like basis. In terms of capital expenditures, so far, we've spent about $66 million of CapEx in the first 9 months of 2019. We now we've been focusing on defining a network expansion allocation so far this year. As we mentioned earlier, our network rolled out is scheduled for operational deployment towards early 2020, early next year. So we certainly expect to accelerate our CapEx in 2020. 
Now for 2019, we expect this to be in the range of USD 100 million to USD 150 million compared to up to USD 300 million, which was our guidance earlier. However, we expect CapEx acceleration in 2020 given our ambitious delivery schedule, especially in Dubai. 
Now in addition to the savings we've achieved so far. We definitely see more room to achieve further OpEx savings and capital expenditure efficiency when we built out our new sites. At this point, I will hand you over to Petri, who is going to present the highlights of our financial performance."

As Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of initiatives have resonated in the achievement of positive underlying results for the first 9 months of the year. Our revenues reaching USD 4.33 billion, which is down by 6% compared to prior year. The decline in revenue was mainly driven by lower average pump prices in UAE in the first 9 months of 2019. To illustrate this, the 95 octane gasoline prices are averaging 9.3% below the average of prior year. That said, our convenience store revenue increased by 23% in the first 9 months, driven by better category management, introduction of new products and as Mohamed stated, supported by Flex participation as well. We also witnessed positive growth in our corporate LPG as well as Luke's businesses. First 9 months, gross profit was $1 billion, down by 4.2% on last year. This decrease was mainly due to the lower inventory gains in our fuel retail business in the first 9 months, we saw $33 million in inventory gains versus USD 80 million last year. Meanwhile, we continue to see strong growth in our nonfuel retail business, mainly convenience stores with the first 9 months gross profit growth of 12.2% and  third quarter gross profit growth of 16.6% compared to the same period last year. Commercial business gross profit also grew at a healthy rate benefiting from dynamic pricing, which led to volume growth in corporate segment. Our gross profit margin has also saw some continued momentum, raising 23.4% in the first 9 months up from 23% prior year. This is driven by a stable fixed retail months at a lower revenue base. Gross profit was down due to lower inventory gains in the first 9 months compared to the same period last year. The underlying EBITDA for the first 9 months grew 10.6%. Reported EBITDA, however, reached $594 million growing at a slower pace of 1.1%. And once again, mainly due to the lower inventory gains. We've reported this year. The strong underlying performance was driven by improved cost efficiencies, as mentioned, and positive results of our convenience store revitalization program as well as growth in fuel volumes during the last quarter. And finally, we've generated underlying strong free cash flow, measured as EBITDA minus capital expenditures, free cash flow is up 18.8% year-on-year to USD 527 million, driven by higher EBITDA and lower CapEx. So moving on, summarizing the financials and operating highlights. Fuel volumes sold in the first 9 months were stable compared to last year. However, we are very pleased to report the third quarter of 2019 witness increase in fuel volumes of 3.9%. Q3 volumes growth was driven by improvements in the core retail markets of APU and the Northern Emirates. And of course, the contribution from our new stations in Dubai as well as the rise in commercial volumes. Our retail fuel sales volumes survey, down by 1.9% for the first 9 months however, after the successful marketing campaigns that Mohamed was talking about Q3. Retail fuel volumes were up by 1.3% year-on-year. This is for the first time since the IPO. On the corporate segment side, good increase of 5.7% on last year. This is heavily driven by sales of LPG, lubricants as well as base oil volumes. And finally, our Aviation segment volumes sold to strategic customers increased also very strong at 6.7% for the first 9 months. Looking at the gross profit performance by segment for nonfuel retail mainly Convene stores, there's an increase of 12.4% year-on-year for the first 9 months this is reflecting the diversification strategy towards non-fuel rate as well as the implementation of the new initiatives to improve customer experience, including also a more focused revitalization program, and the positive contribution from our fuel rewards program. Fuel retail gross profit decreased, however, by 9.7% year-on-year. This is, once again, driven by the lower inventory gains, as mentioned. In the corporate segment, gross profit increased by 10.2%, and gross profit margin has increased from 17.3% to 18.6% on the back of the increase in volumes, better inventory management, as well as more dynamic product pricing. And finally, Aviation gross profit has decreased in the first 9 months by 1.2% year-on-year. 
Moving on to EBITDA. Retail segment decreased by 3%, mainly due to the decrease in fuel retail. EBITDA after the lower inventory gains, as mentioned. Corporate segment EBITDA, however, increased by 20.9%, driven by higher corporate volumes as well as cost efficiencies, efficiencies.  and EBITDA has increased also by 7.1% in the first 9 months, driven by the increase in volumes sold to strategic customers, and once again, the contribution from the cost efficiencies. In summarizing my remarks with a few remarks on cash movements. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations this is partially offset by movements in working capital. Strong cash flow generation resulted in a net debt-to-EBITDA rate of minus 0.11x at the end of September 2019. However, adjusting for interim dividend of USD 325 million for the first 6 months of 2019, approved by the Board of Directors on 29th of September, and paid early days of October, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 0.32x at end of September 2019. Now let me hand it back over to Saeed for the closing remarks."

Maybe some color on that would be quite helpful. On volumes, when we look at Aviation and corporate sales, we've seen a significant pickup this year. How sustainable is that particularly as well for aviation? And what should we think about for volumes next year for the wholesale business? And then finally, on OpEx, part of your previous guidance on Flex included the plans for adopting a lighter staff model. How should we think about cost efficiencies now given that you've canceled Flex versus what was communicated previously?"

I believe, I expect strongly that continuing into next year, they will be sustainable. Because we're starting to see some green shoots in the macro so not only sustainable, but growth as well, both on the aviation side as well as the commercial side. As far as Flex, as I pointed out, when discussed it, that only is a loss in EBITDA about circa $38 million. But as we pointed out, the additional manpower that we will incur to offer superior customer service to all our customers services to our customers and that is about USD 10 million. So in aggregate, the cost of it is about USD 48 million offering free assisted fueling and free premium service to all our customers. But again, as we pointed out, we are fully, fully confident that all of it will have 0 impact on our profitability. Given the volume uplift, which on a conservative side, we shared good numbers. About USD 12 million to USD 17 million as well as the renegotiated supply agreement, which will return approximately USD 35 million at current volumes. Of course, as volumes go up, this will equate into an amount higher than USD 35 million."

The -- this is based on feedback from thousands of our customers who ask for 2 things basically, when they've given feedback to wise. And the charge, which will now ending that charge and offering the service for free, which will bring us at parity with our competition, but also the introduction of an ADNOC Rewards program. Outside of that ending flex, do we expect disruption? No. We have triggered the additional manpower that we need to deploy the sites. The the staff is well-trained to address any queries from customers, from our stakeholders in terms of communication, in terms of a very, very customer-centric approach that we're going to take Sven Flex. We are anticipating and have already seen massive amounts of goodwill from our customers within the local community. It's in the -- from our residents. So we do not expect any disruption. So from now until Sunday morning, 6 a.m. we are putting into action a plan that is well rehearsed and all our employees, all our stakeholders, we'll see a very, very seamless process. Any pressure that we expect on the convenience store nonfuel retail revenue in short, no, as our volumes come back, we expect increased footfall in our convenience stores as well. So on a conservative side, we've shared an estimate $12 million to $17 million of incremental EBITDA, very, very confident, comfortable about delivering this. We will run promotions. We will roll out ADNOC Rewards. More details will be provided as this is disclosed to the market. But what's important to note is that infrastructure, the design will help us tremendously in delivering at the very least, of $12 million to $17 million of incremental EBITDA that we expect from our nonfuel retail from ending flex. The ADNOC rewards will play a huge role in that. Of course, we'll share more details later. As far as the average debate throughput. What I can tell you is, this is on the very, very high side. The average volume or site in our stations in Dubai is higher than the average volume per site, which is 20 million to 25 million liters per station per year in our other stations in Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates. So we're looking at a range of 18. Now obviously, for competitive reasons, we do not disclose the volume by regions. I'll tell you what that tells me, that tells me that the capacity to build out our sites in Dubai, the number of sites that we intend to drop in that market is spot on. The market is well placed to absorb many, many more of our sites. It tells me the high-volume tells me that there's congestion that each of these patients are serving higher number of people than they should. So the number of stations that were opening up, 45 by first half of 2020. Very, very comfortable about that in terms of what that's going to return in terms of volume uplift. Our strong balance sheet, thankfully, allows us to deploy this capital very, very seamlessly. So this is and will remain our focus, Dubai. I think you had 1 last question regarding revitalization?"

So opportunities have opened up for players which bring economies of scale and size to the market. So it's not a kind of a free for all margin increase. But these are both good news for us. So given the new margin regime, as I've said, we're going to be much more constructive and aggressive towards our Saudi expansion. And as always, this is subject to Board approval. So the new regime, the IRR that we expect from the international expansion into Saudi should be in the range of 15% to 20%, which now, as you know, clears our minimum 15% hurdle rate.

What I -- since I've joined the company, I've struggled a bit to understand the conflicting messages that we were getting from a commercial side, which was starting to show consistent conservative but consistent growth versus the retail side, which seemed constantly under pressure. So what was that saying about the macro. So what I've come to know what we have come to find out collectively, not only as part of the customer feedback from speaking to more than 14,000 customers. But also from running our 3 successful marketing campaigns was that the macro is just fine. The green shoots are starting to pop up. What was happening is because of our flex offering where we were not at par with their competition. This is the conflicting messages that we were getting. So the minute we took it off during the campaigns, the volumes shot up. So now very, very confident. If you look at Q3, when we ran sustainable marketing campaigns, volumes shot up by more than 1%, by about 1.3%. And overall, third quarter of 2019, 3.9%. So how do we feel about going forward, especially with Flex removed, especially with our expansion in areas which are debate in Northern Emirates, where we get organic growth. We're confident that this will sustain and continue. So we're getting support from ourselves, we're helping ourselves by ending this program that was facing customer backlash, and we're also helped by the macro."

Thank you, Athmane, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we go on to the Q3 2019 highlights, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business, and we continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions. In terms of financial performance, we have delivered a strong underlying performance. Excluding the inventory gains, underlying EBITDA grew by 10% to USD 190 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to third quarter of 2018. Fuel volumes grew 3.9% and the third quarter of 2019, including growth in the retail fuel volumes by 1.3% when compared to the same period in 2018. Positive results from our convenience stores also contributed to our higher EBITDA growth. 
Our Board of Directors have approved free assisted fueling to all our customers, which will be implemented beginning this Sunday at 6 a.m. November 3. We are confident this will be very well received by our customers and our investors, facilitating and strengthening our ambitious network expansion and volume growth targets. Providing free assisted fueling also puts us on par with our competition, supports the acceleration of our Dubai network expansion and protects our market share. As a result of the anticipated increases in fuel volumes as well as cost reductions and other initiatives, we do not expect this announcement to have any impact on our profitability or dividend policy. Our continued focus on realizing cost efficiencies, including  across the supply chain and logistics operations has contributed to a 9.3% reduction in like-for-like operating expenses for the first 9 months of 2019 compared to the 9 months of 2018. The improvements in the efficiency of our operations has also benefited our suppliers, which has enabled us to successfully renegotiate our fuel supply costs. In the renegotiated agreement with results and reduction of our retail fuel supply costs by 2 fils per liter, the benefits of which will begin to be seen during Q4 of 2019, leading to a higher fuel margin in the future.
Moving to the outlook of our business for the remainder of 2019 and 2020, we are focused on acceleration of our domestic network growth expansion, particularly in Dubai, and the growth of our non-fuel business to provide a superior experience to our customers. As part of the evolution of our customer offering, we will launch a new loyalty program, ADNOC Rewards, before the end of 2019, further enhancing our customer experience. Finally, we strive to continue to deliver a strong and sustainable growth while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. This is evidenced by the announcement and efforts of our progressive dividend policy, confirming our confidence in our growth strategy and future cash flow generation. 
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy."

So I will start off by reiterating that we remain focused on delivering our ambitious growth strategy. And building long-term shareholder value through the next phase of our growth. So we delivered strong underlying results in the third quarter and the 9 months of 2019, and we expect more to come. 
So let me begin by giving you an update on the retail fuel segment, which is, of course, our first strategic pillar. So our UAE network reached 382 retail fuel stations as of 30 September 2019. In the first 9 months of 2019, we opened 6 new stations in UAE, of which 3 are in Dubai as a result of which, we now have a total of 6 stations operating in Dubai. So we've previously had indicated a network expansion target of 20 to 30 new stations by the end of 2019, of which about half were expected in Dubai. So I'm pleased to say that we now have 45 sites in advanced stages of execution, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2020. That's 45 sites in advanced stages of execution. As far as Saudi Arabia, we saw positive development last quarter with regulators approving increase in fuel margins. So under the new margin regime, ADNOC Distribution, it's going to be much more constructive towards the Saudi expansion. This is, of course, subject to Board approval. But our focus right now will remain on the home market. So during 2019, we launched 3 marketing campaigns: that was Good Morning UAE; Fuel Up & Fly Off; and Hello Summer. Now these were targeted to incentivize station traffic. These marketing campaigns were quite successful, and they generated an increase in retail fuel volumes in the third quarter of 2019 for the first time since our IPO. 
Moving on to the corporate segment, we've achieved 6% year-on-year growth in volumes in the third quarter of 2019, and this was mostly driven by increased sales of diesel. Also during 2019, we entered the commercial 100-pound cylinder market in Dubai, and we've done so, we've entered the Dubai LPG market by partnering with established distributors. This, of course, gives us a quick route to market and a very, very effective entry. Now as mentioned earlier by Saeed, we are -- we will offer free assisted fueling to all our customers, starting 3rd of November 2019. Now let me reiterate, this is absolutely the right decision for the business over the long term. Let me add some color to that. 
Since the launch of our Flex offering 16 months ago, the customer adoption rate has been slower than anticipated. So 15% to 20% of total fuel transactions. As of right now, it's stagnating around 15%. We've received negative customer feedback and most importantly, we've lost volume to competitors who do not charge for the premium fueling service. This, coupled with the success that we saw in our recent marketing campaigns, as well as feedback from extensive customer engagement, we are confident that this decision will be well received by our customers and will be very positive for the growth of our business, especially in those areas where we are targeting growth over 2019 and 2020, which is Dubai in Northern Emirates, where we have increased competition. 
Now most importantly, this decision we do not expect this to have any impact on our profitability. And here's why, and I'm going to explain why, and some qualitative details. So we estimate that our ADNOC Flex offering had been contributing approximately USD 38 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. However, offering this service for free will result in increased fuel volume sales, which in turn will result in increased footfall at our nonfuel retail and other nonfuel services. The increased footfall will contribute approximately USD 12 million to USD 17 million of incremental EBITDA on an annual basis, one. In addition to that, we now have a renegotiated fuel supply agreement with our supplier. This will result in a reduction of our retail fuel supply costs by about 2 fils per liter. The benefits of this, we will begin to see during the fourth quarter of 2019. On an aggregate basis, this translates into approximately USD 35 million of incremental EBITDA. This is based on our last 12 months of volumes. Of course, 2 fils per liter translates into $35 million incremental EBITDA. Now as the volumes go up, which we expect them to, as a result of now offering free assisted fueling, the $35 million, driven by market share gains in the Northern Emirates and our Dubai expansion, we expect the EBITDA to increase even further. In aggregate, we expect USD 47 million to USD 52 million growth in EBITDA, which would increase further with growth in volumes. While we lose $38 million from the premium service fees, which is Flex, and we will incur an additional circa USD 10 million in stock costs. 
Moving on to nonfuel retail. Nine months, the first 9 months of 2019, pleased to announce that we've opened 14 new convenience stores across the UAE, 2 of which were opened in the third quarter of 2019. At the end of 9 months in 2019, we have a total of 264 convenience stores. Now the company's convenience store revitalization program, which we alluded to during our last conference call, is advancing and contributing to positive convenience store performance. The improvements were seen in gross margins, an uplift in average basket size in the first 9 months of 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. The sales revenue from convenience stores was up by 23% year-on-year, while gross profit has increased by 27.2% in the first 9 months of 2019. The average convenience store basket size has gone up by 5% year-on-year during the first 9 months of 2019. 
Now how did we do this? We've achieved this through various factors. First and foremost, as we alluded to, the last time we spoke. We've improved the look and feel in our stores. We've improved the category management by adapting to our customers' demands. We have introduced fresh and grab-and-go concept. Of course, we had the rewards issued to customers under our Flex initiatives and we have an improved customer value proposition through the introduction of promotions supported by in-store marketing. Now we are going to continue to focus on these ongoing improvements. In 2020, we're going to accelerate our revitalization program for 100 of our convenience stores. And to [ front this op ], we're going to enhance and improve the overall customer experience at our network of stores significantly over the remainder of 2019 and definitely all of 2020. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on our cost efficiency initiatives. Now that, of course, is the third pillar of our strategic plan. We've made significant progress in rationalizing our cash OpEx. So we've achieved about $43 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the 9 months of 2019. This was, continues to be mainly driven by cost optimization initiatives. I'm confident, we're very confident that we are completely on track to achieve around $15 million of OpEx savings in 2019 on a like-for-like basis. 
In terms of capital expenditures, so far, we've spent about $66 million of CapEx in the first 9 months of 2019. Now we've been focusing on defining a network expansion allocation so far this year. As we mentioned earlier, our network roll out is scheduled for operational deployment towards early 2020, early next year. So we certainly expect to accelerate our CapEx in 2020. 
Now for 2019, we expect this to be in the range of USD 100 million to USD 150 million compared to up to USD 300 million, which was our guidance earlier. However, we expect CapEx acceleration in 2020, given our ambitious delivery schedule, especially in Dubai. 
Now in addition to the savings we've achieved so far, we definitely see more room to achieve further OpEx savings and capital expenditure efficiency when we build out our new sites. At this point, I will hand you over to Petri, who is going to present the highlights of our financial performance."

Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. As Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive underlying results for the first 9 months of the year. Our revenues reaching USD 4.33 billio",900,"Many thanks, Mohamed. Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. As Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive underlying results for the first 9 months of the year. Our revenues reaching USD 4.33 billion, which is down by 6% compared to prior year. The decline in revenue was mainly driven by lower average pump prices in UAE in the first 9 months of 2019. To illustrate this, the 95 octane gasoline prices are averaging 9.3% below the average of prior year. That said, our convenience store revenue increased by 23% in the first 9 months, driven by better category management, introduction of new products and as Mohamed stated, supported by Flex participation as well. We also witnessed positive growth in our corporate LPG as well as Luke's businesses. First 9 months, gross profit was $1 billion, down by 4.2% on last year. This decrease was mainly due to the lower inventory gains in our fuel retail business. In the first 9 months, we saw $33 million in inventory gains versus USD 80 million last year. Meanwhile, we continue to see strong growth in our nonfuel retail business, mainly convenience stores with the first 9 months gross profit growth of 12.2% and third quarter gross profit growth of 16.6% compared to the same period last year. Commercial business gross profit also grew at a healthy rate, benefiting from dynamic pricing, which led to volume growth in corporate segment. Our gross profit margin has also some continued momentum, raising 23.4% in the first 9 months, up from 23% prior year. This is driven by a stable fixed retail margin at a lower revenue base. Gross profit was down due to lower inventory gains in the first 9 months compared to the same period last year. The underlying EBITDA for the first 9 months grew 10.6%. Reported EBITDA, however, reached $594 million growing at a slower pace of 1.1%. And once again, mainly due to the lower inventory gains that we've reported this year. The strong underlying performance was driven by improved cost efficiencies, as mentioned, and positive results of our convenience store revitalization program as well as growth in fuel volumes during the last quarter. And finally, we've generated underlying strong free cash flow, measured as EBITDA minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow is up 18.8% year-on-year to USD 527 million, driven by higher EBITDA and the lower CapEx. So moving on, summarizing the financials and operating highlights. Fuel volumes sold in the first 9 months were stable compared to last year. However, we are very pleased to report that third quarter of 2019 witnessed increase in fuel volumes of 3.9%. Q3 volumes growth was driven by improvements in the core retail markets of Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates and of course, the contribution from our new stations in Dubai as well as the rise in commercial volumes. Our retail fuel sales volumes were down by 1.9% for the first 9 months. However, after the successful marketing campaigns that Mohamed was talking about, Q3 retail fuel volumes were up by 1.3% year-on-year. This is good for the first time since the IPO. On the corporate segment side, good increase of 5.7% on last year. This is heavily driven by sales of LPG, lubricants as well as base oil volumes. And finally, our Aviation segment volumes sold to strategic customers increased also very strong at 6.7% for the first 9 months.
Looking at the gross profit performance by segment. For nonfuel retail, mainly convenience stores, there's an increase of 12.12% (sic) [ 12.2% ] year-on-year. For the first 9 months, this is reflecting the diversification strategy towards non-fuel retail as well as the implementation of the new initiatives to improve customer experience, including also a more focused revitalization program, and the positive contribution from our fuel rewards program. Fuel retail gross profit decreased, however, by 9.7% year-on-year. This is, once again, driven by the lower inventory gains, as mentioned. In the corporate segment, gross profit increased by 10.2%, and gross profit margin has increased from 17.3% to 18.6% on the back of the increase in volumes, better inventory management, as well as more dynamic product pricing. And finally, Aviation gross profit has decreased in the first 9 months by 1.2% year-on-year. 
Moving on to EBITDA. Retail segment decreased by 3%, mainly due to the decrease in fuel retail EBITDA after the lower inventory gains, as mentioned. Corporate segment EBITDA, however, increased by 20.9%, driven by higher corporate volumes as well as cost efficiencies. Aviation EBITDA has increased also by 7.1% in the first 9 months, driven by the increase in volumes sold to strategic customers, and once again, the contribution from the cost efficiencies. 
In summarizing my remarks with a few remarks on cash movements. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations. This is partially offset by movements in working capital. Strong cash flow generation resulted in a net debt-to-EBITDA rate of minus 0.11x at the end of September 2019. However, adjusting for interim dividend of USD 325 million for the first 6 months of 2019, approved by the Board of Directors on 29th of September, and paid early days of October, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 0.32x at the end of September 2019. Now let me hand it back over to Saeed for the closing remarks."

Maybe some color on that would be quite helpful. On volumes, when we look at Aviation and corporate sales, we've seen a significant pickup this year. How sustainable is that? Particularly as well for aviation? And what should we think about for volumes next year for the wholesale business? And then finally, on OpEx, part of your previous guidance on Flex included the plans for adopting a lighter staff model. How should we think about cost efficiencies now given that you've canceled Flex versus what was communicated previously?"

And there will be more to come. In terms of the CapEx, of course, there will be an impact of rollover of 2019 CapEx into 2020. And there's an element of acceleration. As stated, we will be a bit more specific in due course. But I want to reiterate that the CapEx efficiency, reducing the average CapEx spend for a service station is one of the focal points of this acceleration plan -- deployment plan going forward."

Because we're starting to see some green shoots in the macro so not only sustainable, but growth as well, both on the Aviation side as well as the commercial side. As far as Flex, as I pointed out when discussed it, not only is there loss in EBITDA, about circa $38 million. But as we pointed out, the additional manpower that we will incur to offer superior customer service to all our customers, that is about USD 10 million. So in aggregate, the cost of it is about USD 48 million, offering free assisted fueling and free premium service to all our customers. But again, as we pointed out, we are fully, fully confident that all of it will have 0 impact on our profitability. Given the volume uplift, which on a conservative side, we shared good numbers. About USD 12 million to USD 17 million as well as the renegotiated supply agreement, which will return approximately USD 35 million at current volumes. Of course, as volumes go up, this will equate into an amount higher than USD 35 million."

The -- this is based on feedback from thousands of our customers who have asked for 2 things basically, when they've given feedback to us. And the charge, which will now -- ending that charge and offering the service for free, which will bring us at parity with our competition, but also the introduction of an ADNOC Rewards program. Outside of that, ending Flex, do we expect disruption? No. We have triggered the additional manpower that we need to deploy at the sites. The staff is well-trained to address any queries from customers, from our stakeholders in terms of communication, in terms of a very, very customer-centric approach that we're going to take as we end Flex. We are anticipating and have already seen massive amounts of goodwill from our customers within the local community. It's in the -- from our residents. So we do not expect any disruption. So from now until Sunday morning, 6 a.m., we are putting into action a plan that is well rehearsed. And all our employees, all our stakeholders will see a very, very seamless process.
Any pressure that we expect on the convenience store nonfuel retail revenue? In short, no. As our volumes come back, we expect increased footfall in our convenience stores as well. So on a conservative side, we've shared an estimate $12 million to $17 million of incremental EBITDA. Very, very confident, comfortable about delivering this. We will run promotions. We will roll out ADNOC Rewards. More details will be provided as this is disclosed to the market. But what's important to note is that infrastructure, the design will help us tremendously in delivering, at the very least, the $12 million to $17 million of incremental EBITDA that we expect from our nonfuel retail, from ending Flex. The ADNOC Rewards will play a huge role in that. Of course, we'll share more details later. 
As far as the average debate throughput, what I can tell you is this is on the very, very high side. The average volume per site in our stations in Dubai is higher than the average volume per site, which is 20 million to 25 million liters per station per year in our other stations in Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates. So we're looking at a range of 18. Now obviously, for competitive reasons, we do not disclose the volume by regions. I'll tell you what that tells me, that tells me that the capacity to build out our sites in Dubai, the number of sites that we intend to drop in that market is spot on. The market is well placed to absorb many, many more of our sites. This tells me, the high-volume tells me that there's congestion, that each of these patients are serving higher number of people than they should. So the number of stations that were opening up, 45 by first half of 2020. Very, very comfortable about that in terms of what that's going to return in terms of volume uplift. Our strong balance sheet, thankfully, allows us to deploy this capital very, very seamlessly. So this is and will remain our focus, Dubai. I think you had 1 last question regarding revitalization?"

So what we know, being a major player in the industry are 2 things. One, the increase in margin is not across the board. So not only is it set to make investment in this sector more attractive, but it's only for the larger players of scale. So opportunities have opened up for players which bring economies of scale and size to the market. So it's not a kind of a free for all margin increase. But these are both good news for us. So given the new margin regime, as I've said, we're going to be much more constructive and aggressive towards our Saudi expansion. And as always, this is subject to Board approval. So the new regime, the IRR that we expect from the international expansion into Saudi should be in the range of 15% to 20%, which now, as you know, clears our minimum 15% hurdle rate. But to answer your question, absolutely. We are looking at Saudi, and we are looking to make a move."

So what was that saying about the macro? So what I've come to know, what we have come to find out collectively, not only as part of the customer feedback from speaking to more than 14,000 customers, but also from running our 3 successful marketing campaigns was that the macro is just fine. The green shoots are starting to pop up. What was happening is, because of our Flex offering where we were not at par with our competition, this is the conflicting messages that we were getting. So the minute we took it off during the campaigns, the volumes shot up. So now, very, very confident. If you look at Q3, when we ran sustainable marketing campaigns, volumes shot up by more than 1%, by about 1.3%. And overall, third quarter of 2019, 3.9%. So how do we feel about going forward? Especially with Flex removed, especially with our expansion, expansion in areas which are Dubai and Northern Emirates, where we get organic growth? We're confident that this will sustain and continue. So we're getting support from ourselves, we're helping ourselves by ending this program that was facing customer backlash, and we're also helped by the macro."

Thank you, Athmane, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we go on to the Q3 2019 highlights, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business, and we continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions. In terms of financial performance, we have delivered a strong underlying performance. Excluding the inventory gains, underlying EBITDA grew by 10% to USD 190 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to third quarter of 2018. Fuel volumes grew 3.9% and the third quarter of 2019, including growth in the retail fuel volumes by 1.3% when compared to the same period in 2018. Positive results from our convenience stores also contributed to our higher EBITDA growth. 
Our Board of Directors have approved free assisted fueling to all our customers, which will be implemented beginning this Sunday at 6 a.m. November 3. We are confident this will be very well received by our customers and our investors, facilitating and strengthening our ambitious network expansion and volume growth targets. Providing free assisted fueling also puts us on par with our competition, supports the acceleration of our Dubai network expansion and protects our market share. As a result of the anticipated increases in fuel volumes as well as cost reductions and other initiatives, we do not expect this announcement to have any impact on our profitability or dividend policy. 
Our continued focus on realizing cost efficiencies, including  across the supply chain and logistics operations has contributed to a 9.3% reduction in like-to-like (sic) [like-for-like] operating expenses for the first 9 months of 2019 compared to the 9 months of 2018. The improvements in the efficiency of our operations has also benefited our suppliers, which has enabled us to successfully renegotiate our fuel supply costs. In the renegotiated agreement with results and reduction of our retail fuel supply costs by 2 fils per liter, the benefits of which will begin to be seen during Q4 of 2019, leading to a higher fuel margin in the future.
Moving to the outlook of our business for the remainder of 2019 and 2020, we are focused on acceleration of our domestic network growth expansion, particularly in Dubai, and the growth of our non-fuel business to provide a superior experience to our customers. As part of the evolution of our customer offering, we will launch a new loyalty program, ADNOC Rewards, before the end of 2019, further enhancing our customer experience. Finally, we strive to continue to deliver a strong and sustainable growth while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. This is evidenced by the announcement and efforts of our progressive dividend policy, confirming our confidence in our growth strategy and future cash flow generation. 
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy."

So I will start off by reiterating that we remain focused on delivering our ambitious growth strategy. And building long-term shareholder value through the next phase of our growth. So we delivered strong underlying results in the third quarter and the 9 months of 2019, and we expect more to come. 
So let me begin by giving you an update on the retail fuel segment, which is, of course, our first strategic pillar. So our UAE network reached 382 retail fuel stations as of 30 September 2019. In the first 9 months of 2019, we opened 6 new stations in UAE, of which 3 are in Dubai as a result of which, we now have a total of 6 stations operating in Dubai. So we've previously had indicated a network expansion target of 20 to 30 new stations by the end of 2019, of which about half were expected in Dubai. So I'm pleased to say that we now have 45 sites in advanced stages of execution, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2020. 
That's 45 sites in advanced stages of execution. As far as Saudi Arabia, we saw positive development last quarter with regulators approving increase in fuel margins. So under the new margin regime, ADNOC Distribution, it's going to be much more constructive towards the Saudi expansion. This is, of course, subject to Board approval. But our focus right now will remain on the home market. So during 2019, we launched 3 marketing campaigns: that was Good Morning UAE; Fuel Up & Fly Off; and Hello Summer. Now these were targeted to incentivize station traffic. These marketing campaigns were quite successful, and they generated an increase in retail fuel volumes in the third quarter of 2019 for the first time since our IPO. 
Moving on to the corporate segment, we've achieved 6% year-on-year growth in volumes in the third quarter of 2019, and this was mostly driven by increased sales of diesel. Also during 2019, we entered the commercial 100-pound cylinder market in Dubai, and we've done so, we've entered the Dubai LPG market by partnering with established distributors. This, of course, gives us a quick route to market and a very, very effective entry. Now as mentioned earlier by Saeed, we are -- we will offer free assisted fueling to all our customers, starting 3rd of November 2019. Now let me reiterate, this is absolutely the right decision for the business over the long term. Let me add some color to that. 
Since the launch of our Flex offering 16 months ago, the customer adoption rate has been slower than anticipated. So 15% to 20% of total fuel transactions. As of right now, it's stagnating around 15%. We've received negative customer feedback and most importantly, we've lost volume to competitors who do not charge for the premium fueling service. This, coupled with the success that we saw in our recent marketing campaigns, as well as feedback from extensive customer engagement, we are confident that this decision will be well received by our customers and will be very positive for the growth of our business, especially in those areas where we are targeting growth over 2019 and 2020, which is Dubai in Northern Emirates, where we have increased competition. 
Now most importantly, this decision we do not expect this to have any impact on our profitability. And here's why, and I'm going to explain why, and some qualitative details. So we estimate that our ADNOC Flex offering had been contributing approximately USD 38 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. However, offering this service for free will result in increased fuel volume sales, which in turn will result in increased footfall at our nonfuel retail and other nonfuel services. The increased footfall will contribute approximately USD 12 million to USD 17 million of incremental EBITDA on an annual basis, one. 
In addition to that, we now have a renegotiated fuel supply agreement with our suppliers. This will result in a reduction of our retail fuel supply costs by about 2 fils per liter. The benefits of this, we will begin to see during the fourth quarter of 2019. On an aggregate basis, this translates into approximately USD 35 million of incremental EBITDA. This is based on our last 12 months of volumes. Of course, 2 fils per liter translates into $35 million incremental EBITDA. Now as the volumes go up, which we expect them to, as a result of now offering free assisted fueling, the $35 million, driven by market share gains in the Northern Emirates and our Dubai expansion, we expect the EBITDA to increase even further. 
In aggregate, we expect USD 47 million to USD 52 million growth in EBITDA, which would increase further with growth in volumes. While we lose $38 million from the premium service fees, which is Flex, and we will incur an additional circa USD 10 million in stock costs. 
Moving on to nonfuel retail. Nine months, the first 9 months of 2019, pleased to announce that we've opened 14 new convenience stores across the UAE, 2 of which were opened in the third quarter of 2019. At the end of 9 months 2019, we have a total of 264 convenience stores. Now the company's convenience stores' revitalization program, which we alluded to during our last conference call, is advancing and contributing to positive convenience store performance. The improvements were seen in gross margins, an uplift in average basket size in the first 9 months of 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. The sales revenue from convenience stores was up by 23% year-on-year, while gross profit has increased by 27.2% in the first 9 months of 2019. The average convenience store basket size has gone up by 5% year-on-year during the first 9 months of 2019. 
Now how did we do this? We've achieved this through various factors. First and foremost, as we alluded to, the last time we spoke. We've improved the look and feel in our stores. We've improved the category management by adapting to our customers' demands. We have introduced fresh and grab-and-go concept. Of course, we had the rewards issued to customers under our Flex initiatives and we have an improved customer value proposition through the introduction of promotions supported by in-store marketing. Now we are going to continue to focus on these ongoing improvements. In 2020, we're going to accelerate our revitalization program for 100 of our convenience stores. 
And to [ fund this up ], we're going to enhance and improve the overall customer experience at our network of stores significantly over the remainder of 2019 and definitely all of 2020. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on our cost efficiency initiatives. Now that, of course, is the third pillar of our strategic plan. We've made significant progress in rationalizing our cash OpEx. So we've achieved about $43 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the 9 months of 2019. This was, continues to be mainly driven by cost optimization initiatives. I'm confident, we're very confident that we are completely on track to achieve around $15 million of OpEx savings in 2019 on a like-for-like basis. 
In terms of capital expenditures, so far, we've spent about $66 million of CapEx in the first 9 months of 2019. Now we've been focusing on defining a network expansion allocation so far this year. As we mentioned earlier, our network roll out is scheduled for operational deployment towards early 2020, early next year. So we certainly expect to accelerate our CapEx in 2020. 
Now for 2019, we expect this to be in the range of USD 100 million to USD 150 million compared to up to USD 300 million, which was our guidance earlier. However, we expect CapEx acceleration in 2020, given our ambitious delivery schedule, especially in Dubai. 
Now in addition to the savings we've achieved so far, we definitely see more room to achieve further OpEx savings and capital expenditure efficiency when we build out our new sites. At this point, I will hand you over to Petri, who is going to present the highlights of our financial performance."

Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. As Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive underlying results for the first 9 months of the year. Our revenues reaching USD 4.33 billio",902,"Many thanks, Mohamed. Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. As Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive underlying results for the first 9 months of the year. Our revenues reaching USD 4.33 billion, which is down by 6% compared to prior year. The decline in revenue was mainly driven by lower average pump prices in UAE in the first 9 months of 2019. To illustrate this, the 95 octane gasoline prices are averaging 9.3% below the average of prior year. That said, our convenience store revenue increased by 23% in the first 9 months, driven by better category management, introduction of new products and as Mohamed stated, supported by Flex participation as well. We also witnessed positive growth in our corporate LPG as well as [ lube's ] businesses. .
First 9 months, gross profit was USD 1 billion, down by 4.2% on last year. This decrease was mainly due to the lower inventory gains in our fuel retail business. In the first 9 months, we saw $33 million in inventory gains versus USD 80 million last year. Meanwhile, we continue to see strong growth in our nonfuel retail business, mainly convenience stores with the first 9 months gross profit growth of 12.2% and third quarter gross profit growth of 16.6% compared to the same period last year. Commercial business gross profit also grew at a healthy rate, benefiting from dynamic pricing, which led to volume growth in corporate segment. Our gross profit margin has also some continued momentum, raising 23.4% in the first 9 months, up from 23% prior year. 
This is driven by a stable fixed retail margin at a lower revenue base. Gross profit was down due to lower inventory gains in the first 9 months compared to the same period last year. The underlying EBITDA for the first 9 months grew 10.6%. Reported EBITDA, however, reached $594 million growing at a slower pace of 1.1%. And once again, mainly due to the lower inventory gains we've reported this year. The strong underlying performance was driven by improved cost efficiencies, as mentioned, and positive results of our convenience store revitalization program as well as growth in fuel volumes during the last quarter. And finally, we've generated underlying strong free cash flow, measured as EBITDA minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow is up 18.8% year-on-year to USD 527 million, driven by higher EBITDA and the lower CapEx. So moving on, summarizing the financials and operating highlights. 
Fuel volumes sold in the first 9 months were stable compared to last year. However, we are very pleased to report that third quarter of 2019 witnessed increase in fuel volumes of 3.9%. Q3 volumes growth was driven by improvements in the core retail markets of Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates and of course, the contribution from our new stations in Dubai as well as the rise in commercial volumes. Our retail fuel sales volumes were down by 1.9% for the first 9 months. However, after the successful marketing campaigns that Mohamed was talking about, Q3 retail fuel volumes were up by 1.3% year-on-year. This is for the first time since the IPO. On the corporate segment side, good increase of 5.7% on last year. This is heavily driven by sales of LPG, lubricants as well as base oil volumes. And finally, our Aviation segment volumes sold to strategic customers increased also very strong at 6.7% for the first 9 months.
Looking at the gross profit performance by segment. For nonfuel retail, mainly convenience stores, there's an increase of 12.12% (sic) [ 12.2% ] year-on-year. For the first 9 months, this is reflecting the diversification strategy towards non-fuel retail as well as the implementation of the new initiatives to improve customer experience, including also a more focused revitalization program, and the positive contribution from our fuel rewards program. Fuel retail gross profit decreased, however, by 9.7% year-on-year. This is, once again, driven by the lower inventory gains, as mentioned. In the corporate segment, gross profit increased by 10.2%, and gross profit margin has increased from 17.3% to 18.6% on the back of the increase in volumes, better inventory management, as well as more dynamic product pricing. And finally, Aviation gross profit has decreased in the first 9 months by 1.2% year-on-year. 
Moving on to EBITDA. Retail segment decreased by 3%, mainly due to the decrease in fuel retail EBITDA after the lower inventory gains, as mentioned. Corporate segment EBITDA, however, increased by 20.9%, driven by higher corporate volumes as well as cost efficiencies. Aviation EBITDA has increased also by 7.1% in the first 9 months, driven by the increase in volumes sold to strategic customers, and once again, the contribution from the cost efficiencies. 
In summarizing my remarks with a few remarks on cash movements. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations. This is partially offset by movements in working capital. Strong cash flow generation resulted in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of minus 0.11x at the end of September 2019. However, adjusting for interim dividend of USD 325 million for the first 6 months of 2019, approved by the Board of Directors on 29th of September, and paid early days of October, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 0.32x at the end of September 2019. Now let me hand it back over to Saeed for the closing remarks."

So when thinking about CapEx next year, should we kind of assume that $300 million number that you've assumed for '19 to be kind of phased out between second half of this year and next year? Maybe some color on that would be quite helpful. On volumes, when we look at Aviation and corporate sales, we've seen a significant pickup this year. 
How sustainable is that? Particularly as well for aviation? And what should we think about for volumes next year for the wholesale business? And then finally, on OpEx, part of your previous guidance on Flex included plans for adopting a lighter staff model. How should we think about cost efficiencies now given that you've canceled Flex versus what was communicated previously?"

And there will be more to come. In terms of the CapEx, of course, there will be an impact of rollover of 2019 CapEx into 2020. And there's an element of acceleration. As stated, we will be a bit more specific in due course. But I want to reiterate that the CapEx efficiency, reducing the average CapEx spend for a service station is one of the focal points of this acceleration plan -- deployment plan going forward."

I believe, I expect strongly that continuing into next year, they will be sustainable. Because we're starting to see some green shoots in the macro so not only sustainable, but growth as well, both on the Aviation side as well as the commercial side. As far as Flex, as I pointed out when we discussed it, not only is there a loss in EBITDA, about circa $38 million. But as we pointed out, the additional manpower that we will incur to offer superior customer service to all our customers, that is about USD 10 million. 
So in aggregate, the cost of it is about USD 48 million of offering free assisted fueling and free premium service to all our customers. But again, as we pointed out, we are fully, fully confident that all of it will have 0 impact on our profitability. Given the volume uplift, which on a conservative side, we shared [ those ] numbers. About USD 12 million to USD 17 million as well as the renegotiated supply agreement, which will return approximately USD 35 million at current volumes. Of course, as volumes go up, this will equate into an amount higher than USD 35 million."

That's my second question. And the third question is also on the C-stores. You mentioned 100 stores to be revitalized into next year. Based on the experience and the exercise that you've been doing since the IPO, how much of an uplift do you expect from this revitalization exercise on a per-store basis in terms of sales or basket size growth or transactions? Just if you can give us some color there. That's it from my end."

So let's start off with the disruption from Flex. So this is something we're fully prepared for. This ends, obviously, on the 3rd of November, starting at 6 a.m., we're going to offer free assisted fueling to all our customers. The -- this is based on feedback from thousands of our customers who have asked for 2 things basically, when they've given feedback to us. End the charge, which will now -- ending that charge and offering the service for free, which will bring us at parity with our competition, but also the introduction of an ADNOC Rewards program. Outside of that, ending Flex, do we expect disruption? No. We have triggered the additional manpower that we need to deploy at the sites. 
The staff is well-trained to address any queries from customers, from our stakeholders in terms of communication, in terms of a very, very customer-centric approach that we're going to take as we end Flex. We are anticipating and have already seen massive amounts of goodwill from our customers within the local community. It's in the -- from our residents. So we do not expect any disruption. So from now until Sunday morning, 6 a.m., we are putting into action a plan that is well rehearsed. And all our employees, all our stakeholders will see a very, very seamless process.
Any pressure that we expect on the convenience store nonfuel retail revenue? In short, no. As our volumes come back, we expect increased footfall in our convenience stores as well. So on a conservative side, we've shared an estimate $12 million to $17 million of incremental EBITDA. Very, very confident, comfortable about delivering this. We will run promotions. We will roll out ADNOC Rewards. More details will be provided as this is disclosed to the market. But what's important to note is that infrastructure, the design will help us tremendously in delivering, at the very least, the $12 million to $17 million of incremental EBITDA that we expect from our nonfuel retail, from ending Flex. The ADNOC Rewards will play a huge role in that. Of course, we'll share more details later. 
As far as the average Dubai throughput, what I can tell you is this is on the very, very high side. The average volume per site in our stations in Dubai is higher than the average volume per site, which is 20 million to 25 million liters per station per year in our other stations in Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates. So we're looking at a range of 18. Now obviously, for competitive reasons, we do not disclose the volume by regions. I'll tell you what that tells me, that tells me that the capacity to build out our sites in Dubai, the number of sites that we intend to drop in that market is spot on. The market is well placed to absorb many, many more of our sites. 
This tells me, the high-volume tells me that there's congestion, that each of these stations are serving higher number of people than they should. So the number of stations that were opening up, 45 by first half of 2020. Very, very comfortable about that in terms of what that's going to return in terms of volume uplift. Our strong balance sheet, thankfully, allows us to deploy this capital very, very seamlessly. So this is and will remain our focus, Dubai. I think you had one last question regarding revitalization?"

So given the new margin regime, as I've said, we're going to be much more constructive and aggressive towards our Saudi expansion. And as always, this is subject to Board approval. So the new regime, the IRR that we expect from the international expansion into Saudi should be in the range of 15% to 20%, which now, as you know, clears our minimum 15% hurdle rate.

So what I've come to know, what we have come to find out collectively, not only as part of the customer feedback from speaking to more than 14,000 customers, but also from running our 3 successful marketing campaigns was that the macro is just fine. 
The green shoots are starting to pop up. What was happening is, because of our Flex offering where we were not at par with our competition, this is the conflicting messages that we were getting. So the minute we took it off during the campaigns, the volumes shot up. So now, very, very confident. If you look at Q3, when we ran sustainable marketing campaigns, volumes shot up by more than 1%, by about 1.3%. And overall, third quarter of 2019, 3.9%.

Thank you, Athmane, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we go on to the Q3 2019 highlights, I would like to reiterate that safety remains a core value to our business, and we continue to enhance and invest in safety solutions. In terms of financial performance, we have delivered a strong underlying performance. Excluding the inventory gains, underlying EBITDA grew by 10% to USD 190 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to third quarter of 2018. Fuel volumes grew 3.9% and the third quarter of 2019, including growth in the retail fuel volumes by 1.3% when compared to the same period in 2018. Positive results from our convenience stores also contributed to our higher EBITDA growth. 
Our Board of Directors have approved free assisted fueling to all our customers, which will be implemented beginning this Sunday at 6 a.m. November 3. We are confident this will be very well received by our customers and our investors, facilitating and strengthening our ambitious network expansion and volume growth targets. Providing free assisted fueling also puts us on par with our competition, supports the acceleration of our Dubai network expansion and protects our market share. As a result of the anticipated increases in fuel volumes as well as cost reductions and other initiatives, we do not expect this announcement to have any impact on our profitability or dividend policy. 
Our continued focus on realizing cost efficiencies, including  across the supply chain and logistics operations has contributed to a 9.3% reduction in like-to-like (sic) [like-for-like] operating expenses for the first 9 months of 2019 compared to the 9 months of 2018. The improvements in the efficiency of our operations has also benefited our suppliers, which has enabled us to successfully renegotiate our fuel supply costs. In the renegotiated agreement with results and reduction of our retail fuel supply costs by 2 fils per liter, the benefits of which will begin to be seen during Q4 of 2019, leading to a higher fuel margin in the future.
Moving to the outlook of our business for the remainder of 2019 and 2020, we are focused on acceleration of our domestic network growth expansion, particularly in Dubai, and the growth of our non-fuel business to provide a superior experience to our customers. As part of the evolution of our customer offering, we will launch a new loyalty program, ADNOC Rewards, before the end of 2019, further enhancing our customer experience. Finally, we strive to continue to deliver a strong and sustainable growth while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. This is evidenced by the announcement and efforts of our progressive dividend policy, confirming our confidence in our growth strategy and future cash flow generation. 
I will now let Mohamed give you an update and more color on our strategy."

So I will start off by reiterating that we remain focused on delivering our ambitious growth strategy. And building long-term shareholder value through the next phase of our growth. So we delivered strong underlying results in the third quarter and the 9 months of 2019, and we expect more to come. 
So let me begin by giving you an update on the retail fuel segment, which is, of course, our first strategic pillar. So our UAE network reached 382 retail fuel stations as of 30 September 2019. In the first 9 months of 2019, we opened 6 new stations in UAE, of which 3 are in Dubai as a result of which, we now have a total of 6 stations operating in Dubai. So we've previously had indicated a network expansion target of 20 to 30 new stations by the end of 2019, of which about half were expected in Dubai. So I'm pleased to say that we now have 45 sites in advanced stages of execution, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2020. 
That's 45 sites in advanced stages of execution. As far as Saudi Arabia, we saw positive development last quarter with regulators approving increase in fuel margins. So under the new margin regime, ADNOC Distribution, it's going to be much more constructive towards the Saudi expansion. This is, of course, subject to Board approval. But our focus right now will remain on the home market. So during 2019, we launched 3 marketing campaigns: that was Good Morning UAE; Fuel Up & Fly Off; and Hello Summer. Now these were targeted to incentivize station traffic. These marketing campaigns were quite successful, and they generated an increase in retail fuel volumes in the third quarter of 2019 for the first time since our IPO. 
Moving on to the corporate segment, we've achieved 6% year-on-year growth in volumes in the third quarter of 2019, and this was mostly driven by increased sales of diesel. Also during 2019, we entered the commercial 100-pound cylinder market in Dubai, and we've done so, we've entered the Dubai LPG market by partnering with established distributors. This, of course, gives us a quick route to market and a very, very effective entry. Now as mentioned earlier by Saeed, we are -- we will offer free assisted fueling to all our customers, starting 3rd of November 2019. Now let me reiterate, this is absolutely the right decision for the business over the long term. Let me add some color to that. 
Since the launch of our Flex offering 16 months ago, the customer adoption rate has been slower than anticipated. So 15% to 20% of total fuel transactions. As of right now, it's stagnating around 15%. We've received negative customer feedback and most importantly, we've lost volume to competitors who do not charge for the premium fueling service. This, coupled with the success that we saw in our recent marketing campaigns, as well as feedback from extensive customer engagement, we are confident that this decision will be well received by our customers and will be very positive for the growth of our business, especially in those areas where we are targeting growth over 2019 and 2020, which is Dubai in Northern Emirates, where we have increased competition. 
Now most importantly, this decision we do not expect this to have any impact on our profitability. And here's why, and I'm going to explain why, and some qualitative details. So we estimate that our ADNOC Flex offering had been contributing approximately USD 38 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. However, offering this service for free will result in increased fuel volume sales, which in turn will result in increased footfall at our nonfuel retail and other nonfuel services. The increased footfall will contribute approximately USD 12 million to USD 17 million of incremental EBITDA on an annual basis, one. 
In addition to that, we now have a renegotiated fuel supply agreement with our suppliers. This will result in a reduction of our retail fuel supply costs by about 2 fils per liter. The benefits of this, we will begin to see during the fourth quarter of 2019. On an aggregate basis, this translates into approximately USD 35 million of incremental EBITDA. This is based on our last 12 months of volumes. Of course, 2 fils per liter translates into $35 million incremental EBITDA. Now as the volumes go up, which we expect them to, as a result of now offering free assisted fueling, the $35 million, driven by market share gains in the Northern Emirates and our Dubai expansion, we expect the EBITDA to increase even further. 
In aggregate, we expect USD 47 million to USD 52 million growth in EBITDA, which would increase further with growth in volumes. While we lose $38 million from the premium service fees, which is Flex, and we will incur an additional circa USD 10 million in stock costs. 
Moving on to nonfuel retail. Nine months, the first 9 months of 2019, pleased to announce that we've opened 14 new convenience stores across the UAE, 2 of which were opened in the third quarter of 2019. At the end of 9 months 2019, we have a total of 264 convenience stores. Now the company's convenience stores' revitalization program, which we alluded to during our last conference call, is advancing and contributing to positive convenience store performance. The improvements were seen in gross margins, an uplift in average basket size in the first 9 months of 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. The sales revenue from convenience stores was up by 23% year-on-year, while gross profit has increased by 27.2% in the first 9 months of 2019. The average convenience store basket size has gone up by 5% year-on-year during the first 9 months of 2019. 
Now how did we do this? We've achieved this through various factors. First and foremost, as we alluded to, the last time we spoke. We've improved the look and feel in our stores. We've improved the category management by adapting to our customers' demands. We have introduced fresh and grab-and-go concept. Of course, we had the rewards issued to customers under our Flex initiatives and we have an improved customer value proposition through the introduction of promotions supported by in-store marketing. Now we are going to continue to focus on these ongoing improvements. In 2020, we're going to accelerate our revitalization program for 100 of our convenience stores. 
And to [ fund this up ], we're going to enhance and improve the overall customer experience at our network of stores significantly over the remainder of 2019 and definitely all of 2020. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on our cost efficiency initiatives. Now that, of course, is the third pillar of our strategic plan. We've made significant progress in rationalizing our cash OpEx. So we've achieved about $43 million in like-for-like OpEx savings in the 9 months of 2019. This was, continues to be mainly driven by cost optimization initiatives. I'm confident, we're very confident that we are completely on track to achieve around $15 million of OpEx savings in 2019 on a like-for-like basis. 
In terms of capital expenditures, so far, we've spent about $66 million of CapEx in the first 9 months of 2019. Now we've been focusing on defining a network expansion allocation so far this year. As we mentioned earlier, our network roll out is scheduled for operational deployment towards early 2020, early next year. So we certainly expect to accelerate our CapEx in 2020. 
Now for 2019, we expect this to be in the range of USD 100 million to USD 150 million compared to up to USD 300 million, which was our guidance earlier. However, we expect CapEx acceleration in 2020, given our ambitious delivery schedule, especially in Dubai. 
Now in addition to the savings we've achieved so far, we definitely see more room to achieve further OpEx savings and capital expenditure efficiency when we build out our new sites. At this point, I will hand you over to Petri, who is going to present the highlights of our financial performance."

Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. As Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive underlying results for the first 9 months of the year. Our revenues reaching USD 4.33 billio",902,"Many thanks, Mohamed. Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. As Mohamed mentioned, the implementation of initiatives have resulted in the achievement of positive underlying results for the first 9 months of the year. Our revenues reaching USD 4.33 billion, which is down by 6% compared to prior year. The decline in revenue was mainly driven by lower average pump prices in UAE in the first 9 months of 2019. To illustrate this, the 95 octane gasoline prices are averaging 9.3% below the average of prior year. That said, our convenience store revenue increased by 23% in the first 9 months, driven by better category management, introduction of new products and as Mohamed stated, supported by Flex participation as well. We also witnessed positive growth in our corporate LPG as well as [ lube's ] businesses. .
First 9 months, gross profit was USD 1 billion, down by 4.2% on last year. This decrease was mainly due to the lower inventory gains in our fuel retail business. In the first 9 months, we saw $33 million in inventory gains versus USD 80 million last year. Meanwhile, we continue to see strong growth in our nonfuel retail business, mainly convenience stores with the first 9 months gross profit growth of 12.2% and third quarter gross profit growth of 16.6% compared to the same period last year. Commercial business gross profit also grew at a healthy rate, benefiting from dynamic pricing, which led to volume growth in corporate segment. Our gross profit margin has also some continued momentum, raising 23.4% in the first 9 months, up from 23% prior year. 
This is driven by a stable fixed retail margin at a lower revenue base. Gross profit was down due to lower inventory gains in the first 9 months compared to the same period last year. The underlying EBITDA for the first 9 months grew 10.6%. Reported EBITDA, however, reached $594 million growing at a slower pace of 1.1%. And once again, mainly due to the lower inventory gains we've reported this year. The strong underlying performance was driven by improved cost efficiencies, as mentioned, and positive results of our convenience store revitalization program as well as growth in fuel volumes during the last quarter. And finally, we've generated underlying strong free cash flow, measured as EBITDA minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow is up 18.8% year-on-year to USD 527 million, driven by higher EBITDA and the lower CapEx. So moving on, summarizing the financials and operating highlights. 
Fuel volumes sold in the first 9 months were stable compared to last year. However, we are very pleased to report that third quarter of 2019 witnessed increase in fuel volumes of 3.9%. Q3 volumes growth was driven by improvements in the core retail markets of Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates and of course, the contribution from our new stations in Dubai as well as the rise in commercial volumes. Our retail fuel sales volumes were down by 1.9% for the first 9 months. However, after the successful marketing campaigns that Mohamed was talking about, Q3 retail fuel volumes were up by 1.3% year-on-year. This is for the first time since the IPO. On the corporate segment side, good increase of 5.7% on last year. This is heavily driven by sales of LPG, lubricants as well as base oil volumes. And finally, our Aviation segment volumes sold to strategic customers increased also very strong at 6.7% for the first 9 months.
Looking at the gross profit performance by segment. For nonfuel retail, mainly convenience stores, there's an increase of 12.12% (sic) [ 12.2% ] year-on-year. For the first 9 months, this is reflecting the diversification strategy towards non-fuel retail as well as the implementation of the new initiatives to improve customer experience, including also a more focused revitalization program, and the positive contribution from our fuel rewards program. Fuel retail gross profit decreased, however, by 9.7% year-on-year. This is, once again, driven by the lower inventory gains, as mentioned. In the corporate segment, gross profit increased by 10.2%, and gross profit margin has increased from 17.3% to 18.6% on the back of the increase in volumes, better inventory management, as well as more dynamic product pricing. And finally, Aviation gross profit has decreased in the first 9 months by 1.2% year-on-year. 
Moving on to EBITDA. Retail segment decreased by 3%, mainly due to the decrease in fuel retail EBITDA after the lower inventory gains, as mentioned. Corporate segment EBITDA, however, increased by 20.9%, driven by higher corporate volumes as well as cost efficiencies. Aviation EBITDA has increased also by 7.1% in the first 9 months, driven by the increase in volumes sold to strategic customers, and once again, the contribution from the cost efficiencies. 
In summarizing my remarks with a few remarks on cash movements. Net cash generated from operating activities has increased mainly due to robust cash flow from operations. This is partially offset by movements in working capital. Strong cash flow generation resulted in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of minus 0.11x at the end of September 2019. However, adjusting for interim dividend of USD 325 million for the first 6 months of 2019, approved by the Board of Directors on 29th of September, and paid early days of October, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 0.32x at the end of September 2019. Now let me hand it back over to Saeed for the closing remarks."

So when thinking about CapEx next year, should we kind of assume that $300 million number that you've assumed for '19 to be kind of phased out between second half of this year and next year? Maybe some color on that would be quite helpful. On volumes, when we look at Aviation and corporate sales, we've seen a significant pickup this year. 
How sustainable is that? Particularly as well for aviation? And what should we think about for volumes next year for the wholesale business? And then finally, on OpEx, part of your previous guidance on Flex included plans for adopting a lighter staff model. How should we think about cost efficiencies now given that you've canceled Flex versus what was communicated previously?"

And there will be more to come. In terms of the CapEx, of course, there will be an impact of rollover of 2019 CapEx into 2020. And there's an element of acceleration. As stated, we will be a bit more specific in due course. But I want to reiterate that the CapEx efficiency, reducing the average CapEx spend for a service station is one of the focal points of this acceleration plan -- deployment plan going forward."

I believe, I expect strongly that continuing into next year, they will be sustainable. Because we're starting to see some green shoots in the macro so not only sustainable, but growth as well, both on the Aviation side as well as the commercial side. As far as Flex, as I pointed out when we discussed it, not only is there a loss in EBITDA, about circa $38 million. But as we pointed out, the additional manpower that we will incur to offer superior customer service to all our customers, that is about USD 10 million. 
So in aggregate, the cost of it is about USD 48 million of offering free assisted fueling and free premium service to all our customers. But again, as we pointed out, we are fully, fully confident that all of it will have 0 impact on our profitability. Given the volume uplift, which on a conservative side, we shared [ those ] numbers. About USD 12 million to USD 17 million as well as the renegotiated supply agreement, which will return approximately USD 35 million at current volumes. Of course, as volumes go up, this will equate into an amount higher than USD 35 million."

The second question is on the Dubai landscape. You have 6 stations now. 
Can we just get some color how the performance of these 6 stations are? And primarily in terms of the throughput compared to your existing network in Abu Dhabi and Northern Emirates. That's my second question. And the third question is also on the C-stores. You mentioned 100 stores to be revitalized into next year.

This ends, obviously, on the 3rd of November, starting at 6 a.m., we're going to offer free assisted fueling to all our customers. The -- this is based on feedback from thousands of our customers who have asked for 2 things basically, when they've given feedback to us. End the charge, which will now -- ending that charge and offering the service for free, which will bring us at parity with our competition, but also the introduction of an ADNOC Rewards program. Outside of that, ending Flex, do we expect disruption? No. We have triggered the additional manpower that we need to deploy at the sites. 
The staff is well-trained to address any queries from customers, from our stakeholders in terms of communication, in terms of a very, very customer-centric approach that we're going to take as we end Flex. We are anticipating and have already seen massive amounts of goodwill from our customers within the local community. It's in the -- from our residents. So we do not expect any disruption. So from now until Sunday morning, 6 a.m., we are putting into action a plan that is well rehearsed. And all our employees, all our stakeholders will see a very, very seamless process.
Any pressure that we expect on the convenience store nonfuel retail revenue? In short, no. As our volumes come back, we expect increased footfall in our convenience stores as well. So on a conservative side, we've shared an estimate $12 million to $17 million of incremental EBITDA. Very, very confident, comfortable about delivering this. We will run promotions. We will roll out ADNOC Rewards. More details will be provided as this is disclosed to the market. But what's important to note is that infrastructure, the design will help us tremendously in delivering, at the very least, the $12 million to $17 million of incremental EBITDA that we expect from our nonfuel retail, from ending Flex. The ADNOC Rewards will play a huge role in that. Of course, we'll share more details later. 
As far as the average Dubai throughput, what I can tell you is this is on the very, very high side. The average volume per site in our stations in Dubai is higher than the average volume per site, which is 20 million to 25 million liters per station per year in our other stations in Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates. So we're looking at a range of 18. Now obviously, for competitive reasons, we do not disclose the volume by regions. I'll tell you what that tells me, that tells me that the capacity to build out our sites in Dubai, the number of sites that we intend to drop in that market is spot on. The market is well placed to absorb many, many more of our sites. 
This tells me, the high-volume tells me that there's congestion, that each of these stations are serving higher number of people than they should. So the number of stations that were opening up, 45 by first half of 2020. Very, very comfortable about that in terms of what that's going to return in terms of volume uplift. Our strong balance sheet, thankfully, allows us to deploy this capital very, very seamlessly. So this is and will remain our focus, Dubai.

So given the new margin regime, as I've said, we're going to be much more constructive and aggressive towards our Saudi expansion. And as always, this is subject to Board approval. So the new regime, the IRR that we expect from the international expansion into Saudi should be in the range of 15% to 20%, which now, as you know, clears our minimum 15% hurdle rate.

So what I've come to know, what we have come to find out collectively, not only as part of the customer feedback from speaking to more than 14,000 customers, but also from running our 3 successful marketing campaigns was that the macro is just fine. 
The green shoots are starting to pop up. What was happening is, because of our Flex offering where we were not at par with our competition, this is the conflicting messages that we were getting. So the minute we took it off during the campaigns, the volumes shot up. So now, very, very confident. If you look at Q3, when we ran sustainable marketing campaigns, volumes shot up by more than 1%, by about 1.3%. And overall, third quarter of 2019, 3.9%. 
So how do we feel about going forward? Especially with Flex removed, especially with our expansion, expansion in areas which are Dubai and Northern Emirates, where we get organic growth? We're confident that this will sustain and continue. So we're getting support from ourselves, we're helping ourselves by ending this program that was facing customer backlash, and we're also helped by the macro."

People will know now, they can expect a full assisted fueling, full premium service for free of charge just like our competitors offer, we will continue to offer. 
And then where we will land a major punch will be when we drop the ADNOC Rewards program. This will drive customer stickiness and customer loyalty. But obviously, we come to market, as we've said in our press release, that will be in the fourth quarter, so upcoming next few weeks. You will get a lot more color on the ADNOC Rewards.
