As announced earlier today, we finished 2018 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 4% over the prior year to $932 million. 
Aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness collectively increased 13% over the prior year. Gross margin improved to 58.9%, driven by both product and segment mix. Operating margin improved to 23.9%, and operating income increased 21% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1 and pro forma EPS of $1.02 in the quarter, an increase of 26%.
Looking briefly at full year performance. 2018 was our third consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. We launched many innovative products, some of which have become halo products in their respective markets. I will highlight accomplishments in each of our business segment in a moment. But looking back at 2018, I'm very pleased with everything we accomplished. 
For the year, revenue increased 7% to over $3.3 billion. Combined revenue from aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness increased 16%. Gross margin improved to 59.1%. Operating margin improved to 23.3%, and operating income increased 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.66 and pro forma EPS of $3.69, an increase of 22% over the prior year.
The growth in EPS and cash generation gives us confidence in proposing an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
We shipped nearly 15 million units during the year, bringing our total to over 205 million since inception, which includes over 1 million certified aviation products. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I would like to highlight some achievements from the past year and outlook in each of our 5 business segments.
Starting with aviation. Revenue increased 20%, driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. ADS-B continues to be a driver of solid performance in the aftermarket, while new platforms and favorable market conditions led the growth in the OEM category. Gross and operating margins were 75% and 34%, respectively. And operating income increased 33% over the prior year. 
During the year, Tactical Air selected us to equip their fleet of F5 fighter aircraft, which is the second program win for our tandem-integrated flight deck. Also, during the year, we were recognized by Airbus helicopters and Embraer as outstanding Supplier of the Year. And most recently, Garmin was ranked #1 in Navionics product support by Professional Pilot Magazine and by Aviation International News for the 15th consecutive year.
The recognition we are receiving is significant because the aviation industry demands strong performance from those that participate in the market. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers. 
Looking ahead, positive market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and ADS-B provide growth opportunities in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue in the aviation segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019.
Looking next at the marine, revenue increased 18%, driven by strength in a broad range of product lines. During the year, we launched Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates realtime video like images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as disruptive new technology and has become a halo product in our marine portfolio. Gross and operating margins improved to 59% and 14%, respectively, and operating income increased 26%. 
We recently introduced new versions of our flagship GPSMap and echoMAP chartplotters, which included a new map, combining the best of Garmin and Navionics content. This marks the achievement of the major objective we established for the Navionics acquisition. 
We continue to gain market share in the OEM category. During the year, we were named as an exclusive supplier to several boat manufacturers. 
We enter 2019 confident in our portfolio of strong product such as Panoptix LiveScope and our flagship GPSMAP and echoMAP series. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year.
Turning next to outdoor. Revenue increased 16% on strong demand for outdoor adventure watches, golf products and inReach subscription services. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36%, respectively, and operating income increased 16% over the prior year. 
During the year, we built on the momentum in the adventure watch category with the introduction of the fenix 5 Plus series with streaming music, built-in maps and mobile payments. We also extended the category with the introduction of Instinct and Descent. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019, driven partly by growth in watches and inReach subscriptions.
Looking next at fitness. Revenue increased 13%, driven by growth in all product categories. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 21%, respectively, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. In 2018, we launched new music-enabled wearables and added 7 music providers into our Connect IQ app store, including Spotify, Deezer and KKBOX. Lastly, we signed an agreement to purchase Tacx, a leading provider of indoor bike trainers, and we expect this acquisition to be completed some time in the second quarter. 
In 2019, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 13%, which includes the acquisition of Tacx as well as organic growth within the segment. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 19% for the full year due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and lower auto OEM sales, driven by program timing. Gross and operating margins were 43% and 6%, respectively. Our global PND market share remains very strong. And at the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced our new drive PNDs with simplified road trip-ready features.  In the OEM category, we were awarded new business that will contribute starting in 2020. 
Looking at 2019, we anticipate revenue will decrease approximately 18%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market as well softness in OEM due to program timing mentioned earlier. 
In summary, we began our 30th year of operations with opportunities in all segments. We anticipate revenue of approximately $3.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Our plan calls for stronger growth in the second half of the year due to the timing of product launches. We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.5% and operating margin of approximately 22.7%. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 16.5%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.70. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on financial results. Doug?"

I begin my review in the fourth quarter and full year financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $932 million for the fourth quarter, representing 4% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.9%, a 280 basis point increase from the prior year. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $223 million, a 21% increase with the prior year. Operating margin was 23.9%, 350 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1. Pro forma EPS was $1.02, a 26% increase from the prior year.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue over $3.3 billion for the year, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.1%, 150 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.9%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $778 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 23.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin.  Our GAAP EPS was $3.66. Pro forma EPS was $3.69, a 22% increase from the prior year.
Next, look at fourth quarter full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments, led by the outdoor segment with 25% growth, followed closely by the aviation segment with growth of 22%. For the full year 2018, we achieved 7% consolidated growth with double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments.
Looking next at fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the aviation, marine, outdoor, fitness segments contributed 84% to total revenue in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 77% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 23% to 27%. Aviation grew from 14% to 17%. You can see from the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. The aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments collectively delivered 97% of operating income in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 88% in the fourth quarter 2017. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 40% to 43%.
Looking next at full year charts. For the full year, the aviation, marine, outdoor, fitness segments made up 81% of total revenue compared to 75% in 2017. A similar shift occurred in operating income with 95% of 2018 operating income collectively coming from the aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments compared to 88% in 2017. All segments besides auto had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $6 million or 2%. Research and development increased $12 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense decreased $4 million in the prior year quarter, representing 5.9% of sales, 60 basis point decrease. Decrease was primarily due to lower media spend in the fitness segment. 
SG&A decreased $3 million compared to prior quarter, plus 13.5% of sales, 90 basis point decrease compared to prior year. Decrease was due to prior year litigation-related costs, partially offset by increased personnel-related expenses.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $570 million due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year due to timing of cash receipts. Inventory balance increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $562 million. During the fourth quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $185 million. For the full year 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $764 million, a $243 million increase to the prior year. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for our increased dividend beginning in June 2019 payment. Proposal to cash dividend of $2.28 per share, $0.57 per share per quarter, 8% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share.
For the full year 2018, we recorded an effective tax rate of 15.7%, 520 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. The year-over-year increase in 2019 pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to lower expected reserve releases compared to 2018. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Chanel, please open the line for Q&A."

I wouldn't expect to see those, all of those working capital improvements year-over-year. So probably for 2019, I'm estimating free cash flow around $675 million. And zoomed in that is about $150 million of CapEx, which is a similar level that we had in '18."

As announced earlier today, we finished 2018 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 4% over the prior year to $932 million. Aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness collectively increased 13% over the prior year. Gross margin improved to 58.9%, driven by both product and segment mix. Operating margin improved to 23.9%, and operating income increased 21% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1; and pro forma EPS of $1.02 in the quarter, an increase of 26%. 
Looking briefly at full year performance. 2018 was our third consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. We launched many innovative products, some of which have become halo products in their respective markets. I will highlight accomplishments in each of our business segment in a moment. But looking back at 2018, I'm very pleased with everything we accomplished. For the year, revenue increased 7% to over $3.3 billion. Combined revenue from aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness increased 16%. Gross margin improved to 59.1%. Operating margin improved to 23.3%, and operating income increased 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.66; and pro forma EPS of $3.69, an increase of 22% over the prior year. The growth in EPS and cash generation gives us confidence in proposing an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
We shipped nearly 15 million units during the year, bringing our total to over 205 million since inception, which includes over 1 million certified aviation products. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I would like to highlight some achievements from the past year and outlook in each of our 5 business segments. 
Starting with aviation. Revenue increased 20%, driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. ADS-B continues to be a driver of solid performance in the aftermarket, while new platforms and favorable market conditions led the growth in the OEM category. Gross and operating margins were 75% and 34%, respectively, and operating income increased 33% over the prior year. During the year, Tactical Air selected us to equip their fleet of F5 fighter aircraft, which is the second program win for our tandem-integrated flight deck. Also, during the year, we were recognized by Airbus helicopters and Embraer as outstanding Supplier of the Year. And most recently, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionics product support by Professional Pilot magazine and by Aviation International News for the 15th consecutive year. The recognition we are receiving is significant because the aviation industry demands strong performance from those that participate in the market. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers. Looking ahead, positive market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and ADS-B provide growth opportunities in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue in the aviation segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 18%, driven by strength in a broad range of product lines. During the year, we launched Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates realtime video-like images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as disruptive new technology and has become a halo product in our marine portfolio. Gross and operating margins improved to 59% and 14%, respectively, and operating income increased 26%. We recently introduced new versions of our flagship GPSMAP and echoMAP chartplotters, which included a new map, combining the best of Garmin and Navionics content. This marks the achievement of a major objective we established for the Navionics acquisition. We continue to gain market share in the OEM category. During the year, we were named as an exclusive supplier to several boat manufacturers. We enter 2019 confident in our portfolio of strong product such as Panoptix LiveScope and our flagship GPSMAP and echoMAP series. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Turning next to outdoor. Revenue increased 16% on strong demand for outdoor adventure watches, golf products and inReach subscription services. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36%, respectively, and operating income increased 16% over the prior year. During the year, we built on the momentum in the adventure watch category with the introduction of the fenix 5 Plus series with streaming music, built-in maps and mobile payments. We also extended the category with the introduction of Instinct and Descent. Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019, driven primarily by growth in watches and inReach subscriptions. 
Looking next to fitness. Revenue increased 13%, driven by growth in all product categories. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 21%, respectively, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. In 2018, we launched new music-enabled wearables and added 7 music providers into our Connect IQ app store, including Spotify, Deezer and KKBOX. Lastly, we signed an agreement to purchase Tacx, a leading provider of indoor bike trainers, and we expect this acquisition to be completed sometime in the second quarter. In 2019, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 13%, which includes the acquisition of Tacx as well as organic growth within the segment. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 19% for the full year due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and lower auto OEM sales, driven by program timing. Gross and operating margins were 43% and 6%, respectively. Our global PND market share remains very strong. And at the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced our new Drive PNDs with simplified road trip-ready features. In the OEM category, we were awarded new business that will contribute starting in 2020. Looking at 2019, we anticipate revenue will decrease approximately 18%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market as well softness in OEM due to program timing mentioned earlier. 
In summary, we began our 30th year of operations with opportunities in all segments. We anticipate revenue of approximately $3.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Our plan calls for stronger growth in the second half of the year due to the timing of product launches. We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.5% and operating margin of approximately 22.7%. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 16.5%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.70. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin my review in our fourth quarter and full year financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $932 million for the fourth quarter, representing 4",753,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review in our fourth quarter and full year financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $932 million for the fourth quarter, representing 4% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.9%, a 280 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $223 million, a 21% increase with the prior year. Operating margin was 23.9%, a 350 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1. Pro forma EPS was $1.02, a 26% increase from the prior year. 
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue over $3.3 billion for the year, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.1%, 150 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.9%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $778 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 23.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin. Our GAAP EPS was $3.66. Pro forma EPS was $3.69, a 22% increase from the prior year. 
Next, look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments led by the outdoor segment with 25% growth, followed closely by the aviation segment with growth of 22%. For the full year 2018, we achieved 7% consolidated growth with double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. 
Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the aviation, marine, outdoor, fitness segments contributed 84% total revenue in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 77% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 23% to 27%. Aviation grew from 14% to 17%. You can see from the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. The aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments collectively delivered 97% operating income in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 88% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 40% to 43%. 
Looking next at full year charts. For the full year, the aviation, marine, outdoor, fitness segments made up 81% of total revenue compared to 75% in 2017. A similar shift occurred in operating income with 95% in 2018 operating income collectively coming from the aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments compared to 88% in 2017. All segments besides auto had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $6 million or 2%. Research and development increased $12 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense decreased $4 million in the prior year quarter, representing 5.9% of sales, 60 basis point decrease. Decrease was primarily due to lower media spend in the fitness segment. SG&A decreased $3 million compared to prior quarter, with 13.5% of sales, 90 basis point decrease compared to prior year. Decrease was due to prior year litigation-related costs, partially offset by increased personnel-related expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $570 million due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year due to timing of cash receipts. Inventory balance increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $562 million. During the fourth quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $185 million. For the full year 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $764 million, a $243 million increase to the prior year. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for our increased dividend beginning for the June 2019 payment. Proposal is a cash dividend of $2.28 per share, $0.57 per share per quarter, 8% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share. 
For the full year 2018, we recorded an effective tax rate of 15.7%, 520 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. The year-over-year increase in 2019 pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to lower expected reserve releases compared to 2018. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Chanel, please open the line for Q&A."

As announced earlier today, we finished 2018 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 4% over the prior year to $932 million. Aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness collectively increased 13% over the prior year. Gross margin improved to 58.9%, driven by both product and segment mix. Operating margin improved to 23.9%, and operating income increased 21% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1; and pro forma EPS of $1.02 in the quarter, an increase of 26%. 
Looking briefly at full year performance. 2018 was our third consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. We launched many innovative products, some of which have become halo products in their respective markets. I will highlight accomplishments in each of our business segment in a moment. But looking back at 2018, I'm very pleased with everything we accomplished. For the year, revenue increased 7% to over $3.3 billion. Combined revenue from aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness increased 16%. Gross margin improved to 59.1%. Operating margin improved to 23.3%, and operating income increased 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.66; and pro forma EPS of $3.69, an increase of 22% over the prior year. The growth in EPS and cash generation gives us confidence in proposing an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
We shipped nearly 15 million units during the year, bringing our total to over 205 million since inception, which includes over 1 million certified aviation products. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I would like to highlight some achievements from the past year and outlook in each of our 5 business segments. 
Starting with aviation. Revenue increased 20%, driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. ADS-B continues to be a driver of solid performance in the aftermarket, while new platforms and favorable market conditions led the growth in the OEM category. Gross and operating margins were 75% and 34%, respectively, and operating income increased 33% over the prior year. During the year, Tactical Air selected us to equip their fleet of F5 fighter aircraft, which is the second program win for our tandem-integrated flight deck. Also, during the year, we were recognized by Airbus helicopters and Embraer as outstanding Supplier of the Year. And most recently, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionics product support by Professional Pilot magazine and by Aviation International News for the 15th consecutive year. The recognition we are receiving is significant because the aviation industry demands strong performance from those that participate in the market. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers. Looking ahead, positive market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and ADS-B provide growth opportunities in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue in the aviation segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 18%, driven by strength in a broad range of product lines. During the year, we launched Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates realtime video-like images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as disruptive new technology and has become a halo product in our marine portfolio. Gross and operating margins improved to 59% and 14%, respectively, and operating income increased 26%. We recently introduced new versions of our flagship GPSMAP and echoMAP chartplotters, which included a new map, combining the best of Garmin and Navionics content. This marks the achievement of a major objective we established for the Navionics acquisition. We continue to gain market share in the OEM category. During the year, we were named as an exclusive supplier to several boat manufacturers. We enter 2019 confident in our portfolio of strong product such as Panoptix LiveScope and our flagship GPSMAP and echoMAP series. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Turning next to outdoor. Revenue increased 16% on strong demand for outdoor adventure watches, golf products and inReach subscription services. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36%, respectively, and operating income increased 16% over the prior year. During the year, we built on the momentum in the adventure watch category with the introduction of the fenix 5 Plus series with streaming music, built-in maps and mobile payments. We also extended the category with the introduction of Instinct and Descent. Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019, driven primarily by growth in watches and inReach subscriptions. 
Looking next to fitness. Revenue increased 13%, driven by growth in all product categories. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 21%, respectively, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. In 2018, we launched new music-enabled wearables and added 7 music providers into our Connect IQ app store, including Spotify, Deezer and KKBOX. Lastly, we signed an agreement to purchase Tacx, a leading provider of indoor bike trainers, and we expect this acquisition to be completed sometime in the second quarter. In 2019, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 13%, which includes the acquisition of Tacx as well as organic growth within the segment. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 19% for the full year due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and lower auto OEM sales, driven by program timing. Gross and operating margins were 43% and 6%, respectively. Our global PND market share remains very strong. And at the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced our new Drive PNDs with simplified road trip-ready features. In the OEM category, we were awarded new business that will contribute starting in 2020. Looking at 2019, we anticipate revenue will decrease approximately 18%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market as well softness in OEM due to program timing mentioned earlier. 
In summary, we began our 30th year of operations with opportunities in all segments. We anticipate revenue of approximately $3.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Our plan calls for stronger growth in the second half of the year due to the timing of product launches. We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.5% and operating margin of approximately 22.7%. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 16.5%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.70. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin my review in our fourth quarter and full year financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $932 million for the fourth quarter, representing 4",753,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review in our fourth quarter and full year financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $932 million for the fourth quarter, representing 4% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.9%, a 280 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $223 million, a 21% increase with the prior year. Operating margin was 23.9%, a 350 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1. Pro forma EPS was $1.02, a 26% increase from the prior year. 
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue over $3.3 billion for the year, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.1%, 150 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.9%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $778 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 23.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin. Our GAAP EPS was $3.66. Pro forma EPS was $3.69, a 22% increase from the prior year. 
Next, look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments led by the outdoor segment with 25% growth, followed closely by the aviation segment with growth of 22%. For the full year 2018, we achieved 7% consolidated growth with double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. 
Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the aviation, marine, outdoor, fitness segments contributed 84% total revenue in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 77% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 23% to 27%. Aviation grew from 14% to 17%. You can see from the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. The aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments collectively delivered 97% operating income in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 88% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 40% to 43%. 
Looking next at full year charts. For the full year, the aviation, marine, outdoor, fitness segments made up 81% of total revenue compared to 75% in 2017. A similar shift occurred in operating income with 95% in 2018 operating income collectively coming from the aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments compared to 88% in 2017. All segments besides auto had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $6 million or 2%. Research and development increased $12 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense decreased $4 million in the prior year quarter, representing 5.9% of sales, 60 basis point decrease. Decrease was primarily due to lower media spend in the fitness segment. SG&A decreased $3 million compared to prior quarter, with 13.5% of sales, 90 basis point decrease compared to prior year. Decrease was due to prior year litigation-related costs, partially offset by increased personnel-related expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $570 million due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year due to timing of cash receipts. Inventory balance increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $562 million. During the fourth quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $185 million. For the full year 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $764 million, a $243 million increase to the prior year. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for our increased dividend beginning for the June 2019 payment. Proposal is a cash dividend of $2.28 per share, $0.57 per share per quarter, 8% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share. 
For the full year 2018, we recorded an effective tax rate of 15.7%, 520 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. The year-over-year increase in 2019 pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to lower expected reserve releases compared to 2018. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Chanel, please open the line for Q&A."

As announced earlier today, we finished 2018 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 4% over the prior year to $932 million. Aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness collectively increased 13% over the prior year. Gross margin improved to 58.9%, driven by both product and segment mix. Operating margin improved to 23.9%, and operating income increased 21% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1; and pro forma EPS of $1.02 in the quarter, an increase of 26%. 
Looking briefly at full year performance. 2018 was our third consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. We launched many innovative products, some of which have become halo products in their respective markets. I will highlight accomplishments in each of our business segment in a moment. But looking back at 2018, I'm very pleased with everything we accomplished. For the year, revenue increased 7% to over $3.3 billion. Combined revenue from aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness increased 16%. Gross margin improved to 59.1%. Operating margin improved to 23.3%, and operating income increased 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.66; and pro forma EPS of $3.69, an increase of 22% over the prior year. The growth in EPS and cash generation gives us confidence in proposing an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
We shipped nearly 15 million units during the year, bringing our total to over 205 million since inception, which includes over 1 million certified aviation products. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I would like to highlight some achievements from the past year and outlook in each of our 5 business segments. 
Starting with aviation. Revenue increased 20%, driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. ADS-B continues to be a driver of solid performance in the aftermarket, while new platforms and favorable market conditions led the growth in the OEM category. Gross and operating margins were 75% and 34%, respectively, and operating income increased 33% over the prior year. During the year, Tactical Air selected us to equip their fleet of F5 fighter aircraft, which is the second program win for our tandem-integrated flight deck. Also, during the year, we were recognized by Airbus helicopters and Embraer as outstanding Supplier of the Year. And most recently, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionics product support by Professional Pilot magazine and by Aviation International News for the 15th consecutive year. The recognition we are receiving is significant because the aviation industry demands strong performance from those that participate in the market. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers. Looking ahead, positive market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and ADS-B provide growth opportunities in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue in the aviation segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 18%, driven by strength in a broad range of product lines. During the year, we launched Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates realtime video-like images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as disruptive new technology and has become a halo product in our marine portfolio. Gross and operating margins improved to 59% and 14%, respectively, and operating income increased 26%. We recently introduced new versions of our flagship GPSMAP and echoMAP chartplotters, which included a new map, combining the best of Garmin and Navionics content. This marks the achievement of a major objective we established for the Navionics acquisition. We continue to gain market share in the OEM category. During the year, we were named as an exclusive supplier to several boat manufacturers. We enter 2019 confident in our portfolio of strong product such as Panoptix LiveScope and our flagship GPSMAP and echoMAP series. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Turning next to outdoor. Revenue increased 16% on strong demand for outdoor adventure watches, golf products and inReach subscription services. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36%, respectively, and operating income increased 16% over the prior year. During the year, we built on the momentum in the adventure watch category with the introduction of the fenix 5 Plus series with streaming music, built-in maps and mobile payments. We also extended the category with the introduction of Instinct and Descent. Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019, driven primarily by growth in watches and inReach subscriptions. 
Looking next to fitness. Revenue increased 13%, driven by growth in all product categories. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 21%, respectively, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. In 2018, we launched new music-enabled wearables and added 7 music providers into our Connect IQ app store, including Spotify, Deezer and KKBOX. Lastly, we signed an agreement to purchase Tacx, a leading provider of indoor bike trainers, and we expect this acquisition to be completed sometime in the second quarter. In 2019, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 13%, which includes the acquisition of Tacx as well as organic growth within the segment. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 19% for the full year due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and lower auto OEM sales, driven by program timing. Gross and operating margins were 43% and 6%, respectively. Our global PND market share remains very strong. And at the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced our new Drive PNDs with simplified road trip-ready features. In the OEM category, we were awarded new business that will contribute starting in 2020. Looking at 2019, we anticipate revenue will decrease approximately 18%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market as well softness in OEM due to program timing mentioned earlier. 
In summary, we began our 30th year of operations with opportunities in all segments. We anticipate revenue of approximately $3.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Our plan calls for stronger growth in the second half of the year due to the timing of product launches. We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.5% and operating margin of approximately 22.7%. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 16.5%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.70. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on financial results. Doug?"

For the full year 2018, we achieved 7% consolidated growth with double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. 
Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the aviation, marine, outdoor, fitness segments contributed 84% total revenue in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 77% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 23% to 27%. Aviation grew from 14% to 17%. You can see from the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. The aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments collectively delivered 97% operating income in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 88% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 40% to 43%. 
Looking next at full year charts. For the full year, the aviation, marine, outdoor, fitness segments made up 81% of total revenue compared to 75% in 2017. A similar shift occurred in operating income with 95% in 2018 operating income collectively coming from the aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments compared to 88% in 2017. All segments besides auto had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $6 million or 2%. Research and development increased $12 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense decreased $4 million in the prior year quarter, representing 5.9% of sales, 60 basis point decrease. Decrease was primarily due to lower media spend in the fitness segment. SG&A decreased $3 million compared to prior quarter, with 13.5% of sales, 90 basis point decrease compared to prior year. Decrease was due to prior year litigation-related costs, partially offset by increased personnel-related expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $570 million due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year due to timing of cash receipts. Inventory balance increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $562 million. During the fourth quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $185 million. For the full year 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $764 million, a $243 million increase to the prior year. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for our increased dividend beginning for the June 2019 payment. Proposal is a cash dividend of $2.28 per share, $0.57 per share per quarter, 8% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share. 
For the full year 2018, we recorded an effective tax rate of 15.7%, 520 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. The year-over-year increase in 2019 pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to lower expected reserve releases compared to 2018. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Chanel, please open the line for Q&A."

Like, can you give yourself room for potential upside if things don't track according to what they're saying publicly?"

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we refined the methodology use to allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses to the segment. The composition of segments did not change. Prior year amounts are presented as they were originally reported as it is not applicable to accurately restate prior period activity and in accordance with the refined allocation methodology. 
For comparative purposes, we had included in the appendix of this website an estimate of the segment operating income impact if the refined allocation methodology would have been used in 2018 for both the 13 weeks ended March 31, 2018, and the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2018. 
There was no change to either the consolidated SG&A expenses nor the consolidated operating income. This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. In these statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross and operating margins and future dividends, market shares, product introduction, future demand for our product and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. 
The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. 
Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

598655,608178368,1715084,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenues for the first quarter of 2019 with growth and operating income and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $766 million, up 8% over the prior year. Rev",893,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenues for the first quarter of 2019 with growth and operating income and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $766 million, up 8% over the prior year. 
Revenue for marine aviation's business and outdoor collectively increased 12% year-over-year. Gross margin was 59% compared to 60% in the prior year. Operating margin was 19.8% and operating income grew 6% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.74. Pro forma EPS was $0.73, up 7% over the prior year. We're encouraged by our first quarter results since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year, and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. 
Before moving onto segment highlights, I want to mention the recognition we received recently from Forbes who ranked Garmin as one of the top 5 Best employers in America. Speaking on behalf of all Garmin employees, we're truly honored to receive this recognition. Garmin employees are passionate about what we do and we share a deep commitment to serving our customers and each other. Of the many qualities that make Garmin a great place to work, it's the commitment of our employees that sets us apart. 
Moving next to our segment highlights. Revenue in the marine segment increased 18% on strong demand for chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScopesonars. Gross margin was 58% and operating margin improved to 19%. During the quarter, we announced the echoMAP ultra series combining built-in Panoptix LiveScope compatibility with new mapping content. Also, in our first year, as their exclusive electronic supplier, we were named the 2018 Supplier of the Year by independent both builders incorporated. The boating industry's largest purchasing cooperative. It's an honor to be recognized by the IBBI. And I want to thank our marine team to delivering superior products, service and support to our customers. 
Looking next at aviation. Revenue increased 17% driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Growth and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 34%, respectively. During the quarter, we delivered the new G1000 NXi upgrade for the Citation Mustang, which is the first business jet to adopt our G1000 system. We announced compelling products such as the GPS175, GNX375 and the G3X Touch, which expand the addressable market for our retrofit systems. Our aviation team was also recognized as an outstanding supplier to the industry. After recent Embraer conference, we were named Supplier of the Year for electrical systems. This is the tenth supplier what we received from Embraer. And again, reflects the strength of our products, service and support. I want to thank our aviation team for their deep commitment to being the very best. 
Looking next at fitness. Revenue increased 9%, driven primarily by strong growth in our wearable categories. Gross margin was 50% and operating margin was 10% in the quarter. Margins decreased due to a combination of factors, including lower selling prices and a shift in mix as certain products in our consumer wellness categories experienced significant year-over-year growth. 
In early April, we completed the acquisition of Tacx, expanding our reach into the indoor cycling and training market. Yesterday, we announced the fully-refreshed line of running watches with the 445 in 2 sizes, the [ 4 on a 245 ] with optional music source, and the [indiscernible] 945, which has it all. Using these smart marches offer features that will appeal to a broad range of running enthusiasts. Also, we announced the availability of our menstrual cycle tracking feature. This new feature was developed by Garmin women focusing on the special use of those who are highly active. This feature will help women make connection between the current cycle phase, physical and emotional symptoms and their overall well-being. We also announced that we're cooperating with the University of Kansas on research to better understand how variables and the biometric data date produce can help women manage and improve their health. 
Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 7% on strength across multiple categories. The outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 63% and 27%, respectively. During the quarter, we introduced Smart, as a collection of 5 premium smart tool watches. These watches were created from our active lifestyle DNA to inspire adventurers in flying, racing, sailing, exploring and sports performance. 
Also, we recently announced the approach S40, a stylish sports watch, featuring a color touch display and smartwatch capabilities. 
Looking, finally, at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 10% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in certain specialty product lines. Our global PND market share remains very strong. Gross margin was 45% and operating margin improved to 6%. 
During the quarter, we launched the [indiscernible], a new wireless backup camera that's easy to install and provide drivers with a wide clearview behind your vehicle. Also, during the quarter, we announced that BMW selected us as their lead design and production partner of entertainment modules for the BMW group, validating us as a Tier 1 supplier to the world's most respected brands. 
I congratulate our automotive team and thank them for their hard work and dedication in securing this event. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

[indiscernible] revenues of $766 million in the first quarter, representing 8% in",462,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
[indiscernible] revenues of $766 million in the first quarter, representing 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59%, 100 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 39.2%, 80 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $151 million, a 6% increase year-over-year. 
Operating margin was 19.8%, relatively consistent to the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.74. Pro forma EPS was $0.73. 
Next, we'll look at the first quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record first quarter revenue of $766 million, consolidated revenue grew 8% led by double-digit growth in both marine and aviation. Also, both the fitness and outdoor segments achieved solid growth during the quarter. Combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 12% compared to the prior quarter. 
Looking next, the first quarter revenue and operating in charts. Collectively, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments contributed [ 83% ] of total revenue for the first quarter 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Marine grew from 16% to 17%, aviation grew from 21% to 22% and fitness grew from 23% to 24%. 
You can see from charts illustrate our profit mix by segment, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments collectively delivered 95% of operating income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 98% in the first quarter of 2018. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our first quarter operating expense increased by [ $16 million ] or 6%. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased approximately $3 million year-over-year, representing 3.6% of sales, consistent with the prior year quarter. SG&A was up $10 million or 16.5% percentage of sales consistent with prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to legal related costs and personnel related expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $453 million following a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased on a sequential [indiscernible] basis prepared for the seasonally strong second quarter upcoming product launches. 
During the first quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $134 million, $53 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also, during the quarter, we pay dividends of $201 million, which includes both the December 2018 and March 2019 payments. 
During the first quarter of 2019, we reported an effective tax rate of 15.7% compared to 16% in the prior quarter.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we refined the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses to the segments. The composition of segments did not change. Prior year amounts are presented as they were originally reported as it is not practical to accurately restate prior period activity in accordance with the refined allocation methodology.
For comparative purposes, we had included in the appendix of this webcast an estimate of the segment operating income impact if the refined allocation methodology would have been used in 2018 for both the 13 weeks ended March 31, 2018, and the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2018. There was no change to either the consolidated SG&A expenses nor the consolidated operating income.
This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. In these statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross and operating margins and future dividends, market shares, product introduction, future demand for our products and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin.
Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Consolidated revenue came in at $766 million, up 8% over the prior year. Revenue for marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 12% year-over-year.
Gross margin was 59% compared to 60% in the prior year. Operating margin was 19.8% and operating income grew 6% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.74. Pro forma EPS was $0.73, up 7% over the prior year.
We are encouraged by our first quarter results. Since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February.
Before moving onto segment highlights, I want to mention the recognition we received recently from Forbes, who ranked Garmin as one of the top 5 best employers in America. Speaking on behalf of all Garmin employees, we are truly honored to receive this recognition. Garmin employees are passionate about what we do and we share a deep commitment to serving our customers and each other. Of the many qualities that make Garmin a great place to work, it's the commitment of our employees that sets us apart.
Moving next to our segment highlights. Revenue in the marine segment increased 18% on strong demand for chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars. Gross margin was 58% and operating margin improved to 19%. During the quarter, we announced the ECHOMAP ultra series, combining built-in Panoptix LiveScope compatibility with new mapping content. Also in our first year as their exclusive electronic supplier, we were named the 2018 supplier of the year by Independent Boat Builders Incorporated, the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperative. It's an honor to be recognized by the IBBI. And I want to thank our marine team for delivering superior products, service and support to our customers.
Looking next at aviation. Revenue increased 17%, driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 34%, respectively. During the quarter, we delivered the new G1000 NXi upgrade for the Citation Mustang, which is the first business jet to adopt our G1000 system.
We announced compelling new products such as the GPS 175, GNX 375 and the G3X Touch, which expand the addressable market for our retrofit systems.
Our aviation team was also recognized as an outstanding supplier to the industry. At the recent Embraer Suppliers Conference, we were named Supplier of the Year for electrical systems. This is the 10th supplier award we received from Embraer, and again, reflects the strength of our products, service and support. I want to thank our aviation team for their deep commitment to being the very best.
Looking next at fitness. Revenue increased 9%, driven primarily by strong growth in our wearable categories. Gross margin was 50% and operating margin was 10% in the quarter. Margins decreased due to a combination of factors, including lower selling prices and a shift in mix as certain products in our consumer wellness categories experienced significant year-over-year growth.
In early April, we completed the acquisition of Tacx, expanding our reach into the indoor cycling and training market. Yesterday, we announced the fully refreshed line of running watches with the Forerunner 45 in 2 sizes, the Forerunner 245 with optional music storage and the Forerunner 945, which has it all. These new smart watches offer features that will appeal to a broad range of running enthusiasts.
Also, we announced the availability of our menstrual cycle tracking feature. This new feature was developed by Garmin women focusing on the special needs of those who are highly active. This feature will help women make connection between their current cycle phase, physical and emotional symptoms and their overall well-being. We also announced that we are cooperating with the University of Kansas on research to better understand how wearables and the biometric data they produce can help women manage and improve their health.
Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 7% on strength across multiple product categories. The outdoor segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 63% and 27%, respectively. During the quarter, we introduced MARQ, a collection of 5 premium smart tool watches. These watches were created from our active lifestyle DNA to inspire adventurers in flying, racing, sailing, exploring and sports performance.
Also, we recently announced the Approach S40, a stylish golf watch, featuring a color touchscreen display and smart watch capabilities.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 10% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in certain specialty product lines. Our global PND market share remains very strong. Gross margin was 45% and operating margin improved to 6%.
During the quarter, we launched the BC 40, a new wireless backup camera that's easy to install and provides drivers with a wide clear view behind their vehicle.
Also during the quarter, we announced that BMW selected us as their lead design and production partner of entertainment modules for the BMW group, validating us as a Tier 1 supplier to the world's most respected brands. I congratulate our automotive team and thank them for their hard work and dedication in securing this win.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.
We posted revenue of $766 million in the first quarter, representing 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59%, 100 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 39.2%, 80 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $151 million, a 6% increase year-over-year.
Operating margin was 19.8%, relatively consistent to the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.74 and pro forma EPS was $0.73.
Next, we'll look at the first quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record first quarter revenue of $766 million. Consolidated revenue grew 8%, led by double-digit growth in both marine and aviation. Also, both the fitness and outdoor segments achieved solid growth during the quarter. On a combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 12% compared to the prior year quarter.
Looking next, the first quarter revenue and operating income charts. Collectively, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 83% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Marine grew from 16% to 17%, aviation grew from 21% to 22% and fitness grew from 23% to 24%.
You can see from the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments collectively delivered 95% of operating income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 98% in the first quarter of 2018.
Looking next at operating expenses. Our first quarter operating expense increased by $16 million or 6%. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased approximately $3 million year-over-year, representing 3.6% of sales, consistent with the prior year quarter.
SG&A was up $10 million or 16.5% of sales, consistent with the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to legal-related costs and personnel-related expenses.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $453 million following a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased on a sequential and year-over-year basis as we prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter upcoming product launches.
During the first quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $134 million, $53 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $201 million, which includes both the December 2018 and March 2019 payments.
During the first quarter of 2019, we reported an effective tax rate of 15.7% compared to 16% in the prior year quarter.

But again, the environment's unpredictable, so we don't really know in the future what additional things we might face, but we view at as somewhat of a onetime thing.
And in terms of margin trajectory, depending on how the mix goes, we would probably still anticipate some downward pressure on overall fitness margins, probably in the low- to mid-50s range, but that will depend on, again, the overall product mix and the sales trajectory of some of those product lines."

In terms of our outlook for both marine and aviation, as we mentioned we're not ready to think about guidance yet because it's still early in the year, but we're encouraged by the results we've seen in both of those segments. I would say as I mentioned earlier in aviation that towards the back half of the year, we would naturally expect that the growth rates of ADS-B might come down a bit as the rush of people that are trying to get into the installed tapers off a bit.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we refined the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses to the segments. The composition of segments did not change. Prior year amounts are presented as they were originally reported as it is not practical to accurately restate prior period activity in accordance with the refined allocation methodology.
For comparative purposes, we had included in the appendix of this webcast an estimate of the segment operating income impact if the refined allocation methodology would have been used in 2018 for both the 13 weeks ended March 31, 2018, and the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2018. There was no change to either the consolidated SG&A expenses nor the consolidated operating income.
This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. In these statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross and operating margins and future dividends, market shares, product introduction, future demand for our products and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin.
Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble."

Revenu",903,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue for the first quarter of 2019 with growth in operating income and EPS.
Consolidated revenue came in at $766 million, up 8% over the prior year. Revenue for marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 12% year-over-year.
Gross margin was 59% compared to 60% in the prior year. Operating margin was 19.8% and operating income grew 6% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.74. Pro forma EPS was $0.73, up 7% over the prior year.
We are encouraged by our first quarter results. Since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February.
Before moving onto segment highlights, I want to mention the recognition we received recently from Forbes, who ranked Garmin as one of the top 5 best employers in America. Speaking on behalf of all Garmin employees, we are truly honored to receive this recognition. Garmin employees are passionate about what we do and we share a deep commitment to serving our customers and each other. Of the many qualities that make Garmin a great place to work, it's the commitment of our employees that sets us apart.
Moving next to our segment highlights. Revenue in the marine segment increased 18% on strong demand for chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars. Gross margin was 58% and operating margin improved to 19%. During the quarter, we announced the ECHOMAP ultra series, combining built-in Panoptix LiveScope compatibility with new mapping content. Also in our first year as their exclusive electronic supplier, we were named the 2018 supplier of the year by Independent Boat Builders Incorporated, the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperative. It's an honor to be recognized by the IBBI. And I want to thank our marine team for delivering superior products, service and support to our customers.
Looking next at aviation. Revenue increased 17%, driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 34%, respectively. During the quarter, we delivered the new G1000 NXi upgrade for the Citation Mustang, which is the first business jet to adopt our G1000 system.
We announced compelling new products such as the GPS 175, GNX 375 and the G3X Touch, which expand the addressable market for our retrofit systems.
Our aviation team was also recognized as an outstanding supplier to the industry. At the recent Embraer Suppliers Conference, we were named Supplier of the Year for electrical systems. This is the 10th supplier award we received from Embraer, and again, reflects the strength of our products, service and support. I want to thank our aviation team for their deep commitment to being the very best.
Looking next at fitness. Revenue increased 9%, driven primarily by strong growth in our wearable categories. Gross margin was 50% and operating margin was 10% in the quarter. Margins decreased due to a combination of factors, including lower selling prices and a shift in mix as certain products in our consumer wellness categories experienced significant year-over-year growth.
In early April, we completed the acquisition of Tacx, expanding our reach into the indoor cycling and training market. Yesterday, we announced a fully refreshed line of running watches with the Forerunner 45 in 2 sizes, the Forerunner 245 with optional music storage and the Forerunner 945, which has it all. These new smart watches offer features that will appeal to a broad range of running enthusiasts.
Also, we announced the availability of our menstrual cycle tracking feature. This new feature was developed by Garmin women focusing on the special needs of those who are highly active. This feature will help women make connection between their current cycle phase, physical and emotional symptoms and their overall well-being. We also announced that we are cooperating with the University of Kansas on research to better understand how wearables and the biometric data they produce can help women manage and improve their health.
Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 7% on strength across multiple product categories. The outdoor segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 63% and 27%, respectively. During the quarter, we introduced MARQ, a collection of 5 premium smart tool watches. These watches were created from our active lifestyle DNA to inspire adventurers in flying, racing, sailing, exploring and sports performance.
Also, we recently announced the Approach S40, a stylish golf watch, featuring a color touchscreen display and smart watch capabilities.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 10% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in certain specialty product lines. Our global PND market share remains very strong. Gross margin was 45% and operating margin improved to 6%.
During the quarter, we launched the BC 40, a new wireless backup camera that's easy to install and provides drivers with a wide clear view behind their vehicle.
Also during the quarter, we announced that BMW selected us as their lead design and production partner of entertainment modules for the BMW group, validating us as a Tier 1 supplier to the world's most respected brands. I congratulate our automotive team and thank them for their hard work and dedication in securing this win.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

Good morning, everyone. I begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.
We posted revenue of $766 million in the first quarter, representing 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59%, 100 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 39.2%, 80 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $151 million, a 6% increase year-over-year.
Operating margin was 19.8%, relatively consistent to the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.74, our pro forma EPS was $0.73.
Next, we'll look at the first quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record first quarter revenue of $766 million. Consolidated revenue grew 8%, led by double-digit growth in both marine and aviation. Also, both the fitness and outdoor segments achieved solid growth during the quarter. On a combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 12% compared to the prior year quarter.
Looking next, the first quarter revenue and operating income charts. Collectively, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 83% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Marine grew from 16% to 17%, aviation grew from 21% to 22% and fitness grew from 23% to 24%.
You can see from the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments collectively delivered 95% of operating income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 98% in the first quarter of 2018.
Looking next at operating expenses. Our first quarter operating expense increased by $16 million or 6%. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased approximately $3 million year-over-year and represented 3.6% of sales, consistent with the prior year quarter.
SG&A was up $10 million or 16.5% of sales, consistent with prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to legal-related costs and personnel-related expenses.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $453 million following a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased on a sequential and year-over-year basis as we prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter upcoming product launches.
During the first quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $134 million, $53 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $201 million, which includes both the December 2018 and March 2019 payments.
During the first quarter of 2019, we reported an effective tax rate of 15.7% compared to 16% in the prior year quarter.
This concludes our formal remarks. Shannon, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we refined the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses to the segments. The composition of segments did not change. Prior year amounts are presented as they were originally reported as it is not practical to accurately restate prior period activity in accordance with the refined allocation methodology.
For comparative purposes, we had included in the appendix of this webcast an estimate of the segment operating income impact if the refined allocation methodology would have been used in 2018 for both the 13 weeks ended March 31, 2018, and the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2018. There was no change to either the consolidated SG&A expenses nor the consolidated operating income.
This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. In these statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross and operating margins and future dividends, market shares, product introduction, future demand for our products and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin.
Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble."

Revenu",903,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue for the first quarter of 2019 with growth in operating income and EPS.
Consolidated revenue came in at $766 million, up 8% over the prior year. Revenue for marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 12% year-over-year.
Gross margin was 59% compared to 60% in the prior year. Operating margin was 19.8% and operating income grew 6% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.74. Pro forma EPS was $0.73, up 7% over the prior year.
We are encouraged by our first quarter results. Since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February.
Before moving onto segment highlights, I want to mention the recognition we received recently from Forbes, who ranked Garmin as one of the top 5 best employers in America. Speaking on behalf of all Garmin employees, we are truly honored to receive this recognition. Garmin employees are passionate about what we do and we share a deep commitment to serving our customers and each other. Of the many qualities that make Garmin a great place to work, it's the commitment of our employees that sets us apart.
Moving next to our segment highlights. Revenue in the marine segment increased 18% on strong demand for chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars. Gross margin was 58% and operating margin improved to 19%. During the quarter, we announced the ECHOMAP ultra series, combining built-in Panoptix LiveScope compatibility with new mapping content. Also in our first year as their exclusive electronic supplier, we were named the 2018 supplier of the year by Independent Boat Builders Incorporated, the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperative. It's an honor to be recognized by the IBBI. And I want to thank our marine team for delivering superior products, service and support to our customers.
Looking next at aviation. Revenue increased 17%, driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 34%, respectively. During the quarter, we delivered the new G1000 NXi upgrade for the Citation Mustang, which is the first business jet to adopt our G1000 system.
We announced compelling new products such as the GPS 175, GNX 375 and the G3X Touch, which expand the addressable market for our retrofit systems.
Our aviation team was also recognized as an outstanding supplier to the industry. At the recent Embraer Suppliers Conference, we were named Supplier of the Year for electrical systems. This is the 10th supplier award we received from Embraer, and again, reflects the strength of our products, service and support. I want to thank our aviation team for their deep commitment to being the very best.
Looking next at fitness. Revenue increased 9%, driven primarily by strong growth in our wearable categories. Gross margin was 50% and operating margin was 10% in the quarter. Margins decreased due to a combination of factors, including lower selling prices and a shift in mix as certain products in our consumer wellness categories experienced significant year-over-year growth.
In early April, we completed the acquisition of Tacx, expanding our reach into the indoor cycling and training market. Yesterday, we announced a fully refreshed line of running watches with the Forerunner 45 in 2 sizes, the Forerunner 245 with optional music storage and the Forerunner 945, which has it all. These new smart watches offer features that will appeal to a broad range of running enthusiasts.
Also, we announced the availability of our menstrual cycle tracking feature. This new feature was developed by Garmin women focusing on the special needs of those who are highly active. This feature will help women make connection between their current cycle phase, physical and emotional symptoms and their overall well-being. We also announced that we are cooperating with the University of Kansas on research to better understand how wearables and the biometric data they produce can help women manage and improve their health.
Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 7% on strength across multiple product categories. The outdoor segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 63% and 27%, respectively. During the quarter, we introduced MARQ, a collection of 5 premium smart tool watches. These watches were created from our active lifestyle DNA to inspire adventurers in flying, racing, sailing, exploring and sports performance.
Also, we recently announced the Approach S40, a stylish golf watch, featuring a color touchscreen display and smart watch capabilities.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 10% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in certain specialty product lines. Our global PND market share remains very strong. Gross margin was 45% and operating margin improved to 6%.
During the quarter, we launched the BC 40, a new wireless backup camera that's easy to install and provides drivers with a wide clear view behind their vehicle.
Also during the quarter, we announced that BMW selected us as their lead design and production partner of entertainment modules for the BMW group, validating us as a Tier 1 supplier to the world's most respected brands. I congratulate our automotive team and thank them for their hard work and dedication in securing this win.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

Good morning, everyone. I begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.
We posted revenue of $766 million in the first quarter, representing 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59%, 100 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 39.2%, 80 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $151 million, a 6% increase year-over-year.
Operating margin was 19.8%, relatively consistent to the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.74, our pro forma EPS was $0.73.
Next, we'll look at the first quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record first quarter revenue of $766 million. Consolidated revenue grew 8%, led by double-digit growth in both marine and aviation. Also, both the fitness and outdoor segments achieved solid growth during the quarter. On a combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 12% compared to the prior year quarter.
Looking next, the first quarter revenue and operating income charts. Collectively, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 83% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Marine grew from 16% to 17%, aviation grew from 21% to 22% and fitness grew from 23% to 24%.
You can see from the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments collectively delivered 95% of operating income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 98% in the first quarter of 2018.
Looking next at operating expenses. Our first quarter operating expense increased by $16 million or 6%. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased approximately $3 million year-over-year and represented 3.6% of sales, consistent with the prior year quarter.
SG&A was up $10 million or 16.5% of sales, consistent with prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to legal-related costs and personnel-related expenses.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $453 million following a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased on a sequential and year-over-year basis as we prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter upcoming product launches.
During the first quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $134 million, $53 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $201 million, which includes both the December 2018 and March 2019 payments.
During the first quarter of 2019, we reported an effective tax rate of 15.7% compared to 16% in the prior year quarter.
This concludes our formal remarks. Shannon, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

I would say as I mentioned earlier in aviation that towards the back half of the year, we would naturally expect that the growth rates of ADS-B might come down a bit as the rush of people that are trying to get into the installed tapers off a bit.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong results, including record revenue and operating income for the second quarter. 
Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at $955 million, up 7% over the prior year. Aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 12% year-over-year. 
Gross margin improved to 60.3%. Operating margin expanded to 26.8%. Operating income increased 18% to $256 million. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.17 and pro forma EPS of $1.16 in the quarter, up 17% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our performance for the first half of 2019, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the aviation segment. Revenue increased 20% driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. We experienced strong growth in our ADS-B product offerings. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 36%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 27% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we achieved certification of the G5000 integrated flight deck for the Citation Excel and XLS, bringing a state-of-the-art cockpit system to this popular family of aircraft. We also announced the availability of the NXi upgrade for Cessna and Beechcraft models equipped with the original G1000 system. We continue to see strong customer demand and appreciation for this upgrade program.
As I mentioned earlier, ADS-B has been a significant driver of growth in our aviation business. According to the FAA, as of July 1, 2019, approximately 91,000 total aircraft have been equipped, of which approximately 7,000 are commercial aircraft. Of the remaining 84,000, Garmin has captured roughly 80% market share. Based on everything we see, it is likely that the ADS-B opportunities will continue into 2020. 
While ADS-B has been a significant opportunity, it's not the only opportunity for the aviation segment. New OEM platforms, retrofit cockpit systems, NXi upgrades and the growing demand for trainer aircraft represent opportunities for growth beyond the ADS-B cycle. We're optimistic about the future of our aviation business.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 13% as we experienced strong demand for our chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars. Gross and operating margins were 61% and 28%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth. 
Last quarter, we mentioned that the Independent Boat Builders, Incorporated named Garmin its Supplier of the Year. I'm pleased to report that our relationship with IBBI has expanded and now includes audio equipment. Our Fusion brand of marine electronic systems was selected by IBBI as the preferred choice for its members. 
New markets and new product categories are an area of strategic growth because they represent significant growth opportunities. In keeping with this strategy, at the recent ICAST fishing show, we introduced Force, our first entry into the freshwater trolling motor market. Force was named best new boating accessory and won the coveted Best of Show award for 2019, making Garmin a back-to-back Best of Show winner at ICAST. We're very proud of the accomplishments of our marine team, and we're excited about the new opportunity that Force represents in this segment. 
Looking next at the fitness segment. Revenue increased 12% driven by growth in running products as well as contributions from our recent acquisition of Tacx. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively. During the quarter, we began shipping our refreshed line of Forerunners, providing both smartwatch features and enhanced running dynamics for all capabilities of runners. We also completed the acquisition of Tacx and are now in the process of expanding the distribution of Tacx products through Garmin retailers. 
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 4% on a year-over-year basis driven by growth in our golf and inReach products. We believe this is a remarkable accomplishment considering the significant impact of the fenix 5 Plus launch during the first half of 2018. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 34%, respectively. During the quarter, we began shipping the MARQ luxury watch. In addition, we experienced strong demand for golf wearables and the Instinct adventure watch. We also introduced a refreshed line of handheld navigators, adding inReach satellite communication technology to our flagship handheld devices.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 13% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 48% and 16%, respectively. 
Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. We launched the DriveSmart 65 with the integrated Alexa personal assistant, bringing enhanced voice-controlled functionality to drivers. We also announced the Garmin Overlander, an all-terrain GPS navigator specifically designed to fit the needs of the growing over lending community. This is a unique product offering for those looking to explore off the grid. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results in the first half of 2019. Given this strong performance, we are raising our projected revenue to approximately $3.6 billion for the year, representing an 8% increase over the prior year. Gross margin is projected to be 59.5% for the year. Operating margin is projected to be 23.2%. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 16.5%, our pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.90. 
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment, we have increased our growth expectations for the aviation segment to 17%, the marine segment to 12% and the auto segment to down 15%. Fitness and outdoor are unchanged. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $955 million for the second quarter, representing 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.3%, 180 basis point increase from the prior year. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 33.4%, 80 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $256 million, 18% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 26.8%, 250 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.17. Our GAAP (sic) [ pro forma ] EPS was $1.16, a 17% increase from prior year. 
Next, we'll look at our second quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record second quarter revenue of $955 million. Consolidated revenue grew 7%, led by double-digit growth in our aviation, marine and fitness segments. Also the outdoor segment had solid growth during the quarter. Combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor were up 12% quarter-by-quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 83% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Aviation grew from 17% to 19%. Marine grew from 15% to 16%, and fitness grew from 25% to 26%. You can see it on the charts that illustrate our profit mix by segment. On a combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 90% of operating income in the second quarter 2019 compared to 94% in the second quarter of 2018. The aviation, marine and auto segments had strong year-over-year increases and operating income dollars improved operating margins. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $13 million or 4%. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 33.4% in the second quarter of 2019, 80 basis point decrease from the comparable quarter last year. 
Research and development increased $7 million year-over-year and investments entering resources. Advertising expense was down $2 million from the prior year due to lower expenses in the auto segment. 
SG&A was up $8 million compared to prior year quarter, relatively flat as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $584 million due to strong second quarter sales. The inventory balance increased sequentially year-over-year to $648 million due to timing of new products, raw material requirements, acquisition of Tacx. For the second quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $80 million, a $77 million decrease from prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $108 million. 
In the second quarter 2019, reported effective tax rate of 18.9% compared to effective tax rate of 19.4% in the prior year quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. 
This concludes our remarks. TJ, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

In terms of gross margin, again, early days. But there's probably opportunity to improve over time, but that would take some amount of time to be able to realize those savings as we go along."

It's due to a number of factors, one of which is just timing of product launches, the anticipation of product launches in the back half, also some raw material requirements and just making sure we have appropriate levels of safety stock. And also we acquired Tacx, so that basically was incremental increase year-over-year. Also looking at the prior number, probably a little bit lighter last year on inventory than we'd like have been. Kind of looking at inventory on the go forward for the rest of the year, I probably would expect the year-end inventory balance to be pretty similar to what I saw in Q2. It'll probably go up some in Q3, probably similar type of year-over-year change I saw in Q2, but it'll come down some, and yes, we just want to make sure we have appropriate levels of inventory to meet our continuing demands."

In terms of pull-forward impact on ADS-B, for sure, those people that have equipped with ADS-B and have taken the time to fully upgrade their panels with new technology, they obviously are not going to be upgrading in 2020 again per se. But there's many, many more aircraft out there that are needing new technology. Some of them are flying with equipment that's decades-old, and we believe this is an opportunity for people to reassess the electronics in their aircraft and upgrade to a new technology that's available now."

So that's all good news. 
In terms of BMW, the first set of our program is scheduled to be a 2020 program, and that's progressing as we have said before. There'll be minimal impact in 2019. That's been built into our guidance obviously. And the newer sets of business that we won with BMW is an ongoing effort. It will take some number of years now to develop that we're in the process of investing in the capital infrastructure that we need to be able to support that program, including upgrading some of our existing factories and establishing a new facility in Europe."

598655,626254447,1785288,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2019",2019-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong results including record revenue and operating income for the second quarter. Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at $955 million, up 7% over the pr",950,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong results including record revenue and operating income for the second quarter. 
Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at $955 million, up 7% over the prior year. Aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 12% year-over-year. 
Gross margin improved to 60.3%. Operating margin expanded to 26.8%. Operating income increased 18% to $256 million. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.17 and pro forma EPS of $1.16 in the quarter, up 17% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our performance for the first half of 2019, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the aviation segment. Revenue increased 20% driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. We experienced strong growth in our ADS-B product offerings. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 36%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 27% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we achieved certification of the G5000 integrated flight deck for the Citation Excel and XLS, bringing a state-of-the-art cockpit system to this popular family of aircraft. We also announced the availability of the NXi upgrade for Cessna and Beechcraft models equipped with the original G1000 system. We continue to see strong customer demand and appreciation for this upgrade program.
As I mentioned earlier, ADS-B has been a significant driver of growth in our aviation business. According to the FAA, as of July 1, 2019, approximately 91,000 total aircraft have been equipped, of which approximately 7,000 are commercial aircraft. Of the remaining 84,000, Garmin has captured roughly 80% market share. Based on everything we see, it is likely that the ADS-B opportunities will continue into 2020. 
While ADS-B has been a significant opportunity, it's not the only opportunity for the aviation segment. New OEM platforms, retrofit cockpit systems, NXi upgrades and the growing demand for trainer aircraft represent opportunities for growth beyond the ADS-B cycle. We are optimistic about the future of our aviation business.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 13% as we experienced strong demand for our chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars. Gross and operating margins were 61% and 28%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth. 
Last quarter, we mentioned that the Independent Boat Builders, Inc. named Garmin its supplier of the year. I'm pleased to report that our relationship with IBBI has expanded and now includes audio equipment. Our Fusion brand of marine electronic systems was selected by IBBI as the preferred choice for its members. 
New markets and new product category is an area of strategic growth because they represent significant growth opportunities. In keeping with this strategy, at the recent ICAST fishing show, we introduced Force, our first entry into the freshwater trolling motor market. Force was named best new boating accessory and won the coveted Best of Show award for 2019, making Garmin a back-to-back Best of Show winner at ICAST. We are very proud of the accomplishments of our marine team, and we're excited about the new opportunity that Force represents in this segment. 
Looking next at the fitness segment. Revenue increased 12% driven by growth in running products as well as contributions from our recent acquisition of Tacx. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively. During the quarter, we began shipping our refreshed line of Forerunners, providing both smart watch features and enhanced running dynamics for all capabilities of runners. We also completed the acquisition of Tacx and are now in the process of expanding the distribution of Tacx products through Garmin retailers. 
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 4% on a year-over-year basis driven by growth in our golf and inReach products. We believe this is a remarkable accomplishment considering the significant impact of the fenix 5 Plus launch during the first half of 2018. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 34%, respectively. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the MARQ luxury watch. In addition, we experienced strong demand for golf wearables and the Instinct adventure watch. We also introduced a refreshed line of handheld navigators adding inReach satellite communication technology to our flagship handheld devices.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 13% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 48% and 16%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. We launched the DriveSmart 65 with integrated Alexa personal assistant, bringing enhanced voice-controlled functionality to drivers. We also announced the Garmin Overlander, an all-terrain GPS navigator specifically designed to fit the needs of the growing over lending community. This is a unique product offering for those looking to explore off the grid. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results in the first half of 2019. Given this strong performance, we are raising our projected revenue to approximately $3.6 billion for the year, representing an 8% increase over the prior year. Gross margin is projected to be 59.5% for the year. Operating margin is projected to be 23.2%. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 16.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.90. 
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment, we have increased our growth expectations for the aviation segment to 17%, the marine segment to 12% and the auto segment to down 15%. Fitness and outdoor are unchanged. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

We posted revenue of $955 million for the second quarter representing 7% increase year-ov",534,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $955 million for the second quarter representing 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.3%, 180 basis point increase from the prior year. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 33.4%, 80 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $256 million, 18% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 26.8%, 250 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.17. Our GAAP (sic) [ pro forma ] EPS was $1.16, a 17% increase from the prior year. 
Next, we'll look at our second quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record second quarter revenue of $955 million. Consolidated revenue grew 7% led by double-digit growth in our aviation, marine and fitness segments. Also the outdoor segment had solid growth during the quarter. Combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor were up 12% compared in the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 83% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Aviation grew from 17% to 19%. Marine grew from 15% to 16%. And fitness grew from 25% to 26%. You can see it on the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. On a combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 90% of operating income in the second quarter 2019 compared to 94% in the second quarter of 2018. The aviation, marine and auto segments had strong year-over-year increases and operating income dollars improved operating margins. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $13 million or 4%. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 33.4% in the second quarter 2019, 80 basis point decrease from the comparable quarter last year. 
Research and development increased $7 million year-over-year in investments entering resources. Advertising expense was down $2 million from the prior year due to lower expenses in our auto segment. 
SG&A was up $8 million compared to prior year quarter, relatively flat as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $584 million due to strong quarter -- second quarter sales. The inventory balance increased sequentially year-over-year to $648 million due to timing of new products, raw material requirements, acquisition of Tacx. 
For the second quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $80 million, a $77 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $108 million. 
In the second quarter 2019, reported effective tax rate of 18.9% compared to effective tax rate of 19.4% in the prior year quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.

Also looking at the prior number, probably a little bit lighter last year on inventory than we'd like to be in. Kind of looking at inventory on the go forward for the rest of the year, I probably would expect the year-end inventory balance to be pretty similar to what I saw in Q2.

In terms of pull-forward impact on ADS-B, for sure, those people that are equipped with ADS-B and have taken the time to fully upgrade their panels with new technology, they obviously are not going to be upgrading in 2020 again per se. But there's many, many more aircraft out there that are needing new technology. Some of them are flying with equipment that's decades old, and we believe this is an opportunity for people to reassess the electronics in their aircraft and upgrade to a new technology that's available now."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong results including record revenue and operating income for the second quarter. 
Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at $955 million, up 7% over the prior year. Aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 12% year-over-year. 
Gross margin improved to 60.3%. Operating margin expanded to 26.8%. Operating income increased 18% to $256 million. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.17 and pro forma EPS of $1.16 in the quarter, up 17% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our performance for the first half of 2019, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the aviation segment. Revenue increased 20% driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. We experienced strong growth in our ADS-B product offerings. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 36%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 27% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we achieved certification of the G5000 integrated flight deck for the Citation Excel and XLS, bringing a state-of-the-art cockpit system to this popular family of aircraft. We also announced the availability of the NXi upgrade for Cessna and Beechcraft models equipped with the original G1000 system. We continue to see strong customer demand and appreciation for this upgrade program.
As I mentioned earlier, ADS-B has been a significant driver of growth in our aviation business. According to the FAA, as of July 1, 2019, approximately 91,000 total aircraft have been equipped, of which approximately 7,000 are commercial aircraft. Of the remaining 84,000, Garmin has captured roughly 80% market share. Based on everything we see, it is likely that the ADS-B opportunities will continue into 2020. 
While ADS-B has been a significant opportunity, it's not the only opportunity for the aviation segment. New OEM platforms, retrofit cockpit systems, NXi upgrades and the growing demand for trainer aircraft represent opportunities for growth beyond the ADS-B cycle. We are optimistic about the future of our aviation business.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 13% as we experienced strong demand for our chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars. Gross and operating margins were 61% and 28%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth. 
Last quarter, we mentioned that the Independent Boat Builders, Inc. named Garmin its supplier of the year. I'm pleased to report that our relationship with IBBI has expanded and now includes audio equipment. Our Fusion brand of marine electronic systems was selected by IBBI as the preferred choice for its members. 
New markets and new product category is an area of strategic growth because they represent significant growth opportunities. In keeping with this strategy, at the recent ICAST fishing show, we introduced Force, our first entry into the freshwater trolling motor market. Force was named best new boating accessory and won the coveted Best of Show award for 2019, making Garmin a back-to-back Best of Show winner at ICAST. We are very proud of the accomplishments of our marine team, and we're excited about the new opportunity that Force represents in this segment. 
Looking next at the fitness segment. Revenue increased 12% driven by growth in running products as well as contributions from our recent acquisition of Tacx. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively. During the quarter, we began shipping our refreshed line of Forerunners, providing both smart watch features and enhanced running dynamics for all capabilities of runners. We also completed the acquisition of Tacx and are now in the process of expanding the distribution of Tacx products through Garmin retailers. 
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 4% on a year-over-year basis driven by growth in our golf and inReach products. We believe this is a remarkable accomplishment considering the significant impact of the fenix 5 Plus launch during the first half of 2018. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 34%, respectively. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the MARQ luxury watch. In addition, we experienced strong demand for golf wearables and the Instinct adventure watch. We also introduced a refreshed line of handheld navigators adding inReach satellite communication technology to our flagship handheld devices.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 13% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 48% and 16%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. We launched the DriveSmart 65 with integrated Alexa personal assistant, bringing enhanced voice-controlled functionality to drivers. We also announced the Garmin Overlander, an all-terrain GPS navigator specifically designed to fit the needs of the growing over lending community. This is a unique product offering for those looking to explore off the grid. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results in the first half of 2019. Given this strong performance, we are raising our projected revenue to approximately $3.6 billion for the year, representing an 8% increase over the prior year. Gross margin is projected to be 59.5% for the year. Operating margin is projected to be 23.2%. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 16.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.90. 
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment, we have increased our growth expectations for the aviation segment to 17%, the marine segment to 12% and the auto segment to down 15%. Fitness and outdoor are unchanged. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $955 million for the second quarter representing 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.3%, 180 basis point increase from the prior year. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 33.4%, 80 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $256 million, 18% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 26.8%, 250 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.17. Our GAAP (sic) [ pro forma ] EPS was $1.16, a 17% increase from the prior year. 
Next, we'll look at our second quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record second quarter revenue of $955 million. Consolidated revenue grew 7% led by double-digit growth in our aviation, marine and fitness segments. Also the outdoor segment had solid growth during the quarter. Combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor were up 12% compared in the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 83% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Aviation grew from 17% to 19%. Marine grew from 15% to 16%. And fitness grew from 25% to 26%. You can see it on the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. On a combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 90% of operating income in the second quarter 2019 compared to 94% in the second quarter of 2018. The aviation, marine and auto segments had strong year-over-year increases and operating income dollars improved operating margins. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $13 million or 4%. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 33.4% in the second quarter 2019, 80 basis point decrease from the comparable quarter last year. 
Research and development increased $7 million year-over-year in investments entering resources. Advertising expense was down $2 million from the prior year due to lower expenses in our auto segment. 
SG&A was up $8 million compared to prior year quarter, relatively flat as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $584 million due to strong quarter -- second quarter sales. The inventory balance increased sequentially year-over-year to $648 million due to timing of new products, raw material requirements, acquisition of Tacx. 
For the second quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $80 million, a $77 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $108 million. 
In the second quarter 2019, reported effective tax rate of 18.9% compared to effective tax rate of 19.4% in the prior year quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.

It's due to a number of factors, one of which is just timing of product launches, just anticipation of product launches in the back half. Also, some raw material requirements, just making sure we have appropriate levels of safety stock. And also, we acquired Tacx so that basically was incremental increase year-over-year. 
Also looking at the prior number, probably a little bit lighter last year on inventory than we'd like to be in. Kind of looking at inventory on the go forward for the rest of the year, I probably would expect the year-end inventory balance to be pretty similar to what I saw in Q2. It will probably go up some in Q3, probably similar type of year-over-year change I saw in Q2, but it'll come down some, and we just want to make sure we have appropriate levels of inventory to meet our continuing demands."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong results including record revenue and operating income for the second quarter. 
Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at $955 million, up 7% over the prior year. Aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 12% year-over-year. 
Gross margin improved to 60.3%. Operating margin expanded to 26.8%. Operating income increased 18% to $256 million. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.17 and pro forma EPS of $1.16 in the quarter, up 17% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our performance for the first half of 2019, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the aviation segment. Revenue increased 20% driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. We experienced strong growth in our ADS-B product offerings. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 36%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 27% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we achieved certification of the G5000 integrated flight deck for the Citation Excel and XLS, bringing a state-of-the-art cockpit system to this popular family of aircraft. We also announced the availability of the NXi upgrade for Cessna and Beechcraft models equipped with the original G1000 system. We continue to see strong customer demand and appreciation for this upgrade program.
As I mentioned earlier, ADS-B has been a significant driver of growth in our aviation business. According to the FAA, as of July 1, 2019, approximately 91,000 total aircraft have been equipped, of which approximately 7,000 are commercial aircraft. Of the remaining 84,000, Garmin has captured roughly 80% market share. Based on everything we see, it is likely that the ADS-B opportunities will continue into 2020. 
While ADS-B has been a significant opportunity, it's not the only opportunity for the aviation segment. New OEM platforms, retrofit cockpit systems, NXi upgrades and the growing demand for trainer aircraft represent opportunities for growth beyond the ADS-B cycle. We are optimistic about the future of our aviation business.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 13% as we experienced strong demand for our chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars. Gross and operating margins were 61% and 28%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth. 
Last quarter, we mentioned that the Independent Boat Builders, Inc. named Garmin its supplier of the year. I'm pleased to report that our relationship with IBBI has expanded and now includes audio equipment. Our Fusion brand of marine electronic systems was selected by IBBI as the preferred choice for its members. 
New markets and new product category is an area of strategic growth because they represent significant growth opportunities. In keeping with this strategy, at the recent ICAST fishing show, we introduced Force, our first entry into the freshwater trolling motor market. Force was named best new boating accessory and won the coveted Best of Show award for 2019, making Garmin a back-to-back Best of Show winner at ICAST. We are very proud of the accomplishments of our marine team, and we're excited about the new opportunity that Force represents in this segment. 
Looking next at the fitness segment. Revenue increased 12% driven by growth in running products as well as contributions from our recent acquisition of Tacx. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively. During the quarter, we began shipping our refreshed line of Forerunners, providing both smart watch features and enhanced running dynamics for all capabilities of runners. We also completed the acquisition of Tacx and are now in the process of expanding the distribution of Tacx products through Garmin retailers. 
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 4% on a year-over-year basis driven by growth in our golf and inReach products. We believe this is a remarkable accomplishment considering the significant impact of the fenix 5 Plus launch during the first half of 2018. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 34%, respectively. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the MARQ luxury watch. In addition, we experienced strong demand for golf wearables and the Instinct adventure watch. We also introduced a refreshed line of handheld navigators adding inReach satellite communication technology to our flagship handheld devices.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 13% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 48% and 16%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. We launched the DriveSmart 65 with integrated Alexa personal assistant, bringing enhanced voice-controlled functionality to drivers. We also announced the Garmin Overlander, an all-terrain GPS navigator specifically designed to fit the needs of the growing over lending community. This is a unique product offering for those looking to explore off the grid. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results in the first half of 2019. Given this strong performance, we are raising our projected revenue to approximately $3.6 billion for the year, representing an 8% increase over the prior year. Gross margin is projected to be 59.5% for the year. Operating margin is projected to be 23.2%. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 16.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.90. 
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment, we have increased our growth expectations for the aviation segment to 17%, the marine segment to 12% and the auto segment to down 15%. Fitness and outdoor are unchanged. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results with comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $955 million for the second quarter representing 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.3%, 180 basis point increase from the prior year. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 33.4%, 80 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $256 million, 18% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 26.8%, 250 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.17. Our GAAP (sic) [ pro forma ] EPS was $1.16, a 17% increase from the prior year. 
Next, we'll look at our second quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record second quarter revenue of $955 million. Consolidated revenue grew 7% led by double-digit growth in our aviation, marine and fitness segments. Also the outdoor segment had solid growth during the quarter. Combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor were up 12% compared in the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 83% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Aviation grew from 17% to 19%. Marine grew from 15% to 16%. And fitness grew from 25% to 26%. You can see it on the charts, it illustrate our profit mix by segment. On a combined basis, aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 90% of operating income in the second quarter 2019 compared to 94% in the second quarter of 2018. The aviation, marine and auto segments had strong year-over-year increases and operating income dollars improved operating margins. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $13 million or 4%. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 33.4% in the second quarter 2019, 80 basis point decrease from the comparable quarter last year. 
Research and development increased $7 million year-over-year in investments entering resources. Advertising expense was down $2 million from the prior year due to lower expenses in our auto segment. 
SG&A was up $8 million compared to prior year quarter, relatively flat as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $584 million due to strong quarter -- second quarter sales. The inventory balance increased sequentially year-over-year to $648 million due to timing of new products, raw material requirements, acquisition of Tacx. 
For the second quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $80 million, a $77 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $108 million. 
In the second quarter 2019, reported effective tax rate of 18.9% compared to effective tax rate of 19.4% in the prior year quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.

Also looking at the prior number, probably a little bit lighter last year on inventory than we'd like to be in. Kind of looking at inventory on the go forward for the rest of the year, I probably would expect the year-end inventory balance to be pretty similar to what I saw in Q2. It will probably go up some in Q3, probably similar type of year-over-year change I saw in Q2, but it'll come down some, and we just want to make sure we have appropriate levels of inventory to meet our continuing demands."

In terms of pull-forward impact on ADS-B, for sure, those people that are equipped with ADS-B and have taken the time to fully upgrade their panels with new technology, they obviously are not going to be upgrading in 2020 again per se. But there's many, many more aircraft out there that are needing new technology. Some of them are flying with equipment that's decades old, and we believe this is an opportunity for people to reassess the electronics in their aircraft and upgrade to a new technology that's available now."

So our automobile guidance takes into account everything we've experienced so far. We're rolling forward the benefits that we've had into the guidance and not making bold assumptions about where the market will go although we're pleased with how the performance of certain product categories in the segment have performed particularly the higher-end PND lines have been stronger than what they've been in the past. So that's all good news. 
In terms of BMW, the first set of our program is scheduled to be a 2020 program, and that's progressing as we have said before. There'll be minimal impact in 2019. That's been built into our guidance obviously. And the newer sets of business that we won with BMW is an ongoing effort. It will take some number of years now to develop that we're in the process of investing in the capital infrastructure that we need to be able to support that program including upgrading some of our existing factories and establishing a new facility in Europe."

We are pleased with our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2019, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance, which I'll explain in a moment. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments. 
Starting with the Aviation segment. Revenue increased 28%, driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket systems. 
Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 35%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 30% over the prior year. 
Growth in OEM systems was driven primarily by the recent certification of a Citation Longitude, featuring our G5000 integrated flight deck. 
However, the strength was broad based as other aircraft platforms also contributed to the growth. Growth in aftermarket systems was driven by strong ADS-B sales, and the recently certified G5000 integrated flight deck with the Citation XL and XLS. 
During the quarter, the G1000H NXI was certified in the [indiscernible] 407 GXI helicopter, representing the first IFR certification for this advanced helicopter flight deck. 
I'd like to highlight this morning's auto land announcement. This new safety technology is designed to return an aircraft and its passengers safely to the ground in the event a pilot is unable to do so. We believe auto land is disruptive new technologies that will change the way people think about safety in general aviation aircraft. Auto Land will soon be available as part of the G3000 integrated flight deck on the [indiscernible] Vision Jet and Piper M600 pending final FAA certification. 
Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 28%, primarily driven by growth in werewolves and contributions from Tacx. Gross and operating margins were 52% and 20%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 33% over the prior year. 
At Heathrow, which is Europe's leading consumer electronics tradeshow. We now sweeping update to our line of consumer wearable products including new versions of the Vivo active series in 2 sizes. The Vivo move 3 hybrid smart watch series and the all-new [indiscernible] smart watch featuring a brilliant AMOLED touchscreen display, comprehensive health and fitness features and long battery life. 
We also announced the Tacx neo 2T smart trainer featuring enhanced smart design and performance analytics to simulate an outdoor as realistically and quietly as possible. 
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 23% on a year-over-year basis with growth in multiple product categories led by adventure smart watches. 
Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 66% and 41%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment. 
At the recent UTMB tail running event, we launched the Phoenix 6 adventure smart watch series with larger displays and innovative performance features. 
We also introduced the Phoenix 6X Pro Solar, the first of its kind with our exclusive solar harvesting technology. We've often mentioned that in reach technology has been a growth driver for the outdoor segment and that was definitely the case in this most recent quarter. 
I'm pleased to report that in reach recently passed a significant milestone facilitating over 4,000 SOS incidents since its launch in 2011, demonstrating the crucial importance of satellite-based two-way messaging whenever our customers need assistance. 
We believe in reach has room to grow and the future is more people recognize its potential to change outcomes and save lives. 
Turning next to the marine segment. Revenue increased 9% as we saw solid sales across multiple product categories led by Charp Waters. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to [ 60%  ]and  19%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment. 
During the quarter, we were named Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association for the fifth consecutive year, reflecting the strength of our innovative products and our leading market position. 
We were also named the exclusive marine electronics provided by both regulator marine and Sea Hunt, solidifying our leadership in the premier center console boat market. 
Looking finally at the auto segment, revenue decreased 17%, primarily driven by declines in our OEM business and the ongoing PND market contraction. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. 
Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 48% and 15%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 39%. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Overlander all-in-one navigation device, which is the new product category designed for the growing community of overland adventure enthusiasts. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the results in the first 3 quarters of 2019. Given this strong performance, we're raising our projected full year revenue to approximately $3.65 billion. 
We're maintaining our full year gross margin at approximately 59.5% and raising our full year operating margin to approximately 24.3%. 
We're also updating our full year performance at the tax rate to almost 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately [ $4.15.  ] 
So looking quickly at guidance by segment, we've increased growth expectations for aviation to 20%, fitness to 16% and the outdoor segment to 11%. 
Guidance for the auto and the marine segments are unchanged. That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results through the comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted third quarter revenue of $934 million, representing 15% increase year-over-year. 
Gross margin was 60.7%, 130 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.7%, 240 basis points decrease from the prior year. 
Operating income was $261 million, a 33% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28%, a 380 basis point increase from the prior year. 
Our GAAP EPS was $1.19 and our pro forma EPS was $1.27, a 27% increase from the prior year. 
Next, we'll look at third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record third quarter revenue of $934 million. Consolidated revenue grew 15%, led by solid double-digit growth in our aviation, fitness and outdoor segments. Also, marine segment had solid growth of 9% during the quarter. 
On a combined basis, aviation, fitness, outdoor marine were up 24% compared to the prior year quarters. 
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine segments contributed 85% of total revenue in third quarter 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Aviation grew from 18% to 20%. Fitness grew from 24% to 26%, and outdoor grew from 26% to 28%. 
You can see on the charts illustrated our profit mix by segment. On a combined basis, the aviation, fitness, outdoor marine segments delivered 92% operating income in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018. 
All 5 segments had strong year-over-year increases and operating income dollars improved operating margins. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 7%. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 32.7% in the third quarter of 2019, 240 basis decrease in the comparable quarter last year. 
Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year due to investments and engineering resources. Our advising expense was up $2 million from the prior year quarter due to higher outdoor fitness expenses, partially offset by lower expenses in the auto segment. SG&A was up $10 million for the prior year quarter but decreased as a percentage of sales. 
The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to the seasonal trends, increased year-over-year to $558 million due to strong third quarter sales. 
Inventory balance increased sequentially to $750 million prepared for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Year-over-year increases due to timing of new products, acquisition of tax and efforts increase date of supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines. 
During the third quarter 2019, we generated free cash flow of $158 million. During third quarter of 2019, we put an effective tax rate of 11.6% compared to effective tax rate of 8.5% in the prior quarter. 
Increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower income tax reserve releases of the third quarter of 2019. Also, we've updated our guidance for full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximate [ 60%.  ] This concludes our formal remarks. Olivia, can you please open the lines for Q&A?"

Yes, in terms of OEM, as reported last quarter in the gamma research General Aviation and Manufacturers Association. There's been strength across the categories of business jets that were on as well as strength in the aircraft, particularly addressing the training market. So that's driving continued momentum into Q3 and beyond. We see those opportunities as ongoing because, particularly, in the training market, the need for pilots is very acute and the demand for aircraft trainers is high. 
In terms of ADS-B and its impact, it's definitely a growth driver for us. But even absent that particular category, we saw strong growth in the business. We're gaining confidence that going forward the cockpit modernization efforts that we're seeing across the fleet and demand for new aircraft should lead positive results for the segment."

So I'll give you a little bit of perspective on operating structure. And you said between advertising, SG&A and R&D. So thinking about it, on a full year basis as a percentage of sales, what we're thinking about, as it relates to advertising, we anticipate advertising as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat year-over-year. So with that, we will be spending more advertising dollars this Q4 than we did last Q4, that's primarily a function of just having new product launches. So we will be very targeted in our advertising depending upon, you know, what those product launches are. 
As it relates to SG&A, thinking about SG&A full year percentage of sales, anticipate that to be relatively flat year-over-year also. But we have in there is a piece of that is due to acquisitions, the other piece of it is just general, a merit, the other type of, inflation type of, increases we have in SG&A. 
Thinking about R&D, you know full year, as a percentage of sales. We would -- right now, we look at that, call it, about 50 basis points lower than this year than last year. From a dollar standpoint, there will be an increase. The situation there is that we are capitalizing some of our R&D expenses. There are certain auto OEM contracts that include contractual guarantees for reimbursements of R&D expenses. So in those cases, R&D expense are capitalized, they put on the balance sheet until that cash is received from our OEM receipt. I should say, the expense structure that depending upon what kind of different product launches we have and kind of advertising, some of that will fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. But right now, we're giving some nice leverage due to our sales also."

In terms of the expectations for the profit, I mean at these kinds of investment levels and and these kind of revenues, obviously, we should be able to be pretty predictable in terms of our operating profit. But as the business changes, we'll of course adjust and evaluate. For ADS-B, we're expecting that the opportunity will, of course, begin to flatten, that's inevitable as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year. But we do see spillover business into next year, particularly the first half as shop capacity still remains limited, so there's mostly linear output from shops right now and there's still more aircraft that needs to be equipped. There are new opportunities as you pointed out, so Europe is one of those and also Canada is evaluating their compliance as well. Both of these, I would say, are interesting to us. But obviously, the majority of the aircraft and the opportunities have been in the U.S. based ADS-B but they'll be nice enhancers for the coming years."

I would say that for us, again, if we subtracted the impact of ADS-B, we still had very strong growth in our aftermarket business. And I attribute that to the fact that we've got great products and some of them don't even have anything to do with ADS-B such as our autopilot systems for example, and also our aftermarket cockpits for things like the VXL and the XLS. So the dynamic is a little bit different for us. There definitely is an argument to be made that as people are motivated to upgrade to ADS-B, they're also upgrading the other equipment. And we said that before, it's difficult to quantify how much of that is interrelated, and there is quite a bit of cockpit equipment that needs modernization, many cockpits are decades old and the equipment now that is offered in the market is compelling and allows people to upgrade their aircraft into newer, safer, more reliable equipment.

Earlier today, Garmin reported another strong quarter of revenue growth, up 15% to $934 million.

Earlier today, Garmin reported another strong quarter of revenue growth, up 15% to $934 million. Aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine collectively increased 24% and contributed 85% of total revenues.
Gross margin improved to 60.7%. Revenue growth and expanding margins resulted in significant operating leverage in the business. Operating income increased 33% year-over-year to $261 million and operating margin expanded to 28%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.19 and pro forma EPS of $1.27 in the quarter.
We are pleased with our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2019, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance, which I'll explain in a moment.
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the Aviation segment. Revenue increased 28%, driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket systems. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 35%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 30% over the prior year.
Growth in OEM systems was driven primarily by the recent certification of a Citation Longitude, featuring our G5000 integrated flight deck. However, the strength was broad-based as other aircraft platforms also contributed to the growth. Growth in aftermarket systems was driven by strong ADS-B sales and the recently certified G5000 integrated flight deck with the Citation XL and XLS.
During the quarter, the G1000H NXI was certified in the Bell 407GXi helicopter, representing the first IFR certification for this advanced helicopter flight deck.
I'd like to highlight this morning's Autoland announcement. This new safety technology is designed to return an aircraft and its passengers safely to the ground in the event a pilot is unable to do so. We believe Autoland is a disruptive new technology that will change the way people think about safety in general aviation aircraft. Autoland will soon be available as part of the G3000 integrated flight deck on the Cirrus Vision Jet and the Piper M600 pending final FAA certification.
Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 28%, primarily driven by growth in wearables and contributions from Tacx. Gross and operating margins were 52% and 20%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 33% over the prior year.
At [indiscernible], which is Europe's leading consumer electronics trade show, we now a sweeping update to our line of consumer wearable products including new versions of the vÍvoactive series in 2 sizes, the vÍvomove 3 hybrid smartwatch series and the all-new Venu smartwatch featuring a brilliant AMOLED color touchscreen display, comprehensive health and fitness features and long battery life.
We also announced the Tacx NEO 2T smart trainer featuring enhanced drive design and performance analytics to simulate an outdoor ride as realistically and quietly as possible.
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 23% on a year-over-year basis with growth in multiple product categories led by adventure smartwatches. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 66% and 41%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment.
At the recent UTMB trail running event, we launched the fenix 6 adventure smartwatch series with larger displays and innovative performance features. We also introduced the fenix 6X Pro Solar, the first of its kind with our exclusive solar harvesting technology.
We have often mentioned that inReach technology has been a growth driver for the outdoor segment and that was definitely the case in this most recent quarter. I'm pleased to report that inReach recently passed a significant milestone facilitating over 4,000 SOS incidents since its launch in 2011, demonstrating the crucial importance of satellite-based 2-way messaging wherever our customers need assistance. We believe inReach has room to grow in the future as more people recognize its potential to change outcomes and save lives.
Turning next to the marine segment. Revenue increased 9% as we saw solid sales across multiple product categories led by chartplotters. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 60% and 19%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment.
During the quarter, we were named Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association for the fifth consecutive year, reflecting the strength of our innovative products and our leading market position.
We were also named the exclusive marine electronics provider by both Regulator Marine and Sea Hunt, solidifying our leadership in the premier center console boat market.
Looking finally at the auto segment, revenue decreased 17%, primarily driven by declines in our OEM business and the ongoing PND market contraction. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 48% and 15%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 39%.
During the quarter, we began shipping the Overlander all-in-one navigation device, which is the new product category designed for the growing community of overland adventure enthusiasts.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the results in the first 3 quarters of 2019. Given this strong performance, we're raising our projected full year revenue to approximately $3.65 billion.
We're maintaining our full year gross margin at approximately 59.5% and raising our full year operating margin to approximately 24.3%.
We're also updating our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.15.
So looking quickly at guidance by segment, we've increased growth expectations for aviation to 20%, fitness to 16% and the outdoor segment to 11%. Guidance for the auto and the marine segments are unchanged. That concludes my remarks.
Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, give some comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.
We posted third quarter revenue of $934 million, representing 15% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.7%, 130 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.7%, a 240 basis point decrease from the prior year.
Operating income was $261 million, a 33% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28%, a 380 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.19 and our pro forma EPS was $1.27, a 27% increase from the prior year.
Next, we'll look at third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record third quarter revenue of $934 million. Consolidated revenue grew 15%, led by solid double-digit growth in our aviation, fitness and outdoor segments. Also, marine segment had solid growth of 9% during the quarter.
On a combined basis, aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine were up 24% compared to the prior year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine segments contributed 85% of total revenue in third quarter 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Aviation grew from 18% to 20%, fitness grew from 24% to 26% and outdoor grew from 26% to 28%.
You can see from the chart to illustrate our profit mix by segment. Combined basis, the aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine segments delivered 92% operating income in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018. All 5 segments had strong year-over-year increases and operating income dollars improved operating margins.
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 7%. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 32.7% in the third quarter of 2019, 240 basis decrease in the comparable quarter last year.
Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year due to investments and engineering resources. Our advertising expense was up $2 million from the prior year quarter due to higher outdoor and fitness expenses, partially offset by lower expenses in the auto segment.
SG&A was up $10 million from the prior year quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year to $558 million due to strong third quarter sales.
Inventory balance increased sequentially to $750 million prepared for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase is due to timing of new products, acquisition of tax and efforts increase date of supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines.
During the third quarter 2019, we generated free cash flow of $158 million. During third quarter of 2019, we report an effective tax rate of 11.6% compared to effective tax rate of 8.5% in the prior year quarter. Increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower income tax reserve releases in the third quarter of 2019.
Also, we've updated our guidance for the full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%. This concludes our formal remarks.

So that's driving continued momentum into Q3 and beyond. We see those opportunities as ongoing because, particularly, in the training market, the need for pilots is very acute and the demand for aircraft trainers is high.
In terms of ADS-B and its impact, it's definitely a growth driver for us. But even absent that particular category, we saw strong growth in the business. We're gaining confidence that going forward, the cockpit modernization efforts that we're seeing across the fleet and demand for new aircraft should lead to positive results for the segment."

So I'll give you a little bit of perspective on our operating structure, and you said between our advertising, SG&A and R&D. So thinking about it on a full year basis as a percentage of sales, what we're thinking about as it relates to advertising, we anticipate advertising as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat year-over-year.
So with that, we will be spending more advertising dollars this Q4 than we did last Q4. And that's primarily a function of just having new product launches. So we will be very targeted in our advertising depending upon what those product launches are.
As it relates to SG&A, thinking about SG&A full year percentage of sales, anticipate that to be relatively flat year-over-year also. What we have in there is a piece of that is due to acquisitions. The other piece of it is just general, a merit, other type of -- inflational type of increases we have in SG&A.
Thinking about R&D, as a full year percentage of sales, we would -- right now, we look at that probably about 50 basis points lower than this year than last year. From a dollar standpoint, there will be an increase. The situation there is that we are capitalizing some of our R&D expenses. There are certain auto OEM contracts that include contractual guarantees for reimbursements of R&D expenses. So in those cases, R&D expense are capitalized, they're put on the balance sheet until that cash is received from our OEM receipt.
And I should say the expense structure that -- depending upon what kind of different product launches we have and kind of advertising, some of that will fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. But right now, we're getting some nice leverage due to our sales also."

I would say that we would still like to hire more people, engineering people in aviation in order to be able to support ongoing opportunities that are going on there, but we're managing and it is giving us some leverage in the business.
In terms of the expectations for the profit, I mean at these kinds of investment levels and these kinds of revenues, obviously, we should be able to be pretty predictable in terms of our operating profit. But as the business changes, we'll of course adjust and evaluate.
For ADS-B, we're expecting that the opportunity will, of course, begin to flatten. That's inevitable as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, but we do see spillover business into next year, particularly the first half as shop capacity still remains limited, so there's mostly linear output from shops right now and there's still more aircraft that need to be equipped.
There are new opportunities as you pointed out, so Europe is one of those and also Canada is evaluating their compliance as well. Both of these, I would say, are interesting to us. But obviously, the majority of the aircraft and the opportunities have been in the U.S.-based ADS-B, but they'll be nice enhancers for the coming years."

I would say that for us, again, if we subtracted the impact of the ADS-B, we still had very strong growth in our aftermarket business. And I attribute that to the fact that we have got great products and some of them don't even have anything to do with ADS-B such as our autopilot systems, for example, and also our aftermarket cockpits for things like the Excel and the XLS.
So the dynamic is a little bit different. There definitely is an argument to be made that as people are motivated to upgrade to ADS-B, they're also upgrading the other equipment. And we said that before, it's difficult to quantify how much of that is interrelated. And there is quite a bit of cockpit equipment that needs modernization. Many cockpits are decades old, and the equipment now that is offered in the market is compelling and allows people to upgrade their aircraft into newer, safer, more reliable equipment. So we see that dynamic continuing even when ADS-B peaks and fades."

The -- as I mentioned in other questions, the trainer market is something that will see continued demand for several years to come as the pilot shortage is reckoned with in the industry and as there's significant demand for trainer aircraft to train these pilots. And then the class of aircraft that we're on is kind of the midsized business jet on down. And so again, that's where this is kind of a sweet spot right now particularly in this economy as these tend to be -- tend to tilt more towards owner flown or the fractional areas, which has been a very strong area for us.
So we see continued opportunity in the OE side. You asked the question about how significant is it relative to the overall segment. And as we remarked in the past, the segment is roughly split evenly between retrofit and OEM. So OEM is definitely a strong influencer in our business, and we see opportunities going forward that will continue."

Earlier today, Garmin reported another strong quarter of revenue growth, up 15% to $934 million.

Earlier today, Garmin reported another strong quarter of revenue growth, up 15% to $934 million. Aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine collectively increased 24% and contributed 85% of total revenues.
Gross margin improved to 60.7%. Revenue growth and expanding margins resulted in significant operating leverage in the business. Operating income increased 33% year-over-year to $261 million and operating margin expanded to 28%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.19 and pro forma EPS of $1.27 in the quarter.
We are pleased with our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2019, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance, which I'll explain in a moment.
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the Aviation segment. Revenue increased 28% driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket systems. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 35%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 30% over the prior year.
Growth in OEM systems was driven primarily by the recent certification of the Citation Longitude, featuring our G5000 integrated flight deck. However, the strength was broad-based as other aircraft platforms also contributed to the growth. Growth in aftermarket systems was driven by strong ADS-B sales and the recently certified G5000 integrated flight deck for the Citation XL and XLS.
During the quarter, the G1000H NXI was certified in the Bell 407GXi helicopter, representing the first IFR certification for this advanced helicopter flight deck.
I'd like to highlight this morning's Autoland announcement. This new safety technology is designed to return an aircraft and its passengers safely to the ground in the event a pilot is unable to do so. We believe Autoland is disruptive new technology that will change the way people think about safety in general aviation aircraft. Autoland will soon be available as part of the G3000 integrated flight deck on the Cirrus Vision Jet and the Piper M600 pending final FAA certification.
Turning next to the Fitness segment. Revenue increased 28%, primarily driven by growth in wearables and contributions from Tacx. Gross and operating margins were 52% and 20%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 33% over the prior year.
At [ EPA ], which is Europe's leading consumer electronics trade show, we announced a sweeping update to our line of consumer wearable products including new versions of the vívoactive series in 2 sizes, the vivomove 3 hybrid smartwatch series and the all-new Venu smartwatch featuring a brilliant AMOLED color touchscreen display, comprehensive health and fitness features and long battery life.
We also announced the Tacx NEO 2T smart trainer featuring enhanced drive design and performance analytics to simulate an outdoor ride as realistically and quietly as possible.
Turning next to the Outdoor segment. Revenue increased 23% on a year-over-year basis with growth in multiple product categories led by adventure smartwatches. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 66% and 41%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment.
At the recent UTMB trail running event, we launched the fenix 6 adventure smartwatch series with larger displays and innovative performance features. We also introduced the fenix 6X Pro Solar, the first of its kind with our exclusive solar harvesting technology.
We've often mentioned that inReach technology has been a growth driver for the outdoor segment and that was definitely the case in this most recent quarter. I'm pleased to report that inReach recently passed a significant milestone, facilitating over 4,000 SOS incidents since its launch in 2011, demonstrating the crucial importance of satellite-based 2-way messaging wherever our customers need assistance. We believe inReach has room to grow in the future as more people recognize its potential to change outcomes and save lives.
Turning next to the Marine segment. Revenue increased 9% as we saw solid sales across multiple product categories led by chartplotters. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 60% and 19%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment.
During the quarter, we were named Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association for the fifth consecutive year, reflecting the strength of our innovative products and our leading market position.
We were also named the exclusive marine electronics provider by both Regulator Marine and Sea Hunt, solidifying our leadership in the premier center console boat market.
Looking, finally, at the auto segment, revenue decreased 17% primarily driven by declines in our OEM business and the ongoing PND market contraction. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 48% and 15%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 39%.
During the quarter, we began shipping the Overlander all-in-one navigation device, which is a new product category designed for the growing community of overland adventure enthusiasts.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the results in the first 3 quarters of 2019. Given this strong performance, we're raising our projected full year revenue to approximately $3.65 billion.
We're maintaining our full year gross margin at approximately 59.5% and raising our full year operating margin to approximately 24.3%.
We're also updating our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.15.
So looking quickly at guidance by segment, we've increased growth expectations for aviation to 20%, fitness to 16% and the outdoor segment to 11%. Guidance for the auto and the marine segments are unchanged. That concludes my remarks.
Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, give you [ some ] comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.We posted third quarter revenue of $934 million, representing 15% increase",569,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, give you [ some ] comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.
We posted third quarter revenue of $934 million, representing 15% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.7%, 130 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.7%, a 240 basis point decrease from the prior year.
Operating income was $261 million, a 33% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28%, a 380 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.19 and our pro forma EPS was $1.27, a 27% increase from the prior year.
Next, we'll look at third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record third quarter revenue of $934 million. Consolidated revenue grew 15%, led by solid double-digit growth in our Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor segments. Also, the Marine segment had solid growth of 9% during the quarter.
On a combined basis, Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine were up 24% compared to the prior year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine segments contributed 85% of total revenue in third quarter 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Aviation grew from 18% to 20%, Fitness grew from 24% to 26%, and Outdoor grew from 26% to 28%.
You can see from the charts that illustrate our product mix by segment. Combined basis, the Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine segments delivered 92% of operating income in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018. All 5 segments had strong year-over-year increases and operating income dollars improved operating margins.
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 7%. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 32.7% in the third quarter of 2019, a 240 basis decrease from the comparable quarter last year.
Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year due to investments and engineering resources. Our advertising expense was up $2 million from the prior year quarter due to higher Outdoor and Fitness expenses, partially offset by lower expenses in the Auto segment.
SG&A was up $10 million from the prior year quarter but decreased as a percentage of sales. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year to $558 million due to strong third quarter sales.
Inventory balance increased sequentially to $750 million to prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase is due to timing of new products, acquisition of Tacx and efforts to increase days of supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines.
During the third quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $158 million. During the third quarter of 2019, we report an effective tax rate of 11.6% compared to an effective tax rate of 8.5% the prior year quarter. Increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower income tax reserve releases in the third quarter of 2019.
Also, we've updated our guidance for the full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%. This concludes our formal remarks.
Olivia, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

So that's driving continued momentum into Q3 and beyond. We see those opportunities as ongoing because, particularly in the training market, the need for pilots is very acute and the demand for aircraft trainers is high.
In terms of ADS-B and its impact, it's definitely a growth driver for us. But even absent that particular category, we saw strong growth in the business. We're gaining confidence that, going forward, the cockpit modernization efforts that we're seeing across the fleet and demand for new aircraft should lead to positive results for the segment."

So I'll give you a little bit of perspective on our operating structure, and you said between our advertising, SG&A and R&D. So thinking about it on a full year basis as a percentage of sales, what we're thinking about as it relates to advertising, we anticipate advertising as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat year-over-year.
So with that, we will be spending more advertising dollars this Q4 than we did last Q4. And that's primarily a function of just having new product launches. So we will be very targeted in our advertising depending upon what those product launches are.
As it relates to SG&A, thinking about SG&A full year percentage of sales, anticipate that to be relatively flat year-over-year also. What we have in there is a piece of that is due to acquisitions. The other piece of it is just general, merit, other type of -- inflational type of increases we have in SG&A.
Thinking about R&D, as a full year's percentage of sales, we would -- or right now, we look at that probably about 50 basis points lower than this year than last year. From a dollar standpoint, there will be an increase. The situation there is that we are capitalizing some of our R&D expenses. There are certain Auto OEM contracts that include contractual guarantees for reimbursements of R&D expenses. So in those cases, our R&D expenses are capitalized. They're put on the balance sheet until that cash is received from our OEM receipt.
And I should say the expense structure that -- depending upon what kind of different product launches we have, what kind of advertising, some of that will fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. But right now, we're getting some nice leverage due to our sales also."

In terms of the expectations for the profit, I mean, at these kinds of investment levels and these kinds of revenues, obviously, we should be able to be pretty predictable in terms of our operating profit. But as the business changes, we'll of course adjust and evaluate.
For ADS-B, we're expecting that the opportunity will, of course, begin to flatten. That's inevitable as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, but we do see spillover business into next year, particularly the first half, as shop capacity still remains limited, so there's mostly linear output from shops right now and there's still more aircraft that need to be equipped.
There are new opportunities, as you pointed out, so Europe is one of those and also Canada is evaluating their compliance as well. Both of these, I would say, are interesting to us. But obviously, the majority of the aircraft and the opportunities have been in the U.S.-based ADS-B, but they'll be nice enhancers for the coming years."

I would say that, for us, again, if we subtracted the impact of the ADS-B, we still had very strong growth in our aftermarket business. And I attribute that to the fact that we've got great products and some of them don't even have anything to do with ADS-B, such as our Autopilot systems, for example, and also our aftermarket cockpits for things like the Excel and the XLS.
So the dynamic is a little bit different from us. There definitely is an argument to be made that, as people are motivated to upgrade to ADS-B, they're also upgrading the other equipment. And we've said that before, it's difficult to quantify how much of that is interrelated. And there is quite a bit of cockpit equipment that needs modernization. Many cockpits are decades old, and the equipment now that is offered in the market is compelling and allows people to upgrade their aircraft into newer, safer, more reliable equipment. So we see that dynamic continuing even when ADS-B peaks and fades."

From where we sit, we see a very flattish overall OE market that is driven in some part, probably for Garmin, on new introductions. But overall, unit volumes are fairly flat. And I would say there's not a lot of increase in demand. But in the context of that, I wanted to get a sense of how small that business is relative for you to the overall Aviation business given how strong your aftermarket and retrofit components are.

The -- as I mentioned in other questions, the trainer market is something that we'll see continued demand for several years to come as the pilot shortage is reckoned with in the industry and as there's significant demand for trainer aircraft to train these pilots. And then the class of aircraft that we're on is kind of the midsized business jet on down. And so again, that's where it's kind of a sweet spot right now, particularly in this economy, as these tend to be -- tend to tilt more towards owner flown or the fractional areas, which has been a very strong area for us.
So we see continued opportunity in the OE side. You asked the question about how significant is it relative to the overall segment. And as we've remarked in the past, the segment is roughly split evenly between retrofit and OEM. So OEM is definitely a strong influencer in our business, and we see opportunities going forward that will continue."

Earlier today, Garmin reported another strong quarter of revenue growth, up 15% to $934 million.

Earlier today, Garmin reported another strong quarter of revenue growth, up 15% to $934 million. Aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine collectively increased 24% and contributed 85% of total revenues.
Gross margin improved to 60.7%. Revenue growth and expanding margins resulted in significant operating leverage in the business. Operating income increased 33% year-over-year to $261 million and operating margin expanded to 28%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.19 and pro forma EPS of $1.27 in the quarter.
We are pleased with our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2019, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance, which I'll explain in a moment.
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the Aviation segment. Revenue increased 28% driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket systems. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 35%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 30% over the prior year.
Growth in OEM systems was driven primarily by the recent certification of the Citation Longitude, featuring our G5000 integrated flight deck. However, the strength was broad-based as other aircraft platforms also contributed to the growth. Growth in aftermarket systems was driven by strong ADS-B sales and the recently certified G5000 integrated flight deck for the Citation XL and XLS.
During the quarter, the G1000H NXI was certified in the Bell 407GXi helicopter, representing the first IFR certification for this advanced helicopter flight deck.
I'd like to highlight this morning's Autoland announcement. This new safety technology is designed to return an aircraft and its passengers safely to the ground in the event a pilot is unable to do so. We believe Autoland is disruptive new technology that will change the way people think about safety in general aviation aircraft. Autoland will soon be available as part of the G3000 integrated flight deck on the Cirrus Vision Jet and the Piper M600 pending final FAA certification.
Turning next to the Fitness segment. Revenue increased 28%, primarily driven by growth in wearables and contributions from Tacx. Gross and operating margins were 52% and 20%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 33% over the prior year.
At [ EPA ], which is Europe's leading consumer electronics trade show, we announced a sweeping update to our line of consumer wearable products including new versions of the vívoactive series in 2 sizes, the vivomove 3 hybrid smartwatch series and the all-new Venu smartwatch featuring a brilliant AMOLED color touchscreen display, comprehensive health and fitness features and long battery life.
We also announced the Tacx NEO 2T smart trainer featuring enhanced drive design and performance analytics to simulate an outdoor ride as realistically and quietly as possible.
Turning next to the Outdoor segment. Revenue increased 23% on a year-over-year basis with growth in multiple product categories led by adventure smartwatches. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 66% and 41%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment.
At the recent UTMB trail running event, we launched the fenix 6 adventure smartwatch series with larger displays and innovative performance features. We also introduced the fenix 6X Pro Solar, the first of its kind with our exclusive solar harvesting technology.
We've often mentioned that inReach technology has been a growth driver for the outdoor segment and that was definitely the case in this most recent quarter. I'm pleased to report that inReach recently passed a significant milestone, facilitating over 4,000 SOS incidents since its launch in 2011, demonstrating the crucial importance of satellite-based 2-way messaging wherever our customers need assistance. We believe inReach has room to grow in the future as more people recognize its potential to change outcomes and save lives.
Turning next to the Marine segment. Revenue increased 9% as we saw solid sales across multiple product categories led by chartplotters. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 60% and 19%, respectively, resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment.
During the quarter, we were named Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association for the fifth consecutive year, reflecting the strength of our innovative products and our leading market position.
We were also named the exclusive marine electronics provider by both Regulator Marine and Sea Hunt, solidifying our leadership in the premier center console boat market.
Looking, finally, at the auto segment, revenue decreased 17% primarily driven by declines in our OEM business and the ongoing PND market contraction. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 48% and 15%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 39%.
During the quarter, we began shipping the Overlander all-in-one navigation device, which is a new product category designed for the growing community of overland adventure enthusiasts.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the results in the first 3 quarters of 2019. Given this strong performance, we're raising our projected full year revenue to approximately $3.65 billion.
We're maintaining our full year gross margin at approximately 59.5% and raising our full year operating margin to approximately 24.3%.
We're also updating our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.15.
So looking quickly at guidance by segment, we've increased growth expectations for aviation to 20%, fitness to 16% and the outdoor segment to 11%. Guidance for the auto and the marine segments are unchanged. That concludes my remarks.
Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, give you [ some ] comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.We posted third quarter revenue of $934 million, representing 15% increase",569,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, give you [ some ] comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.
We posted third quarter revenue of $934 million, representing 15% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.7%, 130 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.7%, a 240 basis point decrease from the prior year.
Operating income was $261 million, a 33% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28%, a 380 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.19 and our pro forma EPS was $1.27, a 27% increase from the prior year.
Next, we'll look at third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record third quarter revenue of $934 million. Consolidated revenue grew 15%, led by solid double-digit growth in our Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor segments. Also, the Marine segment had solid growth of 9% during the quarter.
On a combined basis, Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine were up 24% compared to the prior year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine segments contributed 85% of total revenue in third quarter 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Aviation grew from 18% to 20%, Fitness grew from 24% to 26%, and Outdoor grew from 26% to 28%.
You can see from the charts that illustrate our product mix by segment. Combined basis, the Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine segments delivered 92% of operating income in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018. All 5 segments had strong year-over-year increases and operating income dollars improved operating margins.
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 7%. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 32.7% in the third quarter of 2019, a 240 basis decrease from the comparable quarter last year.
Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year due to investments and engineering resources. Our advertising expense was up $2 million from the prior year quarter due to higher Outdoor and Fitness expenses, partially offset by lower expenses in the Auto segment.
SG&A was up $10 million from the prior year quarter but decreased as a percentage of sales. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year to $558 million due to strong third quarter sales.
Inventory balance increased sequentially to $750 million to prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase is due to timing of new products, acquisition of Tacx and efforts to increase days of supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines.
During the third quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $158 million. During the third quarter of 2019, we report an effective tax rate of 11.6% compared to an effective tax rate of 8.5% the prior year quarter. Increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower income tax reserve releases in the third quarter of 2019.
Also, we've updated our guidance for the full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%. This concludes our formal remarks.

We see those opportunities as ongoing because, particularly in the training market, the need for pilots is very acute and the demand for aircraft trainers is high.
In terms of ADS-B and its impact, it's definitely a growth driver for us. But even absent that particular category, we saw strong growth in the business. We're gaining confidence that, going forward, the cockpit modernization efforts that we're seeing across the fleet and demand for new aircraft should lead to positive results for the segment."

So I'll give you a little bit of perspective on our operating structure, and you said between our advertising, SG&A and R&D. So thinking about it on a full year basis as a percentage of sales, what we're thinking about as it relates to advertising, we anticipate advertising as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat year-over-year.
So with that, we will be spending more advertising dollars this Q4 than we did last Q4. And that's primarily a function of just having new product launches. So we will be very targeted in our advertising depending upon what those product launches are.
As it relates to SG&A, thinking about SG&A full year percentage of sales, anticipate that to be relatively flat year-over-year also. What we have in there is a piece of that is due to acquisitions. The other piece of it is just general, merit, other type of -- inflational type of increases we have in SG&A.
Thinking about R&D, as a full year's percentage of sales, we would -- or right now, we look at that probably about 50 basis points lower than this year than last year. From a dollar standpoint, there will be an increase. The situation there is that we are capitalizing some of our R&D expenses. There are certain Auto OEM contracts that include contractual guarantees for reimbursements of R&D expenses. So in those cases, our R&D expenses are capitalized. They're put on the balance sheet until that cash is received from our OEM receipt.
And I should say the expense structure that -- depending upon what kind of different product launches we have, what kind of advertising, some of that will fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. But right now, we're getting some nice leverage due to our sales also."

In terms of the expectations for the profit, I mean, at these kinds of investment levels and these kinds of revenues, obviously, we should be able to be pretty predictable in terms of our operating profit. But as the business changes, we'll of course adjust and evaluate.
For ADS-B, we're expecting that the opportunity will, of course, begin to flatten. That's inevitable as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, but we do see spillover business into next year, particularly the first half, as shop capacity still remains limited, so there's mostly linear output from shops right now and there's still more aircraft that need to be equipped.
There are new opportunities, as you pointed out, so Europe is one of those and also Canada is evaluating their compliance as well. Both of these, I would say, are interesting to us.

I just wanted to see if you're seeing the same kind of magnitude. I understand that you're targeting, to some extent, smaller aircraft or much higher volumes of smaller aircraft.

So definitely, there is a difference, as you point out, in the business models between the 2 companies and -- so I think some of the multiplier that you mentioned could be due to that. I would say that, for us, again, if we subtracted the impact of the ADS-B, we still had very strong growth in our aftermarket business. And I attribute that to the fact that we've got great products and some of them don't even have anything to do with ADS-B, such as our Autopilot systems, for example, and also our aftermarket cockpits for things like the Excel and the XLS.
So the dynamic is a little bit different from us. There definitely is an argument to be made that, as people are motivated to upgrade to ADS-B, they're also upgrading the other equipment. And we've said that before, it's difficult to quantify how much of that is interrelated. And there is quite a bit of cockpit equipment that needs modernization. Many cockpits are decades old, and the equipment now that is offered in the market is compelling and allows people to upgrade their aircraft into newer, safer, more reliable equipment. So we see that dynamic continuing even when ADS-B peaks and fades."

You talked about it earlier in an earlier question. You talked about the ramp, you've got the longitude here. And I think you made some positive comments about the OE side. From where we sit, we see a very flattish overall OE market that is driven in some part, probably for Garmin, on new introductions. But overall, unit volumes are fairly flat. And I would say there's not a lot of increase in demand. But in the context of that, I wanted to get a sense of how small that business is relative for you to the overall Aviation business given how strong your aftermarket and retrofit components are. In other words, should we worry too much about the OE side, if it is indeed flat?"

The -- as I mentioned in other questions, the trainer market is something that we'll see continued demand for several years to come as the pilot shortage is reckoned with in the industry and as there's significant demand for trainer aircraft to train these pilots. And then the class of aircraft that we're on is kind of the midsized business jet on down. And so again, that's where it's kind of a sweet spot right now, particularly in this economy, as these tend to be -- tend to tilt more towards owner flown or the fractional areas, which has been a very strong area for us.
So we see continued opportunity in the OE side. You asked the question about how significant is it relative to the overall segment. And as we've remarked in the past, the segment is roughly split evenly between retrofit and OEM. So OEM is definitely a strong influencer in our business, and we see opportunities going forward that will continue."
