News Corp reported increased profitability and revenue growth during the first half of fiscal 2019, highlighting the power of premium content and authenticated audiences in a fact-changed world that craves credibility. For the second quarter",1172,"Thanks, Mike. News Corp reported increased profitability and revenue growth during the first half of fiscal 2019, highlighting the power of premium content and authenticated audiences in a fact-changed world that craves credibility. For the second quarter, the company saw 21% revenue growth and a 13% rise in total segment EBITDA, reflecting the consolidation of Foxtel and a healthy expansion of revenues at HarperCollins, Dow Jones and Group. 
More generally, at News and Information Services, we saw a continuation of positive trends in paid digital subscriptions and digital advertising in Australia and the U.S. where the growth mitigated declines in print revenue. Even though our teams have been diligent in pursuing revenue opportunities, the digital world remains somewhat dysfunctional and subject to intensifying scrutiny. We are in a world of exponential e-evolution in which dominant players have the potential to manipulate markets for data, products, advertising, news and ideas. There is no doubt that some of these companies are arbitraging algorithmic ambiguity and hoping that regulators do not fully appreciate or define their dominance in certain sectors. 
When one company controls much of the U.S. consumer audio book market and has its own products in that market and can tweak its algorithm at will, the potential for abuse is almost limitless. It is clear that there has been a regulatory awakening, and the time has come for a regulatory reckoning. 
Turning now to our end businesses, which are certainly conscious of their responsibilities as custodians of customer data. It is clear that the ongoing digital transformation of Dow Jones is efficacious. Many traditional media companies are ailing, but that is certainly not the case of the world street journal where paid digital subscribers grew 23% to over 1.7 million. Dow Jones overall has approximately 3.2 million total subscribers, 13% higher year-over-year.
Elsewhere in the Dow Jones family, Market Watch saw strong gains this quarter, with visits up 45% year-over-year, according to [indiscernible] While grew its total subscribers 27% year-over-year. The professional information business at Dow Jones also continues to show progress, with Risk and Compliance reporting at 26% increase in revenues. There has now been in excess of 25% year-over-year revenue growth for 7 consecutive quarters.
At The Times in the U.K., print advertising revenues rose for the fifth consecutive quarter. The Times and Sunday Times saw solid growth in digital subscribers, while The Sun continues as the U.K.'s #1 news brand across print and digital combined according to the latest PAMCO survey. 
Last month, we made an application to the U.K. government to allow a sensible sharing resources and cost reduction across The Times and The Sunday Times. The editorial independence and uniqueness of these fearless publications will be protected. But there are clearly areas of cost duplication and we want to ensure the very best use of our financial and the journalistic resources. 
Chris Evans, the gifted legendary writer/broadcaster, joined Wireless Group's Virgin Radio last month, and the audience growth has been remarkable. To put the impact and the potential in perspective, during the first day of Chris' show, Virgin Radio saw more up downloads with digital listing than in all of 2018. The breakfast program also deployed the unique sponsorship partners with Skype, so that the flow was not disrupted by conventional ad brakes. That model has already proven its worth and is likely to be replicated elsewhere on the radio roster. 
At News Australia, profitability improved, thanks to continued digital advertising growth and cost efficiencies. news.com.au was again the #1 news website, significantly ahead of its competitors reaching almost 10 million unique users in the month of December according to Nielsen.
Meanwhile, The Australian, where digital paid subscriptions account for more than half of the total subscriber base, we saw strong digital subscription growth this quarter, up 23% year-over-year. 
Since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, we have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology. Average audiences across Fox Sports Australia channels are up over 70% year-over-year. With the addition of Life, boosting viewership during the summer, traditionally, a relatively quiet period for customer acquisition. 
Our new sports streaming product, KO, has certainly changed the traditional trend. As of February 5, KO had attracted over 115,000 users, of which approximately 100,000 were paid, and we expect that number to increase markedly as we hit into the peak selling season for the more popular winter sports, Australia Football and Rugby League.
It is clear in a competitive world of content that the passion for sport drives subscription growth, and Foxtel has by far the best collection of that cherished content.
In our digital real estate services segment, REA group in Australia continues to outperform the competition, posting robust results despite a challenging listings environment, driven by strong residential growth and the inclusion of the data services business, which was not in the prior comparative period. The continued success of REA would not have been possible without the leadership of Tracey Fellows. She will be driving global expansion and seeking new opportunities for our fastest revenue growing segment in her new role as President of Global Digital Real Estate at News Corp. 
Since the creation of the new News Corp in 2013, digital real estate service revenues have more than tripled, and segment EBITDA has more than doubled. The appointment of Tracy underscores our increasing commitment to the sector. We are particularly pleased that Ellen Wilson has become the new Chief Executive of REA where he's overseeing strategy, M&A and operations, all of which have thrived.
Turning to U.S. real estate. Our long-term optimism is undiminished, even as shorter term trading in the property market has been somewhat sluggish. As evidence of the enduring strength of our business, real estate revenues at the operating  [indiscernible] were up 23% this quarter, with total revenues up 11%. This includes Opcity, the acquisition of which we successfully closed in October. Its strategic importance is evident in the higher quality value-added leads it provides with brokers about potential clients. 
Unlike a certain other company in the sector, we are not in the business of flagrantly flipping houses or covertly competing with our clients. Our aim is to provide the best possible service to buyers, sellers and realtors. 
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins delivered another outstanding performance this quarter. Fostered by best-selling titles, such as Homebody by Joanna Gaines, and Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, both of whom are set to publish new titles in the current quarter. And in the U.K., also very successful with the Ice Monster by the irrepressible David Wallace. Digital sales also grew 12% in the prior year, driven by a 58% increase in the sales of audiobooks.
Our results this quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year demonstrate the power of our premium products and reflect our ongoing digital transformation, which is building a muscular platform for the future and for our investors. Now Susan will provide incisive insights into the founders of our accounts."

Fiscal 2019 second quarter total revenues were over $2.6 billion, up 21% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $370 million, up 13% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues increased 3% and EBITDA increased 2%. 
For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.16 as compared to a loss of $0.14 in the prior year, which included the charge related to the U.S. tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter versus $0.24 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operation segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, down 3% versus the prior year. Currency had a $34 million negative impact, accounting for more than half the decline. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 4%; News U.K. declined 10%; News Australia declined 5%, although it was relatively stable in local currency; and News America Marketing fell 7%. Approximately 32% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year. 
Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 50% of segment revenues and were down 5% versus the prior year, with approximately $18 million or 2% being due to currency fluctuations. Second quarter advertising trends across our new businesses improved modestly from the prior quarter ratio. 
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were flat with the prior year. Digital advertising revenues increased significantly both year-over-year and sequentially, offsetting print decline. The improvement was driven by strong programmatic growth resulting from audience going to MarketWatch. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 7% but down just 1% in local currency, again, showing moderating declines versus the prior quarter, with improvements in the rate of print declines and strong year-over-year gains in digital. 
On the digital front, we saw further expansion of news.com.au and National News portal, a news expand to small to medium business offering. News U.K. advertising fell 8% versus the prior year or down 4% in local currency, due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had challenging prior year comparisons. We saw modestly higher print advertising revenues at The Times. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, advertising revenues fell 7% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which included FSI product and lower install advertising revenues, which were partly impacted by the timing of product campaigns.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 1%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $12 million or 2%. We are continuing to see very healthy digital paid subscriber growth, which has been a core strategic focus and key to improved performance.
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%, benefiting from strong pay digital-only subscriber growth at The Wall Street Journal, which are up 23% year-over-year to over $1.7 million and an increase of 25,000 subscribers from the first quarter. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 67% of total subscribers at the Wall Street Journal, up from 60% last year.
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 22% to 269,000, and at News Australia, up 18% to over 460,000. In Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales offset print volume declines, while circulation revenues were down modestly in the U.K. 
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $120 million, down 15%, mainly driven by declines in the U.K. from lower revenues, including the exit of and higher expenses related to newsprint prices. However, we again had increased contribution at both Dow Jones and News Australia.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $562 million versus $120 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $84 million versus $33 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $69 million or 11% compared with the prior year, an improvement from the first quarter decrease of 17%. $39 million of the decline or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. 
Broadcast trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base, higher cost and mix shift to lower [indiscernible] The subscription revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in Foxtel Now revenues. Broadcast ARPU was AUD 78, down about 3% versus the prior year, reflecting a 2% negative impact from the new revenue standard. Compared to the first quarter, broadcast ARPU was up over 2%, reflecting a price increase implemented on October 1.
Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $71 million or 46% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $26 million of costs related to Australia and about $9 million of marketing related to the commercial launch of Kayo Sports. This level of investment was consistent with our expectations as we focus on better positioning Foxtel for future growth. 
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of December 31, up 4% against the prior year, driven by higher Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia. 
In terms of the subscriber mix, about 2.5 million subscribers were broadcast and commercial. The remainder were Foxtel now and Kayo Sports subscribers. We launched Kayo Sports in late November, and I'm very pleased with the early adoption. As mentioned, we had 115,000 subscribers as of February 5, of which approximately 100,000 were paid subscribers and expect to see it scale into the important winter sports selling season.
Pleasingly, the Kayo Sports user base is engaged with average viewing time per active user currently at 69 minutes per day with over 70% watching live video and smartphone being the primary device. 
In the second quarter, broadcast churn was 15.6% versus 14.5% in the prior year, which was mainly impacted by the October price rise. Churn management is a major focus of the team in Australia, and we are investing to better utilize data and to predict in order for the business to be much more proactive with customized solutions through and win back. 
Capital expenditures related to new Foxtel was $139 million in the first half, which would have been down modestly had we consolidated Foxtel in the prior year. 
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong sales in general books with the release of Joanna Gaine's Homebody and The Next Person You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom, as well as Rachel Jalisco Wash your Face in Christian Publishing. Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $496 million and segment EBITDA increased 13% to $88 million, and both achieved record levels for Harper Columns. This growth came despite recent tighter supply conditions of both paper and bookbinding across the industry. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter, and represented 17% of consumer revenues, up from 16% last year. Downloadable audio again grew over 50%.
At the digital services segment, revenues increased 7% to $311 million, which was driven by strong organic growth and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions contributed $7 million to revenues while currency had a $13 million offset. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 10%.
REA Group revenues grew 6% or 13% in currency due to residential debt revenue growth in Australia, reflecting higher penetration for premium all and increased yield and modest contribution from the home track acquisition. We also saw an improvement in developer revenues. Revenue growth was partially offset by an overall 2% decline in new listing volume, which included a more pronounced decline in Sydney and lower media revenues. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 11% to $122 million versus prior year, helped by growth of its connection product and inclusion of the acquisition. Real estate revenues increased 23%, including Opcity. 
Revenue growth was partially offset by reduced display advertising to drive user experience and engagements, similar to last quarter. We also saw moderating growth in connection plus lead volume, partially impacted by the transferring of leads to Opcity as well as a more challenging U.S. housing market, including declines in existing home sales in the second quarter.
Average monthly unique users at were approximately 53 million for the quarter, rising 6% versus the prior year. On Opcity, we are very pleased with how the integration is going. The team at is focused on their extensive industry relationships to expand adoption of the new platform. We are using advanced AI, machine learning and algorithms to better match consumers with agents. We are taking advantage of the platforms to monetize consumer leads that in the past, have gone unsold or underutilized. 
Segment EBITDA rose 2% to $121 million. The quarter reflected additional cost at move related to the dish acquisition, including deferred compensation combined with continued reinvestment in product development. And on adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 12%. 
I would now like to mention a few things in fiscal third quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect higher class at Dow Jones in the third quarter to drive execution growth initiatives, including expansion into live event. In addition, we expect continued challenges at News America Marketing, mostly related to the FSI advertising. We will continue to seek cost efficiency to streamline the business. 
In Subscription Video Services, similar to the second quarter, when comparing with the prior year, we will have additional cost related to USD 25 million to USD 30 million and incremental marketing for Kayo Sports of USD 10 million to USD 15 million.
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable and we are encouraged by our upcoming releases together with the ongoing strong performance of our backlist. Some key this quarter includes Don't Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis, on the come up by Angie Thomas and We Are by Joanna Gaines. At Digital Real Estate Services, similar to Q2, we expect continued investment to drive revenue growth at .com and Opcity, including higher marketing and product development. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Both those of events could have some impact on business activity. But the underlying macro trends in Australia are positive. There has been something of the decline in the housing market. But that is, in some respects, welcome because it means that the rapid increases in property prices, which many analysts are unsustainable have indeed come to an end. And as in many countries, ensuring that there is enough aggressively priced property is not just an economic issue but a political issue, and one which is generating a lot of debate. So that trend of itself is efficacious. And News Australia and the team, led by mark Miller, is performing very well.

News Corp reported increased profitability and revenue growth during the first half of fiscal 2019, highlighting the power of premium content and authenticated audiences in a fact-changed world that craves credibility. For the second quarter",1179,"Thanks, Mike. News Corp reported increased profitability and revenue growth during the first half of fiscal 2019, highlighting the power of premium content and authenticated audiences in a fact-changed world that craves credibility. For the second quarter, the company saw 21% revenue growth and a 13% rise in total segment EBITDA, reflecting the consolidation of Foxtel and a healthy expansion of revenues at HarperCollins, Dow Jones and REA Group. 
More generally, at News and Information Services, we saw a continuation of positive trends in paid digital subscriptions and digital advertising in Australia and the U.S. where growth mitigated declines in print revenue. Even though our teams have been diligent in pursuing revenue opportunities, the digital world remains somewhat dysfunctional and subject to intensifying scrutiny. We are in a world of exponential e-evolution in which dominant players have the potential to manipulate markets for data, products, advertising, news and ideas. There is no doubt that some of these companies are arbitraging algorithmic ambiguity and hoping that regulators do not fully appreciate or define their dominance in certain sectors. 
When one company controls much of the U.S. consumer audio book market and has its own products in that market and can tweak its algorithm at will, the potential for abuse is almost limitless. It is clear that there has been a regulatory awakening, and the time has come for a regulatory reckoning. 
Turning now to our end businesses, which are certainly conscious of their responsibilities as custodians of customer data. It is clear that the ongoing digital transformation of Dow Jones is efficacious. Many traditional media companies are ailing, but that is certainly not the case of the Wall Street Journal, where paid digital subscribers grew 23% to over 1.7 million. Dow Jones overall has approximately 3.2 million total subscribers, 13% higher year-over-year.
Elsewhere in the Dow Jones family, MarketWatch saw strong gains this quarter, with visits up 45% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics, while Barron's grew its total subscribers 27% year-over-year. The professional information business at Dow Jones also continues to show progress, with Risk and Compliance reporting a 26% increase in revenues. There has now been in excess of 25% year-over-year revenue growth for 7 consecutive quarters.
At The Times in the U.K., print advertising revenues rose for the fifth consecutive quarter. The Times and Sunday Times saw solid growth in digital subscribers, while The Sun continues as the U.K.'s #1 news brand across print and digital combined, according to the latest PAMCO survey. 
Last month, we made an application to the U.K. government to allow a sensible sharing of resources and cost reduction across The Times and The Sunday Times. The editorial independence and uniqueness of these peerless publications will be protected. But there are clearly areas of cost duplication and we want to ensure the very best use of our financial and of our journalistic resources. 
Chris Evans, the gifted legendary writer/broadcaster, joined Wireless Group's Virgin Radio last month, and the audience growth has been remarkable. To put the impact and the potential in perspective, during the first day of Chris' show, Virgin Radio saw more app downloads for digital listening than in all of 2018. The breakfast program also deployed the unique sponsorship partners with Sky, so that the flow was not disrupted by conventional ad breaks. That model has already proven its worth and is likely to be replicated elsewhere on the radio roster. 
At News Australia, profitability improved, thanks to continued digital advertising growth and cost efficiencies. news.com.au was again the #1 news website, significantly ahead of its competitors, reaching almost 10 million unique users in the month of December according to Nielsen.
Meanwhile, The Australian, where digital paid subscriptions account for more than half of the total subscriber base, we saw strong digital subscription growth this quarter, up 23% year-over-year. 
Since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, we have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology. Average audiences across Fox Sports Australia channels are up over 70% year-over-year, with the addition of live cricket boosting viewership during the summer, traditionally, a relatively quiet period for customer acquisition. 
Our new sports streaming product, Kayo, has certainly changed the traditional trend. As of February 5, Kayo had attracted over 115,000 users, of which approximately 100,000 were paid. And we expect that number to increase markedly as we head into the peak selling season for the more popular winter sports, Australian Football and Rugby League.
It is clear in a competitive world of content that the passion for sport drives subscription growth, and Foxtel has, by far, the best collection of that cherished content.
In our Digital Real Estate Services segment, REA Group in Australia continues to outperform the competition, posting robust results despite a challenging listings environment, driven by strong residential growth and the inclusion of the Data Services business, which was not in the prior comparative period. The continued success of REA would not have been possible without the leadership of Tracey Fellows. She will be driving global expansion and seeking new opportunities for our fastest revenue growing segment in her new role as President of Global Digital Real Estate at News Corp. 
Since the creation of the new News Corp in 2013, Digital Real Estate Service revenues have more than tripled, and segment EBITDA has more than doubled. The appointment of Tracey underscores our increasing commitment to the sector. We are particularly pleased that Owen Wilson has become the new Chief Executive of REA where he's overseeing strategy, M&A and operations, all of which have thrived.
Turning to U.S. real estate. Our long-term optimism is undiminished, even as shorter-term trading in the property market has been somewhat sluggish. As evidence of the enduring strength of our business, real estate revenues at the operator of realtor.com, Move, Inc. were up 23% this quarter, with total revenues up 11%. This includes Opcity, the acquisition of which we successfully closed in October. Its strategic importance is evident in the higher quality value-added leads it provides with brokers about potential clients. 
Unlike a certain other company in the sector, we are not in the business of flagrantly flipping houses or covertly competing with our clients. Our aim is to provide the best possible service to buyers, sellers and realtors. 
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins delivered another outstanding performance this quarter, fostered by best-selling titles, such as Homebody by Joanna Gaines, and Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, both of whom are set to publish new titles in the current quarter. And in the U.K., also very successful was the Ice Monster by the irrepressible David Walliams. Digital sales also grew 12% on the prior year, driven by a 58% increase in the sales of audiobooks.
Our results this quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year demonstrate the power of our premium products and reflect our ongoing digital transformation, which is building a muscular platform for the future and for our investors. Now Susan will provide incisive insight into the finer details of our accounts."

And total segment EBITDA was $370 million, up 13% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues increased 3% and EBITDA increased 2%. 
For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.16 as compared to a loss of $0.14 in the prior year, which included a charge related to the U.S. tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter versus $0.24 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operation segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, down 3% versus the prior year. Currency had a $34 million negative impact, accounting for more than half the decline. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 4%; News U.K. declined 10%; News Australia declined 5%, although it was relatively stable in local currency; and News America Marketing fell 7%. Approximately 32% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year. 
Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 50% of segment revenues and were down 5% versus the prior year, with approximately $18 million or 2% being due to currency fluctuations. Second quarter advertising trends across our new businesses improved modestly from the prior quarter rate. 
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were flat with the prior year. Digital effort advertising revenues increased significantly both year-over-year and sequentially, offsetting print decline. The improvement was driven by strong programmatic growth resulting from audience going to MarketWatch. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 7% but down just 1% in local currency, again, showing moderating declines versus the prior quarter, with improvements in the rate of print declines and strong year-over-year gains in digital. 
On the digital front, we saw further expansion of news.com.au our national news portal and News Xtend, our small to medium business offering. News U.K. advertising fell 8% versus the prior year or down 4% in local currency, due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had challenging prior year comparisons. We saw modestly higher print advertising revenues at The Times. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, advertising revenues fell 7% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which included FSI product and lower install advertising revenues, which were partly impacted by the timing of product campaigns.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 1%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $12 million or 2%. We are continuing to see very healthy digital paid subscriber growth, which has been a core strategic focus and key to improved performance.
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%, benefiting from strong pay digital-only subscriber growth at The Wall Street Journal, which are up 23% year-over-year to over 1.7 million and an increase of 125,000 subscribers from the first quarter. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 67% of total subscribers at the Wall Street Journal, up from 60% last year.
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 22% to 269,000, and at News Australia, up 18% to over 460,000. In Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales offset print volume declines, while circulation revenues were down modestly in the U.K. 
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $120 million, down 15%, mainly driven by declines in the U.K. from lower revenues, including the exit of Sun Bets and higher expenses related to newsprint prices. However, we again had increased contribution at both Dow Jones and News Australia.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $562 million versus $120 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $84 million versus $33 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $69 million or 11% compared with the prior year, an improvement from the first quarter decrease of 17%. $39 million of the decline or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. 
Broadcast trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base, higher offer cost and mix shift to lower [indiscernible]. The subscription revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in Foxtel Now revenues. Broadcast ARPU was AUD 78, down about 3% versus the prior year, reflecting a 2% negative impact from the new revenue standard. Compared to the first quarter, broadcast ARPU was up over 2%, reflecting a price increase implemented on October 1.
Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $71 million or 46% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $26 million of costs related to Cricket Australia and about $9 million of marketing related to the commercial launch of Kayo Sports. This level of reinvestment was consistent with our expectations as we focus on better positioning Foxtel for future growth. 
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of December 31, up 4% against the prior year, driven by higher Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia. 
In terms of the subscriber mix, about 2.5 million subscribers were broadcast and commercial. The remainder were Foxtel now and Kayo Sports subscribers. We launched Kayo Sports in late November and are very pleased with the early adoption. As Robert mentioned, we had 115,000 subscribers as of February 5, of which approximately 100,000 were paid subscribers and expect to see it scale into the important winter sports selling season.
Pleasingly, the Kayo Sports user base is engaged with average viewing time per active user currently at 69 minutes per day with over 70% watching live video and smartphone being the primary device. 
In the second quarter, broadcast churn was 15.6% versus 14.5% in the prior year, which was mainly impacted by the October price rise. Churn management is a major focus for the team in Australia. And we are investing to better utilize data and advanced analytics to predict churn going forward in order for the business to be much more proactive with customized solutions through attention and win-back. 
Capital expenditures related to new Foxtel was $139 million in the first half, which would have been down modestly had we consolidated Foxtel in the prior year. At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong sales in general books with the release of Joanna Gaine's Homebody and The Next Person You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom as well as Rachel Hollis's Wash Your Face, in Christian Publishing. Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $496 million and segment EBITDA increased 13% to $88 million, and both achieved record levels for HarperCollins. This growth came despite recent tighter supply conditions for both paper and bookbinding across the industry. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter, and represented 17% of consumer revenues, up from 16% last year. Downloadable audio again grew over 50%.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 7% to $311 million, which was driven by strong organic growth and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by currency headwind. Acquisitions contributed $7 million to revenues while currency had a $13 million offset. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 10%.
REA Group revenues grew 6% or 13% in [ foreign ] currency due to residential depth revenue growth in Australia, reflecting higher penetration for premium all and increased yield and modest contribution from the Hometrack acquisition. We also saw an improvement in developer revenues. Revenue growth was partially offset by an overall 2% decline in new listing volume, which included a more pronounced decline in Sydney and lower media revenues. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 11% to $122 million versus prior year, helped by growth of its Connections Plus product and inclusion of the acquisition. Real estate revenues increased 23%, including Opcity. 
Revenue growth was partially offset by reduced display advertising to drive user experience and engagements, similar to last quarter. We also saw moderating growth in Connection Plus lead volume, partially impacted by the transferring of leads to Opcity as well as a more challenging U.S. housing market, including declines in existing home sales in the second quarter.
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 53 million for the quarter, rising 6% versus the prior year. On Opcity, we are very pleased with how the integration is going. The team at realtor is focused on leveraging their extensive industry relationships to expand adoption of the new platform. We are using advanced AI, machine learning and algorithms to better match consumers with agents. We are taking advantage of the Opcity platform to monetize consumer leads that in the past have gone unsold or underutilized. 
Segment EBITDA rose 2% to $121 million. The quarter reflected additional cost at Move related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation combined with continued reinvestment in product development. And on an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 12%. 
I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal third quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect higher cost at Dow Jones in the third quarter to drive execution growth initiatives, including expansion into live events. In addition, we expect continued challenges at News America Marketing, mostly related to the FSI advertising. We will continue to seek cost efficiency to streamline the business. 
In Subscription Video Services, similar to the second quarter, when comparing with the prior year, we will have additional cost related to Cricket of USD 25 million to USD 30 million and incremental marketing for Kayo Sports of USD 10 million to USD 15 million.
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable and we are encouraged by our upcoming releases together with the ongoing strong performance of our backlist. Some key titles this quarter includes: Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis; On the Come Up by Angie Thomas; and We Are Gardeners (sic) [ We Are The Gardeners ] by Joanna Gaines. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, similar to Q2, we expect continued reinvestment to drive revenue growth at realtor.com and Opcity, including higher marketing and product development. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

What one can definitively say is that we have 115,000 customers, around 100,000 paying. And that number has indeed been rising week-after-week in the 2 months since we launched. And indeed, we are on the cusp of the peak sport selling season, which is Aussie Rules and Rugby League as you know. It is beyond clear that sports events are crucially important in an age of confected, concocted content. And we have the events that matter in Australia for the next 4 or so years. That's an incontrovertible fact and an extraordinary asset. You can be platform-agnostic but you can't be content idealistic. Of course, there is more churn when you increase prices as we did late last year. But what we are absolutely not seeing is massive spin-down to Kayo from premium subscribers. The fact is that the earlier versions of the IQ box were inadequate, and the current version is much more sophisticated and satisfying. The iQ4 really does go to show that the higher the IQ, the better."

There are 2 events upcoming, a state election in New South Wales and a federal election, the lot to be held in May in Australia. Both those events could have some impact on business activity. But the underlying macro trends in Australia are positive. There has been something of the decline in the housing market. But that is, in some respects, welcome because it means that the rapid increases in property prices, which many analysts thought were unsustainable have indeed come to an end. And as in many countries, ensuring that there is enough excessively priced property is not just an economic issue but a political issue and one which is generating a lot of debate. So that trend of itself is efficacious. And News Australia and the team led by Mike Miller, is -- are performing very well.

News Corp reported increased profitability and revenue growth during the first half of fiscal 2019, highlighting the power of premium content and authenticated audiences in a fact-challenged world that craves credibility. For the second quarter, the company saw 21% revenue growth and a 13% rise in total segment EBITDA, reflecting the consolidation of Foxtel and a healthy expansion of revenues at HarperCollins, Dow Jones and REA Group. 
More generally, at News and Information Services, we saw a continuation of positive trends in paid digital subscriptions and digital advertising in Australia and the U.S., where growth mitigated declines in print revenue. Even though our teams have been diligent in pursuing revenue opportunities, the digital world remains somewhat dysfunctional and subject to intensifying scrutiny. We are in a world of exponential e-evolution in which dominant players have the potential to manipulate markets for data, products, advertising, news and ideas. There is no doubt that some of these companies are arbitraging algorithmic ambiguity and hoping that regulators do not fully appreciate or define their dominance in certain sectors. 
When one company controls much of the U.S. consumer audio book market and has its own products in that market and can tweak its algorithm at will, the potential for abuse is almost limitless. It is clear that there has been a regulatory awakening, and the time has come for a regulatory reckoning. 
Turning now to our own businesses, which are certainly conscious of their responsibilities as custodians of customer data. It is clear that the ongoing digital transformation of Dow Jones is efficacious. Many traditional media companies are ailing, but that is certainly not the case at the Wall Street Journal, where paid digital subscribers grew 23% to over 1.7 million. Dow Jones overall has approximately 3.2 million total subscribers, 13% higher year-over-year.
Elsewhere in the Dow Jones family, MarketWatch saw strong gains this quarter, with visits up 45% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics, while Barron's grew its total subscribers 27% year-over-year. The professional information business at Dow Jones also continues to show progress, with Risk and Compliance reporting a 26% increase in revenues. There has now been in excess of 25% year-over-year revenue growth for 7 consecutive quarters.
At The Times in the U.K., print advertising revenues rose for the fifth consecutive quarter. The Times and Sunday Times saw solid growth in digital subscribers, while The Sun continues as the U.K.'s #1 news brand across print and digital combined, according to the latest PAMCo survey. 
Last month, we made an application to the U.K. government to allow a sensible sharing of resources and cost reduction across The Times and The Sunday Times. The editorial independence and uniqueness of these peerless publications will be protected. But there are clearly areas of cost duplication and we want to ensure the very best use of our financial and of our journalistic resources. 
Chris Evans, the gifted legendary writer/broadcaster, joined Wireless Group's Virgin Radio last month, and the audience growth has been remarkable. To put the impact and the potential in perspective, during the first day of Chris' show, Virgin Radio saw more app downloads for digital listening than in all of 2018. The breakfast program also deployed the unique sponsorship partners with Sky, so that the flow was not disrupted by conventional ad breaks. That model has already proven its worth and is likely to be replicated elsewhere on the radio roster. 
At News Australia, profitability improved, thanks to continued digital advertising growth and cost efficiencies. news.com.au was again the #1 news website, significantly ahead of its competitors, reaching almost 10 million unique users in the month of December according to Nielsen.
Meanwhile, The Australian, where digital paid subscriptions account for more than half of the total subscriber base, we saw strong digital subscription growth this quarter, up 23% year-over-year. 
Since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, we have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology. Average audiences across Fox Sports Australia channels are up over 70% year-over-year, with the addition of live cricket boosting viewership during the summer, traditionally, a relatively quiet period for customer acquisition. 
Our new sports streaming product, Kayo, has certainly changed the traditional trend. As of February 5, Kayo had attracted over 115,000 users, of which approximately 100,000 were paid. And we expect that number to increase markedly as we head into the peak selling season for the more popular winter sports, Australian Football and Rugby League.
It is clear in a competitive world of content that the passion for sport drives subscription growth, and Foxtel has, by far, the best collection of that cherished content.
In our Digital Real Estate Services segment, REA Group in Australia continues to outperform the competition, posting robust results despite a challenging listings environment, driven by strong residential growth and the inclusion of the Data Services business, which was not in the prior comparative period. The continued success of REA would not have been possible without the leadership of Tracey Fellows. She will be driving global expansion and seeking new opportunities for our fastest revenue growing segment in her new role as President of Global Digital Real Estate at News Corp. 
Since the creation of the new News Corp in 2013, Digital Real Estate Service revenues have more than tripled, and segment EBITDA has more than doubled. The appointment of Tracey underscores our increasing commitment to the sector. We are particularly pleased that Owen Wilson has become the new Chief Executive of REA where he's overseeing strategy, M&A and operations, all of which have thrived.
Turning to U.S. real estate. Our long-term optimism is undiminished, even as shorter-term trading in the property market has been somewhat sluggish. As evidence of the enduring strength of our business, real estate revenues at the operator of realtor.com, Move, Inc. were up 23% this quarter, with total revenues up 11%. This includes Opcity, the acquisition of which we successfully closed in October. Its strategic importance is evident in the higher quality value-added leads it provides with brokers about potential clients. 
Unlike a certain other company in the sector, we are not in the business of flagrantly flipping houses or covertly competing with our clients. Our aim is to provide the best possible service to buyers, sellers and realtors. 
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins delivered another outstanding performance this quarter, fostered by best-selling titles, such as Homebody by Joanna Gaines, and Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, both of whom are set to publish new titles in the current quarter. And in the U.K., also very successful was the Ice Monster by the irrepressible David Walliams. Digital sales also grew 12% on the prior year, driven by a 58% increase in the sales of audiobooks.
Our results this quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year demonstrate the power of our premium products and reflect our ongoing digital transformation, which is building a muscular platform for the future and for our investors. Now Susan will provide incisive insight into the finer details of our accounts."

And total segment EBITDA was $370 million, up 13% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues increased 3% and EBITDA increased 2%. 
For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.16 as compared to a loss of $0.14 in the prior year, which included a charge related to the U.S. tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter versus $0.24 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operation segments: In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, down 3% versus the prior year. Currency had a $34 million negative impact, accounting for more than half the decline. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 4%; News U.K. declined 10%; News Australia declined 5%, although it was relatively stable in local currency; and News America Marketing fell 7%. Approximately 32% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year. 
Moving on to the segment highlights: Advertising revenues accounted for 50% of segment revenues and were down 5% versus the prior year, with approximately $18 million or 2% being due to currency fluctuations. Second quarter advertising trends across our new businesses improved modestly from the prior quarter rate. 
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were flat with the prior year. Digital effort advertising revenues increased significantly both year-over-year and sequentially, offsetting print decline. The improvement was driven by strong programmatic growth resulting from audience going to MarketWatch. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 7% but down just 1% in local currency, again, showing moderating declines versus the prior quarter, with improvements in the rate of print declines and strong year-over-year gains in digital. 
On the digital front, we saw further expansion of news.com.au, our national news portal and News Xtend, our small to medium business offering. News U.K. advertising fell 8% versus the prior year or down 4% in local currency, due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had challenging prior year comparisons. We saw modestly higher print advertising revenues at The Times. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, advertising revenues fell 7% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which included FSI product and lower in-store advertising revenues, which were partly impacted by the timing of product campaigns.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 1%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $12 million or 2%. We are continuing to see very healthy digital paid subscriber growth, which has been a core strategic focus and key to improved performance.
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%, benefiting from strong pay digital-only subscriber growth at The Wall Street Journal, which are up 23% year-over-year to over 1.7 million and an increase of 125,000 subscribers from the first quarter. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 67% of total subscribers at the Wall Street Journal, up from 60% last year.
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 22% to 269,000, and at News Australia, up 18% to over 460,000. In Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales offset print volume declines, while circulation revenues were down modestly in the U.K. 
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $120 million, down 15%, mainly driven by declines in the U.K. from lower revenues, including the exit of Sun Bets and higher expenses related to newsprint prices. However, we again had increased contribution at both Dow Jones and News Australia.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $562 million versus $120 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $84 million versus $33 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $69 million or 11% compared with the prior year, an improvement from the first quarter decrease of 17%. $39 million of the decline or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. 
Broadcast trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base, higher offer cost and mix shift to lower [ products ]. The subscription revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in Foxtel Now revenues. Broadcast ARPU was AUD 78, down about 3% versus the prior year, reflecting a 2% negative impact from the new revenue standard. Compared to the first quarter, broadcast ARPU was up over 2%, reflecting a price increase implemented on October 1.
Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $71 million or 46% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $26 million of costs related to Cricket Australia and about $9 million of marketing related to the commercial launch of Kayo Sports. This level of reinvestment was consistent with our expectations as we focus on better positioning Foxtel for future growth. 
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of December 31, up 4% against the prior year, driven by higher Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia. 
In terms of the subscriber mix, about 2.5 million subscribers were broadcast and commercial. The remainder were Foxtel now and Kayo Sports subscribers. We launched Kayo Sports in late November and are very pleased with the early adoption. As Robert mentioned, we had 115,000 subscribers as of February 5, of which approximately 100,000 were paid subscribers and expect to see it scale into the important winter sports selling season.
Pleasingly, the Kayo Sports user base is engaged with average viewing time per active user currently at 69 minutes per day, with over 70% watching live video and smartphone being the primary device. 
In the second quarter, broadcast churn was 15.6% versus 14.5% in the prior year, which was mainly impacted by the October price rise. Churn management is a major focus for the team in Australia. And we are investing to better utilize data and advanced analytics to predict churn going forward in order for the business to be much more proactive with customized solutions through attention and win-back. 
Capital expenditures related to new Foxtel was $139 million in the first half, which would have been down modestly had we consolidated Foxtel in the prior year. At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong sales in general books with the release of Joanna Gaine's Homebody and The Next Person You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom as well as Rachel Hollis's Wash Your Face, in Christian Publishing. Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $496 million and segment EBITDA increased 13% to $88 million, and both achieved record levels for HarperCollins. This growth came despite recent tighter supply conditions for both paper and bookbinding across the industry. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter, and represented 17% of consumer revenues, up from 16% last year. Downloadable audio again grew over 50%.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 7% to $311 million, which was driven by strong organic growth and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions contributed $7 million to revenues while currency had a $13 million offset. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 10%.
REA Group revenues grew 6% or 13% in [ foreign ] currency due to residential depth revenue growth in Australia, reflecting higher penetration for Premiere All and increased yield and modest contribution from the Hometrack acquisition. We also saw an improvement in developer revenues. Revenue growth was partially offset by an overall 2% decline in new listing volume, which included a more pronounced decline in Sydney and lower media revenues. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 11% to $122 million versus prior year, helped by growth of its Connections Plus product and inclusion of the acquisition. Real estate revenues increased 23%, including Opcity. 
Revenue growth was partially offset by reduced display advertising to drive user experience and engagements, similar to last quarter. We also saw moderating growth in Connection Plus lead volume, partially impacted by the transferring of leads to Opcity as well as a more challenging U.S. housing market, including declines in existing home sales in the second quarter.
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 53 million for the quarter, rising 6% versus the prior year. On Opcity, we are very pleased with how the integration is going. The team at realtor is focused on leveraging their extensive industry relationships to expand adoption of the new platform. We are using advanced AI, machine learning and algorithms to better match consumers with agents. We are taking advantage of the Opcity platform to monetize consumer leads that in the past have gone unsold or underutilized. 
Segment EBITDA rose 2% to $121 million. The quarter reflected additional cost at Move related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation, combined with continued reinvestment in product development. And on an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 12%. 
I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal third quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect higher cost at Dow Jones in the third quarter to drive execution growth initiatives, including expansion into live events. In addition, we expect continued challenges at News America Marketing, mostly related to the FSI advertising. We will continue to seek cost efficiency to streamline the business. 
In Subscription Video Services, similar to the second quarter, when comparing with the prior year, we will have additional costs related to Cricket of USD 25 million to USD 30 million and incremental marketing for Kayo Sports of USD 10 million to USD 15 million.
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable and we are encouraged by our upcoming releases, together with the ongoing strong performance of our backlist. Some key titles this quarter includes: Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis; On the Come Up by Angie Thomas; and We Are Gardeners (sic) [ We Are The Gardeners ] by Joanna Gaines. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, similar to Q2, we expect continued reinvestment to drive revenue growth at realtor.com and Opcity, including higher marketing and product development. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And indeed, we are on the cusp of the peak sport selling season, which is Aussie Rules and Rugby League as you know. It is beyond clear that sports events are crucially important in an age of confected, concocted content. And we have the events that matter in Australia for the next 4 or so years. That's an incontrovertible fact and an extraordinary asset. You can be platform-agnostic but you can't be content-ideaistic. Of course, there is more churn when you increase prices as we did late last year. But what we are absolutely not seeing is massive spin-down to Kayo from premium subscribers. The fact is that the earlier versions of the IQ Box were inadequate, and the current version is much more sophisticated and satisfying. The iQ4 really does go to show that the higher the IQ, the better."

For the second quar",1179,"Thanks, Mike. News Corp reported increased profitability and revenue growth during the first half of fiscal 2019, highlighting the power of premium content and authenticated audiences in a fact-challenged world that craves credibility. For the second quarter, the company saw 21% revenue growth and a 13% rise in total segment EBITDA, reflecting the consolidation of Foxtel and a healthy expansion of revenues at HarperCollins, Dow Jones and REA Group. 
More generally, at News and Information Services, we saw a continuation of positive trends in paid digital subscriptions and digital advertising in Australia and the U.S., where growth mitigated declines in print revenue. Even though our teams have been diligent in pursuing revenue opportunities, the digital world remains somewhat dysfunctional and subject to intensifying scrutiny. We are in a world of exponential e-evolution in which dominant players have the potential to manipulate markets for data, products, advertising, news and ideas. There is no doubt that some of these companies are arbitraging algorithmic ambiguity and hoping that regulators do not fully appreciate or define their dominance in certain sectors. 
When one company controls much of the U.S. consumer audio book market and has its own products in that market and can tweak its algorithm at will, the potential for abuse is almost limitless. It is clear that there has been a regulatory awakening, and the time has come for a regulatory reckoning. 
Turning now to our own businesses, which are certainly conscious of their responsibilities as custodians of customer data. It is clear that the ongoing digital transformation of Dow Jones is efficacious. Many traditional media companies are ailing, but that is certainly not the case at the Wall Street Journal, where paid digital subscribers grew 23% to over 1.7 million. Dow Jones overall has approximately 3.2 million total subscribers, 13% higher year-over-year.
Elsewhere in the Dow Jones family, MarketWatch saw strong gains this quarter, with visits up 45% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics, while Barron's grew its total subscribers 27% year-over-year. The professional information business at Dow Jones also continues to show progress, with Risk and Compliance reporting a 26% increase in revenues. There has now been in excess of 25% year-over-year revenue growth for 7 consecutive quarters.
At The Times in the U.K., print advertising revenues rose for the fifth consecutive quarter. The Times and Sunday Times saw solid growth in digital subscribers, while The Sun continues as the U.K.'s #1 news brand across print and digital combined, according to the latest PAMCo survey. 
Last month, we made an application to the U.K. government to allow a sensible sharing of resources and cost reduction across The Times and The Sunday Times. The editorial independence and uniqueness of these peerless publications will be protected. But there are clearly areas of cost duplication and we want to ensure the very best use of our financial and of our journalistic resources. 
Chris Evans, the gifted legendary writer/broadcaster, joined Wireless Group's Virgin Radio last month, and the audience growth has been remarkable. To put the impact and the potential in perspective, during the first day of Chris' show, Virgin Radio saw more app downloads for digital listening than in all of 2018. The breakfast program also deployed the unique sponsorship partners with Sky, so that the flow was not disrupted by conventional ad breaks. That model has already proven its worth and is likely to be replicated elsewhere on the radio roster. 
At News Australia, profitability improved, thanks to continued digital advertising growth and cost efficiencies. news.com.au was again the #1 news website, significantly ahead of its competitors, reaching almost 10 million unique users in the month of December according to Nielsen.
Meanwhile, The Australian, where digital paid subscriptions account for more than half of the total subscriber base, we saw strong digital subscription growth this quarter, up 23% year-over-year. 
Since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, we have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology. Average audiences across Fox Sports Australia channels are up over 70% year-over-year, with the addition of live cricket boosting viewership during the summer, traditionally, a relatively quiet period for customer acquisition. 
Our new sports streaming product, Kayo, has certainly changed the traditional trend. As of February 5, Kayo had attracted over 115,000 users, of which approximately 100,000 were paid. And we expect that number to increase markedly as we head into the peak selling season for the more popular winter sports, Australian Football and Rugby League.
It is clear in a competitive world of content that the passion for sport drives subscription growth, and Foxtel has, by far, the best collection of that cherished content.
In our Digital Real Estate Services segment, REA Group in Australia continues to outperform the competition, posting robust results despite a challenging listings environment, driven by strong residential growth and the inclusion of the Data Services business, which was not in the prior comparative period. The continued success of REA would not have been possible without the leadership of Tracey Fellows. She will be driving global expansion and seeking new opportunities for our fastest revenue growing segment in her new role as President of Global Digital Real Estate at News Corp. 
Since the creation of the new News Corp in 2013, Digital Real Estate Service revenues have more than tripled, and segment EBITDA has more than doubled. The appointment of Tracey underscores our increasing commitment to the sector. We are particularly pleased that Owen Wilson has become the new Chief Executive of REA where he's overseeing strategy, M&A and operations, all of which have thrived.
Turning to U.S. real estate. Our long-term optimism is undiminished, even as shorter-term trading in the property market has been somewhat sluggish. As evidence of the enduring strength of our business, real estate revenues at the operator of realtor.com, Move, Inc. were up 23% this quarter, with total revenues up 11%. This includes Opcity, the acquisition of which we successfully closed in October. Its strategic importance is evident in the higher quality value-added leads it provides with brokers about potential clients. 
Unlike a certain other company in the sector, we are not in the business of flagrantly flipping houses or covertly competing with our clients. Our aim is to provide the best possible service to buyers, sellers and realtors. 
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins delivered another outstanding performance this quarter, fostered by best-selling titles, such as Homebody by Joanna Gaines, and Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, both of whom are set to publish new titles in the current quarter. And in the U.K., also very successful was the Ice Monster by the irrepressible David Walliams. Digital sales also grew 12% on the prior year, driven by a 58% increase in the sales of audiobooks.
Our results this quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year demonstrate the power of our premium products and reflect our ongoing digital transformation, which is building a muscular platform for the future and for our investors. Now Susan will provide incisive insight into the finer details of our accounts."

Results reflect the impact of the consol",1787,"Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2019 second quarter total revenues were over $2.6 billion, up 21% versus the prior year. And total segment EBITDA was $370 million, up 13% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues increased 3% and EBITDA increased 2%. 
For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.16 as compared to a loss of $0.14 in the prior year, which included a charge related to the U.S. tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter versus $0.24 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operation segments: In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, down 3% versus the prior year. Currency had a $34 million negative impact, accounting for more than half the decline. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 4%; News U.K. declined 10%; News Australia declined 5%, although it was relatively stable in local currency; and News America Marketing fell 7%. Approximately 32% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year. 
Moving on to the segment highlights: Advertising revenues accounted for 50% of segment revenues and were down 5% versus the prior year, with approximately $18 million or 2% being due to currency fluctuations. Second quarter advertising trends across our new businesses improved modestly from the prior quarter rate. 
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were flat with the prior year. Digital effort advertising revenues increased significantly both year-over-year and sequentially, offsetting print decline. The improvement was driven by strong programmatic growth resulting from audience going to MarketWatch. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 7% but down just 1% in local currency, again, showing moderating declines versus the prior quarter, with improvements in the rate of print declines and strong year-over-year gains in digital. 
On the digital front, we saw further expansion of news.com.au, our national news portal and News Xtend, our small to medium business offering. News U.K. advertising fell 8% versus the prior year or down 4% in local currency, due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had challenging prior year comparisons. We saw modestly higher print advertising revenues at The Times. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, advertising revenues fell 7% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which included FSI product and lower in-store advertising revenues, which were partly impacted by the timing of product campaigns.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 1%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $12 million or 2%. We are continuing to see very healthy digital paid subscriber growth, which has been a core strategic focus and key to improved performance.
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%, benefiting from strong pay digital-only subscriber growth at The Wall Street Journal, which are up 23% year-over-year to over 1.7 million and an increase of 125,000 subscribers from the first quarter. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 67% of total subscribers at the Wall Street Journal, up from 60% last year.
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 22% to 269,000, and at News Australia, up 18% to over 460,000. In Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales offset print volume declines, while circulation revenues were down modestly in the U.K. 
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $120 million, down 15%, mainly driven by declines in the U.K. from lower revenues, including the exit of Sun Bets and higher expenses related to newsprint prices. However, we again had increased contribution at both Dow Jones and News Australia.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $562 million versus $120 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $84 million versus $33 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $69 million or 11% compared with the prior year, an improvement from the first quarter decrease of 17%. $39 million of the decline or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. 
Broadcast trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base, higher offer cost and mix shift to lower [ products ]. The subscription revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in Foxtel Now revenues. Broadcast ARPU was AUD 78, down about 3% versus the prior year, reflecting a 2% negative impact from the new revenue standard. Compared to the first quarter, broadcast ARPU was up over 2%, reflecting a price increase implemented on October 1.
Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $71 million or 46% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $26 million of costs related to Cricket Australia and about $9 million of marketing related to the commercial launch of Kayo Sports. This level of reinvestment was consistent with our expectations as we focus on better positioning Foxtel for future growth. 
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of December 31, up 4% against the prior year, driven by higher Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia. 
In terms of the subscriber mix, about 2.5 million subscribers were broadcast and commercial. The remainder were Foxtel now and Kayo Sports subscribers. We launched Kayo Sports in late November and are very pleased with the early adoption. As Robert mentioned, we had 115,000 subscribers as of February 5, of which approximately 100,000 were paid subscribers and expect to see it scale into the important winter sports selling season.
Pleasingly, the Kayo Sports user base is engaged with average viewing time per active user currently at 69 minutes per day, with over 70% watching live video and smartphone being the primary device. 
In the second quarter, broadcast churn was 15.6% versus 14.5% in the prior year, which was mainly impacted by the October price rise. Churn management is a major focus for the team in Australia. And we are investing to better utilize data and advanced analytics to predict churn going forward in order for the business to be much more proactive with customized solutions through attention and win-back. 
Capital expenditures related to new Foxtel was $139 million in the first half, which would have been down modestly had we consolidated Foxtel in the prior year. At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong sales in general books with the release of Joanna Gaine's Homebody and The Next Person You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom as well as Rachel Hollis's Wash Your Face, in Christian Publishing. Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $496 million and segment EBITDA increased 13% to $88 million, and both achieved record levels for HarperCollins. This growth came despite recent tighter supply conditions for both paper and bookbinding across the industry. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter, and represented 17% of consumer revenues, up from 16% last year. Downloadable audio again grew over 50%.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 7% to $311 million, which was driven by strong organic growth and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions contributed $7 million to revenues while currency had a $13 million offset. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 10%.
REA Group revenues grew 6% or 13% in [ foreign ] currency due to residential depth revenue growth in Australia, reflecting higher penetration for Premiere All and increased yield and modest contribution from the Hometrack acquisition. We also saw an improvement in developer revenues. Revenue growth was partially offset by an overall 2% decline in new listing volume, which included a more pronounced decline in Sydney and lower media revenues. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 11% to $122 million versus prior year, helped by growth of its Connections Plus product and inclusion of the acquisition. Real estate revenues increased 23%, including Opcity. 
Revenue growth was partially offset by reduced display advertising to drive user experience and engagements, similar to last quarter. We also saw moderating growth in Connection Plus lead volume, partially impacted by the transferring of leads to Opcity as well as a more challenging U.S. housing market, including declines in existing home sales in the second quarter.
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 53 million for the quarter, rising 6% versus the prior year. On Opcity, we are very pleased with how the integration is going. The team at realtor is focused on leveraging their extensive industry relationships to expand adoption of the new platform. We are using advanced AI, machine learning and algorithms to better match consumers with agents. We are taking advantage of the Opcity platform to monetize consumer leads that in the past have gone unsold or underutilized. 
Segment EBITDA rose 2% to $121 million. The quarter reflected additional cost at Move related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation, combined with continued reinvestment in product development. And on an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 12%. 
I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal third quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect higher cost at Dow Jones in the third quarter to drive execution growth initiatives, including expansion into live events. In addition, we expect continued challenges at News America Marketing, mostly related to the FSI advertising. We will continue to seek cost efficiency to streamline the business. 
In Subscription Video Services, similar to the second quarter, when comparing with the prior year, we will have additional costs related to Cricket of USD 25 million to USD 30 million and incremental marketing for Kayo Sports of USD 10 million to USD 15 million.
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable and we are encouraged by our upcoming releases, together with the ongoing strong performance of our backlist. Some key titles this quarter includes: Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis; On the Come Up by Angie Thomas; and We Are Gardeners (sic) [ We Are The Gardeners ] by Joanna Gaines. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, similar to Q2, we expect continued reinvestment to drive revenue growth at realtor.com and Opcity, including higher marketing and product development. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

As for professional content, in their clotted world, there are companies who want to incorporate Dow Jones content in their workflow. And that is happening at pace. To be honest, our advertising needed work, and we have a new ad team at Dow Jones and that team is certainly making a positive difference. Digital ads at Dow Jones are up 15%.

And indeed, we are on the cusp of the peak sport selling season, which is Aussie Rules and Rugby League as you know. It is beyond clear that sports events are crucially important in an age of confected, concocted content. And we have the events that matter in Australia for the next 4 or so years. That's an incontrovertible fact and an extraordinary asset. You can be platform-agnostic but you can't be content-idealistic. Of course, there is more churn when you increase prices as we did late last year. But what we are absolutely not seeing is massive spin-down to Kayo from premium subscribers. The fact is that the earlier versions of the IQ Box were inadequate, and the current version is much more sophisticated and satisfying.

News Corp reaped rewards from our digital strategy this quarter, underscored by a robust rise in digital subscriptions across our media properties, a sharp increase in digital audiobook sales and continued expansion at our digital real estate businesses despite volatile conditions in property markets.
In the third quarter, the company saw 17% revenue growth to nearly $2.5 billion, reported net income of $23 million versus a $1.1 billion net loss in the prior year and there was a 36% increase in total segment EBITDA. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel and, among other things, another distinguished performance by HarperCollins. For the 9 months to the end of March, our revenues were 20% higher and profitability was 29% higher.
Turning first to the News and Information Services segment, where Dow Jones continues to expand its national and global digital reach. We have recently entered into a partnership with Apple, which is at an early stage. But the initial signs are encouraging both in terms of reaching new audiences and the strength of engagement with the Wall Street Journal in the new app. The Journal is the most trusted masthead in America and that value can be seen in its results this quarter. With paid digital-only subscribers of the Journal growing to nearly 1.8 million, reflecting 19% growth. In total, 68% of subscribers are now digital-only.
Equally as significant, in the last quarter, about 55% of circulation revenues at Dow Jones were digital and we believe there is undoubted potential for future growth. In addition to The Journal, other noteworthy Dow Jones properties include Barron's and MarketWatch. At MarketWatch, audience expanded 13% in the first 9 months to approximately 30 million average monthly unique users and revenue rose 13%. Barron's subscribers grew over 20% in the quarter compared to the prior year, approaching 600,000. And its success continued in April with Barron's breaking its all-time audience record by achieving, for the first time, a combined total audience of 10 million print and digital users.
We are also expanding the successful Dow Jones Professional Information Business where Risk and Compliance reported 22% growth in revenues. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of 20% or more year-over-year growth in that business. It is worth noting that at the time of the separation of News Corp in 2013, annual revenues of Risk and Compliance were at $31 million. We expect that number to more than quadruple by the end of fiscal 2019 to around $130 million.
We believe that Dow Jones is uniquely able to provide Risk and Compliance services in an area of significant expected growth. In fact, a market research firm recently valued the global risk and compliance market last year at nearly $28 billion and forecast that it would expand to some $65 billion by 2025. 
Dow Jones robust Live Events business continues to expand across sectors and around the world with the Wall Street Journal CEO Council set to meet in London and Tokyo this month and the acclaimed Future of Everything Festival launching here in New York City on May 20.
At News UK, we also saw continued gains in print circulation market share across all titles. And at The Sun, digital traffic improved sequentially with 84 million global monthly users as of March and digital advertising revenue accelerated. The Times and The Sunday Times saw another quarter of strong digital subscriber growth at 24% to 286,000 and now have in total 527,000 subscribers. In the wake of the recent favorable ruling by the U.K. government that will allow sharing of resources at The Times and The Sunday Times, we look forward to further efficiencies in their operations even as their editorial independence remains sacrosanct.
At News Corp Australia, digital subscription growth and heightened cost consciousness rounded out another solid quarter despite a choppy advertising market. News Australia remains the largest print and digital publisher in Australia with news.com.au still the #1 news website, significantly ahead of its rivals with an audience of over 10 million uniques in March. News Corp Australia is looking forward to achieving 500,000 digital subscribers in the coming weeks.
In the Subscription Video Services segment, Foxtel demonstrated its strength. Demand for the iQ4 set-top box launched earlier this fiscal year has exceeded expectation and now serves 43% of our broadcast base. This is important not only because the customer experience is materially better but because iQ4 customers have, on average, a higher build ARPU with lower churn. And while broadcast churn was elevated last quarter at 17.7% impacted by a recent price rise, we saw a notable improvement in March and in April when churn fell to 16% then 15%, respectively. We are confident that the renewed focus on churn and loyalty should continue that trend.
Obviously, we have been investing in streaming with platform development and marketing costs as well as leveraging existing sports rights. Our new sports streaming product, Kayo Sports, has already amassed more than 239,000 users since its launch late last year with more than 209,000 paid subscribers as of May 8. This growth reflects the sophistication of the technology and the strength of the exclusive sporting rights we have acquired.
It is clear that the Kayo subscriber base is engaged, consuming an average of over 7 hours of content per week. And while it is early days, cannibalization of the core broadcast product appears to be de minimis. Kayo is reaching a new audience and maximizing avail of our existing sports rights. We're excited about the upcoming Cricket World Cup, which Kayo has the right to and look forward to maintaining the momentum at Kayo Sports.
We keenly anticipate the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's next-generation set-top box, which will herald the start of Foxtel aggregating other services. Along with a new user interface later this calendar year, this will create a unified content search experience for our customers and strengthen our position in the market as providers of the broadest range of original and sports programming. 
Meanwhile, the success of the new season of Game of Thrones is attracting record audiences in Australia and demonstrates the power of our platform. As a result, we have seen the acceleration of Foxtel Now sales since quarter end with more than 567,000 subscribers as of May 8 and more than 505,000 of those paying subscribers. The opening episode of the final season garnered 962,000 broadcast viewers overnight on Foxtel in Australia, up 17% on the season premiere in 2017. That's in addition to the total premiere day audience of 333,000 who streamed it live or on demand across Foxtel Now and Foxtel Go.
The investment in streaming is starting to pay off. In the aggregate, with Kayo and Foxtel Now, total OTT subscribers at Foxtel increased more than 80% since the beginning of this calendar year to more than 714,000 paying subscribers. Driven by the strong growth of OTT, our closing subscribers as of April 30 totaled approximately 3.1 million as compared to almost 2.8 million in the prior year. 
Turning to Digital Real Estate Services. REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite a soft listing environment and currency headwinds, that is a weak Australian dollar. The housing market was also challenging in the U.S. but at Move, home of realtor.com, real estate revenues, which account for 79% of total Move revenues, rose 14%. Overall, Move revenues grew 5% as we have consciously reduced our advertising inventory to improve the user experience but are able to increase that ratio according to market conditions.
Speaking of those conditions, there are clear signs that the U.S. housing market is strengthening, with lower mortgage rates, strong economic growth and significant increases in personal disposable income. As realtor.com's chief economist noted, positive indicators foreshadow a potential strengthening of home sales in the months to come. This has been reinforced by record traffic at realtor.com in April, up 7% from the prior year to over 69 million uniques, leading to 209 million visits. 
Also, the impact of those improving conditions were seen in the most recent new home sales figures. In March, new home sales rose 4.5% from the prior year to 692,000, the highest level since November 2017. New contracts in March were up 4%. Based on March data from comScore, realtor.com has a greater number of visits per visitor compared to the competition, with more pages viewed and more time spent on the site. So not only does realtor.com have the most complete and up-to-date for-sale listings in the industry, it also has the best level of engagement with its audience.
Likewise, we remain confident in the strategic importance of our recent acquisition of Opcity, which leverages applied analytics and machine learning to quickly match consumers with the right real estate professional. The ability to generate high-quality consumer leads for realtors through Opcity provides a new outlet to sustain revenue growth. This acquisition will involve some investment to increase capacity but it is an investment in future growth.
We recently expanded Opcity to a number of test markets, offering an exclusive performance-based experience to consumers and the industry. We believe that providing higher-quality leads to realtors is part of the changing U.S. property market and will result in higher-quality returns for realtor.com. There is still much potential for growth in the sector, which is at a relatively early stage of digital development. And we expect the sectoral and cyclical wins to be more favorable over the coming year.
Turning to Book Publishing. HarperCollins once again delivered an impressive performance this quarter, with standout hits in our Christian division from best-selling author Rachel Hollis, whose previous title Girl, Wash Your Face has already sold over 3 million units and her latest, Girl, Stop Apologizing, shipped another 1 million. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5%, which included 32% growth in downloadable audiobooks. Digital in the aggregate represented 21% of consumer revenues this quarter. Meanwhile, the HarperCollins backlist contributed approximately 63% of consumer revenues in the quarter.
HarperCollins has been strengthening its reach in the U.S. book buying heartland. It is peerless in commissioning new authors, in its savvy editing and in its first-class marketing for best-in-class books. One recent example of the success of the strategy is the latest book from Joanna Gaines, We are the Gardeners. And Ben Shapiro's book, The Right Side of History, is now our bestseller in print and e-book. These successes enhance the bottom line with a 12.6% segment EBITDA margin in the quarter compared to 10.3% in the prior year.
Prospects with News Corp are certainly positive, given the performance thus far in this fiscal year, which is a direct result of the strategic and digital initiatives across our businesses. There is no doubt that the content landscape is changing and that we are seeing more people prepared to pay more for trusted news and innovative entertainment delivered efficiently, seamlessly to their mobile phone or home devices.
For more details on this quarter's results, I now turn to Susan Panuccio."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenues were nearly $2.5 billion, up 17% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $247 million, up 36% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 2% and EBITDA decreased 4%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.02 as compared to a loss of $1.94 in the prior year, which included a noncash write-down related to Foxtel as well as noncash impairment charges at News America Marketing and FOX SPORTS Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.06 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $52 million or 4% negative impact and was responsible for most of the decline. Approximately 31% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year.
Advertising revenues for the segment accounted for 48% of segment revenues and were down 9% versus the prior year with approximately $23 million or 4% due to negative currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 44% of segment revenues, were relatively flat versus the prior year, this despite foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $22 million or 4%.
Within the segment, revenues at Dow Jones rose 1%, News UK and News America Marketing declined 8% and News Australia declined 7%. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, 73% of revenues are reoccurring and subscription-based, relating to either consumer products primarily for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's or business-to-business through our Professional Information Business, or PIB, which includes Risk and Compliance, Factiva and Dow Jones News Live. Consumer circulation revenues again grew 7% benefiting from 19% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to nearly 1.8 million as well as the benefit of higher subscription pricing, ranging from an additional $2 to $6 per month.
Digital paid subscribers accounted for 68% of total subscribers at The Wall Street Journal, up from 62% last year. This quarter, we added net 66,000 new subscribers. In addition, subscribers for Barron's, the financial news in the U.K., grew 28% from the prior year, resulting in an overall subscriber -- subscription for Dow Jones consumer products reaching almost 3.3 million, achieving record levels. Of that, over 2.1 million is digital-only. We also saw stable low single-digit revenue growth at PIB despite currency headwinds, led by 22% revenue growth from Risk and Compliance, which remains its growth engine as Robert mentioned and a core differentiator versus the industry.
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones fell approximately 8% compared to the prior year, which was weaker than the prior quarter, with the variance versus the second quarter mostly due to digital advertising although we expect to show an improvement in the fourth quarter rate. 
Elsewhere across our news portfolio, at News Australia, advertising declined 9% compared to the prior year but rose 1% in local currency due to the acquisition of Medium Rare, an integrated content agency business and digital advertising growth. We saw further weakness in the print advertising market. In the U.K., advertising fell 11% versus the prior year or down 5% in local currency due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had a challenging prior year comparison, partially offset by a sequential improvement in digital advertising growth at both The Sun and The Times. Now as Robert mentioned, modest improvement in print advertising revenues at The Times.
Importantly, we saw accelerating year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% year-over-year to 286,000 and at News Australia up 21% year-over-year to 493,000. That, along with cover price increases, allowed both markets to post modest gains in circulation and subscription revenues, excluding currency headwinds.
Finally, revenues at News America Marketing fell 8% as growth in U.S. in-store advertising, which is the biggest contributor to revenues, was more than offset by continued weakness in freestanding in-set products. 
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $73 million, down approximately 16% due primarily to News America Marketing, mostly a function of the top line weakness. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $539 million versus $129 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $98 million versus $16 million in the prior year. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $84 million or 13% compared with the prior year. $53 million of the decline or 9% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by [ lower ] broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports. Broadcast ARPU was over AUD 79 or down 1% versus the prior year as the impact of the price increase was more than offset by the impact from the new revenue recognition standards. Compared to the second quarter, broadcast ARPU rose nearly 2%, reflecting a price increase last quarter. We also saw a sequential and year-over-year improvement in Foxtel Now's ARPU due to a price increase last quarter.
Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $29 million, down 23% compared to the prior year and a moderation from last quarter. The year-over-year decline reflects higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $25 million of costs related to cricket Australia, lower revenues and $10 million for marketing related to Kayo Sports. These were partially offset by lower overhead and other corporate expenses as well as lower entertainment programming costs.
On key operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of March 31, up over 5% against the prior year, driven by higher Kayo Sports and Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia.
Compared to the second quarter, we had a modest increase in sequential subscriber growth as higher Kayo subscriptions more than offset broadcast declines. We are making good progress in our OTT strategy, which is helping drive volume growth of Foxtel. As Robert mentioned, as of May 8, we had over 239,000 total Kayo Sports subscribers, of which 209,000 were paying, more than double our last update. We also had over 567,000 Foxtel Now subscribers as of May 8, of which more than 505,000 are paying, which is an increase of 45% in paying subscribers from quarter end, driven by the demand for Game of thrones.
In the third quarter, broadcast churn was 17.7% versus 15.3% in the prior year, higher than we had anticipated, although the majority of churn is coming from lower-value, shorter tenured customers, many without contract. Importantly, sports customer churn on broadcast has been relatively stable at only 6%.
As we mentioned last quarter, Foxtel has launched proactive churn management initiatives focused on customized solutions for retention and winback and we are seeing real progress in recent weeks. March churn was down to 16.2% and to around 15.1% in April. Moreover, unlike in recent periods, promotions and new broadcast sales are predominantly with 12-month contracts, which should also help the churn reduction moving forward.
Capital expenditures related to the new Foxtel was $223 million in the first 9 months. We now expect full year CapEx to be higher than the prior year's level by $25 million or less, which is lower than our previous expectations.
Stepping back. As we have previously indicated, this year was always going to be a big transition year for the new Foxtel, and segment EBITDA performance has been impacted by reinvestments, which have a longer payback period. On this, there are a few points I'd like to make. 
We see OTT as a big revenue driver that will have higher contribution margins, given we are leveraging mostly fixed costs for previously acquired rights. And we are encouraged by the recent performance of Kayo and Foxtel Now. We believe we can stabilize broadcast churn via proactive churn management and a higher penetration of next-generation boxes, which materially reduce churn. Approximately 43% of households now have either the iQ3 or iQ4 box, up 400 basis points from last quarter. As mentioned, we are seeing good progress on that front.
As we lap the cricket investment, we would expect programming costs to grow at a much more modest rate after this year, and we will continue to thoroughly review our content lineup for additional phasings. We see an opportunity to reduce non-programming costs, including the ability to the variable components of the cost base like marketing and broader overhead costs. 
Finally on the Foxtel debt structure, we continue to evaluate numerous options to provide Foxtel with more financial flexibility and an optimal capital structure. To that end, we have contributed AUD 300 million  via shareholder loans, which cover the repayment of April maturities.
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter driven by a strong release slate which included in Christian Publishing, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis and We are the Gardeners by Joanna Gaines. U.K. revenues were also higher, helped by The Thing, a new release from David Walliams. Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $421 million and would have been notably higher excluding negative impacts from revenue recognition and currency. Segment EBITDA increased 29% to $53 million despite a much more challenging prior year comparison than the second quarter.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 3% to $272 million as growth was more than offset by currency headwinds. Currency had a [ $16 million ] negative impact to revenues in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3%. 
REA Group revenues were down 4% but up 6% in local currency due to residential growth in Australia, driven by increased yield and higher penetration for premiere . This growth was partially offset by an overall 9% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter, which included pronounced declines in both Sydney and Melbourne, down 18% and 12%, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 5% to $121 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 14% resulting from higher yield and growth in buy-side lease volume, albeit at a slower rate due to a more challenging U.S. housing marketplace as well as the trends [indiscernible] to Opcity. It is worth noting that Opcity's performance base and as we migrate leads to that model, we monetize differently and this does delay revenue recognition with early data indicating an average delay of 4 months from initial lead inquiry. 
As Robert alluded to earlier, we have been live testing in a handful of small markets converting performance-only model and last week, we expanded to over a dozen markets, big and small, as we test the scalability of the platform. These markets include, among others, Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland and Nashville. We expect to reallocate resources primarily within realtor.com in order to be more streamlined and much better positioned for financial year '20.
Revenue this quarter was also negatively impacted by the continued reduction of non-listed advertising inventory, similar to the first half as part of an initiative to improve the consumer experience and engagement. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 65 million for the quarter, rising 7% versus the prior year. Segment EBITDA fell 16% to $74 million. The quarter reflected additional costs related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 9%.
I would now like to mention a few themes for the fiscal fourth quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising performance to remain relatively similar to the third quarter rate, and we expect to continue to expand our digital subscribers while seeking further cost efficiencies. In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be more modest in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see increased contribution from OTT revenues. On a reported basis, we will be lapping the consolidation of Foxtel.
In Book Publishing, we will face particularly tough comps as in the prior year, we recognized $28 million in revenue and $21 million in EBITDA due to the sublicensing agreement for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy with Amazon. At Digital Real Estate Services, listing volumes in Australia remain challenged, impacted by Easter and Day and in anticipation of the Federal election in May. In the U.S., we expect continued reinvestment as we continue to test and monitor the scalability of Opcity.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

News Corp reaped rewards from our digital strategy this quarter, underscored by a robust rise in digital subscriptions across our media properties, a sharp increase in digital audiobook sales and continued expansion at our digital real estate businesses despite volatile conditions in property markets.
In the third quarter, the company saw 17% revenue growth to nearly $2.5 billion, reported net income of $23 million versus a $1.1 billion net loss in the prior year, and there was a 36% increase in total segment EBITDA. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel and, among other things, another distinguished performance by HarperCollins. For the 9 months to the end of March, our revenues were 20% higher and profitability was 29% higher.
Turning first to the News and Information Services segment, where Dow Jones continues to expand its national and global digital reach. We have recently entered into a partnership with Apple, which is at an early stage. But the initial signs are encouraging both in terms of reaching new audiences and the strength of engagement with the Wall Street Journal in the new app. The Journal is the most trusted masthead in America, and that value can be seen in its results this quarter with paid digital-only subscribers of the Journal growing to nearly 1.8 million, reflecting 19% growth. In total, 68% of subscribers are now digital-only.
Equally as significant, in the last quarter, about 55% of circulation revenues at Dow Jones were digital, and we believe there is undoubted potential for future growth. In addition to The Journal, other noteworthy Dow Jones properties include Barron's and MarketWatch. At MarketWatch, audience expanded 13% in the first 9 months to approximately 30 million average monthly unique users and revenue rose 13%. Barron's subscribers grew over 20% in the quarter compared to the prior year, approaching 600,000. And its success continued in April with Barron's breaking its all-time audience record by achieving, for the first time, a combined total audience of 10 million print and digital users.
We are also expanding the successful Dow Jones Professional Information Business where Risk and Compliance reported 22% growth in revenues. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of 20% or more year-over-year growth in that business. It is worth noting that at the time of the separation of News Corp in 2013, annual revenues of Risk and Compliance were at $31 million. We expect that number to more than quadruple by the end of fiscal 2019 to around $130 million.
We believe that Dow Jones is uniquely able to provide risk and compliance services in an area of significant expected growth. In fact, a market research firm recently valued the global risk and compliance market last year at nearly $28 billion and forecast that it would expand to some $65 billion by 2025. 
Dow Jones robust live events business continues to expand across sectors and around the world with The Wall Street Journal CEO Council set to meet in London and Tokyo this month and the acclaimed Future of Everything Festival launching here in New York City on May 20.
At News UK, we also saw continued gains in print circulation market share across all titles. And at The Sun, digital traffic improved sequentially with 84 million global monthly users as of March and digital advertising revenue accelerated. The Times and The Sunday Times saw another quarter of strong digital subscriber growth at 24% to 286,000 and now have in total 527,000 subscribers. In the wake of the recent favorable ruling by the U.K. government that will allow sharing of resources at The Times and The Sunday Times, we look forward to further efficiencies in their operations even as their editorial independence remains sacrosanct.
At News Corp Australia, digital subscription growth and heightened cost consciousness rounded out another solid quarter despite a choppy advertising market. News Australia remains the largest print and digital publisher in Australia with news.com.au still the #1 news website, significantly ahead of its rivals with an audience of over 10 million uniques in March. News Corp Australia is looking forward to achieving 500,000 digital subscribers in the coming weeks.
In the Subscription Video Services segment, Foxtel demonstrated its strength. Demand for the iQ4 set-top box launched earlier this fiscal year has exceeded expectation and now serves 43% of our broadcast base. This is important not only because the customer experience is materially better but because iQ4 customers have, on average, a higher build ARPU with lower churn. And while broadcast churn was elevated last quarter at 17.7% impacted by a recent price rise, we saw a notable improvement in March and in April when churn fell to 16% then 15%, respectively. We are confident that the renewed focus on churn and loyalty should continue that trend.
Obviously, we have been investing in streaming with platform development and marketing costs as well as leveraging existing sports rights. Our new sports streaming product, Kayo Sports, has already amassed more than 239,000 users since its launch late last year with more than 209,000 paid subscribers as of May 8. This growth reflects the sophistication of the technology and the strength of the exclusive sporting rights we have acquired.
It is clear that the Kayo subscriber base is engaged, consuming an average of over 7 hours of content per week. And while it is early days, cannibalization of the core broadcast product appears to be de minimis. Kayo is reaching a new audience and maximizing avail of our existing sports rights. We're excited about the upcoming Cricket World Cup, which Kayo has the right to and look forward to maintaining the momentum at Kayo Sports.
We keenly anticipate the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's next-generation set-top box, which will herald the start of Foxtel aggregating other services. Along with a new user interface later this calendar year, this will create a unified content search experience for our customers and strengthen our position in the market as providers of the broadest range of original and sports programming. 
Meanwhile, the success of the new season of Game of Thrones is attracting record audiences in Australia and demonstrates the power of our platform. As a result, we have seen the acceleration of Foxtel Now sales since quarter end with more than 567,000 subscribers as of May 8 and more than 505,000 of those, paying subscribers. The opening episode of the final season garnered 962,000 broadcast viewers overnight on Foxtel in Australia, up 17% on the season premiere in 2017. That's in addition to the total premiere day audience of 333,000 who streamed it live or on demand across Foxtel Now and Foxtel Go.
The investment in streaming is starting to pay off. In the aggregate, with Kayo and Foxtel Now, total OTT subscribers at Foxtel increased more than 80% since the beginning of this calendar year to more than 714,000 paying subscribers. Driven by the strong growth of OTT, our closing subscribers as of April 30 totaled approximately 3.1 million as compared to almost 2.8 million in the prior year. 
Turning to Digital Real Estate Services. REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite a soft listing environment and currency headwinds, that is a weak Australian dollar. The housing market was also challenging in the U.S. but at Move, home of realtor.com, real estate revenues, which account for 79% of total Move revenues, rose 14%. Overall, Move revenues grew 5% as we have consciously reduced our advertising inventory to improve the user experience but are able to increase that ratio according to market conditions.
Speaking of those conditions, there are clear signs that the U.S. housing market is strengthening, with lower mortgage rates, strong economic growth and significant increases in personal disposable income. As realtor.com's chief economist noted, positive indicators foreshadow a potential strengthening of home sales in the months to come. This has been reinforced by record traffic at realtor.com in April, up 7% from the prior year to over 69 million uniques, leading to 209 million visits. 
Also, the impact of those improving conditions were seen in the most recent new home sales figures. In March, new home sales rose 4.5% from the prior year to 692,000, the highest level since November 2017. New contracts in March were up 4%. Based on March data from comScore, realtor.com has a greater number of visits per visitor compared to the competition, with more pages viewed and more time spent on the site. So not only does realtor.com have the most complete and up-to-date for-sale listings in the industry, it also has the best level of engagement with its audience.
Likewise, we remain confident in the strategic importance of our recent acquisition of Opcity, which leverages applied analytics and machine learning to quickly match consumers with the right real estate professional. The ability to generate high-quality consumer leads for realtors through Opcity provides a new outlet to sustain revenue growth. This acquisition will involve some investment to increase capacity, but it is an investment in future growth.
We recently expanded Opcity to a number of test markets, offering an exclusive performance-based experience to consumers and the industry. We believe that providing higher-quality leads to realtors is part of the changing U.S. property market and will result in higher-quality returns for realtor.com. There is still much potential for growth in the sector, which is at a relatively early stage of digital development. And we expect the sectoral and cyclical wins to be more favorable over the coming year.
Turning to Book Publishing. HarperCollins once again delivered an impressive performance this quarter, with standout hits in our Christian division from best-selling author Rachel Hollis, whose previous title Girl, Wash Your Face has already sold over 3 million units and her latest, Girl, Stop Apologizing, shipped another 1 million. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5%, which included 32% growth in downloadable audiobooks. Digital in the aggregate represented 21% of consumer revenues this quarter. Meanwhile, the HarperCollins backlist contributed approximately 63% of consumer revenues in the quarter.
HarperCollins has been strengthening its reach in the U.S. book buying heartland. It is peerless in commissioning new authors, in its savvy editing and in its first-class marketing for best-in-class books. One recent example of the success of the strategy is the latest book from Joanna Gaines, We are the Gardeners. And Ben Shapiro's book, The Right Side of History, is now a bestseller in print and e-book. These successes enhance the bottom line with a 12.6% segment EBITDA margin in the quarter compared to 10.3% in the prior year.
Prospects with News Corp are certainly positive, given the performance thus far in this fiscal year, which is a direct result of the strategic and digital initiatives across our businesses. There is no doubt that the content landscape is changing and that we are seeing more people prepared to pay more for trusted news and innovative entertainment delivered efficiently, seamlessly to their mobile phone or home devices.
For more details on this quarter's results, I now turn to Susan Panuccio."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenues were nearly $2.5 billion, up 17% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $247 million, up 36% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 2% and EBITDA decreased 4%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.02 as compared to a loss of $1.94 in the prior year, which included a noncash write-down related to Foxtel as well as noncash impairment charges at News America Marketing and Fox Sports Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.06 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $52 million or 4% negative impact and was responsible for most of the decline. Approximately 31% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year.
Advertising revenues for the segment accounted for 48% of segment revenues and were down 9% versus the prior year with approximately $23 million or 4% due to negative currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 44% of segment revenues, were relatively flat versus the prior year, this despite foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $22 million or 4%.
Within the segment, revenues at Dow Jones rose 1%, News UK and News America Marketing declined 8% and News Australia declined 7%. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, 73% of revenues are reoccurring and subscription-based, relating to either consumer products primarily for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's or business-to-business through our Professional Information Business, or PIB, which includes Risk and Compliance, Factiva and Dow Jones news live. Consumer circulation revenues again grew 7% benefiting from 19% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to nearly 1.8 million as well as the benefit of higher subscription pricing, ranging from an additional $2 to $6 per month.
Digital paid subscribers accounted for 68% of total subscribers at The Wall Street Journal, up from 62% last year. This quarter, we added net 66,000 new subscribers. In addition, subscribers for Barron's, the financial news in the U.K., grew 28% from the prior year, resulting in an overall subscriber -- subscription for Dow Jones consumer products reaching almost 3.3 million, achieving record levels. Of that, over 2.1 million is digital-only. We also saw stable low single-digit revenue growth at PIB despite currency headwinds, led by 22% revenue growth from Risk and Compliance, which remains its growth engine as Robert mentioned and a core differentiator versus the industry.
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones fell approximately 8% compared to the prior year, which was weaker than the prior quarter, with the variance versus the second quarter mostly due to digital advertising although we expect to show an improvement in the fourth quarter rate. 
Elsewhere across our news portfolio, at News Australia, advertising declined 9% compared to the prior year but rose 1% in local currency due to the acquisition of Medium Rare, an integrated content agency business, and digital advertising growth. We saw further weakness in the print advertising market. In the U.K., advertising fell 11% versus the prior year or down 5% in local currency due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had a challenging prior year comparison, partially offset by a sequential improvement in digital advertising growth at both The Sun and The Times. Now as Robert mentioned, modest improvement in print advertising revenues at The Times.
Importantly, we saw accelerating year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% year-over-year to 286,000 and at News Australia, up 21% year-over-year to 493,000. That, along with cover price increases, allowed both markets to post modest gains in circulation and subscription revenues, excluding currency headwinds.
Finally, revenues at News America Marketing fell 8% as growth in U.S. in-store advertising, which is the biggest contributor to NAM revenues, was more than offset by continued weakness in freestanding in-set products. 
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $73 million, down approximately 16% due primarily to News America Marketing, mostly a function of the top line weakness. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $539 million versus $129 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $98 million versus $16 million in the prior year. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $84 million or 13% compared with the prior year. $53 million of the decline or 9% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports. Broadcast ARPU was over AUD 79 or down 1% versus the prior year as the impact of the price increase was more than offset by the impact from the new revenue recognition standards. Compared to the second quarter, broadcast ARPU rose nearly 2%, reflecting a price increase last quarter. We also saw a sequential and year-over-year improvement in Foxtel Now's ARPU due to a price increase last quarter.
Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $29 million, down 23% compared to the prior year and a moderation from last quarter. The year-over-year decline reflects higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $25 million of costs related to Cricket Australia, lower revenues and $10 million for marketing related to Kayo Sports. These were partially offset by lower overhead and other corporate expenses as well as lower entertainment programming costs.
On key operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of March 31, up over 5% against the prior year, driven by higher Kayo Sports and Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia.
Compared to the second quarter, we had a modest increase in sequential subscriber growth as higher Kayo subscriptions more than offset broadcast declines. We are making good progress in our OTT strategy, which is helping drive volume growth of Foxtel. As Robert mentioned, as of May 8, we had over 239,000 total Kayo Sports subscribers, of which 209,000 were paying, more than double our last update. We also had over 567,000 Foxtel Now subscribers as of May 8, of which more than 505,000 are paying, which is an increase of 45% in paying subscribers from quarter end, driven by the demand for Game of Thrones.
In the third quarter, broadcast churn was 17.7% versus 15.3% in the prior year, higher than we had anticipated, although the majority of churn is coming from lower-value, shorter-tenured customers, many without contract. Importantly, sports customer churn on broadcast has been relatively stable at only 6%.
As we mentioned last quarter, Foxtel has launched proactive churn management initiatives focused on customized solutions for retention and winback, and we are seeing real progress in recent weeks. March churn was down to 16.2% and to around 15.1% in April. Moreover, unlike in recent periods, promotions and new broadcast sales are predominantly with 12-month contracts, which should also help the churn reduction moving forward.
Capital expenditures related to the new Foxtel was $223 million in the first 9 months. We now expect full year CapEx to be higher than the prior year's level by $25 million or less, which is lower than our previous expectations.
Stepping back. As we have previously indicated, this year was always going to be a big transition year for the new Foxtel, and segment EBITDA performance has been impacted by reinvestments, which have a longer payback period. On this, there are a few points I'd like to make. 
We see OTT as a big revenue driver that will have higher contribution margins, given we are leveraging mostly fixed costs for previously acquired rights. And we are encouraged by the recent performance of Kayo and Foxtel Now. We believe we can stabilize broadcast churn via proactive churn management and a higher penetration of next-generation boxes, which materially reduce churn. Approximately 43% of households now have either the iQ3 or iQ4 box, up 400 basis points from last quarter. As mentioned, we are seeing good progress on that front.
As we lap the cricket investment, we would expect programming costs to grow at a much more modest rate after this year, and we will continue to thoroughly review our content lineup for additional savings. We see an opportunity to reduce nonprogramming costs, including the ability to flex the variable components of the cost base like marketing and broader overhead costs. 
Finally on the Foxtel debt structure, we continue to evaluate numerous options to provide Foxtel with more financial flexibility and an optimal capital structure. To that end, we have contributed AUD 300 million via shareholder loans, which cover the repayment of April maturities.
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter driven by a strong release slate which included in Christian publishing, Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis and We are the Gardeners by Joanna Gaines. U.K. revenues were also higher, helped by Fing, a new release from David Walliams. Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $421 million and would have been notably higher excluding negative impacts from revenue recognition and currency. Segment EBITDA increased 29% to $53 million despite a much more challenging prior year comparison than the second quarter.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 3% to $272 million as growth was more than offset by currency headwinds. Currency had a $16 million negative impact to revenues in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3%. 
REA Group revenues were down 4% but up 6% in local currency due to residential depth growth in Australia, driven by increased yield and higher penetration for Premiere All. This growth was partially offset by an overall 9% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter, which included pronounced declines in both Sydney and Melbourne, down 18% and 12%, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 5% to $121 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 14% resulting from higher yield and growth in buy-side leads volume, albeit at a slower rate due to a more challenging U.S. housing marketplace as well as the transfer of leads to Opcity. It is worth noting that Opcity is performance-based, and as we migrate leads to that model, we monetize differently, and this does delay revenue recognition with early data indicating an average delay of 4 months from initial lead inquiry. 
As Robert alluded to earlier, we have been live testing in a handful of small markets converting to performance-only model, and last week, we expanded to over a dozen markets, big and small, as we test the scalability of the platform. These markets include, among others, Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland and Nashville. We expect to reallocate resources primarily within realtor.com teams in order to be more streamlined and much better positioned for financial year '20.
Revenue this quarter was also negatively impacted by the continued reduction of nonlisted advertising inventory, similar to the first half, as part of an initiative to improve the consumer experience and engagement. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 65 million for the quarter, rising 7% versus the prior year. Segment EBITDA fell 16% to $74 million. The quarter reflected additional costs related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 9%.
I would now like to mention a few themes for the fiscal fourth quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising performance to remain relatively similar to the third quarter rate, and we expect to continue to expand our digital subscribers while seeking further cost efficiencies. In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be more modest in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see increased contribution from OTT revenues. On a reported basis, we will be lapping the consolidation of Foxtel.
In Book Publishing, we will face particularly tough comps as in the prior year, we recognized $28 million in revenue and $21 million in EBITDA due to the sublicensing agreement for The Lord of the Rings trilogy with Amazon. At Digital Real Estate Services, listing volumes in Australia remain challenged, impacted by Easter and Anzac Day and in anticipation of the federal election in May. In the U.S., we expect continued reinvestment as we continue to test and monitor the scalability of Opcity.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And we've made clear that we're in a development phase and there will be investment, but we're already seeing the results of that investment. Kayo has been in the market for barely 6 months, and frankly, you're not just building a brand but you're changing habits and meeting changing habits. 
And the key thing is that what is extremely clear from what we have seen in recent months is that Australians are prepared to pay for higher-quality content delivered when they want to watch, and it must be what they want to watch. And the great enduring myth was that Australians wouldn't pay. Australians are paying."

News Corp reaped rewards from our digital strategy this quarter, underscored by a robust rise in digital subscriptions across our media properties, a sharp increase in digital audiobook sales and continued expansion at our digital real estate businesses despite volatile conditions in property markets.
In the third quarter, the company saw 17% revenue growth to nearly $2.5 billion, reported net income of $23 million versus a $1.1 billion net loss in the prior year, and there was a 36% increase in total segment EBITDA. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel and, among other things, another distinguished performance by HarperCollins. For the 9 months to the end of March, our revenues were 20% higher and profitability was 29% higher.
Turning first to the News and Information Services segment, where Dow Jones continues to expand its national and global digital reach. We have recently entered into a partnership with Apple, which is at an early stage. But the initial signs are encouraging both in terms of reaching new audiences and the strength of engagement with The Wall Street Journal in the new app. The Journal is the most trusted masthead in America, and that value can be seen in its results this quarter with paid digital-only subscribers of the Journal growing to nearly 1.8 million, reflecting 19% growth. In total, 68% of subscribers are now digital-only.
Equally as significant, in the last quarter, about 55% of circulation revenues at Dow Jones were digital, and we believe there is undoubted potential for future growth. In addition to The Journal, other noteworthy Dow Jones properties include Barron's and MarketWatch. At MarketWatch, audience expanded 13% in the first 9 months to approximately 30 million average monthly unique users and revenue rose 13%. Barron's subscribers grew over 20% in the quarter compared to the prior year, approaching 600,000. And its success continued in April with Barron's breaking its all-time audience record by achieving, for the first time, a combined total audience of 10 million print and digital users.
We are also expanding the successful Dow Jones Professional Information Business where Risk and Compliance reported 22% growth in revenues. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of 20% or more year-over-year growth in that business. It is worth noting that at the time of the separation of News Corp in 2013, annual revenues of Risk and Compliance were at $31 million. We expect that number to more than quadruple by the end of fiscal 2019 to around $130 million.
We believe that Dow Jones is uniquely able to provide risk and compliance services in an area of significant expected growth. In fact, a market research firm recently valued the global risk and compliance market last year at nearly $28 billion and forecast that it would expand to some $65 billion by 2025. 
Dow Jones robust live events business continues to expand across sectors and around the world with The Wall Street Journal CEO Council set to meet in London and Tokyo this month and the acclaimed Future of Everything Festival launching here in New York City on May 20.
At News UK, we also saw continued gains in print circulation market share across all titles. And at The Sun, digital traffic improved sequentially with 84 million global monthly users as of March and digital advertising revenue accelerated. The Times and The Sunday Times saw another quarter of strong digital subscriber growth at 24% to 286,000 and now have in total 527,000 subscribers. 
In the wake of the recent favorable ruling by the U.K. government that will allow sharing of resources at The Times and The Sunday Times, we look forward to further efficiencies in their operations even as their editorial independence remains sacrosanct.
At News Corp Australia, digital subscription growth and heightened cost consciousness rounded out another solid quarter despite a choppy advertising market. News Australia remains the largest print and digital publisher in Australia with news.com.au still the #1 news website, significantly ahead of its rivals with an audience of over 10 million uniques in March. News Corp Australia is looking forward to achieving 500,000 digital subscribers in the coming weeks.
In the Subscription Video Services segment, Foxtel demonstrated its strength. Demand for the iQ4 set-top box launched earlier this fiscal year has exceeded expectation and now serves 43% of our broadcast base. This is important not only because the customer experience is materially better but because iQ4 customers have, on average, a higher build ARPU with lower churn. And while broadcast churn was elevated last quarter at 17.7% impacted by a recent price rise, we saw a notable improvement in March and in April when churn fell to 16% then 15%, respectively. We are confident that the renewed focus on churn and loyalty should continue that trend.
Obviously, we have been investing in streaming with platform development and marketing costs as well as leveraging existing sports rights. Our new sports streaming product, Kayo Sports, has already amassed more than 239,000 users since its launch late last year with more than 209,000 paid subscribers as of May 8. This growth reflects the sophistication of the technology and the strength of the exclusive sporting rights we have acquired.
It is clear that the Kayo subscriber base is engaged, consuming an average of over 7 hours of content per week. And while it is early days, cannibalization of the core broadcast product appears to be de minimis. Kayo is reaching a new audience and maximizing avail of our existing sports rights. We're excited about the upcoming Cricket World Cup, which Kayo has the right to and look forward to maintaining the momentum at Kayo Sports.
We keenly anticipate the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's next-generation set-top box, which will herald the start of Foxtel aggregating other services. Along with a new user interface later this calendar year, this will create a unified content search experience for our customers and strengthen our position in the market as providers of the broadest range of original and sports programming. 
Meanwhile, the success of the new season of Game of Thrones is attracting record audiences in Australia and demonstrates the power of our platform. As a result, we have seen the acceleration of Foxtel Now sales since quarter end with more than 567,000 subscribers as of May 8 and more than 505,000 of those, paying subscribers. The opening episode of the final season garnered 962,000 broadcast viewers overnight on Foxtel in Australia, up 17% on the season premiere in 2017. That's in addition to the total premiere day audience of 333,000 who streamed it live or on demand across Foxtel Now and Foxtel Go.
The investment in streaming is starting to pay off. In the aggregate, with Kayo and Foxtel Now, total OTT subscribers at Foxtel increased more than 80% since the beginning of this calendar year to more than 714,000 paying subscribers. Driven by the strong growth of OTT, our closing subscribers as of April 30 totaled approximately 3.1 million as compared to almost 2.8 million in the prior year. 
Turning to Digital Real Estate Services. REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite a soft listing environment and currency headwinds, that is a weak Australian dollar. The housing market was also challenging in the U.S. but at Move, home of realtor.com, real estate revenues, which account for 79% of total Move revenues, rose 14%. Overall, Move revenues grew 5% as we have consciously reduced our advertising inventory to improve the user experience but are able to increase that ratio according to market conditions.
Speaking of those conditions, there are clear signs that the U.S. housing market is strengthening, with lower mortgage rates, strong economic growth and significant increases in personal disposable income. As realtor.com's chief economist noted, positive indicators foreshadow a potential strengthening of home sales in the months to come. This has been reinforced by record traffic at realtor.com in April, up 7% from the prior year to over 69 million uniques, leading to 209 million visits. 
Also, the impact of those improving conditions were seen in the most recent new home sales figures. In March, new home sales rose 4.5% from the prior year to 692,000, the highest level since November 2017. New contracts in March were up 4%. Based on March data from comScore, realtor.com has a greater number of visits per visitor compared to the competition, with more pages viewed and more time spent on the site. So not only does realtor.com have the most complete and up-to-date for-sale listings in the industry, it also has the best level of engagement with its audience.
Likewise, we remain confident in the strategic importance of our recent acquisition of Opcity, which leverages applied analytics and machine learning to quickly match consumers with the right real estate professional. The ability to generate high-quality consumer leads for realtors through Opcity provides a new outlet to sustain revenue growth. This acquisition will involve some investment to increase capacity, but it is an investment in future growth.
We recently expanded Opcity to a number of test markets, offering an exclusive performance-based experience to consumers and the industry. We believe that providing higher-quality leads to realtors is part of the changing U.S. property market and will result in higher-quality returns for realtor.com. There is still much potential for growth in the sector, which is at a relatively early stage of digital development. And we expect the sectoral and cyclical wins to be more favorable over the coming year.
Turning to Book Publishing. HarperCollins once again delivered an impressive performance this quarter, with standout hits in our Christian division from best-selling author Rachel Hollis, whose previous title Girl, Wash Your Face has already sold over 3 million units and her latest, Girl, Stop Apologizing, shipped another 1 million. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5%, which included 32% growth in downloadable audiobooks. Digital in the aggregate represented 21% of consumer revenues this quarter. Meanwhile, the HarperCollins backlist contributed approximately 63% of consumer revenues in the quarter.
HarperCollins has been strengthening its reach in the U.S. book buying heartland. It is peerless in commissioning new authors, in its savvy editing and in its first-class marketing for best-in-class books. One recent example of the success of the strategy is the latest book from Joanna Gaines, We are the Gardeners. And Ben Shapiro's book, The Right Side of History, is now a bestseller in print and e-book. These successes enhance the bottom line with a 12.6% segment EBITDA margin in the quarter compared to 10.3% in the prior year.
Prospects with News Corp are certainly positive, given the performance thus far in this fiscal year, which is a direct result of the strategic and digital initiatives across our businesses. There is no doubt that the content landscape is changing and that we are seeing more people prepared to pay more for trusted news and innovative entertainment delivered efficiently, seamlessly to their mobile phone or home devices.
For more details on this quarter's results, I now turn to Susan Panuccio."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenues were nearly $2.5 billion, up 17% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $247 million, up 36% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 2% and EBITDA decreased 4%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.02 as compared to a loss of $1.94 in the prior year, which included a noncash write-down related to Foxtel as well as noncash impairment charges at News America Marketing and Fox Sports Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.06 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $52 million or 4% negative impact and was responsible for most of the decline. Approximately 31% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year.
Advertising revenues for the segment accounted for 48% of segment revenues and were down 9% versus the prior year with approximately $23 million or 4% due to negative currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 44% of segment revenues, were relatively flat versus the prior year, this despite foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $22 million or 4%.
Within the segment, revenues at Dow Jones rose 1%, News UK and News America Marketing declined 8% and News Australia declined 7%. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, 73% of revenues are reoccurring and subscription-based, relating to either consumer products primarily for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's or business-to-business through our Professional Information Business, or PIB, which includes Risk and Compliance, Factiva and Dow Jones news live. Consumer circulation revenues again grew 7% benefiting from 19% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to nearly 1.8 million as well as the benefit of higher subscription pricing, ranging from an additional $2 to $6 per month.
Digital paid subscribers accounted for 68% of total subscribers at The Wall Street Journal, up from 62% last year. This quarter, we added net 66,000 new subscribers. In addition, subscribers for Barron's and the Financial News in the U.K., grew 28% from the prior year, resulting in an overall subscriber -- subscription for Dow Jones consumer products reaching almost 3.3 million, achieving record levels. Of that, over 2.1 million is digital-only. We also saw stable low single-digit revenue growth at PIB despite currency headwinds, led by 22% revenue growth from Risk and Compliance, which remains its growth engine as Robert mentioned and a core differentiator versus the industry.
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones fell approximately 8% compared to the prior year, which was weaker than the prior quarter, with the variance versus the second quarter mostly due to digital advertising although we expect to show an improvement in the fourth quarter rate. 
Elsewhere across our news portfolio, at News Australia, advertising declined 9% compared to the prior year but rose 1% in local currency due to the acquisition of Medium Rare, an integrated content agency business, and digital advertising growth. We saw further weakness in the print advertising market. In the U.K., advertising fell 11% versus the prior year or down 5% in local currency due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had a challenging prior year comparison, partially offset by a sequential improvement in digital advertising growth at both The Sun and The Times. Now as Robert mentioned, modest improvement in print advertising revenues at The Times.
Importantly, we saw accelerating year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% year-over-year to 286,000 and at News Australia, up 21% year-over-year to 493,000. That, along with cover price increases, allowed both markets to post modest gains in circulation and subscription revenues, excluding currency headwinds.
Finally, revenues at News America Marketing fell 8% as growth in U.S. in-store advertising, which is the biggest contributor to NAM revenues, was more than offset by continued weakness in freestanding [ in-set ] products. 
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $73 million, down approximately 16% due primarily to News America Marketing, mostly a function of the top line weakness. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $539 million versus $129 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $98 million versus $16 million in the prior year. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel. 
On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $84 million or 13% compared with the prior year. $53 million of the decline or 9% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports. Broadcast ARPU was over AUD 79 or down 1% versus the prior year as the impact of the price increase was more than offset by the impact from the new revenue recognition standards. Compared to the second quarter, broadcast ARPU rose nearly 2%, reflecting a price increase last quarter. We also saw a sequential and year-over-year improvement in Foxtel Now's ARPU due to a price increase last quarter.
Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $29 million, down 23% compared to the prior year and a moderation from last quarter. The year-over-year decline reflects higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $25 million of costs related to Cricket Australia, lower revenues and $10 million for marketing related to Kayo Sports. These were partially offset by lower overhead and other corporate expenses as well as lower entertainment programming costs.
On key operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of March 31, up over 5% against the prior year, driven by higher Kayo Sports and Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia.
Compared to the second quarter, we had a modest increase in sequential subscriber growth as higher Kayo subscriptions more than offset broadcast declines. We are making good progress in our OTT strategy, which is helping drive volume growth of Foxtel. As Robert mentioned, as of May 8, we had over 239,000 total Kayo Sports subscribers, of which 209,000 were paying, more than double our last update. 
We also had over 567,000 Foxtel Now subscribers as of May 8, of which more than 505,000 are paying, which is an increase of 45% in paying subscribers from quarter end, driven by the demand for Game of Thrones.
In the third quarter, broadcast churn was 17.7% versus 15.3% in the prior year, higher than we had anticipated, although the majority of churn is coming from lower-value, shorter-tenured customers, many without contract. Importantly, sports customer churn on broadcast has been relatively stable at only 6%.
As we mentioned last quarter, Foxtel has launched proactive churn management initiatives focused on customized solutions for retention and winback, and we are seeing real progress in recent weeks. March churn was down to 16.2% and to around 15.1% in April. Moreover, unlike in recent periods, promotions and new broadcast sales are predominantly with 12-month contracts, which should also help the churn reduction moving forward.
Capital expenditures related to the new Foxtel was $223 million in the first 9 months. We now expect full year CapEx to be higher than the prior year's level by $25 million or less, which is lower than our previous expectations.
Stepping back. As we have previously indicated, this year was always going to be a big transition year for the new Foxtel, and segment EBITDA performance has been impacted by reinvestments, which have a longer payback period. On this, there are a few points I'd like to make. 
We see OTT as a big revenue driver that will have higher contribution margins, given we are leveraging mostly fixed costs for previously acquired rights. And we are encouraged by the recent performance of Kayo and Foxtel Now. We believe we can stabilize broadcast churn via proactive churn management and a higher penetration of next-generation boxes, which materially reduce churn. Approximately 43% of households now have either the iQ3 or iQ4 box, up 400 basis points from last quarter. As mentioned, we are seeing good progress on that front.
As we lap the Cricket investment, we would expect programming costs to grow at a much more modest rate after this year, and we will continue to thoroughly review our content lineup for additional savings. We see an opportunity to reduce nonprogramming costs, including the ability to flex the variable components of the cost base like marketing and broader overhead costs. 
Finally on the Foxtel debt structure, we continue to evaluate numerous options to provide Foxtel with more financial flexibility and an optimal capital structure. To that end, we have contributed AUD 300 million via shareholder loans, which cover the repayment of April maturities.
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter driven by a strong release slate which included in Christian publishing, Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis and We are the Gardeners by Joanna Gaines. U.K. revenues were also higher, helped by Fing, a new release from David Walliams. Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $421 million and would have been notably higher excluding negative impacts from revenue recognition and currency. Segment EBITDA increased 29% to $53 million despite a much more challenging prior year comparison than the second quarter.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 3% to $272 million as growth was more than offset by currency headwinds. Currency had a $16 million negative impact to revenues in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3%. 
REA Group revenues were down 4% but up 6% in local currency due to residential [ debt ] growth in Australia, driven by increased yield and higher penetration for Premiere All. This growth was partially offset by an overall 9% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter, which included pronounced declines in both Sydney and Melbourne, down 18% and 12%, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 5% to $121 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 14% resulting from higher yield and growth in buy-side leads volume, albeit at a slower rate due to a more challenging U.S. housing marketplace as well as the transfer of leads to Opcity. It is worth noting that Opcity is performance-based, and as we migrate leads to that model, we monetize differently, and this does delay revenue recognition with early data indicating an average delay of 4 months from initial lead inquiry. 
As Robert alluded to earlier, we have been live testing in a handful of small markets converting to performance-only model, and last week, we expanded to over a dozen markets, big and small, as we test the scalability of the platform. These markets include, among others, Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland and Nashville. We expect to reallocate resources primarily within realtor.com teams in order to be more streamlined and much better positioned for financial year '20.
Revenue this quarter was also negatively impacted by the continued reduction of nonlisted advertising inventory, similar to the first half, as part of an initiative to improve the consumer experience and engagement. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 65 million for the quarter, rising 7% versus the prior year. 
Segment EBITDA fell 16% to $74 million. The quarter reflected additional costs related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 9%.
I would now like to mention a few themes for the fiscal fourth quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising performance to remain relatively similar to the third quarter rate, and we expect to continue to expand our digital subscribers while seeking further cost efficiencies. In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be more modest in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see increased contribution from OTT revenues. On a reported basis, we will be lapping the consolidation of Foxtel.
In Book Publishing, we will face particularly tough comps as in the prior year, we recognized $28 million in revenue and $21 million in EBITDA due to the sublicensing agreement for The Lord of the Rings trilogy with Amazon. At Digital Real Estate Services, listing volumes in Australia remain challenged, impacted by Easter and Anzac Day and in anticipation of the federal election in May. In the U.S., we expect continued reinvestment as we continue to test and monitor the scalability of Opcity.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

But the Apple deal is important. We are proud to work with companies that value journalism and are popularizing a subscription mechanic. There's just no doubt that we are reaching a far larger audience with Apple readers who may have had preconceptions about The Wall Street Journal and imagined that it was just the world's best business newspaper. 
Well, it's much more than that. It is the most trusted masthead in America. Its coverage of politics is by far the best in the business, and its lifestyle and sports coverage is peerless. There is no better wittiest sportswriter than Jason Gay, and I just hope my compliments don't go to his [ horseshoed ] head. 
We are attracting more younger readers and more women from our internal data. Felt that it's very early, obviously, in the Apple relationship. But what we're not doing is compromising the business subscribers for whom we will provide even more specialist information."

News Corp reaped rewards from our digital strategy this quarter, underscored by a robust rise in digital subscriptions across our media properties, a sharp increase in digital audiobook sales and continued expansion at our digital real estate businesses despite volatile conditions in property markets.
In the third quarter, the company saw 17% revenue growth to nearly $2.5 billion, reported net income of $23 million versus a $1.1 billion net loss in the prior year, and there was a 36% increase in total segment EBITDA. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel and, among other things, another distinguished performance by HarperCollins. For the 9 months to the end of March, our revenues were 20% higher and profitability was 29% higher.
Turning first to the News and Information Services segment, where Dow Jones continues to expand its national and global digital reach. We have recently entered into a partnership with Apple, which is at an early stage. But the initial signs are encouraging both in terms of reaching new audiences and the strength of engagement with The Wall Street Journal in the new app. The Journal is the most trusted masthead in America, and that value can be seen in its results this quarter with paid digital-only subscribers of the Journal growing to nearly 1.8 million, reflecting 19% growth. In total, 68% of subscribers are now digital-only.
Equally as significant, in the last quarter, about 55% of circulation revenues at Dow Jones were digital, and we believe there is undoubted potential for future growth. In addition to The Journal, other noteworthy Dow Jones properties include Barron's and MarketWatch. At MarketWatch, audience expanded 13% in the first 9 months to approximately 30 million average monthly unique users and revenue rose 13%. Barron's subscribers grew over 20% in the quarter compared to the prior year, approaching 600,000. And its success continued in April with Barron's breaking its all-time audience record by achieving, for the first time, a combined total audience of 10 million print and digital users.
We are also expanding the successful Dow Jones Professional Information Business where Risk and Compliance reported 22% growth in revenues. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of 20% or more year-over-year growth in that business. It is worth noting that at the time of the separation of News Corp in 2013, annual revenues of Risk and Compliance were at $31 million. We expect that number to more than quadruple by the end of fiscal 2019 to around $130 million.
We believe that Dow Jones is uniquely able to provide risk and compliance services in an area of significant expected growth. In fact, a market research firm recently valued the global risk and compliance market last year at nearly $28 billion and forecast that it would expand to some $65 billion by 2025. 
Dow Jones robust live events business continues to expand across sectors and around the world with The Wall Street Journal CEO Council set to meet in London and Tokyo this month and the acclaimed Future of Everything Festival launching here in New York City on May 20.
At News UK, we also saw continued gains in print circulation market share across all titles. And at The Sun, digital traffic improved sequentially with 84 million global monthly users as of March and digital advertising revenue accelerated. The Times and The Sunday Times saw another quarter of strong digital subscriber growth at 24% to 286,000 and now have in total 527,000 subscribers. 
In the wake of the recent favorable ruling by the U.K. government that will allow sharing of resources at The Times and The Sunday Times, we look forward to further efficiencies in their operations even as their editorial independence remains sacrosanct.
At News Corp Australia, digital subscription growth and heightened cost consciousness rounded out another solid quarter despite a choppy advertising market. News Australia remains the largest print and digital publisher in Australia with news.com.au still the #1 news website, significantly ahead of its rivals with an audience of over 10 million uniques in March. News Corp Australia is looking forward to achieving 500,000 digital subscribers in the coming weeks.
In the Subscription Video Services segment, Foxtel demonstrated its strength. Demand for the iQ4 set-top box launched earlier this fiscal year has exceeded expectation and now serves 43% of our broadcast base. This is important not only because the customer experience is materially better but because iQ4 customers have, on average, a higher build ARPU with lower churn. And while broadcast churn was elevated last quarter at 17.7% impacted by a recent price rise, we saw a notable improvement in March and in April when churn fell to 16% then 15%, respectively. We are confident that the renewed focus on churn and loyalty should continue that trend.
Obviously, we have been investing in streaming with platform development and marketing costs as well as leveraging existing sports rights. Our new sports streaming product, Kayo Sports, has already amassed more than 239,000 users since its launch late last year with more than 209,000 paid subscribers as of May 8. This growth reflects the sophistication of the technology and the strength of the exclusive sporting rights we have acquired.
It is clear that the Kayo subscriber base is engaged, consuming an average of over 7 hours of content per week. And while it is early days, cannibalization of the core broadcast product appears to be de minimis. Kayo is reaching a new audience and maximizing the value of our existing sports rights. We're excited about the upcoming Cricket World Cup, which Kayo has the right to and look forward to maintaining the momentum at Kayo Sports.
We keenly anticipate the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's next-generation set-top box, which will herald the start of Foxtel aggregating other services. Along with a new user interface later this calendar year, this will create a unified content search experience for our customers and strengthen our position in the market as providers of the broadest range of original and sports programming. 
Meanwhile, the success of the new season of Game of Thrones is attracting record audiences in Australia and demonstrates the power of our platform. As a result, we have seen the acceleration of Foxtel Now sales since quarter end with more than 567,000 subscribers as of May 8 and more than 505,000 of those, paying subscribers. The opening episode of the final season garnered 962,000 broadcast viewers overnight on Foxtel in Australia, up 17% on the season premiere in 2017. That's in addition to the total premiere day audience of 333,000 who streamed it live or on demand across Foxtel Now and Foxtel Go.
The investment in streaming is starting to pay off. In the aggregate, with Kayo and Foxtel Now, total OTT subscribers at Foxtel increased more than 80% since the beginning of this calendar year to more than 714,000 paying subscribers. Driven by the strong growth of OTT, our closing subscribers as of April 30 totaled approximately 3.1 million as compared to almost 2.8 million in the prior year. 
Turning to Digital Real Estate Services. REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite a soft listing environment and currency headwinds, that is a weak Australian dollar. The housing market was also challenging in the U.S. but at Move, home of realtor.com, real estate revenues, which account for 79% of total Move revenues, rose 14%. Overall, Move revenues grew 5% as we have consciously reduced our advertising inventory to improve the user experience but are able to increase that ratio according to market conditions.
Speaking of those conditions, there are clear signs that the U.S. housing market is strengthening, with lower mortgage rates, strong economic growth and significant increases in personal disposable income. As realtor.com's chief economist noted, positive indicators foreshadow a potential strengthening of home sales in the months to come. This has been reinforced by record traffic at realtor.com in April, up 7% from the prior year to over 69 million uniques, leading to 209 million visits. 
Also, the impact of those improving conditions were seen in the most recent new home sales figures. In March, new home sales rose 4.5% from the prior year to 692,000, the highest level since November 2017. New contracts in March were up 4%. Based on March data from comScore, realtor.com has a greater number of visits per visitor compared to the competition, with more pages viewed and more time spent on the site. So not only does realtor.com have the most complete and up-to-date for-sale listings in the industry, it also has the best level of engagement with its audience.
Likewise, we remain confident in the strategic importance of our recent acquisition of Opcity, which leverages applied analytics and machine learning to quickly match consumers with the right real estate professional. The ability to generate high-quality consumer leads for realtors through Opcity provides a new outlet to sustain revenue growth. This acquisition will involve some investment to increase capacity, but it is an investment in future growth.
We recently expanded Opcity to a number of test markets, offering an exclusive performance-based experience to consumers and the industry. We believe that providing higher-quality leads to realtors is part of the changing U.S. property market and will result in higher-quality returns for realtor.com. There is still much potential for growth in the sector, which is at a relatively early stage of digital development. And we expect the sectoral and cyclical wins to be more favorable over the coming year.
Turning to Book Publishing. HarperCollins once again delivered an impressive performance this quarter, with standout hits in our Christian division from best-selling author Rachel Hollis, whose previous title Girl, Wash Your Face has already sold over 3 million units and her latest, Girl, Stop Apologizing, shipped another 1 million. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5%, which included 32% growth in downloadable audiobooks. Digital in the aggregate represented 21% of consumer revenues this quarter. Meanwhile, the HarperCollins backlist contributed approximately 63% of consumer revenues in the quarter.
HarperCollins has been strengthening its reach in the U.S. book buying heartland. It is peerless in commissioning new authors, in its savvy editing and in its first-class marketing for best-in-class books. One recent example of the success of the strategy is the latest book from Joanna Gaines, We are the Gardeners. And Ben Shapiro's book, The Right Side of History, is now a bestseller in print and e-book. These successes enhance the bottom line with a 12.6% segment EBITDA margin in the quarter compared to 10.3% in the prior year.
Prospects with News Corp are certainly positive, given the performance thus far in this fiscal year, which is a direct result of the strategic and digital initiatives across our businesses. There is no doubt that the content landscape is changing and that we are seeing more people prepared to pay more for trusted news and innovative entertainment delivered efficiently, seamlessly to their mobile phone or home devices.
For more details on this quarter's results, I now turn to Susan Panuccio."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenues were nearly $2.5 billion, up 17% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $247 million, up 36% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 2% and EBITDA decreased 4%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.02 as compared to a loss of $1.94 in the prior year, which included a noncash write-down related to Foxtel as well as noncash impairment charges at News America Marketing and Fox Sports Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.06 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $52 million or 4% negative impact and was responsible for most of the decline. Approximately 31% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year.
Advertising revenues for the segment accounted for 48% of segment revenues and were down 9% versus the prior year with approximately $23 million or 4% due to negative currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 44% of segment revenues, were relatively flat versus the prior year, this despite foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $22 million or 4%.
Within the segment, revenues at Dow Jones rose 1%, News UK and News America Marketing declined 8% and News Australia declined 7%. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, 73% of revenues are reoccurring and subscription-based, relating to either consumer products primarily for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's or business-to-business through our Professional Information Business, or PIB, which includes Risk and Compliance, Factiva and Dow Jones news live. Consumer circulation revenues again grew 7% benefiting from 19% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to nearly 1.8 million as well as the benefit of higher subscription pricing, ranging from an additional $2 to $6 per month.
Digital paid subscribers accounted for 68% of total subscribers at The Wall Street Journal, up from 62% last year. This quarter, we added net 66,000 new subscribers. In addition, subscribers for Barron's and the Financial News in the U.K., grew 28% from the prior year, resulting in an overall subscriber -- subscription for Dow Jones consumer products reaching almost 3.3 million, achieving record levels. Of that, over 2.1 million is digital-only. We also saw stable low single-digit revenue growth at PIB despite currency headwinds, led by 22% revenue growth from Risk and Compliance, which remains its growth engine as Robert mentioned and a core differentiator versus the industry.
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones fell approximately 8% compared to the prior year, which was weaker than the prior quarter, with the variance versus the second quarter mostly due to digital advertising although we expect to show an improvement in the fourth quarter rate. 
Elsewhere across our news portfolio, at News Australia, advertising declined 9% compared to the prior year but rose 1% in local currency due to the acquisition of Medium Rare, an integrated content agency business, and digital advertising growth. We saw further weakness in the print advertising market. In the U.K., advertising fell 11% versus the prior year or down 5% in local currency due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had a challenging prior year comparison, partially offset by a sequential improvement in digital advertising growth at both The Sun and The Times. Now as Robert mentioned, modest improvement in print advertising revenues at The Times.
Importantly, we saw accelerating year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% year-over-year to 286,000 and at News Australia, up 21% year-over-year to 493,000. That, along with cover price increases, allowed both markets to post modest gains in circulation and subscription revenues, excluding currency headwinds.
Finally, revenues at News America Marketing fell 8% as growth in U.S. in-store advertising, which is the biggest contributor to NAM revenues, was more than offset by continued weakness in freestanding [ in-set ] products. 
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $73 million, down approximately 16% due primarily to News America Marketing, mostly a function of the top line weakness. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $539 million versus $129 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $98 million versus $16 million in the prior year. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel. 
On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $84 million or 13% compared with the prior year. $53 million of the decline or 9% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports. Broadcast ARPU was over AUD 79 or down 1% versus the prior year as the impact of the price increase was more than offset by the impact from the new revenue recognition standards. Compared to the second quarter, broadcast ARPU rose nearly 2%, reflecting a price increase last quarter. We also saw a sequential and year-over-year improvement in Foxtel Now's ARPU due to a price increase last quarter.
Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $29 million, down 23% compared to the prior year and a moderation from last quarter. The year-over-year decline reflects higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $25 million of costs related to Cricket Australia, lower revenues and $10 million for marketing related to Kayo Sports. These were partially offset by lower overhead and other corporate expenses as well as lower entertainment programming costs.
On key operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of March 31, up over 5% against the prior year, driven by higher Kayo Sports and Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia.
Compared to the second quarter, we had a modest increase in sequential subscriber growth as higher Kayo subscriptions more than offset broadcast declines. We are making good progress in our OTT strategy, which is helping drive volume growth of Foxtel. As Robert mentioned, as of May 8, we had over 239,000 total Kayo Sports subscribers, of which 209,000 were paying, more than double our last update. 
We also had over 567,000 Foxtel Now subscribers as of May 8, of which more than 505,000 are paying, which is an increase of 45% in paying subscribers from quarter end, driven by the demand for Game of Thrones.
In the third quarter, broadcast churn was 17.7% versus 15.3% in the prior year, higher than we had anticipated, although the majority of churn is coming from lower-value, shorter-tenured customers, many without contract. Importantly, sports customer churn on broadcast has been relatively stable at only 6%.
As we mentioned last quarter, Foxtel has launched proactive churn management initiatives focused on customized solutions for retention and winback, and we are seeing real progress in recent weeks. March churn was down to 16.2% and to around 15.1% in April. Moreover, unlike in recent periods, promotions and new broadcast sales are predominantly with 12-month contracts, which should also help the churn reduction moving forward.
Capital expenditures related to the new Foxtel was $223 million in the first 9 months. We now expect full year CapEx to be higher than the prior year's level by $25 million or less, which is lower than our previous expectations.
Stepping back. As we have previously indicated, this year was always going to be a big transition year for the new Foxtel, and segment EBITDA performance has been impacted by reinvestments, which have a longer payback period. On this, there are a few points I'd like to make. 
We see OTT as a big revenue driver that will have higher contribution margins, given we are leveraging mostly fixed costs for previously acquired rights. And we are encouraged by the recent performance of Kayo and Foxtel Now. We believe we can stabilize broadcast churn via proactive churn management and a higher penetration of next-generation boxes, which materially reduce churn. Approximately 43% of households now have either the iQ3 or iQ4 box, up 400 basis points from last quarter. As mentioned, we are seeing good progress on that front.
As we lap the Cricket investment, we would expect programming costs to grow at a much more modest rate after this year, and we will continue to thoroughly review our content lineup for additional savings. We see an opportunity to reduce nonprogramming costs, including the ability to flex the variable components of the cost base like marketing and broader overhead costs. 
Finally on the Foxtel debt structure, we continue to evaluate numerous options to provide Foxtel with more financial flexibility and an optimal capital structure. To that end, we have contributed AUD 300 million via shareholder loans, which cover the repayment of April maturities.
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter driven by a strong release slate which included in Christian publishing, Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis and We are the Gardeners by Joanna Gaines. U.K. revenues were also higher, helped by Fing, a new release from David Walliams. Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $421 million and would have been notably higher excluding negative impacts from revenue recognition and currency. Segment EBITDA increased 29% to $53 million despite a much more challenging prior year comparison than the second quarter.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 3% to $272 million as growth was more than offset by currency headwinds. Currency had a $16 million negative impact to revenues in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3%. 
REA Group revenues were down 4% but up 6% in local currency due to residential [ debt ] growth in Australia, driven by increased yield and higher penetration for Premiere All. This growth was partially offset by an overall 9% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter, which included pronounced declines in both Sydney and Melbourne, down 18% and 12%, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 5% to $121 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 14% resulting from higher yield and growth in buy-side leads volume, albeit at a slower rate due to a more challenging U.S. housing marketplace as well as the transfer of leads to Opcity. It is worth noting that Opcity is performance-based, and as we migrate leads to that model, we monetize differently, and this does delay revenue recognition with early data indicating an average delay of 4 months from initial lead inquiry. 
As Robert alluded to earlier, we have been live testing in a handful of small markets converting to performance-only model, and last week, we expanded to over a dozen markets, big and small, as we test the scalability of the platform. These markets include, among others, Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland and Nashville. We expect to reallocate resources primarily within realtor.com teams in order to be more streamlined and much better positioned for financial year '20.
Revenue this quarter was also negatively impacted by the continued reduction of nonlisted advertising inventory, similar to the first half, as part of an initiative to improve the consumer experience and engagement. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 65 million for the quarter, rising 7% versus the prior year. 
Segment EBITDA fell 16% to $74 million. The quarter reflected additional costs related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 9%.
I would now like to mention a few themes for the fiscal fourth quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising performance to remain relatively similar to the third quarter rate, and we expect to continue to expand our digital subscribers while seeking further cost efficiencies. In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be more modest in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see increased contribution from OTT revenues. On a reported basis, we will be lapping the consolidation of Foxtel.
In Book Publishing, we will face particularly tough comps as in the prior year, we recognized $28 million in revenue and $21 million in EBITDA due to the sublicensing agreement for The Lord of the Rings trilogy with Amazon. At Digital Real Estate Services, listing volumes in Australia remain challenged, impacted by Easter and Anzac Day and in anticipation of the federal election in May. In the U.S., we expect continued reinvestment as we continue to test and monitor the scalability of Opcity.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

But we're constantly reviewing that portfolio to ensure that both in the medium and long term that investor interests are taken care of."

News Corp reaped rewards from our digital strategy this quarter, underscored by a robust rise in digital subscriptions across our media properties, a sharp increase in digital audiobook sales and continued expansion at our digital real estate businesses despite volatile conditions in property markets.
In the third quarter, the company saw 17% revenue growth to nearly $2.5 billion, reported net income of $23 million versus a $1.1 billion net loss in the prior year, and there was a 36% increase in total segment EBITDA. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel and, among other things, another distinguished performance by HarperCollins. For the 9 months to the end of March, our revenues were 20% higher and profitability was 29% higher.
Turning first to the News and Information Services segment, where Dow Jones continues to expand its national and global digital reach. We have recently entered into a partnership with Apple, which is at an early stage. But the initial signs are encouraging both in terms of reaching new audiences and the strength of engagement with The Wall Street Journal in the new app. The Journal is the most trusted masthead in America, and that value can be seen in its results this quarter with paid digital-only subscribers of the Journal growing to nearly 1.8 million, reflecting 19% growth. In total, 68% of subscribers are now digital-only.
Equally as significant, in the last quarter, about 55% of circulation revenues at Dow Jones were digital, and we believe there is undoubted potential for future growth. In addition to The Journal, other noteworthy Dow Jones properties include Barron's and MarketWatch. At MarketWatch, audience expanded 13% in the first 9 months to approximately 30 million average monthly unique users and revenue rose 13%. Barron's subscribers grew over 20% in the quarter compared to the prior year, approaching 600,000. And its success continued in April with Barron's breaking its all-time audience record by achieving, for the first time, a combined total audience of 10 million print and digital users.
We are also expanding the successful Dow Jones Professional Information Business where Risk and Compliance reported 22% growth in revenues. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of 20% or more year-over-year growth in that business. It is worth noting that at the time of the separation of News Corp in 2013, annual revenues of Risk and Compliance were at $31 million. We expect that number to more than quadruple by the end of fiscal 2019 to around $130 million.
We believe that Dow Jones is uniquely able to provide risk and compliance services in an area of significant expected growth. In fact, a market research firm recently valued the global risk and compliance market last year at nearly $28 billion and forecast that it would expand to some $65 billion by 2025. 
Dow Jones robust live events business continues to expand across sectors and around the world with The Wall Street Journal CEO Council set to meet in London and Tokyo this month and the acclaimed Future of Everything Festival launching here in New York City on May 20.
At News UK, we also saw continued gains in print circulation market share across all titles. And at The Sun, digital traffic improved sequentially with 84 million global monthly users as of March and digital advertising revenue accelerated. The Times and The Sunday Times saw another quarter of strong digital subscriber growth at 24% to 286,000 and now have in total 527,000 subscribers. 
In the wake of the recent favorable ruling by the U.K. government that will allow sharing of resources at The Times and The Sunday Times, we look forward to further efficiencies in their operations even as their editorial independence remains sacrosanct.
At News Corp Australia, digital subscription growth and heightened cost consciousness rounded out another solid quarter despite a choppy advertising market. News Australia remains the largest print and digital publisher in Australia with news.com.au still the #1 news website, significantly ahead of its rivals with an audience of over 10 million uniques in March. News Corp Australia is looking forward to achieving 500,000 digital subscribers in the coming weeks.
In the Subscription Video Services segment, Foxtel demonstrated its strength. Demand for the iQ4 set-top box launched earlier this fiscal year has exceeded expectation and now serves 43% of our broadcast base. This is important not only because the customer experience is materially better but because iQ4 customers have, on average, a higher build ARPU with lower churn. And while broadcast churn was elevated last quarter at 17.7% impacted by a recent price rise, we saw a notable improvement in March and in April when churn fell to 16% then 15%, respectively. We are confident that the renewed focus on churn and loyalty should continue that trend.
Obviously, we have been investing in streaming with platform development and marketing costs as well as leveraging existing sports rights. Our new sports streaming product, Kayo Sports, has already amassed more than 239,000 users since its launch late last year with more than 209,000 paid subscribers as of May 8. This growth reflects the sophistication of the technology and the strength of the exclusive sporting rights we have acquired.
It is clear that the Kayo subscriber base is engaged, consuming an average of over 7 hours of content per week. And while it is early days, cannibalization of the core broadcast product appears to be de minimis. Kayo is reaching a new audience and maximizing the value of our existing sports rights. We're excited about the upcoming Cricket World Cup, which Kayo has the right to and look forward to maintaining the momentum at Kayo Sports.
We keenly anticipate the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's next-generation set-top box, which will herald the start of Foxtel aggregating other services. Along with a new user interface later this calendar year, this will create a unified content search experience for our customers and strengthen our position in the market as providers of the broadest range of original and sports programming. 
Meanwhile, the success of the new season of Game of Thrones is attracting record audiences in Australia and demonstrates the power of our platform. As a result, we have seen the acceleration of Foxtel Now sales since quarter end with more than 567,000 subscribers as of May 8 and more than 505,000 of those, paying subscribers. The opening episode of the final season garnered 962,000 broadcast viewers overnight on Foxtel in Australia, up 17% on the season premiere in 2017. That's in addition to the total premiere day audience of 333,000 who streamed it live or on demand across Foxtel Now and Foxtel Go.
The investment in streaming is starting to pay off. In the aggregate, with Kayo and Foxtel Now, total OTT subscribers at Foxtel increased more than 80% since the beginning of this calendar year to more than 714,000 paying subscribers. Driven by the strong growth of OTT, our closing subscribers as of April 30 totaled approximately 3.1 million as compared to almost 2.8 million in the prior year. 
Turning to Digital Real Estate Services. REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite a soft listing environment and currency headwinds, that is a weak Australian dollar. The housing market was also challenging in the U.S. but at Move, home of realtor.com, real estate revenues, which account for 79% of total Move revenues, rose 14%. Overall, Move revenues grew 5% as we have consciously reduced our advertising inventory to improve the user experience but are able to increase that ratio according to market conditions.
Speaking of those conditions, there are clear signs that the U.S. housing market is strengthening, with lower mortgage rates, strong economic growth and significant increases in personal disposable income. As realtor.com's chief economist noted, positive indicators foreshadow a potential strengthening of home sales in the months to come. This has been reinforced by record traffic at realtor.com in April, up 7% from the prior year to over 69 million uniques, leading to 209 million visits. 
Also, the impact of those improving conditions were seen in the most recent new home sales figures. In March, new home sales rose 4.5% from the prior year to 692,000, the highest level since November 2017. New contracts in March were up 4%. Based on March data from comScore, realtor.com has a greater number of visits per visitor compared to the competition, with more pages viewed and more time spent on the site. So not only does realtor.com have the most complete and up-to-date for-sale listings in the industry, it also has the best level of engagement with its audience.
Likewise, we remain confident in the strategic importance of our recent acquisition of Opcity, which leverages applied analytics and machine learning to quickly match consumers with the right real estate professional. The ability to generate high-quality consumer leads for realtors through Opcity provides a new outlet to sustain revenue growth. This acquisition will involve some investment to increase capacity, but it is an investment in future growth.
We recently expanded Opcity to a number of test markets, offering an exclusive performance-based experience to consumers and the industry. We believe that providing higher-quality leads to realtors is part of the changing U.S. property market and will result in higher-quality returns for realtor.com. There is still much potential for growth in the sector, which is at a relatively early stage of digital development. And we expect the sectoral and cyclical wins to be more favorable over the coming year.
Turning to Book Publishing. HarperCollins once again delivered an impressive performance this quarter, with standout hits in our Christian division from best-selling author Rachel Hollis, whose previous title Girl, Wash Your Face has already sold over 3 million units and her latest, Girl, Stop Apologizing, shipped another 1 million. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5%, which included 32% growth in downloadable audiobooks. Digital in the aggregate represented 21% of consumer revenues this quarter. Meanwhile, the HarperCollins backlist contributed approximately 63% of consumer revenues in the quarter.
HarperCollins has been strengthening its reach in the U.S. book buying heartland. It is peerless in commissioning new authors, in its savvy editing and in its first-class marketing for best-in-class books. One recent example of the success of the strategy is the latest book from Joanna Gaines, We are the Gardeners. And Ben Shapiro's book, The Right Side of History, is now a bestseller in print and e-book. These successes enhance the bottom line with a 12.6% segment EBITDA margin in the quarter compared to 10.3% in the prior year.
Prospects with News Corp are certainly positive, given the performance thus far in this fiscal year, which is a direct result of the strategic and digital initiatives across our businesses. There is no doubt that the content landscape is changing and that we are seeing more people prepared to pay more for trusted news and innovative entertainment delivered efficiently, seamlessly to their mobile phone or home devices.
For more details on this quarter's results, I now turn to Susan Panuccio."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenues were nearly $2.5 billion, up 17% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $247 million, up 36% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 2% and EBITDA decreased 4%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.02 as compared to a loss of $1.94 in the prior year, which included a noncash write-down related to Foxtel as well as noncash impairment charges at News America Marketing and Fox Sports Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.06 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $52 million or 4% negative impact and was responsible for most of the decline. Approximately 31% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year.
Advertising revenues for the segment accounted for 48% of segment revenues and were down 9% versus the prior year with approximately $23 million or 4% due to negative currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 44% of segment revenues, were relatively flat versus the prior year, this despite foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $22 million or 4%.
Within the segment, revenues at Dow Jones rose 1%, News UK and News America Marketing declined 8% and News Australia declined 7%. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, 73% of revenues are reoccurring and subscription-based, relating to either consumer products primarily for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's or business-to-business through our Professional Information Business, or PIB, which includes Risk and Compliance, Factiva and Dow Jones news live. Consumer circulation revenues again grew 7% benefiting from 19% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to nearly 1.8 million as well as the benefit of higher subscription pricing, ranging from an additional $2 to $6 per month.
Digital paid subscribers accounted for 68% of total subscribers at The Wall Street Journal, up from 62% last year. This quarter, we added net 66,000 new subscribers. In addition, subscribers for Barron's and the Financial News in the U.K., grew 28% from the prior year, resulting in an overall subscriber -- subscription for Dow Jones consumer products reaching almost 3.3 million, achieving record levels. Of that, over 2.1 million is digital-only. We also saw stable low single-digit revenue growth at PIB despite currency headwinds, led by 22% revenue growth from Risk and Compliance, which remains its growth engine as Robert mentioned and a core differentiator versus the industry.
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones fell approximately 8% compared to the prior year, which was weaker than the prior quarter, with the variance versus the second quarter mostly due to digital advertising although we expect to show an improvement in the fourth quarter rate. 
Elsewhere across our news portfolio, at News Australia, advertising declined 9% compared to the prior year but rose 1% in local currency due to the acquisition of Medium Rare, an integrated content agency business, and digital advertising growth. We saw further weakness in the print advertising market. In the U.K., advertising fell 11% versus the prior year or down 5% in local currency due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had a challenging prior year comparison, partially offset by a sequential improvement in digital advertising growth at both The Sun and The Times. Now as Robert mentioned, modest improvement in print advertising revenues at The Times.
Importantly, we saw accelerating year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% year-over-year to 286,000 and at News Australia, up 21% year-over-year to 493,000. That, along with cover price increases, allowed both markets to post modest gains in circulation and subscription revenues, excluding currency headwinds.
Finally, revenues at News America Marketing fell 8% as growth in U.S. in-store advertising, which is the biggest contributor to NAM revenues, was more than offset by continued weakness in freestanding [ in-set ] products. 
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $73 million, down approximately 16% due primarily to News America Marketing, mostly a function of the top line weakness. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $539 million versus $129 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $98 million versus $16 million in the prior year. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel. 
On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $84 million or 13% compared with the prior year. $53 million of the decline or 9% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports. Broadcast ARPU was over AUD 79 or down 1% versus the prior year as the impact of the price increase was more than offset by the impact from the new revenue recognition standards. Compared to the second quarter, broadcast ARPU rose nearly 2%, reflecting a price increase last quarter. We also saw a sequential and year-over-year improvement in Foxtel Now's ARPU due to a price increase last quarter.
Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $29 million, down 23% compared to the prior year and a moderation from last quarter. The year-over-year decline reflects higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $25 million of costs related to Cricket Australia, lower revenues and $10 million for marketing related to Kayo Sports. These were partially offset by lower overhead and other corporate expenses as well as lower entertainment programming costs.
On key operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of March 31, up over 5% against the prior year, driven by higher Kayo Sports and Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia.
Compared to the second quarter, we had a modest increase in sequential subscriber growth as higher Kayo subscriptions more than offset broadcast declines. We are making good progress in our OTT strategy, which is helping drive volume growth of Foxtel. As Robert mentioned, as of May 8, we had over 239,000 total Kayo Sports subscribers, of which 209,000 were paying, more than double our last update. 
We also had over 567,000 Foxtel Now subscribers as of May 8, of which more than 505,000 are paying, which is an increase of 45% in paying subscribers from quarter end, driven by the demand for Game of Thrones.
In the third quarter, broadcast churn was 17.7% versus 15.3% in the prior year, higher than we had anticipated, although the majority of churn is coming from lower-value, shorter-tenured customers, many without contract. Importantly, sports customer churn on broadcast has been relatively stable at only 6%.
As we mentioned last quarter, Foxtel has launched proactive churn management initiatives focused on customized solutions for retention and winback, and we are seeing real progress in recent weeks. March churn was down to 16.2% and to around 15.1% in April. Moreover, unlike in recent periods, promotions and new broadcast sales are predominantly with 12-month contracts, which should also help the churn reduction moving forward.
Capital expenditures related to the new Foxtel was $223 million in the first 9 months. We now expect full year CapEx to be higher than the prior year's level by $25 million or less, which is lower than our previous expectations.
Stepping back. As we have previously indicated, this year was always going to be a big transition year for the new Foxtel, and segment EBITDA performance has been impacted by reinvestments, which have a longer payback period. On this, there are a few points I'd like to make. 
We see OTT as a big revenue driver that will have higher contribution margins, given we are leveraging mostly fixed costs for previously acquired rights. And we are encouraged by the recent performance of Kayo and Foxtel Now. We believe we can stabilize broadcast churn via proactive churn management and a higher penetration of next-generation boxes, which materially reduce churn. Approximately 43% of households now have either the iQ3 or iQ4 box, up 400 basis points from last quarter. As mentioned, we are seeing good progress on that front.
As we lap the Cricket investment, we would expect programming costs to grow at a much more modest rate after this year, and we will continue to thoroughly review our content lineup for additional savings. We see an opportunity to reduce nonprogramming costs, including the ability to flex the variable components of the cost base like marketing and broader overhead costs. 
Finally on the Foxtel debt structure, we continue to evaluate numerous options to provide Foxtel with more financial flexibility and an optimal capital structure. To that end, we have contributed AUD 300 million via shareholder loans, which cover the repayment of April maturities.
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter driven by a strong release slate which included in Christian publishing, Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis and We are the Gardeners by Joanna Gaines. U.K. revenues were also higher, helped by Fing, a new release from David Walliams. Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $421 million and would have been notably higher excluding negative impacts from revenue recognition and currency. Segment EBITDA increased 29% to $53 million despite a much more challenging prior year comparison than the second quarter.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 3% to $272 million as growth was more than offset by currency headwinds. Currency had a $16 million negative impact to revenues in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3%. 
REA Group revenues were down 4% but up 6% in local currency due to residential [ debt ] growth in Australia, driven by increased yield and higher penetration for Premiere All. This growth was partially offset by an overall 9% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter, which included pronounced declines in both Sydney and Melbourne, down 18% and 12%, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 5% to $121 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 14% resulting from higher yield and growth in buy-side leads volume, albeit at a slower rate due to a more challenging U.S. housing marketplace as well as the transfer of leads to Opcity. It is worth noting that Opcity is performance-based, and as we migrate leads to that model, we monetize differently, and this does delay revenue recognition with early data indicating an average delay of 4 months from initial lead inquiry. 
As Robert alluded to earlier, we have been live testing in a handful of small markets converting to performance-only model, and last week, we expanded to over a dozen markets, big and small, as we test the scalability of the platform. These markets include, among others, Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland and Nashville. We expect to reallocate resources primarily within realtor.com teams in order to be more streamlined and much better positioned for financial year '20.
Revenue this quarter was also negatively impacted by the continued reduction of nonlisted advertising inventory, similar to the first half, as part of an initiative to improve the consumer experience and engagement. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 65 million for the quarter, rising 7% versus the prior year. 
Segment EBITDA fell 16% to $74 million. The quarter reflected additional costs related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 9%.
I would now like to mention a few themes for the fiscal fourth quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising performance to remain relatively similar to the third quarter rate, and we expect to continue to expand our digital subscribers while seeking further cost efficiencies. In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be more modest in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see increased contribution from OTT revenues. On a reported basis, we will be lapping the consolidation of Foxtel.
In Book Publishing, we will face particularly tough comps as in the prior year, we recognized $28 million in revenue and $21 million in EBITDA due to the sublicensing agreement for The Lord of the Rings trilogy with Amazon. At Digital Real Estate Services, listing volumes in Australia remain challenged, impacted by Easter and Anzac Day and in anticipation of the federal election in May. In the U.S., we expect continued reinvestment as we continue to test and monitor the scalability of Opcity.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

News Corp completed fiscal year 2019 in a strong position with revenues increasing 12% and profitability rising 16% against the prior year, reflecting not only the consolidation of Foxtel but also the continued strength and development of co",2104,"Thanks, Mike. News Corp completed fiscal year 2019 in a strong position with revenues increasing 12% and profitability rising 16% against the prior year, reflecting not only the consolidation of Foxtel but also the continued strength and development of core segments of the company, including Book Publishing, and Digital Real Estate Services, and substantial progress and the digital transformation of our News and Information Services businesses.
The concerted focus on our primary revenue drivers, including the creation and distribution of premium content, was reflected in audience growth across News Corp's milestones and digital properties. We are also acutely focused on simplifying the structure of the company and making clear the full value of the sum of our parts. To that end, we recently announced a strategic review of News America Marketing including a potential sale of the business. We have received material interest and the process is progressing rather well.
There is clearly a fundamental shift underway in the content landscape. And one consequence, other than intensifying regulatory scrutiny of big digital, is a gradual transference of value to content creators who over the past decade have lost influence in revenue to their digital distributors. With [indiscernible] encouragement, News Corp has been advocating vigorously on behalf of journalists, journalism and the protection of intellectual property and that intense, sometimes solidarity's advocacy, has begun to pay dividends for journalism and importantly, for our shareholders. We are still at a relatively early stage of this tectonic transformation, but there will surely be an ongoing transfer of value to creators in coming years, which should be a great benefit to News Corp and its investors.
We have begun partnering with companies such as Apple and Twitter, which recognize the value of our content. And discussions are underway with other digital companies, though I am not at liberty at this moment to provide more detail. What I can say is that the terms of trade and the tenor of our talks are now vastly different to even a year ago. 
In fiscal 2019, the News and Information Services segment posted higher profitability which was spurred by the rapid rise of digital paid subscribers. The Wall Street Journal, the Times and Sunday Times and The Australian all grew subscriber volumes at a healthy rate with digital now accounting for the majority of their subscribers. There is an emerging subscription sensibility among consumers which is obviously to our benefit, but we are also conscious of the need to provide ever better service to those subscribers who rightly have high expectations for their digital experience.
Dow Jones is a media business that we believe has a distinctive ability to prosper in the digital age. The Wall Street Journal recorded 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers who now account for over 69% of the total subscriber base of 2.6 million. Circulation revenue trends at Dow Jones remained robust, rising 7% for the year, well above the rates of the New York Times and others in the industry. Since separation in 2013, Dow Jones' consumer circulation revenues have grown more than [ 40%. ] And within that category, digital revenues at the Wall Street Journal had expanded by almost 150%. 
Advertising trends improved in Q4 for the Wall Street Journal. And in July, both print and digital advertising revenue were higher than a year earlier.
As we look to the future, we believe that Dow Jones could attract a significantly larger subscription base by directions, subscriptions and through content partnerships. We have particular optimism about the international potential of Dow Jones given the relatively low non-U.S. share, 12% of subscribers today. We are also seeing the increasing ability of the Dow Jones team, deploying customized artificial intelligence to sell specialist Financial News and data products to professional and wealthy individuals subscribers. 
The Dow Jones professional information business posted revenue growth for the second consecutive year after a period of transition, overcoming currency headwinds. An important driver of that growth has been the Risk and Compliance business, which grew 24% for the full fiscal year to exceed $130 million of revenues at attractive margins. Impressively, that business has more than quadrupled in size since its separation 6 years ago. Obviously, companies around the world are focused on maximizing compliance and minimizing risk. So we are confident that there will be continuing growth in that sector.
In addition, Dow Jones will pass news coverage, and analysis is now aggregated on the Bloomberg terminal, significantly extending the reach and impact of Dow Jones' trusted high-quality journalism and analysis and enabling us to inform a larger total audience. Over the past fiscal year, along with other new partnership arrangements, Dow Jones news wise is now available on more than 300,000 additional terminals. These partnerships make our newswires the most widely available professional newswire services in the world.
In the U.K. in constant currency, The Times of London grew print advertising revenues for the second consecutive year. Digital paid subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 304,000, while regulatory approval was received this month for the sharing of resources by The Times and Sunday Times. Clearly, the change should result in operation efficiencies while we will be assiduous in protecting the unique identity of each of those iconic mastheads.
Wireless Group posted its highest ratings ever in the April to June period. Chris Evans, the legendary radio broadcaster who joined Wireless Group's Virgin Radio last year, reached 1.1 million listeners a week across the U.K. during that period. In fact, Virgin Radio continues to be the fastest growing station in the U.K., both in reach and listening hours.
Meanwhile, Fox Sports hold record audience speakers with 3.3 million weekly listeners across the network in the quarter. Under Rebekah Brook's, expert leadership, we are ensuring that the fearless forecast skills of Wireless are being deployed to improve the quality of the audio products elsewhere in the U.K. to take advantage of rapidly increasing podcast amount.
In Australia, our focus on growth paid off through an improvement in profitability for the year, driven in part by an increase in digital subscription which now exceed 517,000, up 24% year-on-year with The Australian, a notably strong performer.
At the same time, news.com.au has remained the #1 website for 20 consecutive months, well ahead of its rivals with its monthly unique visitor number topping 10 million and total visitors at over 91 million in June.
News Australia is also benefiting from the acceleration in digital advertising, including expansion of News Xtend, the small to medium business solution and from its cost reduction efforts. We are confident that Michael Miller and his talented team are well-positioned to extend their operational success into fiscal 2020.
At the New York Post, the cover price was doubled to $2 in metropolitan markets, the first increase in 7 years and one reason for improved financial results at The Post. And The Post digital network continues to be strong with audience numbers averaging more than 101 million unique users per month according to Google Analytics. 
In the Subscription Video Services segment, the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports was completed in April 2018. And throughout fiscal 2019, the new business has been focused on delivering premium content and experiences to customers and rapidly expanding our streaming services, which have grown markedly over the past year. Foxtel is underpinned by a large and loyal broadcast subscriber base and unique content across sports, entertainment, documentaries and news. As of the end of the fiscal year, Foxtel's total paid subscribers grew to over 3.1 million, led by the success of our new sports streaming product, Kayo, and continued expansion of Foxtel Now, where the number of its subscribers increased by 36% from the prior year to 446,000 at year-end. 
Kayo, which is launched in November 2018, showed a material acceleration in subscriber additions into the year-end with over 330,000 paid subscribers as of June 30, a doubling since last quarter. Worth noting is Kayo's high level of audience engagement with 90% of subscribers using it each week, watching an average of 8.5 hours of sports content across an average of 6 different sports.
In total, our streaming base in Australia has nearly doubled since calendar year-end to approximately 777,000. It is notable that the growth in Kayo subscribers between the third and fourth quarter has actually been accompanied by a decline in average churn among sports tier subscriber to Foxtel broadcast over the same period.
We announced in July the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's iQ3 and iQ4 set-top boxes which, along with a new user interface, creates a unified content discovery experience for our customers and strengthens our position in the market as the preeminent creator and aggregator of the broadest range of programming. At the same time, the consolidation of Foxtel and Fox Sports has obviously provided an opportunity to review our cost base without undermining the quality of service or programming.
At Digital Real Estate Services, despite housing market headwinds, both REA and realtor.com strengthened their competitive position by continuing to innovate and expand audience. Signs of improvement in the U.S. housing market are emerging with realtor.com traffic at record levels. Industry rates declining, [indiscernible] volumes on the rise and pending home sales rising 2.8% in June. Last November, Tracey Fellows was promoted to President of global Digital Real Estate, underscoring our company's increasing commitment to the sector, which has been an engine of growth since we separated in 2013. In fact, over that period, segment revenues have tripled through a combination of rapid growth in REA in Australia and acquisitions in the U.S. and Asia. We are in the process of a major transformation of realtor.com, underscored by the recent acquisition of Opcity and guided by our goal of providing consumers with a superior home buying and selling experience.
While that acquisition and the migration towards a performance-based model naturally had an impact in revenues and investment last year, it represents a commitment to future growth by increasing the quality of connections between consumers and real estate professionals and heightening our potential to maximize the value of those interactions. We believe our focus on quality connections also increases our ability to generate additional revenue across the home buying and selling experience, from mortgage origination to the inevitable spending done by every family during the a profoundly important process of moving home. 
REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite the soft listing environment in the second half of the year. For the year, REA extended its lead over Domain, generating nearly 3x total visits. The company is continuing to create products that provide genuine value for ambitious agents. A federal election in May in Australia obviously contributed to economic uncertainty, but the political situation has clearly stabilized and the government is taking measures that should stimulate the housing market. 
We also made good progress in Asia through iProperty with healthy revenue growth despite fluctuating economic and political conditions.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins slide this year with new releases and a strong backlist, filling a 6% increase in EBITDA despite a tough comparison with 2018. We should benefit from a onetime lucrative licensing contract for J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. As Tolkien himself wrote, all's well that ends better. That is certainly true of the downloadable audiobooks, for which revenues rose 40% for the year. There is patently a fundamental shift in listening habits under way, and we should expect double-digit growth to continue in the current year.
Brian Murray and the HarperCollins team are finding new ways to make the most of our content and enhance the profile of our audience. We have just announce a partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment in Hollywood and Elizabeth Gable and her former Fox 2000 team to develop programming and films from of the remarkable HarperCollins catalog. We have also announced an agreement through our Harlequin imprint with [indiscernible] Major in Canada to produce movies from Harlequin's extensive library of more than 30,000 titles.
The most successful book of the year was a standout hits from our Christian division by best-selling author, Rachel Hollis. This debut and follow-up books, Girl, Wash Your Face; and Girl, Stop Apologizing, together shipped more than 5 million units during the year. We also saw great success with David Williams, including Ice Monster and World's Worst Teachers; and Mark Manson had continuing success with his sequel to The Subtle of not Giving A expletive, with Everything is expletive. 
With that book title, I will hand the call over to Susan for an unvarnished account of our fourth quarter and full year 2019."

Before I preview this year's end quarter financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past fiscal year where we've made significant progress. Firstly, we're making notable progress in stabilizing the News and Informatio",2748,"Thank you, Robert. Before I preview this year's end quarter financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past fiscal year where we've made significant progress. 
Firstly, we're making notable progress in stabilizing the News and Information Services sector and entered our fiscal year on a positive note. Our digital paid subscriber base continues to grow while we continue to focus on streamlining our critical space and investing in new revenue streams. Importantly, the segment posted a higher profitability this year with improvement across our key news publishing business units, the first time you've seen this improvement since the company's separation. We will remain focused on these areas in the coming year, and we are optimistic we can build on the current use of [indiscernible]
Secondly, the team at Foxtel has made steady progress on its over-the-top offering, including a successful launch of Kayo in November and further improvement to its premium broadcast product. Foxtel returned to volume growth, ending the year at the highest closing paid subscriber base since separation. And now with the core platforms in hub, they are focused on improving the path to revenue and profit growth. 
The performance in our Book Publishing segment this year underscores the value of content global distribution network, posting record profitability even when facing a very challenging rider year comparable. Given the rapid rise of downloadable audiobooks and the explosion in demand for premium content globally, we continue to explore ways that HarperCollins can leverage its highly valued content into other media. As Robert mentioned, recent examples of these efforts are our announced partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment and also with media in Canada our Harlequin division. These are deals with minimal capital outlay which have the potential to monetize content more broadly. 
Our businesses in the Digital Real Estate Services segment made strategic acquisitions, expanded their product offering and continue to capture audience share amid a challenging global healthy market. We feel positive about our pace of innovation and investment and believe this segment is well-positioned going into fiscal 2020.
And finally, we continue to actively look at our portfolio. In June, we announced at News America Marketing is undergoing a strategic review, including actively exploring a sale, and that process is ongoing. 
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results.
For the full year fiscal 2019, total revenues were $10.1 billion, a 12% increase compared to the prior year. Reported results for fiscal 2019 include the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, significant currency headwinds and other items as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 1%.
Total segment EBITDA for the year was $1.24 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year, a 16% increase over the prior-year period. Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the year rose 4%. 
Full year dilution in earnings per share were $0.26 compared to a loss of $2.60 in the prior year, primarily driven by the absence of the noncash impairment charges and write-downs of $1.2 billion recognized in fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $0.46 versus $0.44 in the prior year. 
Free cash flow available to the company for the year were [ $213 million, ] which included a step up in capital expenditures related to the consolidation of Foxtel. 
And now to the quarterly financial data. We reported fiscal 2019 fourth quarter total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, due in part to the $105 million impact from continued currency headwind. Adjusted revenues declined 5%.
Total segment EBITDA for the quarter was $269 million compared to $314 million in the prior year, down 14%. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 8%. 
For the quarter, loss per share was $0.09 compared to a loss of [ $0.64 ] a year ago with the improvement mainly due to the absence of the write-off of the Fox Sports Australia channel distribution agreement last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.07 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down approximately 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $40 million or 3% negative impact and was responsible for the majority of the decline. Digital revenues to Dow Jones and the newspaper markets represented 37% of combined revenue. Approximately 33% of the segments revenue were digital, up from 30% in the prior year. 
Advertising revenues for the segment was down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year with approximately [ $18 million ] or 2% due to negative currency fluctuations.
Circulation and subscription revenues with a prior year despite $17 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $108 million, up 14% over the prior year and a very strong improvement from the last [ 2 ] quarters, primarily driven by News America Marketing but also benefiting positive contribution from Dow Jones and News U.K.
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, the consumer circulation revenues in the fourth quarter remained robust, growing 7% for the fourth consecutive quarter, benefiting from 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at the Wall Street Journal to over 1.8 million as well a subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for over 69% of total subscriber from the Wall Street Journal, which is up from over 64% last year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Financial News in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record level. Of that, the digital-only subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to 2.2 million subscribers.
Over the same period, Barron's expanded its total subscriber base to 579,000, a 16% year-over-year increase. 
Within the professional information business, risk and compliance grew 23% in the quarter compared to the prior year and as expected exceeded $139 million in revenues this year. We continue to expect significant growth ahead as we expand our product range. Overall, our professional information business grew [ 2% ] this quarter. 
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarters was flat, a notable improvement from last quarter led by an improvement in digital advertising as we had anticipated. For the quarter, digital advertising accounted for 40% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 39% last year.
[indiscernible] unused portfolio. Advertising conditions were overall relatively stable with last quarter. Advertising revenues at News Australia and News U.K. declined 8% and 7%, respectively, yet both were down only 1% in local currency compared to the prior year, benefiting from higher digital advertising revenues. Pleasingly, The Times in the U.K. grew fleet advertising revenue in local currency for the seventh consecutive quarter.
On circulation, our digital subscribers around the globe are growing at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% to 304,000 at The Times and the Sunday Times. And they also have approximately 5 million registered users, which is both [indiscernible] subscriber acquisition and an advertising opportunity as we continue to leverage our increasing audience scale. 
At News Australia, paid digital subscribers rose over 24% year-over-year to more than 517,000, which include 146,000 digital and bundled subscribed at The Australian. The increase in digital subscription along with cover price increases at News U.K. and News Australia allowed both markets to mitigate print volume decline in currency headwind. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 6% driven by continued weakness in freestanding insert products but partially offset by in-store product growth. Cost initiatives help contribute high profitability in the quarter.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter was $536 million, down the 12% versus $610 million a year ago, of which $44 million or 7% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency.
Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $85 million, down 12% with the prior year.
From the fourth quarter, we are now comparing like-for-like as we completed the Foxtel consolidation and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base rose to over 3.1 million as of June 30, with volume growing 12% versus the prior year. First was driven by Kayo, strong adoption of Foxtel Now and the inclusion of commercial subscribers at Foxtel Australia. Of that subscriber base, approximately 2.4 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers and remain consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now subscription.
We are making steady progress in our OTT strategy, with Kayo claiming subscribers at 331,000 as of June 30, up by over [ 120,000 ] since our last update on May 8 and more than doubled since the third, quarter driven by the Cricket World Cup and the expansion of our distribution channel. Including trials, the total paid subscriber base reached approximately 382,000. Pleasingly thus far, Kayo is not forming a material chain in Foxtel broadcast customer base with an estimated 5% of Foxtel disconnection since Kayo's launch being driven by customers moving to Kayo.
Foxtel Now also performed strongly with total paying subscribers reaching over 446,000 as of June 30, up 36% from last year. While this is down from the May 8 update to due to the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, Foxtel has been focused on retention, and overall, the product has exceeded our expectations. In the aggregate, Foxtel had a strong and growing base of OTT subscribers, which in total reached 842,000 subscribers at June 30, of which approximately 777,000 were paying subscribers, accounting for 25% of Foxtel's total paying subscriber base and is reflective of Foxtel strategy to monetize existing rights of a multiple platform.
In the fourth quarter, broadcast churn was 14.7% versus 12.5% in the prior year, reflective of a 300 basis points improvement from the third quarter. The outcome in the fourth quarter reflects early successes from leveraging analytics to reduce churn despite the price increases. In addition, the team is focus on stabilizing broadcast ARPU, which is more than AUD 78 in the quarter, down 1% versus last year.
Capital expenditures related to Foxtel where approximately USD 300 million for fiscal 2019 which is lower than what we had anticipated, and we expect sizable declines in fiscal 2020. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was subscriber related.
Finally, we issued Foxtel and AUD 200 million shareholder vote in May at a variable rate of approximately 9% as we continue to work with banks on refinancing upcoming maturity.
At Book Publishing, as expected, we faced an unusually strong prior year comparison with the prior year including a onetime revenue contribution of $28 million for the Tolkien sublicense to Amazon and the release of Magnolia Table by Joanna Gain. 
Revenues for the quarter decreased 14% to $419 million due to the fact that I just noted as well as approximately [ $18 million ] of negative impact from the new revenue recognition standard.
Segment EBITDA fell to $44 million from $72 million, with the biggest factor impacting profitability being the absence of the Tolkien deal from the prior year. Notwithstanding the fourth quarter results, HarperCollins have had a very strong year and outperformed our expectations. HarperCollins posted high digital revenues in the quarter and a fiscal year rate by the continued expansion of downloadable audio, which accounts for approximately 1/3 of digital sales today. They will also move to capitalize on momentum in and depth of their backlist to generate longer term incremental revenues as they have done via the new deals in Bell Media.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $283 million, primarily related to currency headwinds of $13 million. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. 
REA grew -- revenues were down 6% and up 1% in local currency as higher yield and increased debt penetration was offset by an overall 19% year-over-year decline in the existing volume during the quarter, which was notably weaker than the third quarter and full year rate of 9% and 8% declines, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and the conference call following this call for additional data and comments on their outlook.
News revenues rose 3% to $123 million versus the prior year with real estate revenues growing 8%. The increase in real estate revenues, which represents 77% of total revenue, reflect higher yield per lease, a slight improvement in volume and the acquisition of Opcity. While lead volumes remain subdued, the business did see an improvement in run rates in June, which should build momentum to this coming fiscal year.
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing of performance-based early model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact on scalability of this platform. Early results have been promising, with improvements in engagement and leasing rates, which we expect to drive higher conversion rates.
During fiscal 2020, we will continue to allocate lead flow to Opcity, although we expect that in most markets, we will be offering both our existing connection SaaS products along with the Opcity concierge model. We have, as mentioned last quarter, began to reallocate resources within the realtor.com team to better position and streamline the business to this year and beyond. 
On audience, we saw an acceleration versus the third quarter growth rate and reached monthly unique users at realtor.com to a record 72 million for the quarter, rising 14% versus the prior year together with notable pickup in engagement.
Segment EBITDA fell 15% to $84 million similar to the third quarter rate. The decline was driven by higher investment in Opcity and the $5 million negative impact from currency. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA decreased 7%.
I would now like to mention a few themes to the fiscal 2020 year. At News and Information Services, while advertising visibility remains limited, the revenue mix is becoming less dependent on print, and we are encouraged by the pace of global uptake of paid digital subscribers. In fact, excluding Nam, the majority of segment's revenue will be circulation and subscription revenues. So far, the advertising trends are similar to slightly better in the current quarter, and we continue to remain digital while reinvesting in our digital offerings.
Overall, our expectation is a show further stability in this segment and it is pleasing that we finish the year with some strength. We do note the first quarter will face a challenging comparisons due to the $48 million benefit in the prior year related to News U.K.'s exit of the gaining partnership with [indiscernible] 
In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be modest in fiscal 2020 absent currency fluctuation. We will have one additional quarter of domestic especially approximately USD 20 million before lapping the rights and some additional OTT expenses as we drive further penetration. This will be in conjunction with our continued efforts to seek cost efficiencies. We also expect a noncash impact of approximately $30 million to $35 million in fiscal 2020 related to a change in amortization methodologies entertainment programming. We expect CapEx in the Foxtel to decline by approximately 20% compared to fiscal 2019 and overall expect higher cash generation from this business.
In Book Publishing, we will face tougher comparison to the fiscal year given the outperformance in fiscal 2019. However, we are confident with our slate of title, which will be headlined a new releases from Regent Raymond, Ajay Sims, Daniel Silver and David Dwellings in the U.K. among others, along with expect continued growth and with billable audiobooks. Fiscal third quarter releases includes Daniel Silva's The New Girl and The dutch Child as well as addition of [indiscernible] The Art of Racing in the Rain, which will hit the movie theaters this weekend. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, despite a challenging market in Australia, REA should benefit from higher penetration and higher pricing. Please refer to REA's call for a more detailed outlook.

Just in relation to the cost, they declined 7%, but down 4% on an adjusted basis. So cost distribution, Dow Jones cost are up, but we would expect that to be up given the subscriber growth and the investments that we have in the DIB business in risk and compliance. Across of the other businesses in the U.K. and Australia posted a decline, and within them, clearly cost declined by around 12% year-on-year. We are expecting to see cost continue to increase across the U.K. and Australia. We have been quite vocal about that over the past couple of years. The teams across the U.K. and Australia are very focused on cost reduction and continue to look at ways that they can innovate and drive costs, particularly out of the back office and some of the distribution chain And you would also expect to see Dow Jones investing in that business going forward. But I would say that overall, we do balance the cost reductions with investment even within the U.K. and Australia because it's important that we can support that digital growth coming through in the businesses."

News Corp completed fiscal year 2019 in a strong position with revenues increasing 12% and profitability rising 16% against the prior year, reflecting not only the consolidation of Foxtel but also the continued strength and development of core segments of the company, including Book Publishing, and Digital Real Estate Services, and substantial progress and the digital transformation of our News and Information Services businesses.
The concerted focus on our primary revenue drivers, including the creation and distribution of premium content, was reflected in audience growth across News Corp's milestones and digital properties. We are also acutely focused on simplifying the structure of the company and making clear the full value of the sum of our parts. To that end, we recently announced a strategic review of News America Marketing, including a potential sale of the business. We have received material interest and the process is progressing rather well.
There is clearly a fundamental shift underway in the content landscape. And one consequence, other than intensifying regulatory scrutiny of big digital, is a gradual transference of value to content creators who over the past decade have lost influence in revenue to their digital distributors. With words of encouragement, News Corp has been advocating vigorously on behalf of journalists, journalism and the protection of intellectual property and that intense, sometimes solidarity's advocacy, has begun to pay dividends for journalism and importantly, for our shareholders. We are still at a relatively early stage of this tectonic transformation, but there will surely be an ongoing transfer of value to creators in coming years, which should be a great benefit to News Corp and its investors.
We have begun partnering with companies such as Apple and Twitter, which recognize the value of our content. And discussions are underway with other digital companies, though I am not at liberty at this moment to provide more detail. What I can say is that the terms of trade and the tenor of our talks are now vastly different to even a year ago. 
In fiscal 2019, the News and Information Services segment posted higher profitability which was spurred by the rapid rise of digital paid subscribers. The Wall Street Journal, the Times and Sunday Times and The Australian all grew subscriber volumes at a healthy rate with digital now accounting for the majority of their subscribers. There is an emerging subscription sensibility among consumers which is obviously to our benefit, but we are also conscious of the need to provide ever better service to those subscribers who rightly have high expectations for their digital experience.
Dow Jones is a media business that we believe has a distinctive ability to prosper in the digital age. The Wall Street Journal recorded 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers who now account for over 69% of the total subscriber base of 2.6 million. Circulation revenue trends at Dow Jones remained robust, rising 7% for the year, well above the rates of the New York Times and others in the industry. Since separation in 2013, Dow Jones' consumer circulation revenues have grown more than 40%. And within that category, digital revenues at the Wall Street Journal had expanded by almost 150%. 
Advertising trends improved in Q4 for The Wall Street Journal. And in July, both print and digital advertising revenue were higher than a year earlier.
As we look to the future, we believe that Dow Jones could attract a significantly larger subscription base by directions, subscriptions and through content partnerships. We have particular optimism about the international potential of Dow Jones given the relatively low non-U.S. share, 12% of subscribers today. We are also seeing the increasing ability of the Dow Jones team, deploying customized artificial intelligence to sell special Financial News and data products to professional and wealthy individuals subscribers. 
The Dow Jones professional information business posted revenue growth for the second consecutive year after a period of transition, overcoming currency headwinds. An important driver of that growth has been the Risk and Compliance business, which grew 24% for the full fiscal year to exceed $130 million of revenues at attractive margins. Impressively, that business has more than quadrupled in size since its separation 6 years ago. Obviously, companies around the world are focused on maximizing compliance and minimizing risk. So we are confident that there will be continuing growth in that sector.
In addition, Dow Jones will pass news coverage, and analysis is now aggregated on the Bloomberg terminal, significantly extending the reach and impact of Dow Jones' trusted high-quality journalism and analysis and enabling us to inform a larger total audience. Over the past fiscal year, along with other new partnership arrangements, Dow Jones news wise is now available on more than 300,000 additional terminals. These partnerships make our newswires the most widely available professional newswire services in the world.
In the U.K., in constant currency, The Times of London grew print advertising revenues for the second consecutive year. Digital paid subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 304,000, while regulatory approval was received this month for the sharing of resources by The Times and Sunday Times. Clearly, the change should result in operation efficiencies while we will be assiduous in protecting the unique identity of each of those iconic mastheads.
Wireless Group posted its highest ratings ever in the April to June period. Chris Evans, the legendary radio broadcaster who joined Wireless Group's Virgin Radio last year, reached 1.1 million listeners a week across the U.K. during that period. In fact, Virgin Radio continues to be the fastest growing station in the U.K., both in reach and listening hours.
Meanwhile, Fox Sports hold record audience speakers with 3.3 million weekly listeners across the network in the quarter. Under Rebekah Brook's expert leadership, we are ensuring that the fearless forecast skills of Wireless are being deployed to improve the quality of the audio products elsewhere in the U.K. to take advantage of rapidly increasing podcast amount.
In Australia, our focus on growth paid off through an improvement in profitability for the year, driven in part by an increase in digital subscriptions which now exceed 517,000, up 24% year-on-year with The Australian, a notably strong performer.
At the same time, news.com.au has remained the #1 website for 20 consecutive months, well ahead of its rivals with its monthly unique visitor number topping 10 million and total visitors at over 91 million in June.
News Australia is also benefiting from the acceleration in digital advertising, including expansion of News Xtend, the small to medium business solution and from its cost reduction efforts. We are confident that Michael Miller and his talented team are well-positioned to extend their operational success into fiscal 2020.
At the New York Post, the cover price was doubled to $2 in metropolitan markets, the first increase in 7 years and one reason for improved financial results at The Post. And The Post digital network continues to be strong with audience numbers averaging more than 101 million unique users per month in the quarter, according to Google Analytics. 
In the Subscription Video Services segment, the combination of Foxtel and FOX SPORTS was completed in April 2018. And throughout fiscal 2019, the new business has been focused on delivering premium content and experiences to customers and rapidly expanding our streaming services, which have grown markedly over the past year. Foxtel is underpinned by a large and loyal broadcast subscriber base and unique content across sports, entertainment, documentaries and news. As of the end of the fiscal year, Foxtel's total paid subscribers grew to over 3.1 million, led by the success of our new sports streaming product, Kayo, and continued expansion of Foxtel Now, where the number of its subscribers increased by 36% from the prior year to 446,000 at year-end. 
Kayo, which is launched in November 2018, showed a material acceleration in subscriber additions into the year-end with over 330,000 paid subscribers as of June 30, a doubling since last quarter. Worth noting is Kayo's high level of audience engagement with 90% of subscribers using it each week, watching an average of 8.5 hours of sports content across an average of 6 different sports.
In total, our streaming base in Australia has nearly doubled since calendar year-end to approximately 777,000. It is notable that the growth in Kayo subscribers between the third and fourth quarter has actually been accompanied by a decline in average churn among sports tier subscribers to Foxtel broadcast over the same period.
We announced in July the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's iQ3 and iQ4 set-top boxes which, along with a new user interface, creates a unified content discovery experience for our customers and strengthens our position in the market as the preeminent creator and aggregator of the broadest range of programming. At the same time, the consolidation of Foxtel and Fox Sports has obviously provided an opportunity to review our cost base without undermining the quality of service or programming.
At Digital Real Estate Services, despite housing market headwinds, both REA and realtor.com strengthened their competitive position by continuing to innovate and expand audience. Signs of improvement in the U.S. housing market are emerging with realtor.com traffic at record levels. Industry rates declining, buyer lead volumes on the rise and pending home sales rising 2.8% in June. Last November, Tracey Fellows was promoted to President of Global Digital Real Estate, underscoring our company's increasing commitment to the sector, which has been an engine of growth since we separated in 2013. In fact, over that period, segment revenues have tripled through a combination of rapid growth in REA in Australia and acquisitions in the U.S. and Asia. We are in the process of a major transformation of realtor.com, underscored by the recent acquisition of Opcity and guided by our goal of providing consumers with a superior home buying and selling experience.
While that acquisition and the migration towards a performance-based model naturally had an impact in revenues and investment last year, it represents a commitment to future growth by increasing the quality of connections between consumers and real estate professionals and heightening our potential to maximize the value of those interactions. We believe our focus on quality connections also increases our ability to generate additional revenue across the home buying and selling experience, from mortgage origination to the inevitable spending done by every family during the profoundly important process of moving home. 
REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite the soft listing environment in the second half of the year. For the year, REA extended its lead over, domain generating nearly 3x as many total visits. The company is continuing to create products that provide genuine value for ambitious agents. A federal election in May in Australia obviously contributed to economic uncertainty, but the political situation has clearly stabilized and the government is taking measures that should stimulate the housing market. 
We also made good progress in Asia through iProperty with healthy revenue growth despite fluctuating economic and political conditions.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins slide this year with new releases and a strong backlist, filling a 6% increase in EBITDA despite a tough comparison with 2018. We should benefitted from a onetime lucrative licensing contract for J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. As Tolkien himself wrote, all's well that ends better. That is certainly true of the downloadable audiobooks, for which revenues rose 40% for the year. There is patently a fundamental shift in listening habits under way, and we should expect double-digit growth to continue in the current year.
Brian Murray and the HarperCollins team are finding new ways to make the most of our content and enhance the profile of our audience. We have just announced a partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment in Hollywood and Elizabeth Gabler and her former Fox 2000 team to develop programming and films from the remarkable HarperCollins catalog. We have also announced an agreement through our Harlequin imprint with Bell Media in Canada to produce movies from Harlequin's extensive library of more than 30,000 titles.
The most successful book of the year was a standout hits from our Christian division by best-selling author, Rachel Hollis. This debut and follow-up books: Girl, Wash Your Face; and Girl, Stop Apologizing, together shipped more than 5 million units during the year. We also saw great success with David Williams, including Ice Monster and World's Worst Teachers; and Mark Manson had continuing success with his sequel to The Subtle Art of Not Giving an Expletive, with Everything is Expletive. 
Without this book title, I will hand the call over to Susan for an unvarnished account of our fourth quarter and full year 2019."

Before I preview this year's end quarter financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past fiscal year where we've made significant progress. 
Firstly, we're making notable progress in stabilizing the News and Information Services sector and entered our fiscal year on a positive note. Our digital paid subscriber base continues to grow while we continue to focus on streamlining our critical space and investing in new revenue streams. Importantly, the segment posted a higher profitability this year with improvement across our key news publishing business units, the first time you've seen this improvement since the company's separation. We will remain focused on these areas in the coming year, and we are optimistic we can build on the current use of fifth.
Secondly, the team at Foxtel has made steady progress on its over-the-top offering, including a successful launch of Kayo in November and further improvement to its premium broadcast product. Foxtel returned to volume growth, ending the year at the highest closing paid subscriber base since separation. And now with the core platforms in hub, they are focused on improving a path to revenue and profit growth. 
The performance in our Book Publishing segment this year underscores the value of premium content and the advantage of a global distribution network, posting record profitability even when facing a very challenging prior year comparable. Given the rapid rise of downloadable audiobooks and the explosion in demand for premium content globally, we continue to explore ways that HarperCollins can see the leverage its highly valued content into other media. As Robert mentioned, recent examples of these efforts are our announced partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment and also with media in Canada our Harlequin division. These are deals with minimum capital outlay which have the potential to monetize content more broadly. 
Our businesses in the Digital Real Estate Services segment made strategic acquisitions, expanded their product offering and continue to capture audience share amid a challenging global healthy market. We feel positive about our pace of innovation and investment and believe this segment is well-positioned going into fiscal 2020.
And finally, we continue to actively look at our portfolio. In June, we announced that News America Marketing is undergoing a strategic review, including actively exploring sale, and that process is ongoing. 
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results.
For the full year fiscal 2019, total revenues were $10.1 billion, a 12% increase compared to the prior year. Reported results for fiscal 2019 include the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, significant currency headwinds and other items as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 1%.
Total segment EBITDA for the year was $1.24 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year, a 16% increase over the prior-year period. Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the year rose 4%. 
Full year dilution in earnings per share were $0.26 compared to a loss of $2.60 in the prior year, primarily driven by the absence of the noncash impairment charges and write-downs of $1.2 billion recognized in fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $0.46 versus $0.44 in the prior year. 
Free cash flow available to the company for the year were $213 million, which included a step up in capital expenditures related to the consolidation of Foxtel. 
And now to the quarterly financial data. We reported fiscal 2019 fourth quarter total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, due in part to the $105 million impact from continued currency headwind. Adjusted revenues declined 5%.
Total segment EBITDA for the quarter was $269 million compared to $314 million in the prior year, down 14%. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 8%. 
For the quarter, loss per share was $0.09 compared to a loss of $0.64a year ago with the improvement mainly due to the absence of the write-off of the FOX SPORTS Australia channel distribution agreement last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.07 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down approximately 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $40 million or 3% negative impact and was responsible for the majority of the decline Digital revenues to Dow Jones and the newspaper markets represented 37% of combined revenue. Approximately 33% of the segments revenue were digital, up from 30% in the prior year. 
Advertising revenues for the segment was down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year with approximately $18 million or 2% due to negative currency fluctuations.
Circulation and subscription revenues with a prior year despite $17 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $108 million, up 14% over the prior year and a very strong improvement from the last 2 quarters, primarily driven by News America Marketing but also benefiting positive contribution from Dow Jones and News U.K.
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, the consumer circulation revenues in the fourth quarter remained robust, growing 7% for the fourth consecutive quarter, benefiting from 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to over 1.8 million as well a subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for over 69% of total subscriber from The Wall Street Journal, which is up from over 64% last year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Financial News in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record level. Of that, the digital-only subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to 2.2 million subscribers.
Over the same period, Barron's expanded its total subscriber base to 579,000, a 16% year-over-year increase. 
Within the professional information business, Risk and Compliance grew 23% in the quarter compared to the prior year and as expected, exceeded $139 million in revenues this year. We continue to expect significant growth ahead as we expand our product range. Overall, our professional information business grew 2% this quarter. 
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarters was flat, a notable improvement from last quarter led by an improvement in digital advertising as we had anticipated. For the quarter, digital advertising accounted for 40% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 39% last year.
Elsewhere across our portfolio, advertising conditions were overall relatively stable with last quarter. Advertising revenues at News Australia and News U.K. declined 8% and 7%, respectively, yet both were down only 1% in local currency compared to the prior year, benefiting from higher digital advertising revenues. Pleasingly, The Times in the U.K. grew fleet advertising revenue in local currency for the seventh consecutive quarter.
On circulation, our digital subscribers around the globe are growing at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% to 304,000 at The Times and the Sunday Times. And they also have approximately 5 million registered users, which is both a source of subscriber acquisitions and an advertising opportunity as we continue to leverage our increasing audience scale. 
At News Australia, paid digital subscribers rose over 24% year-over-year to more than 517,000, which include 146,000 digital and bundled subscribed at The Australian. The increase in digital subscription along with cover price increases at News U.K. and News Australia allowed both markets to mitigate print volume decline in currency headwind.  
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 6% driven by continued weakness in free-standing insert products but partially offset by in-store product growth. Cost initiatives help NAM contribute high profitability in the quarter.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter was $536 million, down the 12% versus $610 million a year ago, of which $44 million or 7% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency.
Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $85 million, down 12% with the prior year.
From the fourth quarter, we are now comparing like-for-like as we completed the Foxtel consolidation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base rose to over 3.1 million as of June 30, with volume growing 12% versus the prior year. First was driven by Kayo, strong adoption of Foxtel Now and the inclusion of commercial subscribers at Foxtel Australia. Of that subscriber base, approximately 2.4 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers and remain consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now subscription.
We are making steady progress in our OTT strategy, with Kayo claiming subscribers at 331,000 as of June 30, up by over 120,000 since our last update on May 8 and more than doubled since the third quarter, driven by the Cricket World Cup and the expansion of our distribution channel. Including trials, the total paid subscriber base reached approximately 382,000. Pleasingly thus far, Kayo is not forming a material chain in Foxtel broadcast customer base with an estimated 5% of Foxtel disconnection since Kayo's launch being driven by customers moving to Kayo.
Foxtel Now also performed strongly with total paying subscribers reaching over 446,000 as of June 30, up 36% from last year. While this is down from the May 8 update to due to the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, Foxtel has been focused on retention, and overall, the product has exceeded our expectations. In the aggregate, Foxtel had a strong and growing base of OTT subscribers, which in total reached 842,000 subscribers at June 30, of which approximately 777,000 were paying subscribers, accounting for 25% of Foxtel's total paying subscriber base and is reflective of Foxtel strategy to monetize existing rights of a multiple platform.
In the fourth quarter, broadcast churn was 14.7% versus 12.5% in the prior year, reflective of a 300 basis points improvement from the third quarter. The outcome in the fourth quarter reflects early successes from leveraging data and analytics to reduce churn despite the price increases. In addition, the team is focused on stabilizing broadcast ARPU, which is more than AUD 78 in the fourth quarter, down 1% versus last year.
Capital expenditures related to Foxtel where approximately USD 300 million for fiscal 2019 which is lower than what we had anticipated, and we expect sizable declines in fiscal 2020. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was subscriber related.
Finally, we issued Foxtel and AUD 200 million shareholder vote in May at a variable rate of approximately 9% as we continue to work with banks on refinancing upcoming maturity.
At Book Publishing, as expected, we faced an unusually strong prior year comparison with the prior year including a onetime revenue contribution of $28 million for the Tolkien sublicense to Amazon and the release of Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines. 
Revenues for the quarter decreased 14% to $419 million due to the fact that I just noted as well as approximately 18 million of negative impact from the new revenue recognition standard.
Segment EBITDA fell to $44 million from $72 million, with the biggest factor impacting profitability being the absence of the Tolkien deal from the prior year. Notwithstanding the fourth quarter results, HarperCollins have had a very strong year and outperformed our expectations. HarperCollins posted high digital revenues for the quarter and a fiscal year rate by the continued expansion of downloadable audio, which accounts for approximately 1/3 of digital sales today. They will also move to fairly capitalize on momentum in and depth of their backlist to generate longer term incremental revenues as they have done via the new deals in Bell Media.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $283 million, primarily related to currency headwinds of $13 million. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. 
REA grew -- revenues were down 6% and up 1% in local currency as higher yield and increased debt penetration was offset by an overall 19% year-over-year decline in the existing volume during the quarter, which was notably weaker than the third quarter and full year rate of 9% and 8% declines, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and the conference call following this call for additional data and comments on their outlook.
News revenues rose 3% to $123 million versus the prior year with real estate revenues growing 8%. The increase in real estate revenues, which represents 77% of total revenue, reflect higher yield per lease, a slight improvement in buyer lead volume and the acquisition of Opcity. While lead volumes remain subdued, the business did see an improvement in run rates in June, which should build momentum to this coming fiscal year.
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing of performance-based early model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact on scalability of this platform. Early results have been promising, with improvements in engagement and leasing rates, which we expect to drive higher conversion rates.
During fiscal 2020, we will continue to allocate lead flow to Opcity, although we expect that in most markets, we will be offering both our existing connection SaaS products along with the Opcity concierge model. We have, as mentioned last quarter, began to reallocate resources within the realtor.com team to better position and streamline the business to this year and beyond. 
On audience, we saw an acceleration versus the third quarter growth rate and reached monthly unique users at realtor.com to a record 72 million for the quarter, rising 14% versus the prior year together with notable pickup in engagement.
Segment EBITDA fell 15% to $84 million similar to the third quarter rate. The decline was driven by higher investment in Opcity and the $5 million negative impact from currency. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA decreased 7%.
I would now like to mention a few things to the fiscal 2020 year. Yes. At News and Information Services, while advertising visibility remains limited, the revenue mix is becoming less dependent on print, and we are encouraged by the pace of global uptake of paid digital subscribers. In fact, excluding NAM, the majority of segment's revenue will be circulation and subscription revenues. So far, the advertising trends are similar to slightly better in the current quarter, and we continue to remain digital while reinvesting in our digital offerings.
Overall, our expectation is a show further stability in this segment and it is pleasing that we finish the year with some strength. We do note the first quarter will face a challenging comparisons due to the $48 million benefit in the prior year related to News U.K.'s exit of the gaining partnership with Tabcorp.
In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be modest in fiscal 2020 absent currency fluctuation. We will have one additional quarter of domestic especially approximately USD 20 million before locking the rights and some additional OTT expenses as we drive further penetration. This will be in conjunction with our continued efforts to seek cost efficiencies. We also expect a noncash impact of approximately $30 million to $35 million in fiscal 2020 related to a change in amortization methodologies entertainment programming. We expect CapEx in the Foxtel to decline by approximately 20% compared to fiscal 2019 and overall expect higher cash generation from this business.
In Book Publishing, we will face tougher comparison to the fiscal year given the outperformance in fiscal 2019. However, we are confident with our slice of tussle, which will be headlined a new releases from Regent Raymond, Ajay Sims, Daniel Silver and David Dwellings in the U.K. among others, along with expect continued growth and with billable audiobooks. Fiscal third quarter releases include Daniel Silva's The New Girl and Ann Pachette's The Dutch House as well as the tie-in edition of Garth Stein's The Art of Racing in the Rain, which will hit the movie theaters this weekend. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, despite a challenging housing market in Australia, REA should benefit from higher debt penetration and higher pricing. Please refer to REA's call for a more detailed outlook. At realtor's fiscal 2020, we anticipate both higher revenue and higher profit contribution by further expanding the Opcity concierge model, returning the nonlisting base advertising back to growth and leveraging the recent cost initiatives.
With that, let me hand it over to your operator for Q&A."

Just in relation to the cost, they declined 7%, but down 4% on an adjusted basis. So cost distribution, Dow Jones cost are up, but we would expect that to be up given the subscriber growth and the investments that we have in the PIB business in Risk and Compliance. Across the other businesses in the U.K. and Australia posted decline, and within them, clearly cost declined by around 12% year-on-year. We are expecting to see cost continue to increase across the U.K. and Australia. We have been quite vocal about that over the past couple of years. The teams across the U.K. and Australia are very focused on cost reduction and continue to look at ways that they can innovate and drive costs, particularly out of the back office and some of the distribution chain And you would also expect to see Dow Jones investing in that business going forward. But I would say that overall, we do balance the cost reductions with investment even within the U.K. and Australia because it's important that we can support that digital growth coming through in the businesses."

And there is little more premium than exclusive sports runs. The old story about Foxtel was it had maxed out on subscribers that they were strictly limited number of Australians prepared to pay for content, and we heard that rumor. Frankly, that's clearly not the case, and the doubling of Kayo subscribers is actually been accompanied by a fall during the same period by the rate of churn among sports users subscribers on broadcast. That is a significant trend and an indication of the success of Kayo."

Just in relation to your second question, in relation to Foxtel cost base, in relation to next year, clearly the current year, fiscal 2019 is the investment year for Foxtel. We are very clear about that and transparent particularly in relation to the Cricket rights. If we cast our lines forward to the next financial year, we would expect to have a one additional quarter of Cricker right so that.
USD 20 million, we will, no doubt, have some continued investment in OTT as we scale this product and depending on the marketing activities around that. But more importantly as I mentioned in my comment, we'll have this noncash impact related to the programming amortization change, which is about $30 million to $35 million. So that will impact on the result. Outside of that, we expect that cost base will be relatively notwithstanding the variable nature of subscribers."

News Corp completed fiscal year 2019 in a strong position with revenues increasing 12% and profitability rising 16% against the prior year, reflecting not only the consolidation of Foxtel but also the continued strength and development of core segments of the company, including Book Publishing, and Digital Real Estate Services and substantial progress in the digital transformation of our News and Information Services businesses.
The concerted focus on our primary revenue drivers, including the creation and distribution of premium content, was reflected in audience growth across News Corp's mastheads and digital properties. We are also acutely focused on simplifying the structure of the company and making clear the full value of the sum of our parts. To that end, we recently announced a strategic review of News America Marketing, including a potential sale of the business. We have received material interest and the process is progressing rather well.
There is clearly a fundamental shift underway in the content landscape. And one consequence, other than intensifying regulatory scrutiny of big digital, is a gradual transference of value to content creators who over the past decade have lost influence and revenue to their digital distributors. With Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch's encouragement, News Corp has been advocating vigorously on behalf of journalists, journalism and the protection of intellectual property and that intense, sometimes solitary, advocacy has begun to pay dividends for journalism and importantly, for our shareholders. We are still at a relatively early stage of this tectonic transformation, but there will surely be an ongoing transfer of value to creators in coming years, which should be of great benefit to News Corp and its investors.
We have begun partnering with companies such as Apple and Twitter, which recognize the value of our content. And discussions are underway with other digital companies, though I am not at liberty at this moment to provide more detail. What I can say is that the terms of trade and the tenor of our talks are now vastly different to even a year ago. 
In fiscal 2019, the News and Information Services segment posted higher profitability which was spurred by the rapid rise of digital paid subscribers. The Wall Street Journal, The Times and Sunday Times and The Australian all grew subscriber volumes at a healthy rate, with digital now accounting for the majority of their subscribers. There is an emerging subscription sensibility among consumers which is obviously to our benefit, but we are also conscious of the need to provide ever-better service to those subscribers who rightly have high expectations for their digital experience.
Dow Jones is a media business that we believe has a distinctive ability to prosper in the digital age. The Wall Street Journal recorded 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers who now account for over 69% of the total subscriber base of 2.6 million. Circulation revenue trends at Dow Jones remained robust, rising 7% for the year, well above the rates of the New York Times and others in the industry. Since separation in 2013, Dow Jones consumer circulation revenues have grown more than 40%. And within that category, digital revenues at The Wall Street Journal have expanded by almost 150%. 
Advertising trends improved in Q4 for The Wall Street Journal. And in July, both print and digital advertising revenue were higher than a year earlier.
As we look to the future, we believe that Dow Jones can attract a significantly larger subscription base via direct subscriptions and through content partnerships. We have particular optimism about the international potential of Dow Jones given the relatively low non-U.S. share, 12% of subscribers today. We are also seeing the increasing ability of the Dow Jones team deploying customized artificial intelligence to sell specialist financial news and data products to professional and wealthy individual subscribers. 
The Dow Jones Professional Information Business posted revenue growth for the second consecutive year after a period of transition, overcoming currency headwinds. An important driver of that growth has been the Risk and Compliance business, which grew 24% for the full fiscal year to exceed $130 million of revenues at attractive margins. Impressively, that business has more than quadrupled in size since its separation 6 years ago. Obviously, companies around the world are focused on maximizing compliance and minimizing risk. So we are confident that there will be continuing growth in that sector.
In addition, Dow Jones' world-class news coverage and analysis is now aggregated on the Bloomberg Terminal, significantly extending the reach and impact of Dow Jones' trusted, high-quality journalism and analysis and enabling us to inform a larger total audience. Over the past fiscal year, along with other new partnership arrangements, Dow Jones Newswires is now available on more than 300,000 additional terminals. These partnerships make our newswires the most widely available professional newswire services in the world.
In the U.K., in constant currency, The Times of London grew print advertising revenues for the second consecutive year. Digital paid subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 304,000, while regulatory approval was received this month for the sharing of resources by The Times and Sunday Times. Clearly, the change should result in operational efficiencies while we will be assiduous in protecting the unique identity of each of those iconic mastheads.
Wireless Group posted its highest ratings ever in the April to June period. Chris Evans, the legendary radio broadcaster who joined Wireless Group's Virgin Radio last year, reached 1.1 million listeners a week across the U.K. during that period. In fact, Virgin Radio continues to be the fastest-growing station in the U.K., both in reach and listening hours.
Meanwhile, Fox Sports saw record audience figures with 3.3 million weekly listeners across the network in the quarter. Under Rebekah Brooks' expert leadership, we are ensuring that the peerless broadcast skills at Wireless are being deployed to improve the quality of the audio products elsewhere in the U.K. to take advantage of rapidly-increasing podcast demand.
In Australia, our focus on growth paid off with improvement in profitability for the year, driven in part by an increase in digital subscriptions, which now exceed 517,000, up 24% year-on-year with The Australian, a notably strong performer.
At the same time, news.com.au has remained the #1 website for 20 consecutive months, well ahead of its rivals, with its monthly unique visitor number topping 10 million and total visitors at over 91 million in June.
News Australia is also benefiting from the acceleration in digital advertising, including expansion of News Xtend, the small to medium business solution and from its cost reduction efforts. We are confident that Michael Miller and his talented team are well-positioned to extend their operational success into fiscal 2020.
At the New York Post, the cover price was doubled to $2 in metropolitan markets, the first increase in 7 years and one reason for improved financial results at The Post. And The Post digital network continues to be strong with audience numbers averaging more than 101 million unique users per month in the quarter, according to Google Analytics. 
In the Subscription Video Services segment, the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports was completed in April 2018. And throughout fiscal 2019, the new business has been focused on delivering premium content and experiences to customers and rapidly expanding our streaming services, which have grown markedly over the past year. Foxtel is underpinned by a large and loyal broadcast subscriber base and unique content across sports, entertainment, documentaries and news. As of the end of the fiscal year, Foxtel's total paid subscribers grew to over 3.1 million, led by the success of our new sports streaming product, Kayo, and continued expansion of Foxtel Now, where the number of its subscribers increased by 36% from the prior year to 446,000 at year-end. 
Kayo, which was launched in November 2018, showed a material acceleration in subscriber additions into the year-end, with over 330,000 paid subscribers as of June 30, a doubling since last quarter. Worth noting is Kayo's high levels of audience engagement, with 90% of subscribers using it each week, watching an average of 8.5 hours of sports content across an average of 6 different sports.
In total, our streaming base in Australia has nearly doubled since calendar year-end to approximately 777,000. It is notable that the growth in Kayo subscribers between the third and fourth quarter has actually been accompanied by a decline in average churn among sports tier subscribers to Foxtel broadcast over the same period.
We announced in July the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's iQ3 and iQ4 set-top boxes which, along with a new user interface, creates a unified content discovery experience for our customers and strengthens our position in the market as the preeminent creator and aggregator of the broadest range of programming. At the same time, the consolidation of Foxtel and Fox Sports has obviously provided an opportunity to review our cost base without undermining the quality of service or programming.
At Digital Real Estate Services, despite housing market headwinds, both REA and realtor.com strengthened their competitive position by continuing to innovate and expand audience. Signs of improvement in the U.S. housing market are emerging, with realtor.com traffic at record levels, interest rates declining, buyer lead volumes on the rise and pending home sales rising 2.8% in June. Last November, Tracey Fellows was promoted to President of Global Digital Real Estate, underscoring our company's increasing commitment to the sector, which has been an engine of growth since we separated in 2013. In fact, over that period, segment revenues have tripled through a combination of rapid growth in REA in Australia and acquisitions in the U.S. and Asia. We are in the process of a major transformation of realtor.com, underscored by the recent acquisition of Opcity and guided by our goal of providing consumers with a superior home buying and selling experience.
While that acquisition and the migration towards a performance-based model naturally had an impact in revenues and investment last year, it represents a commitment to future growth by increasing the quality of connections between consumers and real estate professionals and heightening our potential to maximize the value of those interactions. We believe a focus on quality connections also increases our ability to generate additional revenue across the home buying and selling experience, from mortgage origination to the inevitable spending done by every family during the profoundly important process of moving home. 
REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite the soft listing environment in the second half of the year. For the year, REA extended its lead over domain, generating nearly 3x as many total visits. The company is continuing to create products that provide genuine value for ambitious agents. A federal election in May in Australia obviously contributed to economic uncertainty, but the political situation has clearly stabilized and the government is taking measures that should stimulate the housing market. We also made good progress in Asia through iProperty with healthy revenue growth despite fluctuating economic and political conditions.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins thrived this year with new releases and a strong backlist, fueling a 6% increase in EBITDA despite a tough comparison with 2018, which had benefited from a onetime lucrative licensing contract for J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. As Tolkien himself wrote, ""All's well that ends better."" That is certainly true of downloadable audiobooks, for which revenues rose 40% for the year. There is patently a fundamental shift in listening habits under way, and we expect double-digit growth to continue in the current year.
Brian Murray and the HarperCollins team are finding new ways to make the most of our content and enhance the profile of our authors. We have just announced a partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment in Hollywood and Elizabeth Gabler and her former Fox 2000 team to develop programming and films from the remarkable HarperCollins catalog. We have also announced an agreement through our Harlequin imprint with Bell Media in Canada to produce movies from Harlequin's extensive library of more than 30,000 titles.
The most successful book of the year was a standout hit from our Christian division by best-selling author, Rachel Hollis, whose debut and follow-up books, Girl, Wash Your Face; and Girl, Stop Apologizing, together shipped more than 5 million units during the year. We also saw great success with David Walliams, including Ice Monster and World's Worst Teachers; and Mark Manson had continuing success with his sequel to The Subtle Art of Not Giving an Expletive, with Everything is Expletive. 
With that bowdlerized book title, I will hand the call over to Susan for an unvarnished account of our fourth quarter and full year performance."

Before I review this year's end quarter financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past fiscal year where we've made significant progress. Firstly, we're making notable progress in stabilizing the News and Information",2760,"Thank you, Robert. Before I review this year's end quarter financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past fiscal year where we've made significant progress. 
Firstly, we're making notable progress in stabilizing the News and Information Services sector and ended our fiscal year on a positive note. Our digital paid subscriber base continues to grow while we continue to focus on streamlining our print cost base and investing in new revenue streams. Importantly, the segment posted higher profitability this year with improvement across our key news publishing business units, the first time we've seen this improvement since the company's separation. We will remain focused on these areas in the coming year, and we are optimistic we can build on the current year's success.
Secondly, the team at Foxtel has made steady progress on its over-the-top offering, including the successful launch of Kayo in November and further improvement to its premium broadcast product. Foxtel returned to volume growth, ending the year at the highest closing paid subscriber base since separation. And now with their core platforms enhanced, they are focused on improving a path to revenue and profit growth. 
The performance in our Book Publishing segment this year underscores the value of premium content and the advantage of a global distribution network, posting record profitability even while facing a very challenging prior year comparable. Given the rapid rise of downloadable audiobooks and the explosion in demand for premium content globally, we continue to explore ways that HarperCollins can further leverage its highly valued content into other media. As Robert mentioned, recent examples of these efforts are our announced partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment and also with Bell Media in Canada for our Harlequin division. These are deals with minimum capital outlay which have the potential to monetize content more broadly. 
Our businesses in the Digital Real Estate Services segment made strategic acquisitions, expanded their product offering and continued to capture audience share amid a challenging global housing market. We feel positive about our pace of innovation and investment and believe this segment is well-positioned going into fiscal 2020.
And finally, we continue to actively look at our portfolio. In June, we announced that News America Marketing is undergoing a strategic review, including actively exploring a sale, and that process is ongoing. 
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results.
For the full year fiscal 2019, total revenues were $10.1 billion, a 12% increase compared to the prior year. Reported results for fiscal 2019 include the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, significant currency headwinds and other items as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 1%.
Total segment EBITDA for the year was $1.24 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year, a 16% increase over the prior-year period. Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the year rose 4%. 
Full year diluted earnings per share were $0.26 compared to a loss of $2.60 in the prior year, primarily driven by the absence of the noncash impairment charges and write-downs of $1.2 billion recognized in fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $0.46 versus $0.44 in the prior year. 
Free cash flow available to the company for the year was $213 million, which included a step-up in capital expenditures related to the consolidation of Foxtel. 
And now to the quarterly financial details. We reported fiscal 2019 fourth quarter total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, due in part to the $105 million impact from continued currency headwinds. Adjusted revenues declined 5%.
Total segment EBITDA for the quarter was $269 million compared to $314 million in the prior year, down 14%. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 8%. 
For the quarter, loss per share was $0.09 compared to a loss of $0.64 a year ago, with the improvement mainly due to the absence of the write-off of the Fox Sports Australia channel distribution agreement last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.07 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down approximately 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $40 million or 3% negative impact and was responsible for the majority of the decline. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 37% of combined revenue. Approximately 33% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 30% in the prior year. 
Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $18 million or 2% due to negative currency fluctuations.
Circulation and subscription revenues were flat versus the prior year despite a $17 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $108 million, up 14% over the prior year and a very strong improvement from the last 2 quarters, primarily driven by News America Marketing but also benefiting from positive contribution from Dow Jones and News UK.
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the fourth quarter remained robust, growing 7% for the fourth consecutive quarter, benefiting from 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to over 1.8 million as well subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for over 69% of total subscribers at The Wall Street Journal, which is up from over 64% last year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and Financial News in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that, digital-only subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to 2.2 million subscribers.
Over the same period, Barron's expanded its total subscriber base to 579,000, a 16% year-over-year increase. 
Within the Professional Information Business, Risk and Compliance grew 23% in the quarter compared to the prior year and as expected, exceeded $139 million in revenues this year. We continue to expect significant growth ahead as we expand our product range. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew 2% this quarter. 
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter were flat, a notable improvement from last quarter, led by an improvement in digital advertising as we had anticipated. For the quarter, digital advertising accounted for 40% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 39% last year.
Elsewhere across our portfolio, advertising conditions were overall relatively stable with last quarter. Advertising revenues at News Australia and News UK declined 8% and 7%, respectively, yet both were down only 1% in local currency compared to the prior year, benefiting from higher digital advertising revenues. Pleasingly, The Times in the U.K. grew print advertising revenue in local currency for the seventh consecutive quarter.
On circulation, our digital subscribers around the globe are growing at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% to 304,000 at The Times and The Sunday Times and they also have approximately 5 million registered users, which is both a source of subscriber acquisitions and an advertising opportunity as we continue to leverage our increasing audience scale. 
At News Australia, paid digital subscribers rose over 24% year-over-year to more than 517,000, which includes 146,000 digital and bundled subscribers at The Australian. The increase in digital subscriptions along with cover price increases at News UK and News Australia allowed both markets to mitigate print volume decline and currency headwinds.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 6%, driven by continued weakness in free-standing insert products but partially offset by in-store product growth. Cost initiatives helped NAM contribute higher profitability in the quarter.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $536 million, down 12% versus $610 million a year ago, of which $44 million or 7% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency.
Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $85 million, down 12% with the prior year. From the fourth quarter, we are now comparing like-for-like as we completed the Foxtel consolidation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base rose to over 3.1 million as of June 30, with volume growing 12% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by Kayo, strong adoption of Foxtel Now and the inclusion of commercial subscribers at Fox Sports Australia. Of that subscriber base, approximately 2.4 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now subscriptions.
We are making steady progress in our OTT strategy, with Kayo paying subscribers at 331,000 as of June 30, up by over 120,000 since our last update on May 8 and more than double since the third quarter, driven by the Cricket World Cup and the expansion of our distribution channel. Including trialists, the total payer subscriber base reached approximately 382,000. Pleasingly thus far, Kayo is not causing a material churn in the Foxtel broadcast customer base, with an estimated 5% of Foxtel disconnections since Kayo's launch being driven by existing customers moving to Kayo.
Foxtel Now also performed strongly with total paying subscribers reaching 446,000 as of June 30, up 36% from last year. While this is down from the May 8 update due to the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, Foxtel has been focused on retention, and overall, the product has exceeded our expectations. In the aggregate, Foxtel has a strong and growing base of OTT subscribers, which in total reached 842,000 subscribers at June 30, of which approximately 777,000 were paying subscribers, accounting for 25% of Foxtel's total paying subscriber base and is reflective of Foxtel's strategy to monetize existing rights via multiple platforms.
In the fourth quarter, broadcast churn was 14.7% versus 12.5% in the prior year, reflective of a 300 basis point improvement from the third quarter. The outcome in the fourth quarter reflects early successes from leveraging data and analytics to reduce churn despite price increases. In addition, the team have focused on stabilizing broadcast ARPU, which was more than AUD 78 in the fourth quarter, down 1% versus last year.
Capital expenditures related to Foxtel were approximately USD 300 million for fiscal 2019 which is lower than what we had anticipated, and we expect sizable declines in fiscal 2020. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was subscriber-related.
Finally, we issued Foxtel an AUD 200 million shareholder loan in May at a variable rate of approximately 9% as we continue to work with banks on refinancing upcoming maturity.
At Book Publishing, as expected, we faced an unusually strong prior year comparison, with the prior year including a onetime revenue contribution of $28 million for the Tolkien sublicense to Amazon and the release of Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines. 
Revenues for the quarter decreased 14% to $419 million due to the factors I just noted as well as approximately $18 million of negative impact from the new revenue recognition standard.
Segment EBITDA fell to $44 million from $72 million, with the biggest factor impacting profitability being the absence of the Tolkien deal from the prior year. Notwithstanding the fourth quarter results, HarperCollins has had a very strong year and outperformed our own expectations. HarperCollins posted high digital revenues for the quarter and the fiscal year, led by the continued expansion of downloadable audio, which accounts for approximately 1/3 of digital sales today. They will also look to further capitalize on momentum and depth of their backlist to generate longer-term incremental revenues, as they have done via the new deals with Sony and Bell Media.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $283 million, primarily related to currency headwinds of $13 million. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. 
REA Group revenues were down 6% and up 1% in local currency as higher yield and increased debt penetration was offset by an overall 19% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter, which was notably weaker than the third quarter and full year rate of 9% and 8% declines, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 3% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 8%. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 77% of total revenue, reflect higher yield per lead, a slight improvement in buyer lead volume and the acquisition of Opcity. While lead volumes remain subdued, the business did see an improvement in run rates in June, which should build momentum for this coming fiscal year.
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live-testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. Early results have been promising, with improvements in engagement and matching rates, which we expect will drive higher conversion rates.
During fiscal 2020, we will continue to allocate lead flow to Opcity, although we expect that in most markets, we will be offering both our existing Connections Plus products along with the Opcity concierge model. We have, as mentioned last quarter, begun to reallocate resources within the realtor.com team to better position and streamline the business for this year and beyond. 
On audience, we saw an acceleration versus the third quarter growth rate in average monthly unique users at realtor.com for a record 72 million for the quarter, rising 14% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in engagement.
Segment EBITDA fell 15% to $84 million, similar to the third quarter rate. The decline was driven by higher investment in Opcity and the $5 million negative impact from currency. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA decreased 7%.
I would now like to mention a few themes for the fiscal 2020 year. At News and Information Services, while advertising visibility remains limited, the revenue mix is becoming less dependent on print, and we are encouraged by the pace of global uptake of paid digital subscribers. In fact, excluding NAM, the majority of the segment's revenue would be circulation or subscription revenue. So far, the advertising trends are similar to slightly better in the current quarter, and we continue to remain vigilant on costs while reinvesting in our digital offerings.
Overall, our expectation is to show further stability in this segment and it is pleasing that we finished the year with some strength. We do note the first quarter will face a challenging comparison due to the $48 million benefit in the prior year related to News UK's exit of the gaming partnership with Tabcorp.
In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be modest in fiscal 2020 absent currency fluctuations. We will have 1 additional quarter of domestic cricket rights, totaling approximately USD 20 million before lapping the rights and some additional OTT expenses as we drive further penetration. This will be in conjunction with our continued efforts to seek cost efficiencies. We also expect a noncash impact of approximately $30 million to $35 million in fiscal 2020 related to a change in amortization methodologies for certain entertainment programming. We expect CapEx in Foxtel to decline by approximately 20% compared to fiscal 2019 and overall expect higher cash generation from the business.
In Book Publishing, we will face some tougher comparisons for the fiscal year given the outperformance in fiscal 2019. However, we are confident with our slate of titles, which will be headlined by new releases from Ree Drummond, A.J. Finn, Daniel Silva and David Walliams in the U.K., among others, along with expected continued growth in downloadable audiobooks. Fiscal first quarter releases include Daniel Silva's The New Girl, Ann Patchett's The Dutch House as well as a tie-in edition of Garth Stein's The Art of Racing in the Rain, which will hit the movie theaters this weekend. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, despite a challenging listings market in Australia, REA should benefit from higher-depth penetration and higher pricing. Please refer to REA's call for a more detailed outlook. At Realtor for fiscal 2020, we anticipate both higher revenue and higher profit contribution by further expanding the Opcity concierge model, returning the non-listing base advertising back to growth and leveraging the recent cost initiatives.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for the Q&A."

Across the other businesses in the U.K. and Australia, cost did decline, and within them, clearly cost declined by around 12% year-on-year. We are expecting to see cost continue to increase across the U.K. and Australia. We have been quite vocal about that over the past couple of years. The teams across the U.K. and Australia are very focused on cost reduction and continue to look at ways that they can innovate and drive costs, particularly out of the back office and some of the distribution chains. And we would also expect to continue to see Dow Jones invest in that business going forward. But I would say, though, that overall, we do balance the cost reductions with investment, even within the U.K. and Australia, because it's important that we can support that digital growth coming through in the businesses."

What we are seeing at Kayo is success, and fundamentally, what we're seeing is a real growth in the number of Australians prepared to pay for premium programming. And there is little more premium than exclusive sports rights. The old story about Foxtel was it had maxed out on subscribers, that there were a strictly limited number of Australians prepared to pay for content, and that we had hit that limit. Frankly, that's clearly not the case, and the doubling of Kayo subscribers has actually been accompanied by a fall during the same period by the rate of churn among sports users -- subscribers on broadcast. That is a significant trend and an indication of the success of Kayo."

Just in relation to your second question, in relation to Foxtel and the cost base. So as we think about next year, clearly, the current year, fiscal 2019, was a big investment year for Foxtel. We were very clear about that and transparent, particularly in relation to the cricket rights. And if we cast our mind forward to the next financial year, we would expect to have 1 additional quarter of cricket rights, so about USD 20 million. We will, no doubt, have some continued investment in OTT as we scale those products and depending on the marketing activities around that. But more importantly, as I mentioned in my comments, we'll have this noncash impact related to the programming amortization change, which is about $30 million to $35 million. So that will impact on the results. Outside of that, we expect the cost base to be relatively constant, notwithstanding the variable nature of -- due to subscribers."

News Corp completed fiscal year 2019 in a strong position with revenues increasing 12% and profitability rising 16% against the prior year, reflecting not only the consolidation of Foxtel but also the continued strength and development of core segments of the company, including Book Publishing, and Digital Real Estate Services and substantial progress in the digital transformation of our News and Information Services businesses.
The concerted focus on our primary revenue drivers, including the creation and distribution of premium content, was reflected in audience growth across News Corp's mastheads and digital properties. We are also acutely focused on simplifying the structure of the company and making clear the full value of the sum of our parts. To that end, we recently announced a strategic review of News America Marketing, including a potential sale of the business. We have received material interest and the process is progressing rather well.
There is clearly a fundamental shift underway in the content landscape. And one consequence, other than intensifying regulatory scrutiny of big digital, is a gradual transference of value to content creators who over the past decade have lost influence and revenue to their digital distributors. With Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch's encouragement, News Corp has been advocating vigorously on behalf of journalists, journalism and the protection of intellectual property and that intense, sometimes solitary, advocacy has begun to pay dividends for journalism and importantly, for our shareholders. We are still at a relatively early stage of this tectonic transformation, but there will surely be an ongoing transfer of value to creators in coming years, which should be of great benefit to News Corp and its investors.
We have begun partnering with companies such as Apple and Twitter, which recognize the value of our content. And discussions are underway with other digital companies, though I am not at liberty at this moment to provide more detail. What I can say is that the terms of trade and the tenor of our talks are now vastly different to even a year ago. 
In fiscal 2019, the News and Information Services segment posted higher profitability which was spurred by the rapid rise of digital paid subscribers. The Wall Street Journal, The Times and Sunday Times and The Australian all grew subscriber volumes at a healthy rate, with digital now accounting for the majority of their subscribers. There is an emerging subscription sensibility among consumers which is obviously to our benefit, but we are also conscious of the need to provide ever-better service to those subscribers who rightly have high expectations for their digital experience.
Dow Jones is a media business that we believe has a distinctive ability to prosper in the digital age. The Wall Street Journal recorded 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers who now account for over 69% of the total subscriber base of 2.6 million. Circulation revenue trends at Dow Jones remained robust, rising 7% for the year, well above the rates of the New York Times and others in the industry. Since separation in 2013, Dow Jones consumer circulation revenues have grown more than 40%. And within that category, digital revenues at The Wall Street Journal have expanded by almost 150%. 
Advertising trends improved in Q4 for The Wall Street Journal. And in July, both print and digital advertising revenue were higher than a year earlier.
As we look to the future, we believe that Dow Jones can attract a significantly larger subscription base via direct subscriptions and through content partnerships. We have particular optimism about the international potential of Dow Jones given the relatively low non-U.S. share, 12% of subscribers today. We are also seeing the increasing ability of the Dow Jones team deploying customized artificial intelligence to sell specialist financial news and data products to professional and wealthy individual subscribers. 
The Dow Jones Professional Information Business posted revenue growth for the second consecutive year after a period of transition, overcoming currency headwinds. An important driver of that growth has been the Risk and Compliance business, which grew 24% for the full fiscal year to exceed $130 million of revenues at attractive margins. Impressively, that business has more than quadrupled in size since its separation 6 years ago. Obviously, companies around the world are focused on maximizing compliance and minimizing risk. So we are confident that there will be continuing growth in that sector.
In addition, Dow Jones' world-class news coverage and analysis is now aggregated on the Bloomberg Terminal, significantly extending the reach and impact of Dow Jones' trusted, high-quality journalism and analysis and enabling us to inform a larger total audience. Over the past fiscal year, along with other new partnership arrangements, Dow Jones Newswires is now available on more than 300,000 additional terminals. These partnerships make our newswires the most widely available professional newswire services in the world.
In the U.K., in constant currency, The Times of London grew print advertising revenues for the second consecutive year. Digital paid subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 304,000, while regulatory approval was received this month for the sharing of resources by The Times and Sunday Times. Clearly, the change should result in operational efficiencies while we will be assiduous in protecting the unique identity of each of those iconic mastheads.
Wireless Group posted its highest ratings ever in the April to June period. Chris Evans, the legendary radio broadcaster who joined Wireless Group's Virgin Radio last year, reached 1.1 million listeners a week across the U.K. during that period. In fact, Virgin Radio continues to be the fastest-growing station in the U.K., both in reach and listening hours.
Meanwhile, Fox Sports saw record audience figures with 3.3 million weekly listeners across the network in the quarter. Under Rebekah Brooks' expert leadership, we are ensuring that the peerless broadcast skills at Wireless are being deployed to improve the quality of the audio products elsewhere in the U.K. to take advantage of rapidly increasing podcast demand.
In Australia, our focus on growth paid off with improvement in profitability for the year, driven in part by an increase in digital subscriptions, which now exceed 517,000, up 24% year-on-year with The Australian, a notably strong performer.
At the same time, news.com.au has remained the #1 website for 20 consecutive months, well ahead of its rivals, with its monthly unique visitor number topping 10 million and total visitors at over 91 million in June.
News Australia is also benefiting from the acceleration in digital advertising, including expansion of News Xtend, the small to medium business solution and from its cost reduction efforts. We are confident that Michael Miller and his talented team are well-positioned to extend their operational success into fiscal 2020.
At the New York Post, the cover price was doubled to $2 in metropolitan markets, the first increase in 7 years and one reason for improved financial results at The Post. And The Post digital network continues to be strong with audience numbers averaging more than 101 million unique users per month in the quarter, according to Google Analytics. 
In the Subscription Video Services segment, the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports was completed in April 2018. And throughout fiscal 2019, the new business has been focused on delivering premium content and experiences to customers and rapidly expanding our streaming services, which have grown markedly over the past year. Foxtel is underpinned by a large and loyal broadcast subscriber base and unique content across sports, entertainment, documentaries and news. As of the end of the fiscal year, Foxtel's total paid subscribers grew to over 3.1 million, led by the success of our new sports streaming product, Kayo, and continued expansion of Foxtel Now, where the number of its subscribers increased by 36% from the prior year to 446,000 at year-end. 
Kayo, which was launched in November 2018, showed a material acceleration in subscriber additions into the year-end, with over 330,000 paid subscribers as of June 30, a doubling since last quarter. Worth noting is Kayo's high levels of audience engagement, with 90% of subscribers using it each week, watching an average of 8.5 hours of sports content across an average of 6 different sports.
In total, our streaming base in Australia has nearly doubled since calendar year-end to approximately 777,000. It is notable that the growth in Kayo subscribers between the third and fourth quarter has actually been accompanied by a decline in average churn among sports tier subscribers to Foxtel broadcast over the same period.
We announced in July the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's iQ3 and iQ4 set-top boxes which, along with a new user interface, creates a unified content discovery experience for our customers and strengthens our position in the market as the preeminent creator and aggregator of the broadest range of programming. At the same time, the consolidation of Foxtel and Fox Sports has obviously provided an opportunity to review our cost base without undermining the quality of service or programming.
At Digital Real Estate Services, despite housing market headwinds, both REA and realtor.com strengthened their competitive position by continuing to innovate and expand audience. Signs of improvement in the U.S. housing market are emerging, with realtor.com traffic at record levels, interest rates declining, buyer lead volumes on the rise and pending home sales rising 2.8% in June. Last November, Tracey Fellows was promoted to President of Global Digital Real Estate, underscoring our company's increasing commitment to the sector, which has been an engine of growth since we separated in 2013. In fact, over that period, segment revenues have tripled through a combination of rapid growth in REA in Australia and acquisitions in the U.S. and Asia. We are in the process of a major transformation of realtor.com, underscored by the recent acquisition of Opcity and guided by our goal of providing consumers with a superior home buying and selling experience.
While that acquisition and the migration towards a performance-based model naturally had an impact in revenues and investment last year, it represents a commitment to future growth by increasing the quality of connections between consumers and real estate professionals and heightening our potential to maximize the value of those interactions. We believe a focus on quality connections also increases our ability to generate additional revenue across the home buying and selling experience, from mortgage origination to the inevitable spending done by every family during the profoundly important process of moving home. 
REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite the soft listing environment in the second half of the year. For the year, REA extended its lead over domain, generating nearly 3x as many total visits. The company is continuing to create products that provide genuine value for ambitious agents. A federal election in May in Australia obviously contributed to economic uncertainty, but the political situation has clearly stabilized and the government is taking measures that should stimulate the housing market. We also made good progress in Asia through iProperty with healthy revenue growth despite fluctuating economic and political conditions.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins thrived this year with new releases and a strong backlist, fueling a 6% increase in EBITDA despite a tough comparison with 2018, which had benefited from a onetime lucrative licensing contract for J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. As Tolkien himself wrote, ""All's well that ends better."" That is certainly true of downloadable audiobooks, for which revenues rose 40% for the year. There is patently a fundamental shift in listening habits under way, and we expect double-digit growth to continue in the current year.
Brian Murray and the HarperCollins team are finding new ways to make the most of our content and enhance the profile of our authors. We have just announced a partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment in Hollywood and Elizabeth Gabler and her former Fox 2000 team to develop programming and films from the remarkable HarperCollins catalog. We have also announced an agreement through our Harlequin imprint with Bell Media in Canada to produce movies from Harlequin's extensive library of more than 30,000 titles.
The most successful book of the year was a standout hit from our Christian division by best-selling author, Rachel Hollis, whose debut and follow-up books, Girl, Wash Your Face; and Girl, Stop Apologizing, together shipped more than 5 million units during the year. We also saw great success with David Walliams, including Ice Monster and World's Worst Teachers; and Mark Manson had continuing success with his sequel to The Subtle Art of Not Giving an Expletive, with Everything is Expletive. 
With that bowdlerized book title, I will hand the call over to Susan for an unvarnished account of our fourth quarter and full year performance."

Before I review this year's end quarter financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past fiscal year where we've made significant progress. Firstly, we're making notable progress in stabilizing the News and Information",2761,"Thank you, Robert. Before I review this year's end quarter financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past fiscal year where we've made significant progress. 
Firstly, we're making notable progress in stabilizing the News and Information Services sector and ended our fiscal year on a positive note. Our digital paid subscriber base continues to grow while we continue to focus on streamlining our print cost base and investing in new revenue streams. Importantly, the segment posted higher profitability this year with improvement across our key news publishing business units, the first time we've seen this improvement since the company's separation. We will remain focused on these areas in the coming year, and we are optimistic we can build on the current year's success.
Secondly, the team at Foxtel has made steady progress on its over-the-top offering, including the successful launch of Kayo in November and further improvement to its premium broadcast product. Foxtel returned to volume growth, ending the year at the highest closing paid subscriber base since separation. And now with their core platforms enhanced, they are focused on improving a path to revenue and profit growth. 
The performance in our Book Publishing segment this year underscores the value of premium content and the advantage of a global distribution network, posting record profitability even while facing a very challenging prior year comparable. Given the rapid rise of downloadable audiobooks and the explosion in demand for premium content globally, we continue to explore ways that HarperCollins can further leverage its highly valued content into other media. As Robert mentioned, recent examples of these efforts are our announced partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment and also with Bell Media in Canada for our Harlequin division. These are deals with minimum capital outlay which have the potential to monetize content more broadly. 
Our businesses in the Digital Real Estate Services segment made strategic acquisitions, expanded their product offering and continued to capture audience share amid a challenging global housing market. We feel positive about our pace of innovation and investment and believe this segment is well-positioned going into fiscal 2020.
And finally, we continue to actively look at our portfolio. In June, we announced that News America Marketing is undergoing a strategic review, including actively exploring a sale, and that process is ongoing. 
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results.
For the full year fiscal 2019, total revenues were $10.1 billion, a 12% increase compared to the prior year. Reported results for fiscal 2019 include the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, significant currency headwinds and other items as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 1%.
Total segment EBITDA for the year was $1.24 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year, a 16% increase over the prior year period. Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the year rose 4%. 
Full year diluted earnings per share were $0.26 compared to a loss of $2.60 in the prior year, primarily driven by the absence of the noncash impairment charges and write-downs of $1.2 billion recognized in fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $0.46 versus $0.44 in the prior year. 
Free cash flow available to the company for the year was $213 million, which included a step-up in capital expenditures related to the consolidation of Foxtel. 
And now to the quarterly financial details. We reported fiscal 2019 fourth quarter total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, due in part to the $105 million impact from continued currency headwinds. Adjusted revenues declined 5%.
Total segment EBITDA for the quarter was $269 million compared to $314 million in the prior year, down 14%. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 8%. 
For the quarter, loss per share was $0.09 compared to a loss of $0.64 a year ago, with the improvement mainly due to the absence of the write-off of the Fox Sports Australia channel distribution agreement last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.07 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down approximately 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $40 million or 3% negative impact and was responsible for the majority of the decline. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 37% of combined revenue. Approximately 33% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 30% in the prior year. 
Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $18 million or 2% due to negative currency fluctuations.
Circulation and subscription revenues were flat versus the prior year despite a $17 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $108 million, up 14% over the prior year and a very strong improvement from the last 2 quarters, primarily driven by News America Marketing but also benefiting from positive contribution from Dow Jones and News UK.
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the fourth quarter remained robust, growing 7% for the fourth consecutive quarter, benefiting from 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to over 1.8 million as well subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for over 69% of total subscribers at The Wall Street Journal, which is up from over 64% last year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and Financial News in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that, digital-only subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to 2.2 million subscribers.
Over the same period, Barron's expanded its total subscriber base to 579,000, a 16% year-over-year increase. 
Within the Professional Information Business, Risk and Compliance grew 23% in the quarter compared to the prior year and as expected, exceeded $139 million in revenues this year. We continue to expect significant growth ahead as we expand our product range. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew 2% this quarter. 
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter were flat, a notable improvement from last quarter, led by an improvement in digital advertising as we had anticipated. For the quarter, digital advertising accounted for 40% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 39% last year.
Elsewhere across our portfolio, advertising conditions were overall relatively stable with last quarter. Advertising revenues at News Australia and News UK declined 8% and 7%, respectively, yet both were down only 1% in local currency compared to the prior year, benefiting from higher digital advertising revenues. Pleasingly, The Times in the U.K. grew print advertising revenue in local currency for the seventh consecutive quarter.
On circulation, our digital subscribers around the globe are growing at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% to 304,000 at The Times and The Sunday Times and they also have approximately 5 million registered users, which is both a source of subscriber acquisitions and an advertising opportunity as we continue to leverage our increasing audience scale. 
At News Australia, paid digital subscribers rose over 24% year-over-year to more than 517,000, which includes 146,000 digital and bundled subscribers at The Australian. The increase in digital subscriptions along with cover price increases at News UK and News Australia allowed both markets to mitigate print volume decline and currency headwinds.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 6%, driven by continued weakness in free-standing insert products but partially offset by in-store product growth. Cost initiatives helped NAM contribute higher profitability in the quarter.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $536 million, down 12% versus $610 million a year ago, of which $44 million or 7% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency.
Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $85 million, down 12% with the prior year. From the fourth quarter, we are now comparing like-for-like as we completed the Foxtel consolidation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base rose to over 3.1 million as of June 30, with volume growing 12% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by Kayo, strong adoption of Foxtel Now and the inclusion of commercial subscribers at Fox Sports Australia. Of that subscriber base, approximately 2.4 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now subscriptions.
We are making steady progress in our OTT strategy, with Kayo paying subscribers at 331,000 as of June 30, up by over 120,000 since our last update on May 8 and more than double since the third quarter, driven by the Cricket World Cup and the expansion of our distribution channel. Including trialists, the total payer subscriber base reached approximately 382,000. Pleasingly thus far, Kayo is not causing a material churn in the Foxtel broadcast customer base, with an estimated 5% of Foxtel disconnections since Kayo's launch being driven by existing customers moving to Kayo.
Foxtel Now also performed strongly with total paying subscribers reaching 446,000 as of June 30, up 36% from last year. While this is down from the May 8 update due to the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, Foxtel has been focused on retention, and overall, the product has exceeded our expectations. In the aggregate, Foxtel has a strong and growing base of OTT subscribers, which in total reached 842,000 subscribers at June 30, of which approximately 777,000 were paying subscribers, accounting for 25% of Foxtel's total paying subscriber base and is reflective of Foxtel's strategy to monetize existing rights via multiple platforms.
In the fourth quarter, broadcast churn was 14.7% versus 12.5% in the prior year, reflective of a 300 basis point improvement from the third quarter. The outcome in the fourth quarter reflects early successes from leveraging data and analytics to reduce churn despite price increases. In addition, the team have focused on stabilizing broadcast ARPU, which was more than AUD 78 in the fourth quarter, down 1% versus last year.
Capital expenditures related to Foxtel were approximately USD 300 million for fiscal 2019 which is lower than what we had anticipated, and we expect sizable declines in fiscal 2020. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was subscriber-related.
Finally, we issued Foxtel an AUD 200 million shareholder loan in May at a variable rate of approximately 9% as we continue to work with banks on refinancing upcoming maturity.
At Book Publishing, as expected, we faced an unusually strong prior year comparison, with the prior year including a onetime revenue contribution of $28 million for the Tolkien sublicense to Amazon and the release of Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines. 
Revenues for the quarter decreased 14% to $419 million due to the factors I just noted as well as approximately $18 million of negative impact from the new revenue recognition standard.
Segment EBITDA fell to $44 million from $72 million, with the biggest factor impacting profitability being the absence of the Tolkien deal from the prior year. Notwithstanding the fourth quarter results, HarperCollins has had a very strong year and outperformed our own expectations. HarperCollins posted high digital revenues for the quarter and the fiscal year, led by the continued expansion of downloadable audio, which accounts for approximately 1/3 of digital sales today. They will also look to further capitalize on momentum and depth of their backlist to generate longer-term incremental revenues, as they have done via the new deals with Sony and Bell Media.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $283 million, primarily related to currency headwinds of $13 million. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. 
REA Group revenues were down 6% and up 1% in local currency as higher yield and increased debt penetration was offset by an overall 19% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter, which was notably weaker than the third quarter and full year rate of 9% and 8% declines, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.
Move revenues rose 3% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 8%. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 77% of total revenue, reflect higher yield per lead, a slight improvement in buyer lead volume and the acquisition of Opcity. While lead volumes remain subdued, the business did see an improvement in run rates in June, which should build momentum for this coming fiscal year.
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live-testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. Early results have been promising, with improvements in engagement and matching rates, which we expect will drive higher conversion rates.
During fiscal 2020, we will continue to allocate lead flow to Opcity, although we expect that in most markets, we will be offering both our existing Connections Plus products along with the Opcity concierge model. We have, as mentioned last quarter, begun to reallocate resources within the realtor.com team to better position and streamline the business for this year and beyond. 
On audience, we saw an acceleration versus the third quarter growth rate in average monthly unique users at realtor.com for a record 72 million for the quarter, rising 14% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in engagement.
Segment EBITDA fell 15% to $84 million, similar to the third quarter rate. The decline was driven by higher investment in Opcity and the $5 million negative impact from currency. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA decreased 7%.
I would now like to mention a few themes for the fiscal 2020 year. At News and Information Services, while advertising visibility remains limited, the revenue mix is becoming less dependent on print, and we are encouraged by the pace of global uptake of paid digital subscribers. In fact, excluding NAM, the majority of the segment's revenue would be circulation or subscription revenue. So far, the advertising trends are similar to slightly better in the current quarter, and we continue to remain vigilant on costs while reinvesting in our digital offerings.
Overall, our expectation is to show further stability in this segment and it is pleasing that we finished the year with some strength. We do note the first quarter will face a challenging comparison due to the $48 million benefit in the prior year related to News UK's exit of the gaming partnership with Tabcorp.
In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be modest in fiscal 2020 absent currency fluctuations. We will have 1 additional quarter of domestic cricket rights, totaling approximately USD 20 million before lapping the rights and some additional OTT expenses as we drive further penetration. This will be in conjunction with our continued efforts to seek cost efficiencies. We also expect a noncash impact of approximately $30 million to $35 million in fiscal 2020 related to a change in amortization methodologies for certain entertainment programming. We expect CapEx in Foxtel to decline by approximately 20% compared to fiscal 2019 and overall expect higher cash generation from the business.
In Book Publishing, we will face some tougher comparisons for the fiscal year given the outperformance in fiscal 2019. However, we are confident with our slate of titles, which will be headlined by new releases from Ree Drummond, A.J. Finn, Daniel Silva and David Walliams in the U.K., among others, along with expected continued growth in downloadable audiobooks. Fiscal first quarter releases include Daniel Silva's The New Girl, Ann Patchett's The Dutch House as well as a tie-in edition of Garth Stein's The Art of Racing in the Rain, which will hit the movie theaters this weekend. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, despite a challenging listings market in Australia, REA should benefit from higher-depth penetration and higher pricing. Please refer to REA's call for a more detailed outlook. At Realtor for fiscal 2020, we anticipate both higher revenue and higher profit contribution by further expanding the Opcity concierge model, returning the non-listing base advertising back to growth and leveraging the recent cost initiatives.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for the Q&A."

Just in relation to the cost, they declined 7%, but down 4% on an adjusted basis. So across the division, Dow Jones costs were up, but we would expect that to be up given the subscriber growth and the investment that we have in the PIB business in Risk and Compliance. Across the other businesses in the U.K. and Australia, cost did decline, and within them, clearly cost declined by around 12% year-on-year. We are expecting to see cost continue to increase across the U.K. and Australia. We have been quite vocal about that over the past couple of years. The teams across the U.K. and Australia are very focused on cost reduction and continue to look at ways that they can innovate and drive costs, particularly out of the back office and some of the distribution chains. And we would also expect to continue to see Dow Jones invest in that business going forward. But I would say, though, that overall, we do balance the cost reductions with investment, even within the U.K. and Australia, because it's important that we can support that digital growth coming through in the businesses."

What we are seeing at Kayo is success, and fundamentally, what we're seeing is a real growth in the number of Australians prepared to pay for premium programming. And there is little more premium than exclusive sports rights. The old story about Foxtel was it had maxed out on subscribers, that there were a strictly limited number of Australians prepared to pay for content, and that we had hit that limit. Frankly, that's clearly not the case, and the doubling of Kayo subscribers has actually been accompanied by a fall during the same period by the rate of churn among sports users -- subscribers on broadcast.

Just in relation to your second question, in relation to Foxtel and the cost base. So as we think about next year, clearly, the current year, fiscal 2019, was a big investment year for Foxtel. We were very clear about that and transparent, particularly in relation to the cricket rights. And if we cast our mind forward to the next financial year, we would expect to have 1 additional quarter of cricket rights, so about USD 20 million. We will, no doubt, have some continued investment in OTT as we scale those products and depending on the marketing activities around that. But more importantly, as I mentioned in my comments, we'll have this noncash impact related to the programming amortization change, which is about $30 million to $35 million. So that will impact on the results. Outside of that, we expect the cost base to be relatively constant, notwithstanding the variable nature of -- due to subscribers."

212741644,641463433,1857966,"News Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy,",1456,"Thanks, Mike. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy, in particular, a struggling Australian property market, as well as difficult comparisons with the prior year onetime revenue item, a noncash impairment charge in this quarter. 
For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.34 billion with total segment EBITDA of $221 million. This represents a decline of 7% in revenues and 38% in profitability versus the prior year. Of the revenue decline, 3% was directly attributable to currency and 2% to our onetime cash payment last year by [indiscernible] in the U.K. 
Before getting into the final details of the quarter by segment, I want to address a significant development that bodes well for our future prospects. There has been a fundamental change in the content landscape. For over a decade, News Corp has led the international debate in seeking fair returns for our high-quality content from the digital platforms. Clearly, the dominant digital platforms are under intense and continuing regulatory scrutiny on issues such as privacy and an opaque advertising market. There has, however, been a substantial development with Facebook's decision to pay a significant premium for our premium journalism at the WSJ and beyond. This decision begins to change the content equation, and we expect a positive impact on financials at our News and Information Services segment over the long term, beginning this fiscal year. 
The Facebook deal complements the agreement we reached with Apple in March when The Wall Street Journal became a launch partner for Apple News Plus, which expanded the reach of The Journal and its journalism to new audiences. Our brands and our content obviously benefit from the marketing region prowess of a partner, which has nearly 189 million phones in the U.S. and 1.4 billion devices globally. 
We expect the sectoral shift in the value of digital content to have significant implications for our investors and our bottom line. And let us be clear, these unprecedented changes in the publishing industry would not have been achieved without the determination of Rupert and [ Lock ] and Murdoch and the unwavering support of the new score board, which has taken a long-term principal stand on the need to change the digital ecosystem. Other publishers around the world should feel free to send us a commission for services rendered. 
Another development worth highlighting is the ongoing simplification of News Corp. As you are aware, we have put our News America Marketing business under strategic review and are in discussions regarding a possible sale of that business. We expect to update you in due course. 
Consistent with that theme of simplification, we have our Unruly ad tech business under strategic view and are also in discussions about a potential sale. We have learned much from the very talented team at Unruly, and those lessons will inform our ad business for many, many years to come. 
With simplification being an ongoing process, the company will continue to review its structure with the aim of bringing extra focus to our key assets, allowing investors to have a far clear review of their prospects. 
Let me turn to the News and Information Services segment in which Dow Jones had a strong quarter with increased revenues and greater profitability year-over-year. Wall Street Journal subscriptions grew 8%, and we have crossed the 70% threshold for the number of digital-only subscribers. 
Important to note, we currently do not include readers of Apple News Plus in that number. So it certainly does not fully capture the number of readers who are now paying for access to The Journal. 
Advertising revenue at Dow Jones grew 2% in the quarter and led notably by strong digital outperformance at wsj.com, which grew 13% as compared to a decline of the New York Times. We also saw stronger circulation revenue growth and increasing profitability as compared to the New York Times. 
Dow Jones Professional Information Business continued to drive, with the burgeoning risk and compliance sector, in particular, growing 25% year-over-year. With many companies under intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the imperative to minimize risk and to maximize compliance remains a burgeoning source of business. 
Overall, our Professional Information Business represents a pronounced distinguishing advantage over media competitors and provides multiple opportunities for us to upsell specialist content to companies, professional investors and individual investors who actively manage their portfolio. 
Barron's group continued to report strong traffic growth in Q1, with total unique users up 27% year-over-year driven by Market Watch and Barron's online. Barron's subscribers grew 7% to 587,000, while Market Watch Q1 revenue was its strongest quarterly revenue performance ever. 
In the U.K., digital subscribers at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 312,000. Advertising in local currency was up for the first time since Q3 of financial year '18 as digital growth more than offset modest print declines. Digital advertising growth of the Sun accelerated from the prior quarter rate and benefited from a growing audience and higher yield with approximately 129 global monthly unique users in September 2019. 
Meanwhile, at wireless, the October [indiscernible] results show that the reach of wireless stations grew 21% year-over-year with a 26% increase in listening hours. And propelled by Chris Evans joining the network, Virgin Radio experienced a 300% increase in reach and a 500% jump in listening hours. 
Meanwhile, talkSPORT had a 20% increase in digital listening, thanks in part to the new premier league rights, which drive Saturday listening up 120% year-over-year. 
In Australia, there were harsh economic conditions that affected all of our businesses, including HarperCollins. In media, we continue to execute on our digital strategy with the mastheads reaching more than 542,000 digital subscribers, representing 23% year-over-year growth. At the Australian, 65% of subscribers were digital, showing that a subscription sensibility is indeed evolving and more people expect to pay more for digital products. 
Circulation revenue was also lifted by cover price increases at our metropolitan mastheads. We took the bold step of sharply increasing the cover price of the New York Post in June, and there has been a 12% year-over-year increase in circulation revenue. Advertising also rose at a similar rate. 
It is worth noting that more than 70% of The Post advertising revenues in the quarter were digital. 
Turning to subscription video services. Total subscribers at Foxtel grew 6% year-over-year despite the difficult conditions in Australia. The latest number of paying payer subscribers as of November 5 reached 402,000 with total subscribers at 443,000, and this is less than a year after its launch. 
With the Rugby World Cup ending last week, Kayo is now preparing for the seasonal shift to cricket and other summer sports in Australia. And Kayo customers continue to be highly engaged with over 75% of subscribers using the product each and every week.  Kayo is a premium streaming service and shows that a far larger number of Australians are prepared to pay for content they had previously been presumed. Given that we have already acquired the sports rights, it's another important opportunity to monetize those rights without undermining the core. 
[Audio Gap] 
operator of realtor.com had a robust quarter, and we have reason to be optimistic over its prospects, thanks to signs of improving health in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales are on the rise, and there has been rapid audience growth at realtor.com where there was an 18% year-over-year increase in traffic in the quarter. 
Based on the most recent comScore data, real.com traffic is clearly going significantly faster than that of our nearest competitor. 
In addition, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of Opcity, a business that is helping realtor.com become even more connected to consumers and to realtors who are provided with higher quality refined leads that we expect to monetize in adjacencies such as mortgages. We are not entering the house flipping distressed sale business, but we want to offer vendors as many potential purchases as possible. The more competition for our house, the higher the price for the seller. 
While we have been in a period of reinvestment of Move due to the Opcity acquisition, we are seeing the benefits of that commitment with improving financials, and that will accelerate in the second half. 
For News Corp, as the year unfolds, the simplification of our structure will continue, and we expect to see further benefits from the shift in the balance of power between creators of content and the digital distributors. Investors in News Corp should be the beneficiaries of that fundamental transformation. 
And now for further insight, we will turn to Sue."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted by last year's onetime benefit related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K., coupled with continued currency headwinds and challenging prior year comparisons at HarperCollins. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA decreased 30%. Net loss for the quarter was $211 million compared to net income of $128 million in the prior year, reflecting a $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. 
For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.39 as compared to earnings per share of $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down approximately 8% versus the prior year. Currency had a $35 million or 3% negative impact. 
Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper [ markets ] represented 38% of the combined revenues. Approximately 34% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 33% in the prior year, which included the onetime [indiscernible] payment. 
Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $15 million or 3% due to negative currency fluctuations. Performance was stable versus the prior quarter rate. 
Improvements at Dow Jones and News U.K., absent currency impacts, were offset by declines at News America Marketing and News Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 1% versus the prior year despite a $15 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Growth was again led by Dow Jones. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was [ $56 ] million, down from $109 million, with the decline due primarily to the absence of the net [ benefit ] related to the exit of the partnerships with Sun Bets in the U.K. last year. 
We reclassified approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter of fiscal  2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. The costs are mainly related initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic asset and some shared technology services to directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the first quarter remained very healthy, growing 6%, benefiting from 17% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to approximately 1.9 million as well as subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 71% of the total subscriber base at The Wall Street Journal, up from 65% last year. 
We see the opportunity to scale The Wall Street Journal, both directly and through valuable third-party relationships, as Robert mentioned. As a result, we expect to see incremental revenues from these partnerships this year. 
Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and financial news in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that digital-only, subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to almost 2.3 million subscribers. 
We remain optimistic about our Professional Information Business, which accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. The key growth engine continues to be in risk and compliance, which accelerated its revenue growth to 25% in the quarter compared to the prior quarter. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew a robust 8% this quarter. 
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter rose 2%, an improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter. It's led by digital growth with a relatively stable print performance. Digital advertising accounted for 42% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 37% last year. 
We continue to balance healthy revenue growth at Dow Jones with reinvestment, which is leading to ongoing profit growth. 
Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues were flat on a reported basis and up 6% in local currency, representing the first year-over-year increase in local currencies since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The U.K. showed notable growth in digital, particularly at The Sun, which is growing in both audience and engagement. 
Advertising conditions in Australia were more challenged, notably in print, with advertising revenues down 13% on a reported basis and down 8% in local currency. Digital growth helped mitigate print declines with continued growth from music stand, small medium business initiatives and news.com.au.
On circulation, our digital paid subscribers again grew in an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% at The Times and The Sunday Times and 22% at News Australia. The increase in digital subscribers, along with cover price increases at both News UK and News Australia, helped mitigate print volume declines and currency headwinds. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 10% driven by weakness in freestanding insert products given the ongoing digital migration, but partially offset by growth in in-store product revenue, which accounted for roughly half of the overall revenue. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $514 million, down 9% versus [ $565 ] million in the prior year, of which $34 million or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Kayo and Foxtel Now. 
Importantly, as we look at a core driver of the business, TV subscription revenue, which includes both broadcast and OTT revenue, excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth from OTT products almost offset broadcast declines in the quarter, which will be key to the stability of the business. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $81 million, down 28% with the prior year, which, in addition to the revenue trends, was also impacted by [ $16 ] million of costs related to domestic cricket rights, which we didn't have in the prior year and $14 million related to the noncash accelerated amortization of certain of our entertaining -- entertainment programming costs, as we highlighted last quarter. We continue to expect approximately $30 million to $35 million impact from the accelerated amortization for the full year with a greater impact in the first half of the year. 
Other costs notably in overheads were lower this quarter as the team is focused on rightsizing the cost base. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 20% lower than the prior year and for the cash flow generation to improve. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, with volume growing 6% versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo last November. Of that subscriber base, over 2.3 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers, and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now. Kayo paying subscribers grew to [ 364,000 ], up from 331,000 last quarter or 12% of the total Foxtel subscriber base, including trial list rose 430,000 subscribers. We are seeing that customer activations are more pronounced around big events. The first quarter had less exclusive content, particularly following the Cricket World Cup, but we have seen notably stronger ads with the start of the Rugby World Cup, which began in late September. As of November 5, Kayo paying subscribers have increased to approximately 402,000. 
We continue to see that Kayo subscribers are incremental to the subscriber base with very little cannibalization from the core broadcast business. 
Paying subscribers for Foxtel Now were approximately 375,000, down from 446,000 last quarter following the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, but still up from the prior year and have seen an improvement in ARPU from both the last quarter and the prior year. In addition, Foxtel is also planning a new entertainment product, which will leverage the Kayo performance with the commercial launch anticipated later in this fiscal year. 
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 14.4% versus 12.9% in the prior year, but down from 14.7% in Q4, reflecting continued focus on churn management in the Foxtel direct channel and higher penetration of the iQ4 set-top boxes. 
As a reminder, lower ARPU customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months compounded by a price rise is resulting in higher churn versus the prior year. Churn from platinum and sports [indiscernible] remain materially lower than the base. 
Broadcast ARPU grew 2% to about AUD 78 per month. We expect to complete the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt in the coming weeks, which will include a package of bank refinancing, third-party financing and additional shareholder funding. As part of the refinancing, News Corp has contributed an additional AUD 200 million loan, and the new financing will extend maturities for at least 3 years and, importantly, provide Foxtel with ample liquidity and flexibility to execute on its strategy. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins faced an unusually difficult comparison to the prior year due to the success of [indiscernible] Go Wash Your Face, [ Angie Thomas ] The Hate You Give and Mark [indiscernible]. As a result, revenues for the quarter fell 3% to $405 million and segment EBITDA fell to $49 million. 
Notable releases this quarter include [ Daniel Silvers New Gill ] and Patches, the Dutch House [indiscernible] The Last Window, Demi Moore's Inside Out and Ant Middleton's The Fear Bubble. Digital revenues declined 5% and represented 20% -- 22% of consumer revenues also impacted by the year ago comparison. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 7% to $272 million, of which $10 million or 3% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. 
REA Group revenues were down 14% and down 8% in local currency as higher yield and improved product mix was more than offset by an overall 15% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter. Developer revenues were also down on the back of a 26% decline in new project development. Revenue decline was also impacted by the extended duration of premier all listings from 45 to 60 days, which increased the revenue deferral for the period. 
Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. 
Group revenues rose 4% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 11%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 80% of total revenues, was led by higher contribution from Opcity, combined with an improvement in lead volume and audience. This is in the context of the U.S. heavy market showing signs of improvement, with existing home sales up low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. The test also allows us to better control the consumer experience and the transaction. 
Although it is still relatively early in the testing, every single one of the core metrics has gone up materially. Leads, meeting rates, home values and close rates are all trending in the right direction. We are very encouraged by the results and have continued to allocate more leads to the Opcity model, which will allow greater opportunities to further extend into ancillary revenues. 
On audience, we saw an acceleration in audience growth versus the fourth quarter growth rate with average monthly unique users at realtor.com reaching over 71 million, rising 18% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in both page views and time spent. Segment EBITDA fell 22% to $82 million due to REA revenue declines and investment at Move due to Opcity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined just 2%. 
Other costs increased to $47 million from $37 million. The majority of the increase is related to higher equity comp due to the performance, existing schemes and the stock appreciation since the grant date as well as the phasing of certain strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we do not expect this increase to be reflective of the full year. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. In News and Information services, advertising trends thus far remains similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We continue to seek cost efficiencies, particularly in both the U.K. and Australia. Comparisons should ease now that we have moved past the Sun Bets benefit, and we expect to show improvements, particularly at our news brands. 
In Subscription Video Services, we will anniversary the acquisition of the domestic cricket rights, and cost trends should be more favorable. We will also lap the price increase from October last year. 
In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we're excited about the recent launch of [indiscernible] Pioneer Woman, The New Frontier, although we'll continue to face difficult comparisons as the prior year included [ Joanna Gaine's ] Homebody and strong backlist sales. Given the timing of the release schedule, we expect performance will be more second half weighted. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we anticipate improvements at Move as we lap the Opcity acquisition, particularly in the second half. As noted on their release, REA expects revenue growth to be skewed towards the second half of the fiscal year. Please see the release for more detail. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And there are a couple of other initiatives that are notable. When you click on a headline in the Facebook News tab, you'll be taken to our side. So the story is not hosted by Facebook. And that means that we're able to sell advertising directly, and we'll have a more lucrative flow of permission data. And these were all essential preconditions for our ascent and our agreement, and will have a long-term benefit on our accounts. 
The fact is that there'll be less providence if there's not a premium for [ Providence ]. And it's frankly clear that the revenue show flow had shifted dramatically from the creators to the distributors. So for us, there are -- commercially, there are 2 things that are meaningful and absolutely essential. Firstly, development of a subscription sensibility. There has to be more of a propensity to pay. Thankfully, Facebook understood that priority. Secondly, the digital advertising market is dysfunctional. The so-called open market is a virtual monopoly.

If you think back even 12 months ago, the prospects of Facebook paying for content to [indiscernible], as we called it, in fact, Rupert was the first to cite that as a need, the prospects seem remote. It's now real. And what we're finding generally in our discussion with the digital platforms is that, that they have indeed adopted a new approach. They realize that for various reasons that their past policies were unsustainable. But as I made clear to you, it's not just about paying a premium for premium journalism. It is also about sorting out what is an opaque advertising market, and there's no doubt that the regulatory pressure in that area is only going to increase. And a consequence of that, well, I suspect, be that as we're already seeing, more advertisers understand how dysfunctional that market is and seek association with high-quality content, and we will undoubtedly be a beneficiary of that given the excellent journalism that we have, not only in this country, but around the world."

212741644,641463433,1858139,"News Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy,",1451,"Thanks, Mike. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy, in particular, a struggling Australian property market, as well as difficult comparisons with the prior year onetime revenue item, a noncash impairment charge in this quarter. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.34 billion with total segment EBITDA of $221 million. This represents a decline of 7% in revenues and 38% in profitability versus the prior year. Of the revenue decline, 3% was directly attributable to currency and 2% to our onetime cash payment last year by Tabcorp in the U.K. 
Before getting into the final details of the quarter by segment, I want to address a significant development that bodes well for our future prospects. There has been a fundamental change in the content landscape. For over a decade, News Corp has led the international debate in seeking fair returns for our high-quality content from the digital platforms. Clearly, the dominant digital platforms are under intense and continuing regulatory scrutiny on issues such as privacy and an opaque advertising market. There has, however, been a substantial development with Facebook's decision to pay a significant premium for our premium journalism at the WSJ and beyond. This decision begins to change the content equation, and we expect a positive impact on financials at our News and Information Services segment over the long term, beginning this fiscal year. The Facebook deal complements the agreement we reached with Apple in March when The Wall Street Journal became a launch partner for Apple News+, which expanded the reach of The Journal and its journalism to new audiences. Our brands and our content obviously benefit from the marketing region prowess of a partner, which has nearly 189 million phones in the U.S. and 1.4 billion devices globally. 
We expect the sectoral shift in the value of digital content to have significant implications for our investors and our bottom line. And let us be clear, these unprecedented changes in the publishing industry would not have been achieved without the determination of Rupert and Lock and Murdoch and the unwavering support of the new score board, which has taken a long-term principal stand on the need to change the digital ecosystem. Other publishers around the world should feel free to send us a commission for services rendered. 
Another development worth highlighting is the ongoing simplification of News Corp. As you are aware, we have put our News America Marketing business under strategic review and are in discussions regarding a possible sale of that business. We expect to update you in due course. 
Consistent with that theme of simplification, we have our Unruly ad tech business under strategic view and are also in discussions about a potential sale. We have learned much from the very talented team at Unruly, and those lessons will inform our ad business for many, many years to come. With simplification being an ongoing process, the company will continue to review its structure with the aim of bringing extra focus to our key assets, allowing investors to have a far clear review of their prospects. 
Let me turn to the News and Information Services segment in which Dow Jones had a strong quarter with increased revenues and greater profitability year-over-year. Wall Street Journal subscriptions grew 8%, and we have crossed the 70% threshold for the number of digital-only subscribers. Important to note, we currently do not include readers of Apple News+ in that number. So it certainly does not fully capture the number of readers who are now paying for access to The Journal. 
Advertising revenue at Dow Jones grew 2% in the quarter and led notably by strong digital outperformance at wsj.com, which grew 13% as compared to a decline of the New York Times. We also saw stronger circulation revenue growth and increasing profitability as compared to the New York Times. Dow Jones Professional Information Business continue to thrive, with the burgeoning risk and compliance sector, in particular, growing 25% year-over-year. With many companies under intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the imperative to minimize risk and to maximize compliance remains a burgeoning source of business. Overall, our Professional Information Business represents a pronounced distinguishing advantage over media competitors and provides multiple opportunities for us to upsell specialist content to companies, professional investors and individual investors who actively manage their portfolio. 
Barron's group continued to report strong traffic growth in Q1, with total unique users up 27% year-over-year driven by MarketWatch and Barron's online. Barron's subscribers grew 7% to 587,000, while MarketWatch Q1 revenue was its strongest quarterly revenue performance ever. 
In the U.K., digital subscribers at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 312,000. Advertising in local currency was up for the first time since Q3 of financial year '18 as digital growth more than offset modest print declines. Digital advertising growth of The Sun accelerated from the prior quarter rate and benefited from a growing audience and higher yield with approximately 129 global monthly unique users in September 2019. Meanwhile, at Wireless, the October radar results show that the reach of Wireless's stations grew 21% year-over-year with a 26% increase in listening hours. And propelled by Chris Evans joining the network, Virgin Radio experienced a 300% increase in reach and a 500% jump in listening hours. 
Meanwhile, talkSPORT had a 20% increase in digital listening, thanks in part to the new Premier League rights, which drive Saturday listening up 120% year-over-year. In Australia, there were harsh economic conditions that affected all of our businesses, including HarperCollins. In media, we continue to execute on our digital strategy with the mastheads reaching more than 542,000 digital subscribers, representing 23% year-over-year growth. At the Australian, 65% of subscribers were digital, showing that a subscription sensibility is indeed evolving and more people expect to pay more for digital products. Circulation revenue was also lifted by cover price increases at our metropolitan mastheads. We took the bold step of sharply increasing the cover price of the New York Post in June, and there has been a 12% year-over-year increase in circulation revenue. Advertising also rose at a similar rate. It is worth noting that more than 70% of The Post advertising revenues in the quarter were digital. 
Turning to subscription video services. Total subscribers at Foxtel grew 6% year-over-year despite the difficult conditions in Australia. The latest number of paying Kayo payer subscribers as of November 5 reached 402,000 with total subscribers at 443,000, and this is less than a year after its launch. With the Rugby World Cup ending last week, Kayo is now preparing for the seasonal shift to cricket and other summer sports in Australia. And Kayo customers continue to be highly engaged with over 75% of subscribers using the product each and every week. Kayo is a premium streaming service and shows that a far larger number of Australians are prepared to pay for content they had previously been presumed. Given that we have already acquired the sports rights, it's another important opportunity to monetize those rights without undermining the core. 
[Audio Gap] 
operator of realtor.com had a robust quarter, and we have reason to be optimistic over its prospects, thanks to signs of improving health in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales are on the rise, and there has been rapid audience growth at realtor.com where there was an 18% year-over-year increase in traffic in the quarter. 
Based on the most recent comScore data, realtor's.com traffic is clearly going significantly faster than that of our nearest competitor. 
In addition, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of Opcity, a business that is helping realtor.com become even more connected to consumers and to REALTORS who are provided with higher quality refined leads that we expect to monetize in adjacencies such as mortgages. We are not entering the house flipping distressed sale business, but we want to offer vendors as many potential purchases as possible. The more competition for our house, the higher the price for the seller. While we have been in a period of reinvestment of Move due to the Opcity acquisition, we are seeing the benefits of that commitment with improving financials, and that will accelerate in the second half. 
For News Corp, as the year unfolds, the simplification of our structure will continue, and we expect to see further benefits from the shift in a balance of power between creators of content and the digital distributors. Investors in News Corp should be the beneficiaries of that fundamental transformation. 
And now for further insight, we will turn to Susan."
212741644,641463433,1858139,"News Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted b",2329,"Thank you, Robert. 
Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted by last year's onetime benefit related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K., coupled with continued currency headwinds and challenging prior year comparisons at HarperCollins. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA decreased 30%. Net loss for the quarter was $211 million compared to net income of $128 million in the prior year, reflecting a $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.39 as compared to earnings per share of $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down approximately 8% versus the prior year. Currency had a $35 million or 3% negative impact. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 38% of the combined revenues. Approximately 34% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 33% in the prior year, which included the onetime Tabcorp payment. Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $15 million or 3% due to negative currency fluctuations. Performance was stable versus the prior quarter rate. Improvements at Dow Jones and News U.K., absent currency impacts, were offset by declines at News America Marketing and News Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 1% versus the prior year despite a $15 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Growth was again led by Dow Jones. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $56 million, down from $109 million, with the decline due primarily to the absence of the net benefit related to the exit of the partnerships with Sun Bets in the U.K. last year. We reclassified approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. The costs are mainly related to initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic asset and some shared technology services to directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the first quarter remained very healthy, growing 6%, benefiting from 17% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to approximately 1.9 million as well as subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 71% of the total subscriber base at The Wall Street Journal, up from 65% last year. We see a big opportunity to scale The Wall Street Journal, both directly and through valuable third-party relationships, as Robert mentioned. As a result, we expect to see incremental revenues from these partnerships this year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and financial news in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that digital-only, subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to almost 2.3 million subscribers. We remain optimistic about our Professional Information Business, which accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. The key growth engine continues to be in Risk and Compliance, which accelerated its revenue growth to 25% in the quarter compared to the prior quarter. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew a robust 8% this quarter. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter rose 2%, an improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter rate. It's led by digital growth with a relatively stable print performance. Digital advertising accounted for 42% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 37% last year. 
We continue to balance healthy revenue growth at Dow Jones with reinvestment, which is leading to ongoing profit growth. Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues were flat on a reported basis and up 6% in local currency, representing the first year-over-year increase in local currencies since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The U.K. showed notable growth in digital, particularly at The Sun, which is growing in both audience and engagement. 
Advertising conditions in Australia were more challenged, notably in print, with advertising revenues down 13% on a reported basis and down 8% in local currency. Digital growth helped mitigate print declines with continued growth from music stand, small medium business initiatives and news.com.au.
On circulation, our digital paid subscribers again grew at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% at The Times and The Sunday Times and 22% at News Australia. The increase in digital subscribers, along with cover price increases at both News UK and News Australia, helped mitigate print volume declines and currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 10% driven by weakness in freestanding insert products given the ongoing digital migration, but partially offset by growth in in-store product revenue, which accounted for roughly half of the overall revenue. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $514 million, down 9% versus $565 million in the prior year, of which $34 million or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Kayo and Foxtel Now. Importantly, as we look at a core driver of the business, TV subscription revenue, which includes both broadcast and OTT revenue, excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth from OTT products almost offset broadcast declines in the quarter, which will be key to the stability of the business. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $81 million, down 28% with the prior year, which, in addition to the revenue trends, was also impacted by $16 million of costs related to domestic cricket rights, which we didn't have in the prior year and $14 million related to the noncash accelerated amortization of certain of our entertaining -- entertainment programming costs, as we highlighted last quarter. We continue to expect approximately $30 million to $35 million impact from the accelerated amortization for the full year with a greater impact in the first half of the year. 
Other costs notably in overheads were lower this quarter as the team is focused on rightsizing the cost base. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 20% lower than the prior year and for the cash flow generation to improve. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, with volume growing 6% versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo last November. Of that subscriber base, over 2.3 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers, and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now. Kayo paying subscribers grew to 364,000, up from 331,000 last quarter or 12% of the total Foxtel subscriber base, including trial list Kayo rose 430,000 subscribers. We are seeing that customer activations are more pronounced around big events. The first quarter had less exclusive content, particularly following the Cricket World Cup, but we have seen notably stronger ads with the start of the Rugby World Cup, which began in late September. As of November 5, Kayo paying subscribers have increased to approximately 402,000. 
We continue to see that Kayo subscribers are incremental to the subscriber base with very little cannibalization from the core broadcast business. Paying subscribers for Foxtel Now were approximately 375,000, down from 446,000 last quarter following the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, but still up from the prior year and have seen an improvement in ARPU from both the last quarter and the prior year. In addition, Foxtel is also planning a new entertainment product, which will leverage the Kayo platform with the commercial launch anticipated later in this fiscal year. 
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 14.4% versus 12.9% in the prior year, but down from 14.7% in Q4, reflecting continued focus on churn management in the Foxtel direct channel and higher penetration of the iQ4 set-top boxes. 
As a reminder, lower ARPU customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months compounded by a price rise is resulting in higher churn versus the prior year. Churn from platinum and sports teams remain materially lower than the base. 
Broadcast ARPU grew 2% to about AUD 78 per month. We expect to complete the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt in the coming weeks, which will include a package of bank refinancing, third-party financing and additional shareholder funding. As part of the refinancing, News Corp has contributed an additional AUD 200 million loan, and the new financing that will extend maturities for at least 3 years and, importantly, provide Foxtel with ample liquidity and flexibility to execute on its strategy. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins faced an unusually difficult comparison to the prior year due to the success of Rachel Hollis' Girl, Wash Your Face, Angie Thoma's The Hate U Give and Mark Manson's Subtle Art. As a result, revenues for the quarter fell 3% to $405 million and segment EBITDA fell to $49 million. 
Notable releases this quarter include Daniel Silva's New Girl, Ann Patchett's, The Dutch House, Karin Slaughter's The Last Widow, Demi Moore's Inside Out and Ant Middleton's The Fear Bubble. Digital revenues declined 5% and represented 20% -- 22% of consumer revenues also impacted by the year ago comparison. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 7% to $272 million, of which $10 million or 3% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. REA Group revenues were down 14% and down 8% in local currency as higher yield and improved product mix was more than offset by an overall 15% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter. Developer revenues were also down on the back of a 26% decline in new project development. Revenue decline was also impacted by the extended duration of premier all listings from 45 to 60 days, which increased the revenue deferral for the period. 
Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. Group revenues rose 4% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 11%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 80% of total revenues, was led by a higher contribution from Opcity, combined with an improvement in lead volume and audience. This is in the context of the U.S. housing market showing signs of improvement, with existing home sales up low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. The test also allows us to better control the consumer experience and the transaction. Although it is still relatively early in the testing, every single one of the core metrics has gone up materially. Leads, meeting rates, home values and close rates are all trending in the right direction. We are very encouraged by the results and have continued to allocate more leads to the Opcity model, which will allow greater opportunities to further extend into ancillary revenues. On audience, we saw an acceleration in audience growth versus the fourth quarter growth rate with average monthly unique users at realtor.com reaching over 71 million, rising 18% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in both page views and time spent. Segment EBITDA fell 22% to $82 million due to REA revenue declines and investment at Move due to Opcity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined just 2%. 
Other costs increased to $47 million from $37 million. The majority of the increase is related to higher equity comp due to the performance, existing schemes and the stock appreciation since the grant date as well as the phasing of certain strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we do not expect this increase to be reflective of the full year. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. In News and Information services, advertising trends thus far remains similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We continue to seek cost efficiencies, particularly in both the U.K. and Australia. Comparisons should ease now that we have moved past the Sun Bets benefit, and we expect to show improvements, particularly at our news brands. 
In Subscription Video Services, we will anniversary the acquisition of the domestic cricket rights, and cost trends should be more favorable. We will also lap the price increase from October last year. In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we're excited about the recent launch of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman The New Frontier, although we'll continue to face difficult comparisons as the prior year included Joanna Gaine's Homebody and strong backlist sales. Given the timing of the release schedule, we expect performance will be more second half weighted. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we anticipate improvements at Move as we lap the Opcity acquisition, particularly in the second half. As noted on their release, REA expects revenue growth to be skewed towards the second half of the fiscal year. Please see the release for more detail. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And there are a couple of other initiatives that are notable. When you click on a headline in the Facebook News tab, you'll be taken to our site. So the story is not hosted by Facebook. And that means that we're able to sell advertising directly, and we'll have a more lucrative flow of permission data. And these were all essential preconditions for our ascent and our agreement, and will have a long-term benefit on our accounts. 
The fact is that there'll be less providence if there's not a premium for Providence. And it's frankly clear that the revenue show flow had shifted dramatically from the creators to the distributors. So for us, there are -- commercially, there are 2 things that are meaningful and absolutely essential. Firstly, development of a subscription sensibility. There has to be more of a propensity to pay. Thankfully, Facebook understood that priority. Secondly, the digital advertising market is dysfunctional. The so-called open market is a virtual monopoly. We've been very public about our concerns on that segment, which is in dire need of reform, and is thankfully now under close scrutiny by 50 U.S. attorneys general."

So over the full year, absent those costs, we would expect the whole cost base to be relatively stable. But it is important to note that the team down in Australia are continuing to focus on rightsizing their cost base and are continuing to look for opportunities as they move forward. 
In relation to [ Aeries ], we are looking to launch that towards the back half of this particular fiscal year. We're not expecting to see significant incremental costs to your point.

As for Move, both short, medium and long term, we believe that realtor.com is a tremendous property. You could see that the growth in audience is far superior to that at Zillow at the moment. If you take the independent comScore figures from September, the unique users at realtor.com were up 17%, while Zillow grew at only 2%. And Trulia actually shrank by 2%. And the divergence was even more marked on desktop with 10% of growth at realtor and Zillow, down by 12% year-on-year.

If you think back even 12 months ago, the prospects of Facebook paying for content, a carriage fee, as we called it, in fact, Rupert was the first to cite that as a need, the prospects seem remote. It's now real. And what we're finding generally in our discussion with the digital platforms is that, that they have indeed adopted a new approach. They realize that for various reasons that their past policies were unsustainable. But as I made clear to you, it's not just about paying a premium for premium journalism. It is also about sorting out what is an opaque advertising market, and there's no doubt that the regulatory pressure in that area is only going to increase. And a consequence of that, well, I suspect, be that as we're already seeing, more advertisers understand how dysfunctional that market is and seek association with high-quality content, and we will undoubtedly be a beneficiary of that given the excellent journalism that we have, not only in this country, but around the world."

In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy,",1453,"Thanks, Mike. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy, in particular, a struggling Australian property market, as well as difficult comparisons with the prior year onetime revenue item, a noncash impairment charge in this quarter. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.34 billion with total segment EBITDA of $221 million. This represents a decline of 7% in revenues and 38% in profitability versus the prior year. Of the revenue decline, 3% was directly attributable to currency and 2% to our onetime cash payment last year by Tabcorp in the U.K. 
Before getting into the final details of the quarter by segment, I want to address a significant development that bodes well for our future prospects. There has been a fundamental change in the content landscape. For over a decade, News Corp has led the international debate in seeking fair returns for our high-quality content from the digital platforms. Clearly, the dominant digital platforms are under intense and continuing regulatory scrutiny on issues such as privacy and an opaque advertising market. There has, however, been a substantial development with Facebook's decision to pay a significant premium for our premium journalism at the WSJ and beyond. This decision begins to change the content equation, and we expect a positive impact on financials at our News and Information Services segment over the long term, beginning this fiscal year. The Facebook deal complements the agreement we reached with Apple in March when The Wall Street Journal became a launch partner for Apple News+, which expanded the reach of The Journal and its journalism to new audiences. Our brands and our content obviously benefit from the marketing region prowess of a partner, which has nearly 189 million phones in the U.S. and 1.4 billion devices globally. 
We expect the sectoral shift in the value of digital content to have significant implications for our investors and our bottom line. And let us be clear, these unprecedented changes in the publishing industry would not have been achieved without the determination of Rupert and Lock and Murdoch and the unwavering support of the new score board, which has taken a long-term principal stand on the need to change the digital ecosystem. Other publishers around the world should feel free to send us a commission for services rendered. 
Another development worth highlighting is the ongoing simplification of News Corp. As you are aware, we have put our News America Marketing business under strategic review and are in discussions regarding a possible sale of that business. We expect to update you in due course. 
Consistent with that theme of simplification, we have our Unruly ad tech business under strategic view and are also in discussions about a potential sale. We have learned much from the very talented team at Unruly, and those lessons will inform our ad business for many, many years to come. With simplification being an ongoing process, the company will continue to review its structure with the aim of bringing extra focus to our key assets, allowing investors to have a far clearer review of their prospects. 
Let me turn to the News and Information Services segment in which Dow Jones had a strong quarter with increased revenues and greater profitability year-over-year. Wall Street Journal subscriptions grew 8%, and we have crossed the 70% threshold for the number of digital-only subscribers. Important to note, we currently do not include readers of Apple News+ in that number. So it certainly does not fully capture the number of readers who are now paying for access to The Journal. 
Advertising revenue at Dow Jones grew 2% in the quarter and led notably by strong digital outperformance at wsj.com, which grew 13% as compared to a decline of the New York Times. We also saw stronger circulation revenue growth and increasing profitability as compared to the New York Times. Dow Jones Professional Information Business continue to thrive, with the burgeoning risk and compliance sector, in particular, growing 25% year-over-year. With many companies under intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the imperative to minimize risk and to maximize compliance remains a burgeoning source of business. Overall, our Professional Information Business represents a pronounced distinguishing advantage over media competitors and provides multiple opportunities for us to upsell specialist content to companies, professional investors and individual investors who actively manage their portfolio. 
Barron's group continued to report strong traffic growth in Q1, with total unique users up 27% year-over-year driven by MarketWatch and Barron's online. Barron's subscribers grew 7% to 587,000, while MarketWatch Q1 revenue was its strongest quarterly revenue performance ever. 
In the U.K., digital subscribers at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 312,000. Advertising in local currency was up for the first time since Q3 of financial year '18 as digital growth more than offset modest print declines. Digital advertising growth of The Sun accelerated from the prior quarter rate and benefited from a growing audience and higher yield with approximately 129 global monthly unique users in September 2019. Meanwhile, at Wireless, the October [ radar ] results show that the reach of Wireless's stations grew 21% year-over-year with a 26% increase in listening hours. And propelled by Chris Evans joining the network, Virgin Radio experienced a 300% increase in reach and a 500% jump in listening hours. 
Meanwhile, talkSPORT had a 20% increase in digital listening, thanks in part to the new Premier League rights, which drive Saturday listening up 120% year-over-year. In Australia, there were harsh economic conditions that affected all of our businesses, including HarperCollins. In media, we continue to execute on our digital strategy with the mastheads reaching more than 542,000 digital subscribers, representing 23% year-over-year growth. At the Australian, 65% of subscribers were digital, showing that a subscription sensibility is indeed evolving and more people expect to pay more for digital products. Circulation revenue was also lifted by cover price increases at our metropolitan mastheads. We took the bold step of sharply increasing the cover price of the New York Post in June, and there has been a 12% year-over-year increase in circulation revenue. Advertising also rose at a similar rate. It is worth noting that more than 70% of The Post advertising revenues in the quarter were digital. 
Turning to subscription video services. Total subscribers at Foxtel grew 6% year-over-year despite the difficult conditions in Australia. The latest number of paying Kayo payer subscribers as of November 5 reached 402,000 with total subscribers at 443,000, and this is less than a year after its launch. With the Rugby World Cup ending last week, Kayo is now preparing for the seasonal shift to cricket and other summer sports in Australia. And Kayo customers continue to be highly engaged with over 75% of subscribers using the product each and every week. Kayo is a premium streaming service and shows that a far larger number of Australians are prepared to pay for content they had previously been presumed. Given that we have already acquired the sports rights, it's another important opportunity to monetize those rights without undermining the core. 
[Audio Gap] 
operator of realtor.com had a robust quarter, and we have reason to be optimistic over its prospects, thanks to signs of improving health in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales are on the rise, and there has been rapid audience growth at realtor.com where there was an 18% year-over-year increase in traffic in the quarter. 
Based on the most recent Comscore data, realtor's.com traffic is clearly going significantly faster than that of our nearest competitor. 
In addition, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of Opcity, a business that is helping realtor.com become even more connected to consumers and to REALTORS who are provided with higher quality refined leads that we expect to monetize in adjacencies such as mortgages. We are not entering the house flipping distressed sale business, but we want to offer vendors as many potential purchases as possible. The more competition for our house, the higher the price for the seller. While we have been in a period of reinvestment of Move due to the Opcity acquisition, we are seeing the benefits of that commitment with improving financials, and that will accelerate in the second half. 
For News Corp, as the year unfolds, the simplification of our structure will continue, and we expect to see further benefits from the shift in a balance of power between creators of content and the digital distributors. Investors in News Corp should be the beneficiaries of that fundamental transformation. 
And now for further insight, we will turn to Susan."
212741644,641463433,1860421,"News Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted b",2328,"Thank you, Robert. 
Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted by last year's onetime benefit related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K., coupled with continued currency headwinds and challenging prior year comparisons at HarperCollins. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA decreased 30%. Net loss for the quarter was $211 million compared to net income of $128 million in the prior year, reflecting a $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.39 as compared to earnings per share of $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down approximately 8% versus the prior year. Currency had a $35 million or 3% negative impact. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 38% of the combined revenues. Approximately 34% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 33% in the prior year, which included the onetime Tabcorp payment. Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $15 million or 3% due to negative currency fluctuations. Performance was stable versus the prior quarter rate. Improvements at Dow Jones and News U.K., absent currency impacts, were offset by declines at News America Marketing and News Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 1% versus the prior year despite a $15 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Growth was again led by Dow Jones. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $56 million, down from $109 million, with the decline due primarily to the absence of the net benefit related to the exit of the partnerships with Sun Bets in the U.K. last year. We reclassified approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. The costs are mainly related to initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic asset and some shared technology services that directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the first quarter remained very healthy, growing 6%, benefiting from 17% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to approximately 1.9 million as well as subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 71% of the total subscriber base at The Wall Street Journal, up from 65% last year. We see a big opportunity to scale The Wall Street Journal, both directly and through valuable third-party relationships, as Robert mentioned. As a result, we expect to see incremental revenues from these partnerships this year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and financial news in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that digital-only, subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to almost 2.3 million subscribers. We remain optimistic about our Professional Information Business, which accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. The key growth engine continues to be in Risk and Compliance, which accelerated its revenue growth to 25% in the quarter compared to the prior quarter. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew a robust 8% this quarter. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter rose 2%, an improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter rate led by digital growth with a relatively stable print performance. Digital advertising accounted for 42% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 37% last year. 
We continue to balance healthy revenue growth at Dow Jones with reinvestment, which is leading to ongoing profit growth. Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues were flat on a reported basis and up 6% in local currency, representing the first year-over-year increase in local currencies since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The U.K. showed notable growth in digital, particularly at The Sun, which is growing in both audience and engagement. 
Advertising conditions in Australia were more challenged, notably in print, with advertising revenues down 13% on a reported basis and down 8% in local currency. Digital growth helped mitigate print declines with continued growth from music stand, small medium business initiatives and news.com.au.
On circulation, our digital paid subscribers again grew at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% at The Times and The Sunday Times and 22% at News Australia. The increase in digital subscribers, along with cover price increases at both News UK and News Australia, helped mitigate print volume declines and currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 10% driven by weakness in freestanding insert products given the ongoing digital migration, but partially offset by growth in in-store product revenue, which accounted for roughly half of the overall revenue. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $514 million, down 9% versus $565 million in the prior year, of which $34 million or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Kayo and Foxtel Now. Importantly, as we look at a core driver of the business, TV subscription revenue, which includes both broadcast and OTT revenue, excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth from OTT products almost offset broadcast declines in the quarter, which will be key to the stability of the business. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $81 million, down 28% with the prior year, which, in addition to the revenue trends, was also impacted by $16 million of costs related to domestic cricket rights, which we didn't have in the prior year and $14 million related to the noncash accelerated amortization of certain of our entertaining -- entertainment programming costs, as we highlighted last quarter. We continue to expect approximately $30 million to $35 million impact from the accelerated amortization for the full year with a greater impact in the first half of the year. 
Other costs notably in overheads were lower this quarter as the team is focused on rightsizing the cost base. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 20% lower than the prior year and for the cash flow generation to improve. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, with volume growing 6% versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo last November. Of that subscriber base, over 2.3 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers, and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now. Kayo paying subscribers grew to 364,000, up from 331,000 last quarter or 12% of the total Foxtel subscriber base, including trial list Kayo rose 430,000 subscribers. We are seeing that customer activations are more pronounced around big events. The first quarter had less exclusive content, particularly following the Cricket World Cup, but we have seen notably stronger ads with the start of the Rugby World Cup, which began in late September. As of November 5, Kayo paying subscribers have increased to approximately 402,000. 
We continue to see that Kayo subscribers are incremental to the subscriber base with very little cannibalization from the core broadcast business. Paying subscribers for Foxtel Now were approximately 375,000, down from 446,000 last quarter following the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, but still up from the prior year and have seen an improvement in ARPU from both the last quarter and the prior year. In addition, Foxtel is also planning a new entertainment product, which will leverage the Kayo platform with the commercial launch anticipated later in this fiscal year. 
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 14.4% versus 12.9% in the prior year, but down from 14.7% in Q4, reflecting continued focus on churn management in the Foxtel direct channel and higher penetration of the iQ4 set-top boxes. 
As a reminder, lower ARPU customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months compounded by a price rise is resulting in higher churn versus the prior year. Churn from platinum and sports teams remain materially lower than the base. 
Broadcast ARPU grew 2% to about AUD 78 per month. We expect to complete the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt in the coming weeks, which will include a package of bank refinancing, third-party financing and additional shareholder funding. As part of the refinancing, News Corp has contributed an additional AUD 200 million loan, and the new financing that will extend maturities for at least 3 years and, importantly, provide Foxtel with ample liquidity and flexibility to execute on its strategy. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins faced an unusually difficult comparison to the prior year due to the success of Rachel Hollis' Girl, Wash Your Face, Angie Thoma's The Hate U Give and Mark Manson's Subtle Art. As a result, revenues for the quarter fell 3% to $405 million and segment EBITDA fell to $49 million. 
Notable releases this quarter include Daniel Silva's New Girl, Ann Patchett's, The Dutch House, Karin Slaughter's The Last Widow, Demi Moore's Inside Out and Ant Middleton's The Fear Bubble. Digital revenues declined 5% and represented 20% -- 22% of consumer revenues also impacted by the year ago comparison. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 7% to $272 million, of which $10 million or 3% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. REA Group revenues were down 14% and down 8% in local currency as higher yield and improved product mix was more than offset by an overall 15% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter. Developer revenues were also down on the back of a 26% decline in new project development. Revenue decline was also impacted by the extended duration of premier all listings from 45 to 60 days, which increased the revenue deferral for the period. 
Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. Group revenues rose 4% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 11%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 80% of total revenues, was led by a higher contribution from Opcity, combined with an improvement in lead volume and audience. This is in the context of the U.S. housing market showing signs of improvement, with existing home sales up low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. The test also allows us to better control the consumer experience and the transaction. Although it is still relatively early in the testing, every single one of the core metrics has gone up materially. Leads, meeting rates, home values and close rates are all trending in the right direction. We are very encouraged by the results and have continued to allocate more leads to the Opcity model, which will allow greater opportunities to further extend into ancillary revenues. On audience, we saw an acceleration in audience growth versus the fourth quarter growth rate with average monthly unique users at realtor.com reaching over 71 million, rising 18% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in both page views and time spent. Segment EBITDA fell 22% to $82 million due to REA revenue declines and investment at Move due to Opcity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined just 2%. 
Other costs increased to $47 million from $37 million. The majority of the increase is related to higher equity comp due to the performance, existing schemes and the stock appreciation since the grant date as well as the phasing of certain strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we do not expect this increase to be reflective of the full year. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. In News and Information services, advertising trends thus far remains similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We continue to seek cost efficiencies, particularly in both the U.K. and Australia. Comparisons should ease now that we have moved past the Sun Bets benefit, and we expect to show improvements, particularly at our news brands. 
In Subscription Video Services, we will anniversary the acquisition of the domestic cricket rights, and cost trends should be more favorable. We will also lap the price increase from October last year. In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we're excited about the recent launch of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman The New Frontier, although we'll continue to face difficult comparisons as the prior year included Joanna Gaine's Homebody and strong backlist sales. Given the timing of the release schedule, we expect performance will be more second half weighted. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we anticipate improvements at Move as we lap the Opcity acquisition, particularly in the second half. As noted on their release, REA expects revenue growth to be skewed towards the second half of the fiscal year. Please see the release for more detail. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And there are a couple of other initiatives that are notable. When you click on a headline in the Facebook News tab, you'll be taken to our site. So the story is not hosted by Facebook. And that means that we're able to sell advertising directly, and we'll have a more lucrative flow of permission data. And these were all essential preconditions for our ascent and our agreement, and will have a long-term benefit on our accounts. 
The fact is that there'll be less prominence if there's not a premium for Providence. And it's frankly clear that the revenue show flow had shifted dramatically from the creators to the distributors. So for us, there are -- commercially, there are 2 things that are meaningful and absolutely essential. Firstly, development of a subscription sensibility. There has to be more of a propensity to pay. Thankfully, Facebook understood that priority. Secondly, the digital advertising market is dysfunctional. The so-called open market is a virtual monopoly. We've been very public about our concerns on that segment, which is in dire need of reform, and is thankfully now under close scrutiny by 50 U.S. attorneys general."

But I think it's important to note when we think about the cost base, the largest increase that's come through is because of the noncash amortization in relation to those entertainment expenses. So over the full year, absent those costs, we would expect the whole cost base to be relatively stable. But it is important to note that the team down in Australia are continuing to focus on rightsizing their cost base and are continuing to look for opportunities as they move forward. 
In relation to [ Aeries ], we are looking to launch that towards the back half of this particular fiscal year. We're not expecting to see significant incremental costs to your point.

If you think back even 12 months ago, the prospects of Facebook paying for content, a carriage fee, as we called it, in fact, Rupert was the first to cite that as a need, the prospects seem remote. It's now real. And what we're finding generally in our discussion with the digital platforms is that, that they have indeed adopted a new approach. They realize that for various reasons that their past policies were unsustainable. But as I made clear to you, it's not just about paying a premium for premium journalism. It is also about sorting out what is an opaque advertising market, and there's no doubt that the regulatory pressure in that area is only going to increase. And a consequence of that, will, I suspect, be that as we're already seeing, more advertisers understand how dysfunctional that market is and seek association with high-quality content, and we will undoubtedly be a beneficiary of that given the excellent journalism that we have, not only in this country, but around the world."

212741644,641463433,1864329,"News Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy,",1453,"Thanks, Mike. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy, in particular, a struggling Australian property market, as well as difficult comparisons with the prior year onetime revenue item, a noncash impairment charge in this quarter. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.34 billion with total segment EBITDA of $221 million. This represents a decline of 7% in revenues and 38% in profitability versus the prior year. Of the revenue decline, 3% was directly attributable to currency and 2% to our onetime cash payment last year by Tabcorp in the U.K. 
Before getting into the final details of the quarter by segment, I want to address a significant development that bodes well for our future prospects. There has been a fundamental change in the content landscape. For over a decade, News Corp has led the international debate in seeking fair returns for our high-quality content from the digital platforms. Clearly, the dominant digital platforms are under intense and continuing regulatory scrutiny on issues such as privacy and an opaque advertising market. There has, however, been a substantial development with Facebook's decision to pay a significant premium for our premium journalism at the WSJ and beyond. This decision begins to change the content equation, and we expect a positive impact on financials at our News and Information Services segment over the long term, beginning this fiscal year. The Facebook deal complements the agreement we reached with Apple in March when The Wall Street Journal became a launch partner for Apple News+, which expanded the reach of The Journal and its journalism to new audiences. Our brands and our content obviously benefit from the marketing region prowess of a partner, which has nearly 189 million phones in the U.S. and 1.4 billion devices globally. 
We expect the sectoral shift in the value of digital content to have significant implications for our investors and our bottom line. And let us be clear, these unprecedented changes in the publishing industry would not have been achieved without the determination of Rupert and Lock and Murdoch and the unwavering support of the new score board, which has taken a long-term principal stand on the need to change the digital ecosystem. Other publishers around the world should feel free to send us a commission for services rendered. 
Another development worth highlighting is the ongoing simplification of News Corp. As you are aware, we have put our News America Marketing business under strategic review and are in discussions regarding a possible sale of that business. We expect to update you in due course. 
Consistent with that theme of simplification, we have our Unruly ad tech business under strategic view and are also in discussions about a potential sale. We have learned much from the very talented team at Unruly, and those lessons will inform our ad business for many, many years to come. With simplification being an ongoing process, the company will continue to review its structure with the aim of bringing extra focus to our key assets, allowing investors to have a far clearer review of their prospects. 
Let me turn to the News and Information Services segment in which Dow Jones had a strong quarter with increased revenues and greater profitability year-over-year. Wall Street Journal subscriptions grew 8%, and we have crossed the 70% threshold for the number of digital-only subscribers. Important to note, we currently do not include readers of Apple News+ in that number. So it certainly does not fully capture the number of readers who are now paying for access to The Journal. 
Advertising revenue at Dow Jones grew 2% in the quarter and led notably by strong digital outperformance at wsj.com, which grew 13% as compared to a decline of the New York Times. We also saw stronger circulation revenue growth and increasing profitability as compared to the New York Times. Dow Jones Professional Information Business continue to thrive, with the burgeoning risk and compliance sector, in particular, growing 25% year-over-year. With many companies under intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the imperative to minimize risk and to maximize compliance remains a burgeoning source of business. Overall, our Professional Information Business represents a pronounced distinguishing advantage over media competitors and provides multiple opportunities for us to upsell specialist content to companies, professional investors and individual investors who actively manage their portfolio. 
Barron's group continued to report strong traffic growth in Q1, with total unique users up 27% year-over-year driven by MarketWatch and Barron's online. Barron's subscribers grew 7% to 587,000, while MarketWatch Q1 revenue was its strongest quarterly revenue performance ever. 
In the U.K., digital subscribers at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 312,000. Advertising in local currency was up for the first time since Q3 of financial year '18 as digital growth more than offset modest print declines. Digital advertising growth of The Sun accelerated from the prior quarter rate and benefited from a growing audience and higher yield with approximately 129 global monthly unique users in September 2019. Meanwhile, at Wireless, the October [ radar ] results show that the reach of Wireless's stations grew 21% year-over-year with a 26% increase in listening hours. And propelled by Chris Evans joining the network, Virgin Radio experienced a 300% increase in reach and a 500% jump in listening hours. 
Meanwhile, talkSPORT had a 20% increase in digital listening, thanks in part to the new Premier League rights, which drive Saturday listening up 120% year-over-year. In Australia, there were harsh economic conditions that affected all of our businesses, including HarperCollins. In media, we continue to execute on our digital strategy with the mastheads reaching more than 542,000 digital subscribers, representing 23% year-over-year growth. At the Australian, 65% of subscribers were digital, showing that a subscription sensibility is indeed evolving and more people expect to pay more for digital products. Circulation revenue was also lifted by cover price increases at our metropolitan mastheads. We took the bold step of sharply increasing the cover price of the New York Post in June, and there has been a 12% year-over-year increase in circulation revenue. Advertising also rose at a similar rate. It is worth noting that more than 70% of The Post advertising revenues in the quarter were digital. 
Turning to subscription video services. Total subscribers at Foxtel grew 6% year-over-year despite the difficult conditions in Australia. The latest number of paying Kayo payer subscribers as of November 5 reached 402,000 with total subscribers at 443,000, and this is less than a year after its launch. With the Rugby World Cup ending last week, Kayo is now preparing for the seasonal shift to cricket and other summer sports in Australia. And Kayo customers continue to be highly engaged with over 75% of subscribers using the product each and every week. Kayo is a premium streaming service and shows that a far larger number of Australians are prepared to pay for content they had previously been presumed. Given that we have already acquired the sports rights, it's another important opportunity to monetize those rights without undermining the core. 
[Audio Gap] 
operator of realtor.com had a robust quarter, and we have reason to be optimistic over its prospects, thanks to signs of improving health in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales are on the rise, and there has been rapid audience growth at realtor.com where there was an 18% year-over-year increase in traffic in the quarter. 
Based on the most recent Comscore data, realtor's.com traffic is clearly going significantly faster than that of our nearest competitor. 
In addition, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of Opcity, a business that is helping realtor.com become even more connected to consumers and to REALTORS who are provided with higher quality refined leads that we expect to monetize in adjacencies such as mortgages. We are not entering the house flipping distressed sale business, but we want to offer vendors as many potential purchases as possible. The more competition for our house, the higher the price for the seller. While we have been in a period of reinvestment of Move due to the Opcity acquisition, we are seeing the benefits of that commitment with improving financials, and that will accelerate in the second half. 
For News Corp, as the year unfolds, the simplification of our structure will continue, and we expect to see further benefits from the shift in a balance of power between creators of content and the digital distributors. Investors in News Corp should be the beneficiaries of that fundamental transformation. 
And now for further insight, we will turn to Susan."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted by last year's onetime benefit related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K., coupled with continued currency headwinds and challenging prior year comparisons at HarperCollins. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA decreased 30%. Net loss for the quarter was $211 million compared to net income of $128 million in the prior year, reflecting a $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.39 as compared to earnings per share of $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down approximately 8% versus the prior year. Currency had a $35 million or 3% negative impact. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 38% of the combined revenues. Approximately 34% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 33% in the prior year, which included the onetime Tabcorp payment. Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $15 million or 3% due to negative currency fluctuations. Performance was stable versus the prior quarter rate. Improvements at Dow Jones and News U.K., absent currency impacts, were offset by declines at News America Marketing and News Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 1% versus the prior year despite a $15 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Growth was again led by Dow Jones. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $56 million, down from $109 million, with the decline due primarily to the absence of the net benefit related to the exit of the partnerships with Sun Bets in the U.K. last year. We reclassified approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. The costs are mainly related to initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic asset and some shared technology services that directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the first quarter remained very healthy, growing 6%, benefiting from 17% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to approximately 1.9 million as well as subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 71% of the total subscriber base at The Wall Street Journal, up from 65% last year. We see a big opportunity to scale The Wall Street Journal, both directly and through valuable third-party relationships, as Robert mentioned. As a result, we expect to see incremental revenues from these partnerships this year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and financial news in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that digital-only, subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to almost 2.3 million subscribers. We remain optimistic about our Professional Information Business, which accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. The key growth engine continues to be in Risk and Compliance, which accelerated its revenue growth to 25% in the quarter compared to the prior quarter. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew a robust 8% this quarter. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter rose 2%, an improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter rate led by digital growth with a relatively stable print performance. Digital advertising accounted for 42% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 37% last year. 
We continue to balance healthy revenue growth at Dow Jones with reinvestment, which is leading to ongoing profit growth. Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues were flat on a reported basis and up 6% in local currency, representing the first year-over-year increase in local currencies since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The U.K. showed notable growth in digital, particularly at The Sun, which is growing in both audience and engagement. 
Advertising conditions in Australia were more challenged, notably in print, with advertising revenues down 13% on a reported basis and down 8% in local currency. Digital growth helped mitigate print declines with continued growth from music stand, small medium business initiatives and news.com.au.
On circulation, our digital paid subscribers again grew at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% at The Times and The Sunday Times and 22% at News Australia. The increase in digital subscribers, along with cover price increases at both News UK and News Australia, helped mitigate print volume declines and currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 10% driven by weakness in freestanding insert products given the ongoing digital migration, but partially offset by growth in in-store product revenue, which accounted for roughly half of the overall revenue. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $514 million, down 9% versus $565 million in the prior year, of which $34 million or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Kayo and Foxtel Now. Importantly, as we look at a core driver of the business, TV subscription revenue, which includes both broadcast and OTT revenue, excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth from OTT products almost offset broadcast declines in the quarter, which will be key to the stability of the business. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $81 million, down 28% with the prior year, which, in addition to the revenue trends, was also impacted by $16 million of costs related to domestic cricket rights, which we didn't have in the prior year and $14 million related to the noncash accelerated amortization of certain of our entertaining -- entertainment programming costs, as we highlighted last quarter. We continue to expect approximately $30 million to $35 million impact from the accelerated amortization for the full year with a greater impact in the first half of the year. 
Other costs notably in overheads were lower this quarter as the team is focused on rightsizing the cost base. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 20% lower than the prior year and for the cash flow generation to improve. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, with volume growing 6% versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo last November. Of that subscriber base, over 2.3 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers, and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now. Kayo paying subscribers grew to 364,000, up from 331,000 last quarter or 12% of the total Foxtel subscriber base, including trial list Kayo rose 430,000 subscribers. We are seeing that customer activations are more pronounced around big events. The first quarter had less exclusive content, particularly following the Cricket World Cup, but we have seen notably stronger ads with the start of the Rugby World Cup, which began in late September. As of November 5, Kayo paying subscribers have increased to approximately 402,000. 
We continue to see that Kayo subscribers are incremental to the subscriber base with very little cannibalization from the core broadcast business. Paying subscribers for Foxtel Now were approximately 375,000, down from 446,000 last quarter following the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, but still up from the prior year and have seen an improvement in ARPU from both the last quarter and the prior year. In addition, Foxtel is also planning a new entertainment product, which will leverage the Kayo platform with the commercial launch anticipated later in this fiscal year. 
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 14.4% versus 12.9% in the prior year, but down from 14.7% in Q4, reflecting continued focus on churn management in the Foxtel direct channel and higher penetration of the iQ4 set-top boxes. 
As a reminder, lower ARPU customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months compounded by a price rise is resulting in higher churn versus the prior year. Churn from platinum and sports teams remain materially lower than the base. 
Broadcast ARPU grew 2% to about AUD 78 per month. We expect to complete the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt in the coming weeks, which will include a package of bank refinancing, third-party financing and additional shareholder funding. As part of the refinancing, News Corp has contributed an additional AUD 200 million loan, and the new financing that will extend maturities for at least 3 years and, importantly, provide Foxtel with ample liquidity and flexibility to execute on its strategy. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins faced an unusually difficult comparison to the prior year due to the success of Rachel Hollis' Girl, Wash Your Face, Angie Thoma's The Hate U Give and Mark Manson's Subtle Art. As a result, revenues for the quarter fell 3% to $405 million and segment EBITDA fell to $49 million. 
Notable releases this quarter include Daniel Silva's New Girl, Ann Patchett's, The Dutch House, Karin Slaughter's The Last Widow, Demi Moore's Inside Out and Ant Middleton's The Fear Bubble. Digital revenues declined 5% and represented 20% -- 22% of consumer revenues also impacted by the year ago comparison. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 7% to $272 million, of which $10 million or 3% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. REA Group revenues were down 14% and down 8% in local currency as higher yield and improved product mix was more than offset by an overall 15% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter. Developer revenues were also down on the back of a 26% decline in new project development. Revenue decline was also impacted by the extended duration of premier all listings from 45 to 60 days, which increased the revenue deferral for the period. 
Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. Group revenues rose 4% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 11%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 80% of total revenues, was led by a higher contribution from Opcity, combined with an improvement in lead volume and audience. This is in the context of the U.S. housing market showing signs of improvement, with existing home sales up low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. The test also allows us to better control the consumer experience and the transaction. Although it is still relatively early in the testing, every single one of the core metrics has gone up materially. Leads, meeting rates, home values and close rates are all trending in the right direction. We are very encouraged by the results and have continued to allocate more leads to the Opcity model, which will allow greater opportunities to further extend into ancillary revenues. On audience, we saw an acceleration in audience growth versus the fourth quarter growth rate with average monthly unique users at realtor.com reaching over 71 million, rising 18% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in both page views and time spent. Segment EBITDA fell 22% to $82 million due to REA revenue declines and investment at Move due to Opcity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined just 2%. 
Other costs increased to $47 million from $37 million. The majority of the increase is related to higher equity comp due to the performance, existing schemes and the stock appreciation since the grant date as well as the phasing of certain strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we do not expect this increase to be reflective of the full year. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. In News and Information services, advertising trends thus far remains similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We continue to seek cost efficiencies, particularly in both the U.K. and Australia. Comparisons should ease now that we have moved past the Sun Bets benefit, and we expect to show improvements, particularly at our news brands. 
In Subscription Video Services, we will anniversary the acquisition of the domestic cricket rights, and cost trends should be more favorable. We will also lap the price increase from October last year. In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we're excited about the recent launch of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman The New Frontier, although we'll continue to face difficult comparisons as the prior year included Joanna Gaine's Homebody and strong backlist sales. Given the timing of the release schedule, we expect performance will be more second half weighted. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we anticipate improvements at Move as we lap the Opcity acquisition, particularly in the second half. As noted on their release, REA expects revenue growth to be skewed towards the second half of the fiscal year. Please see the release for more detail. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And there are a couple of other initiatives that are notable. When you click on a headline in the Facebook News tab, you'll be taken to our site. So the story is not hosted by Facebook. And that means that we're able to sell advertising directly, and we'll have a more lucrative flow of permission data. And these were all essential preconditions for our ascent and our agreement, and will have a long-term benefit on our accounts. 
The fact is that there'll be less prominence if there's not a premium for Providence. And it's frankly clear that the revenue show flow had shifted dramatically from the creators to the distributors. So for us, there are -- commercially, there are 2 things that are meaningful and absolutely essential. Firstly, development of a subscription sensibility. There has to be more of a propensity to pay. Thankfully, Facebook understood that priority. Secondly, the digital advertising market is dysfunctional. The so-called open market is a virtual monopoly.

So over the full year, absent those costs, we would expect the whole cost base to be relatively stable. But it is important to note that the team down in Australia are continuing to focus on rightsizing their cost base and are continuing to look for opportunities as they move forward. 
In relation to [ Aeries ], we are looking to launch that towards the back half of this particular fiscal year. We're not expecting to see significant incremental costs to your point. We do have a lot of the content covered within existing deals. We will, of course, have marketing costs as we scale up that product, but the actual incremental cost that we'd expect to see within the year is going to be minimal."

As for Move, both short, medium and long term, we believe that realtor.com is a tremendous property. You could see that the growth in audience is far superior to that at Zillow at the moment. If you take the independent comScore figures from September, the unique users at realtor.com were up 17%, while Zillow grew at only 2%. And Trulia actually shrank by 2%. And the divergence was even more marked on desktop with 10% of growth at realtor and Zillow, down by 12% year-on-year.

If you think back even 12 months ago, the prospects of Facebook paying for content, a carriage fee, as we called it, in fact, Rupert was the first to cite that as a need, the prospects seem remote. It's now real. And what we're finding generally in our discussion with the digital platforms is that, that they have indeed adopted a new approach. They realize that for various reasons that their past policies were unsustainable. But as I made clear to you, it's not just about paying a premium for premium journalism. It is also about sorting out what is an opaque advertising market, and there's no doubt that the regulatory pressure in that area is only going to increase. And a consequence of that, it will, I suspect, be that, as we're already seeing, more advertisers understand how dysfunctional that market is and seek association with high-quality content, and we will undoubtedly be a beneficiary of that given the excellent journalism that we have, not only in this country but around the world."

In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy,",1456,"Thanks, Mike. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy, in particular, a struggling Australian property market, as well as difficult comparisons with the prior year onetime revenue item, a noncash impairment charge in this quarter. 
For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.34 billion with total segment EBITDA of $221 million. This represents a decline of 7% in revenues and 38% in profitability versus the prior year. Of the revenue decline, 3% was directly attributable to currency and 2% to our onetime cash payment last year by [indiscernible] in the U.K. 
Before getting into the final details of the quarter by segment, I want to address a significant development that bodes well for our future prospects. There has been a fundamental change in the content landscape. For over a decade, News Corp has led the international debate in seeking fair returns for our high-quality content from the digital platforms. Clearly, the dominant digital platforms are under intense and continuing regulatory scrutiny on issues such as privacy and an opaque advertising market. There has, however, been a substantial development with Facebook's decision to pay a significant premium for our premium journalism at the WSJ and beyond. This decision begins to change the content equation, and we expect a positive impact on financials at our News and Information Services segment over the long term, beginning this fiscal year. 
The Facebook deal complements the agreement we reached with Apple in March when The Wall Street Journal became a launch partner for Apple News Plus, which expanded the reach of The Journal and its journalism to new audiences. Our brands and our content obviously benefit from the marketing region prowess of a partner, which has nearly 189 million phones in the U.S. and 1.4 billion devices globally. 
We expect the sectoral shift in the value of digital content to have significant implications for our investors and our bottom line. And let us be clear, these unprecedented changes in the publishing industry would not have been achieved without the determination of Rupert and [ Lock ] and Murdoch and the unwavering support of the new score board, which has taken a long-term principal stand on the need to change the digital ecosystem. Other publishers around the world should feel free to send us a commission for services rendered. 
Another development worth highlighting is the ongoing simplification of News Corp. As you are aware, we have put our News America Marketing business under strategic review and are in discussions regarding a possible sale of that business. We expect to update you in due course. 
Consistent with that theme of simplification, we have our Unruly ad tech business under strategic view and are also in discussions about a potential sale. We have learned much from the very talented team at Unruly, and those lessons will inform our ad business for many, many years to come. 
With simplification being an ongoing process, the company will continue to review its structure with the aim of bringing extra focus to our key assets, allowing investors to have a far clear review of their prospects. 
Let me turn to the News and Information Services segment in which Dow Jones had a strong quarter with increased revenues and greater profitability year-over-year. Wall Street Journal subscriptions grew 8%, and we have crossed the 70% threshold for the number of digital-only subscribers. 
Important to note, we currently do not include readers of Apple News Plus in that number. So it certainly does not fully capture the number of readers who are now paying for access to The Journal. 
Advertising revenue at Dow Jones grew 2% in the quarter and led notably by strong digital outperformance at wsj.com, which grew 13% as compared to a decline of the New York Times. We also saw stronger circulation revenue growth and increasing profitability as compared to the New York Times. 
Dow Jones Professional Information Business continued to drive, with the burgeoning risk and compliance sector, in particular, growing 25% year-over-year. With many companies under intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the imperative to minimize risk and to maximize compliance remains a burgeoning source of business. 
Overall, our Professional Information Business represents a pronounced distinguishing advantage over media competitors and provides multiple opportunities for us to upsell specialist content to companies, professional investors and individual investors who actively manage their portfolio. 
Barron's group continued to report strong traffic growth in Q1, with total unique users up 27% year-over-year driven by Market Watch and Barron's online. Barron's subscribers grew 7% to 587,000, while Market Watch Q1 revenue was its strongest quarterly revenue performance ever. 
In the U.K., digital subscribers at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 312,000. Advertising in local currency was up for the first time since Q3 of financial year '18 as digital growth more than offset modest print declines. Digital advertising growth of the Sun accelerated from the prior quarter rate and benefited from a growing audience and higher yield with approximately 129 global monthly unique users in September 2019. 
Meanwhile, at wireless, the October [indiscernible] results show that the reach of wireless stations grew 21% year-over-year with a 26% increase in listening hours. And propelled by Chris Evans joining the network, Virgin Radio experienced a 300% increase in reach and a 500% jump in listening hours. 
Meanwhile, talkSPORT had a 20% increase in digital listening, thanks in part to the new premier league rights, which drive Saturday listening up 120% year-over-year. 
In Australia, there were harsh economic conditions that affected all of our businesses, including HarperCollins. In media, we continue to execute on our digital strategy with the mastheads reaching more than 542,000 digital subscribers, representing 23% year-over-year growth. At the Australian, 65% of subscribers were digital, showing that a subscription sensibility is indeed evolving and more people expect to pay more for digital products. 
Circulation revenue was also lifted by cover price increases at our metropolitan mastheads. We took the bold step of sharply increasing the cover price of the New York Post in June, and there has been a 12% year-over-year increase in circulation revenue. Advertising also rose at a similar rate. 
It is worth noting that more than 70% of The Post advertising revenues in the quarter were digital. 
Turning to subscription video services. Total subscribers at Foxtel grew 6% year-over-year despite the difficult conditions in Australia. The latest number of paying payer subscribers as of November 5 reached 402,000 with total subscribers at 443,000, and this is less than a year after its launch. 
With the Rugby World Cup ending last week, Kayo is now preparing for the seasonal shift to cricket and other summer sports in Australia. And Kayo customers continue to be highly engaged with over 75% of subscribers using the product each and every week.  Kayo is a premium streaming service and shows that a far larger number of Australians are prepared to pay for content they had previously been presumed. Given that we have already acquired the sports rights, it's another important opportunity to monetize those rights without undermining the core. 
[Audio Gap] 
operator of realtor.com had a robust quarter, and we have reason to be optimistic over its prospects, thanks to signs of improving health in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales are on the rise, and there has been rapid audience growth at realtor.com where there was an 18% year-over-year increase in traffic in the quarter. 
Based on the most recent comScore data, real.com traffic is clearly going significantly faster than that of our nearest competitor. 
In addition, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of Opcity, a business that is helping realtor.com become even more connected to consumers and to realtors who are provided with higher quality refined leads that we expect to monetize in adjacencies such as mortgages. We are not entering the house flipping distressed sale business, but we want to offer vendors as many potential purchases as possible. The more competition for our house, the higher the price for the seller. 
While we have been in a period of reinvestment of Move due to the Opcity acquisition, we are seeing the benefits of that commitment with improving financials, and that will accelerate in the second half. 
For News Corp, as the year unfolds, the simplification of our structure will continue, and we expect to see further benefits from the shift in the balance of power between creators of content and the digital distributors. Investors in News Corp should be the beneficiaries of that fundamental transformation. 
And now for further insight, we will turn to Sue."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year.

Net loss for the quarter was $211 million compared to net income of $128 million in the prior year, reflecting a $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. 
For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.39 as compared to earnings per share of $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down approximately 8% versus the prior year. Currency had a $35 million or 3% negative impact. 
Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper [ markets ] represented 38% of the combined revenues. Approximately 34% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 33% in the prior year, which included the onetime [indiscernible] payment. 
Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $15 million or 3% due to negative currency fluctuations. Performance was stable versus the prior quarter rate. 
Improvements at Dow Jones and News U.K., absent currency impacts, were offset by declines at News America Marketing and News Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 1% versus the prior year despite a $15 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Growth was again led by Dow Jones. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was [ $56 ] million, down from $109 million, with the decline due primarily to the absence of the net [ benefit ] related to the exit of the partnerships with Sun Bets in the U.K. last year. 
We reclassified approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter of fiscal  2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. The costs are mainly related initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic asset and some shared technology services to directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the first quarter remained very healthy, growing 6%, benefiting from 17% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to approximately 1.9 million as well as subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 71% of the total subscriber base at The Wall Street Journal, up from 65% last year. 
We see the opportunity to scale The Wall Street Journal, both directly and through valuable third-party relationships, as Robert mentioned. As a result, we expect to see incremental revenues from these partnerships this year. 
Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and financial news in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that digital-only, subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to almost 2.3 million subscribers. 
We remain optimistic about our Professional Information Business, which accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. The key growth engine continues to be in risk and compliance, which accelerated its revenue growth to 25% in the quarter compared to the prior quarter. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew a robust 8% this quarter. 
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter rose 2%, an improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter. It's led by digital growth with a relatively stable print performance. Digital advertising accounted for 42% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 37% last year. 
We continue to balance healthy revenue growth at Dow Jones with reinvestment, which is leading to ongoing profit growth. 
Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues were flat on a reported basis and up 6% in local currency, representing the first year-over-year increase in local currencies since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The U.K. showed notable growth in digital, particularly at The Sun, which is growing in both audience and engagement. 
Advertising conditions in Australia were more challenged, notably in print, with advertising revenues down 13% on a reported basis and down 8% in local currency. Digital growth helped mitigate print declines with continued growth from music stand, small medium business initiatives and news.com.au.
On circulation, our digital paid subscribers again grew in an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% at The Times and The Sunday Times and 22% at News Australia. The increase in digital subscribers, along with cover price increases at both News UK and News Australia, helped mitigate print volume declines and currency headwinds. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 10% driven by weakness in freestanding insert products given the ongoing digital migration, but partially offset by growth in in-store product revenue, which accounted for roughly half of the overall revenue. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $514 million, down 9% versus [ $565 ] million in the prior year, of which $34 million or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Kayo and Foxtel Now. 
Importantly, as we look at a core driver of the business, TV subscription revenue, which includes both broadcast and OTT revenue, excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth from OTT products almost offset broadcast declines in the quarter, which will be key to the stability of the business. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $81 million, down 28% with the prior year, which, in addition to the revenue trends, was also impacted by [ $16 ] million of costs related to domestic cricket rights, which we didn't have in the prior year and $14 million related to the noncash accelerated amortization of certain of our entertaining -- entertainment programming costs, as we highlighted last quarter. We continue to expect approximately $30 million to $35 million impact from the accelerated amortization for the full year with a greater impact in the first half of the year. 
Other costs notably in overheads were lower this quarter as the team is focused on rightsizing the cost base. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 20% lower than the prior year and for the cash flow generation to improve. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, with volume growing 6% versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo last November. Of that subscriber base, over 2.3 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers, and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now. Kayo paying subscribers grew to [ 364,000 ], up from 331,000 last quarter or 12% of the total Foxtel subscriber base, including trial list rose 430,000 subscribers. We are seeing that customer activations are more pronounced around big events. The first quarter had less exclusive content, particularly following the Cricket World Cup, but we have seen notably stronger ads with the start of the Rugby World Cup, which began in late September. As of November 5, Kayo paying subscribers have increased to approximately 402,000. 
We continue to see that Kayo subscribers are incremental to the subscriber base with very little cannibalization from the core broadcast business. 
Paying subscribers for Foxtel Now were approximately 375,000, down from 446,000 last quarter following the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, but still up from the prior year and have seen an improvement in ARPU from both the last quarter and the prior year. In addition, Foxtel is also planning a new entertainment product, which will leverage the Kayo performance with the commercial launch anticipated later in this fiscal year. 
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 14.4% versus 12.9% in the prior year, but down from 14.7% in Q4, reflecting continued focus on churn management in the Foxtel direct channel and higher penetration of the iQ4 set-top boxes. 
As a reminder, lower ARPU customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months compounded by a price rise is resulting in higher churn versus the prior year. Churn from platinum and sports [indiscernible] remain materially lower than the base. 
Broadcast ARPU grew 2% to about AUD 78 per month. We expect to complete the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt in the coming weeks, which will include a package of bank refinancing, third-party financing and additional shareholder funding. As part of the refinancing, News Corp has contributed an additional AUD 200 million loan, and the new financing will extend maturities for at least 3 years and, importantly, provide Foxtel with ample liquidity and flexibility to execute on its strategy. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins faced an unusually difficult comparison to the prior year due to the success of [indiscernible] Go Wash Your Face, [ Angie Thomas ] The Hate You Give and Mark [indiscernible]. As a result, revenues for the quarter fell 3% to $405 million and segment EBITDA fell to $49 million. 
Notable releases this quarter include [ Daniel Silvers New Gill ] and Patches, the Dutch House [indiscernible] The Last Window, Demi Moore's Inside Out and Ant Middleton's The Fear Bubble. Digital revenues declined 5% and represented 20% -- 22% of consumer revenues also impacted by the year ago comparison. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 7% to $272 million, of which $10 million or 3% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. 
REA Group revenues were down 14% and down 8% in local currency as higher yield and improved product mix was more than offset by an overall 15% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter. Developer revenues were also down on the back of a 26% decline in new project development. Revenue decline was also impacted by the extended duration of premier all listings from 45 to 60 days, which increased the revenue deferral for the period. 
Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. 
Group revenues rose 4% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 11%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 80% of total revenues, was led by higher contribution from Opcity, combined with an improvement in lead volume and audience. This is in the context of the U.S. heavy market showing signs of improvement, with existing home sales up low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. The test also allows us to better control the consumer experience and the transaction. 
Although it is still relatively early in the testing, every single one of the core metrics has gone up materially. Leads, meeting rates, home values and close rates are all trending in the right direction. We are very encouraged by the results and have continued to allocate more leads to the Opcity model, which will allow greater opportunities to further extend into ancillary revenues. 
On audience, we saw an acceleration in audience growth versus the fourth quarter growth rate with average monthly unique users at realtor.com reaching over 71 million, rising 18% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in both page views and time spent. Segment EBITDA fell 22% to $82 million due to REA revenue declines and investment at Move due to Opcity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined just 2%. 
Other costs increased to $47 million from $37 million. The majority of the increase is related to higher equity comp due to the performance, existing schemes and the stock appreciation since the grant date as well as the phasing of certain strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we do not expect this increase to be reflective of the full year. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. In News and Information services, advertising trends thus far remains similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We continue to seek cost efficiencies, particularly in both the U.K. and Australia. Comparisons should ease now that we have moved past the Sun Bets benefit, and we expect to show improvements, particularly at our news brands. 
In Subscription Video Services, we will anniversary the acquisition of the domestic cricket rights, and cost trends should be more favorable. We will also lap the price increase from October last year. 
In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we're excited about the recent launch of [indiscernible] Pioneer Woman, The New Frontier, although we'll continue to face difficult comparisons as the prior year included [ Joanna Gaine's ] Homebody and strong backlist sales. Given the timing of the release schedule, we expect performance will be more second half weighted. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we anticipate improvements at Move as we lap the Opcity acquisition, particularly in the second half. As noted on their release, REA expects revenue growth to be skewed towards the second half of the fiscal year. Please see the release for more detail. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And there are a couple of other initiatives that are notable. When you click on a headline in the Facebook News tab, you'll be taken to our side. So the story is not hosted by Facebook. And that means that we're able to sell advertising directly, and we'll have a more lucrative flow of permission data. And these were all essential preconditions for our ascent and our agreement, and will have a long-term benefit on our accounts. 
The fact is that there'll be less providence if there's not a premium for [ Providence ]. And it's frankly clear that the revenue show flow had shifted dramatically from the creators to the distributors. So for us, there are -- commercially, there are 2 things that are meaningful and absolutely essential. Firstly, development of a subscription sensibility. There has to be more of a propensity to pay. Thankfully, Facebook understood that priority. Secondly, the digital advertising market is dysfunctional. The so-called open market is a virtual monopoly.

But it is important to note that the team down in Australia are continuing to focus on rightsizing the cost base and are continuing to look for opportunities as they move forward.

They realize that for various reasons that their past policies were unsustainable. But as I made clear to you, it's not just about paying a premium for premium journalism. It is also about sorting out what is an opaque advertising market, and there's no doubt that the regulatory pressure in that area is only going to increase. And a consequence of that, well, I suspect, be that as we're already seeing, more advertisers understand how dysfunctional that market is and seek association with high-quality content, and we will undoubtedly be a beneficiary of that given the excellent journalism that we have, not only in this country, but around the world."

212741644,641463433,2097508,"News Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy,",1829,"Thanks, Mike. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy, in particular, a struggling Australian property market, as well as difficult comparisons with the prior year onetime revenue item, a noncash impairment charge in this quarter. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.34 billion with total segment EBITDA of $221 million. This represents a decline of 7% in revenues and 38% in profitability versus the prior year. Of the revenue decline, 3% was directly attributable to currency and 2% to our onetime cash payment last year by Tabcorp in the U.K. 
Before getting into the final details of the quarter by segment, I want to address a significant development that bodes well for our future prospects. There has been a fundamental change in the content landscape. For over a decade, News Corp has led the international debate in seeking fair returns for our high-quality content from the digital platforms. Clearly, the dominant digital platforms are under intense and continuing regulatory scrutiny on issues such as privacy and an opaque advertising market. There has, however, been a substantial development with Facebook's decision to pay a significant premium for our premium journalism at the WSJ and beyond. This decision begins to change the content equation, and we expect a positive impact on financials at our News and Information Services segment over the long term, beginning this fiscal year. The Facebook deal complements the agreement we reached with Apple in March when The Wall Street Journal became a launch partner for Apple News+, which expanded the reach of The Journal and its journalism to new audiences. Our brands and our content obviously benefit from the marketing region prowess of a partner, which has nearly 189 million phones in the U.S. and 1.4 billion devices globally. 
We expect the sectoral shift in the value of digital content to have significant implications for our investors and our bottom line. And let us be clear, these unprecedented changes in the publishing industry would not have been achieved without the determination of Rupert and Lock and Murdoch and the unwavering support of the new score board, which has taken a long-term principal stand on the need to change the digital ecosystem. Other publishers around the world should feel free to send us a commission for services rendered. 
Another development worth highlighting is the ongoing simplification of News Corp. As you are aware, we have put our News America Marketing business under strategic review and are in discussions regarding a possible sale of that business. We expect to update you in due course. 
Consistent with that theme of simplification, we have our Unruly ad tech business under strategic view and are also in discussions about a potential sale. We have learned much from the very talented team at Unruly, and those lessons will inform our ad business for many, many years to come. With simplification being an ongoing process, the company will continue to review its structure with the aim of bringing extra focus to our key assets, allowing investors to have a far clearer review of their prospects. 
Let me turn to the News and Information Services segment in which Dow Jones had a strong quarter with increased revenues and greater profitability year-over-year. Wall Street Journal subscriptions grew 8%, and we have crossed the 70% threshold for the number of digital-only subscribers. Important to note, we currently do not include readers of Apple News+ in that number. So it certainly does not fully capture the number of readers who are now paying for access to The Journal. 
Advertising revenue at Dow Jones grew 2% in the quarter and led notably by strong digital outperformance at wsj.com, which grew 13% as compared to a decline of the New York Times. We also saw stronger circulation revenue growth and increasing profitability as compared to the New York Times. Dow Jones Professional Information Business continue to thrive, with the burgeoning risk and compliance sector, in particular, growing 25% year-over-year. With many companies under intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the imperative to minimize risk and to maximize compliance remains a burgeoning source of business. Overall, our Professional Information Business represents a pronounced distinguishing advantage over media competitors and provides multiple opportunities for us to upsell specialist content to companies, professional investors and individual investors who actively manage their portfolio. 
Barron's group continued to report strong traffic growth in Q1, with total unique users up 27% year-over-year driven by MarketWatch and Barron's online. Barron's subscribers grew 7% to 587,000, while MarketWatch Q1 revenue was its strongest quarterly revenue performance ever. 
In the U.K., digital subscribers at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 312,000. Advertising in local currency was up for the first time since Q3 of financial year '18 as digital growth more than offset modest print declines. Digital advertising growth of The Sun accelerated from the prior quarter rate and benefited from a growing audience and higher yield with approximately 129 global monthly unique users in September 2019. Meanwhile, at Wireless, the October [ radar ] results show that the reach of Wireless's stations grew 21% year-over-year with a 26% increase in listening hours. And propelled by Chris Evans joining the network, Virgin Radio experienced a 300% increase in reach and a 500% jump in listening hours. 
Meanwhile, talkSPORT had a 20% increase in digital listening, thanks in part to the new Premier League rights, which drive Saturday listening up 120% year-over-year. In Australia, there were harsh economic conditions that affected all of our businesses, including HarperCollins. In media, we continue to execute on our digital strategy with the mastheads reaching more than 542,000 digital subscribers, representing 23% year-over-year growth. At the Australian, 65% of subscribers were digital, showing that a subscription sensibility is indeed evolving and more people expect to pay more for digital products. Circulation revenue was also lifted by cover price increases at our metropolitan mastheads. We took the bold step of sharply increasing the cover price of the New York Post in June, and there has been a 12% year-over-year increase in circulation revenue. Advertising also rose at a similar rate. It is worth noting that more than 70% of The Post advertising revenues in the quarter were digital. 
Turning to subscription video services. Total subscribers at Foxtel grew 6% year-over-year despite the difficult conditions in Australia. The latest number of paying Kayo payer subscribers as of November 5 reached 402,000 with total subscribers at 443,000, and this is less than a year after its launch. With the Rugby World Cup ending last week, Kayo is now preparing for the seasonal shift to cricket and other summer sports in Australia. And Kayo customers continue to be highly engaged with over 75% of subscribers using the product each and every week. Kayo is a premium streaming service and shows that a far larger number of Australians are prepared to pay for content they had previously been presumed. Given that we have already acquired the sports rights, it's another important opportunity to monetize those rights without undermining the core broadcast offering. 
During this quarter, Foxtel has continued to make significant enhancements to its product offering. The company began rolling out a new user interface to more than 1.1 million iQ3 and iQ4 set-top boxes. Since the end of September, Foxtel has also begun a major channel refresh for movies and entertainment with a focus on new Fox branded channels. In addition, Foxtel and NBCUniversal announced yesterday a long-term deal that will provide a variety of programming for Foxtel's broadcast on demand and streaming platforms, including Universal Studios movies, along with popular television series and other content. With the simplification of the Foxtel product offering having been completed, a new customer loyalty program called Foxtel First has been launched. We are all hopeful that these initiatives will help strengthen the product and reduce churn, which in the core Foxtel retail channel accounted for majority of broadcast subscribers, excluding wholesale partnerships, actually improved from 13.6% and to 12.2%. 
In book publishing, results were influenced by an invidious comparison to the prior year when we saw 42% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, thanks to the remarkable success of the Rachel Hollis and Mark Manson books. There are a number of important works in the HarperCollins pipeline, including a cookbook from Ree Drummond, author of the Pioneer Woman series in the current quarter as well as the Andromeda evolution by Michael Krein released next Tuesday. Other books in the second half of the fiscal year include a cookbook from Joanna Gaines of Magnolia Series fame; and in the U.K., a work by the best-selling children's order, David Williams. We also expect to see benefits from the release of the film version of A.J. Finn, Women in the Window, and HarperCollins also announced that it will be publishing back the compelling memoir by Tiger Woods. 
Turning now to digital real estate services. REA results were challenged due to soft listing volumes in Australia, though average option clearance rates have returned to the levels seen before the market correction, over 80% in Melbourne and Sydney. And there has been some improvement in the month-on-month listing environment. With evidence of a gradual market recovery, we do expect enhancements in revenue in the second half of this fiscal year. 
Moving, operator of realtor.com had a robust quarter, and we have reason to be optimistic over its prospects, thanks to signs of improving health in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales are on the rise, and there has been rapid audience growth at realtor.com where there was an 18% year-over-year increase in traffic in the quarter. 
Based on the most recent Comscore data, realtor's.com traffic is clearly going significantly faster than that of our nearest competitor. 
In addition, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of Opcity, a business that is helping realtor.com become even more connected to consumers and to REALTORS who are provided with higher quality refined leads that we expect to monetize in adjacencies such as mortgages. We are not entering the house flipping distressed sale business, but we want to offer vendors as many potential purchases as possible. The more competition for our house, the higher the price for the seller. While we have been in a period of reinvestment of Move due to the Opcity acquisition, we are seeing the benefits of that commitment with improving financials, and that will accelerate in the second half. 
For News Corp, as the year unfolds, the simplification of our structure will continue, and we expect to see further benefits from the shift in a balance of power between creators of content and the digital distributors. Investors in News Corp should be the beneficiaries of that fundamental transformation. 
And now for further insight, we will turn to Susan."
212741644,641463433,2097508,"News Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted b",2328,"Thank you, Robert. 
Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted by last year's onetime benefit related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K., coupled with continued currency headwinds and challenging prior year comparisons at HarperCollins. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA decreased 30%. Net loss for the quarter was $211 million compared to net income of $128 million in the prior year, reflecting a $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.39 as compared to earnings per share of $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down approximately 8% versus the prior year. Currency had a $35 million or 3% negative impact. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 38% of the combined revenues. Approximately 34% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 33% in the prior year, which included the onetime Tabcorp payment. Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $15 million or 3% due to negative currency fluctuations. Performance was stable versus the prior quarter rate. Improvements at Dow Jones and News U.K., absent currency impacts, were offset by declines at News America Marketing and News Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 1% versus the prior year despite a $15 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Growth was again led by Dow Jones. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $56 million, down from $109 million, with the decline due primarily to the absence of the net benefit related to the exit of the partnerships with Sun Bets in the U.K. last year. We reclassified approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. The costs are mainly related to initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic asset and some shared technology services that directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the first quarter remained very healthy, growing 6%, benefiting from 17% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to approximately 1.9 million as well as subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 71% of the total subscriber base at The Wall Street Journal, up from 65% last year. We see a big opportunity to scale The Wall Street Journal, both directly and through valuable third-party relationships, as Robert mentioned. As a result, we expect to see incremental revenues from these partnerships this year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and financial news in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that digital-only, subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to almost 2.3 million subscribers. We remain optimistic about our Professional Information Business, which accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. The key growth engine continues to be in Risk and Compliance, which accelerated its revenue growth to 25% in the quarter compared to the prior quarter. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew a robust 8% this quarter. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter rose 2%, an improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter rate led by digital growth with a relatively stable print performance. Digital advertising accounted for 42% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 37% last year. 
We continue to balance healthy revenue growth at Dow Jones with reinvestment, which is leading to ongoing profit growth. Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues were flat on a reported basis and up 6% in local currency, representing the first year-over-year increase in local currencies since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The U.K. showed notable growth in digital, particularly at The Sun, which is growing in both audience and engagement. 
Advertising conditions in Australia were more challenged, notably in print, with advertising revenues down 13% on a reported basis and down 8% in local currency. Digital growth helped mitigate print declines with continued growth from music stand, small medium business initiatives and news.com.au.
On circulation, our digital paid subscribers again grew at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% at The Times and The Sunday Times and 22% at News Australia. The increase in digital subscribers, along with cover price increases at both News UK and News Australia, helped mitigate print volume declines and currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 10% driven by weakness in freestanding insert products given the ongoing digital migration, but partially offset by growth in in-store product revenue, which accounted for roughly half of the overall revenue. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $514 million, down 9% versus $565 million in the prior year, of which $34 million or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Kayo and Foxtel Now. Importantly, as we look at a core driver of the business, TV subscription revenue, which includes both broadcast and OTT revenue, excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth from OTT products almost offset broadcast declines in the quarter, which will be key to the stability of the business. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $81 million, down 28% with the prior year, which, in addition to the revenue trends, was also impacted by $16 million of costs related to domestic cricket rights, which we didn't have in the prior year and $14 million related to the noncash accelerated amortization of certain of our entertaining -- entertainment programming costs, as we highlighted last quarter. We continue to expect approximately $30 million to $35 million impact from the accelerated amortization for the full year with a greater impact in the first half of the year. 
Other costs notably in overheads were lower this quarter as the team is focused on rightsizing the cost base. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 20% lower than the prior year and for the cash flow generation to improve. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, with volume growing 6% versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo last November. Of that subscriber base, over 2.3 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers, and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now. Kayo paying subscribers grew to 364,000, up from 331,000 last quarter or 12% of the total Foxtel subscriber base, including trial list Kayo rose 430,000 subscribers. We are seeing that customer activations are more pronounced around big events. The first quarter had less exclusive content, particularly following the Cricket World Cup, but we have seen notably stronger ads with the start of the Rugby World Cup, which began in late September. As of November 5, Kayo paying subscribers have increased to approximately 402,000. 
We continue to see that Kayo subscribers are incremental to the subscriber base with very little cannibalization from the core broadcast business. Paying subscribers for Foxtel Now were approximately 375,000, down from 446,000 last quarter following the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, but still up from the prior year and have seen an improvement in ARPU from both the last quarter and the prior year. In addition, Foxtel is also planning a new entertainment product, which will leverage the Kayo platform with the commercial launch anticipated later in this fiscal year. 
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 14.4% versus 12.9% in the prior year, but down from 14.7% in Q4, reflecting continued focus on churn management in the Foxtel direct channel and higher penetration of the iQ4 set-top boxes. 
As a reminder, lower ARPU customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months compounded by a price rise is resulting in higher churn versus the prior year. Churn from platinum and sports teams remain materially lower than the base. 
Broadcast ARPU grew 2% to about AUD 78 per month. We expect to complete the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt in the coming weeks, which will include a package of bank refinancing, third-party financing and additional shareholder funding. As part of the refinancing, News Corp has contributed an additional AUD 200 million loan, and the new financing that will extend maturities for at least 3 years and, importantly, provide Foxtel with ample liquidity and flexibility to execute on its strategy. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins faced an unusually difficult comparison to the prior year due to the success of Rachel Hollis' Girl, Wash Your Face, Angie Thoma's The Hate U Give and Mark Manson's Subtle Art. As a result, revenues for the quarter fell 3% to $405 million and segment EBITDA fell to $49 million. 
Notable releases this quarter include Daniel Silva's New Girl, Ann Patchett's, The Dutch House, Karin Slaughter's The Last Widow, Demi Moore's Inside Out and Ant Middleton's The Fear Bubble. Digital revenues declined 5% and represented 20% -- 22% of consumer revenues also impacted by the year ago comparison. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 7% to $272 million, of which $10 million or 3% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. REA Group revenues were down 14% and down 8% in local currency as higher yield and improved product mix was more than offset by an overall 15% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter. Developer revenues were also down on the back of a 26% decline in new project development. Revenue decline was also impacted by the extended duration of premier all listings from 45 to 60 days, which increased the revenue deferral for the period. 
Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. Group revenues rose 4% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 11%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 80% of total revenues, was led by a higher contribution from Opcity, combined with an improvement in lead volume and audience. This is in the context of the U.S. housing market showing signs of improvement, with existing home sales up low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. The test also allows us to better control the consumer experience and the transaction. Although it is still relatively early in the testing, every single one of the core metrics has gone up materially. Leads, meeting rates, home values and close rates are all trending in the right direction. We are very encouraged by the results and have continued to allocate more leads to the Opcity model, which will allow greater opportunities to further extend into ancillary revenues. On audience, we saw an acceleration in audience growth versus the fourth quarter growth rate with average monthly unique users at realtor.com reaching over 71 million, rising 18% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in both page views and time spent. Segment EBITDA fell 22% to $82 million due to REA revenue declines and investment at Move due to Opcity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined just 2%. 
Other costs increased to $47 million from $37 million. The majority of the increase is related to higher equity comp due to the performance, existing schemes and the stock appreciation since the grant date as well as the phasing of certain strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we do not expect this increase to be reflective of the full year. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. In News and Information services, advertising trends thus far remains similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We continue to seek cost efficiencies, particularly in both the U.K. and Australia. Comparisons should ease now that we have moved past the Sun Bets benefit, and we expect to show improvements, particularly at our news brands. 
In Subscription Video Services, we will anniversary the acquisition of the domestic cricket rights, and cost trends should be more favorable. We will also lap the price increase from October last year. In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we're excited about the recent launch of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman The New Frontier, although we'll continue to face difficult comparisons as the prior year included Joanna Gaine's Homebody and strong backlist sales. Given the timing of the release schedule, we expect performance will be more second half weighted. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we anticipate improvements at Move as we lap the Opcity acquisition, particularly in the second half. As noted on their release, REA expects revenue growth to be skewed towards the second half of the fiscal year. Please see the release for more detail. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And there are a couple of other initiatives that are notable. When you click on a headline in the Facebook News tab, you'll be taken to our site. So the story is not hosted by Facebook. And that means that we're able to sell advertising directly, and we'll have a more lucrative flow of permission data. And these were all essential preconditions for our ascent and our agreement, and will have a long-term benefit on our accounts. 
The fact is that there'll be less prominence if there's not a premium for Providence. And it's frankly clear that the revenue show flow had shifted dramatically from the creators to the distributors. So for us, there are -- commercially, there are 2 things that are meaningful and absolutely essential. Firstly, development of a subscription sensibility. There has to be more of a propensity to pay. Thankfully, Facebook understood that priority. Secondly, the digital advertising market is dysfunctional. The so-called open market is a virtual monopoly.

So just in relation to cricket, we would expect to see very, very modest increases over the course of the year. So the bulk of those costs have come through in Q1. But I think it's important to note when we think about the cost base, the largest increase that's come through is because of the noncash amortization in relation to those entertainment expenses. So over the full year, absent those costs, we would expect the whole cost base to be relatively stable. But it is important to note that the team down in Australia are continuing to focus on rightsizing their cost base and are continuing to look for opportunities as they move forward. 
In relation to [ Aeries ], we are looking to launch that towards the back half of this particular fiscal year. We're not expecting to see significant incremental costs to your point. We do have a lot of the content covered within existing deals. We will, of course, have marketing costs as we scale up that product, but the actual incremental cost that we'd expect to see within the year is going to be minimal."

And it will obviously be based on the Kayo distribution platform. So much of the engineering there has already been done. And I think when you speak of streaming, this salient point to note about Foxtel is the rapid growth of Kayo from nothing a year ago to 402,000 paying customers now and another 443,000 in total. And this is not a service that cost $6.99 a month. It's $25 a month. And given the view of feedback and satisfaction, there's obviously some longer-term elasticity in that price. And when you see the sluggishness in the Australian economy in advertising and real estate, which has obviously had an impact on our earnings, the results are even more impressive."

What it does mean at the moment is News America Marketing and Unruly, which are under strategic review. But as I said, that strategic review does not stop with those 2 properties, and we are very conscious of the need to highlight the value of the company and provide more transparency for investors. As for Move, both short, medium and long term, we believe that realtor.com is a tremendous property. You could see that the growth in audience is far superior to that at Zillow at the moment. If you take the independent comScore figures from September, the unique users at realtor.com were up 17%, while Zillow grew at only 2%. And Trulia actually shrank by 2%. And the divergence was even more marked on desktop with 10% of growth at realtor and Zillow, down by 12% year-on-year. 
We're at a very early stage of the evolution of the digital real estate market in the United States. And we think as it evolves, those margins will surely increase."

If you think back even 12 months ago, the prospects of Facebook paying for content, a carriage fee, as we called it, in fact, Rupert was the first to cite that as a need, the prospects seem remote. It's now real. And what we're finding generally in our discussion with the digital platforms is that, that they have indeed adopted a new approach. They realize that for various reasons that their past policies were unsustainable. But as I made clear to you, it's not just about paying a premium for premium journalism. It is also about sorting out what is an opaque advertising market, and there's no doubt that the regulatory pressure in that area is only going to increase. And a consequence of that, it will, I suspect, be that, as we're already seeing, more advertisers understand how dysfunctional that market is and seek association with high-quality content, and we will undoubtedly be a beneficiary of that given the excellent journalism that we have, not only in this country but around the world."
