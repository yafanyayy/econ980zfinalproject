Today, we reported fourth quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $142 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results include a lower cost per market inventory valuation adjustment that decreased pretax earnings by $329 million. Including this item, net income for the quarter was $394 million or $2.25 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $125 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the same period in 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $641 million, an increase of $307 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase in earnings is primarily due to our ability to capture the favorable crude discounts across our refining system.
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported an EBITDA loss of $4 million, driven by negative Rack Back EBITDA in the quarter. Rack Back EBITDA was negatively impacted by very weak base oil markets and the turnaround at the Mississauga plant. 
Rack Forward EBITDA was $49 million, representing a 12% EBITDA margin. Full year Rack Forward EBITDA was $213 million, representing a 13% EBITDA margin, in line with our guidance range.
Within the base oil markets, we believe 2018 was the cyclical low. We anticipate continued pressure on the base oil crack into 2019. For HollyFrontier, we expect a negative Rack Back EBITDA to moderate with no planned maintenance this year at our Mississauga base oil plant. Additionally, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Sonneborn on February 1st, further strengthening our Rack Forward business. 
For full year 2019, Rack Forward EBITDA is expected to be in the $275 million to $300 million range, with an EBITDA margin of 11% to 16% of sales.
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $90 million for the fourth quarter compared to $125 million in the fourth quarter of last year, which included a noncash gain related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the Salt Lake City and Frontier Pipelines. HEP EBITDA was negatively impacted by lower UNEV volumes and unplanned maintenance on the refinery processing unit at Woods Cross in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. 
During the quarter, we announced and paid a $0.33 per share dividend totaling $58 million and repurchased $185 million of our stock. For full year 2018, we returned $597 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on our operations."

For the fourth quarter, our crude throughput was 406,000 barrels per day, slightly below our guidance of 410,000 to 420,000 barrels per day. This was primarily due to unplanned maintenance of one of the FCC units at our Woods Cross Refinery, which has since been resolved. 
For the full year, we ran 432,000 barrels per day of crude, and we successfully completed turnarounds at our Tulsa West, Mississauga and El Dorado plants. In the Rockies, our fourth quarter operating expense of $10.90 per throughput barrel was slightly elevated due to the unplanned maintenance at Woods Cross. We continue to make progress on our efforts to improve operations at our Cheyenne refinery. 
For the full year of 2018, we set an annual crude rate record averaging over 47,000 barrels per day.
In the Southwest, OpEx per throughput barrel was $5.36 for the quarter. Navajo also set an annual crude rate record averaging over 109,000 barrels per day, leading to the highest annual gasoline and diesel production ever recorded. 
In the Mid-Con, our operating expense per throughput barrel was $6.76 for the fourth quarter due to the turnaround at the El Dorado refinery, which was also in the fourth quarter. Despite a heavy maintenance year for the Mid-Con, we were able to set an annual record for gasoline production at our Tulsa Refinery.
Looking to 2019, we had a turnaround schedule for the first quarter at our Tulsa East plant that is expected to last through March. Both Cheyenne and El Dorado are scheduled for turnarounds in the fall. We expect to run between 400,000 and 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil for the first quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom for an update on our commercial operations."

For the fourth quarter, we ran 406,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 40% premium and 17% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $17.39 in the Rockies, $6.66 in the Mid-Con and $6.67",474,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we ran 406,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 40% premium and 17% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $17.39 in the Rockies, $6.66 in the Mid-Con and $6.67 in the Southwest. 
In the fourth quarter 2018, we ended the year with a year-on-year increase in vehicle miles-driven and good demand for products in both domestic and export markets. Gasoline inventories in the Magellan system ended the quarter at 8.8 million barrels, roughly 3.2 million barrels higher than September 30th levels. Diesel inventories ended the quarter at 6.6 million barrels, equaling third quarter levels. 
Days supply of both gasoline and diesel in the group finished at 28 and 36 days, respectively. 
Fourth quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $14.78, $27.16 in the Southwest and $26.67 in the Rockies. Crude differentials widened across the heavy and sour runs slates during the fourth quarter. In the Canadian heavy oil market, fourth quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $39.43 per barrel. But recently, we have seen this differential decrease to the $13 range and as the Alberta government crude system has reduced the volume of crude available and developments in the Indonesia -- in the Venezuelan market has increased the demand for heavy crude in the Gulf Coast. 
Despite corners the level of apportionment on the Enbridge system remain high. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price advantaged heavy crude from Canada to meet our Refining needs. Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 58,000 barrels per day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rockies regions. 
While our El Dorado plant was in turnaround during the fourth quarter, we were able to take advantage of favorable WCS arbitrage economics by selling excess barrels into the Cushing market. We refined approximately 171,000 barrels per day in Permian crude in our refining system composed of 110,000 barrels of the Navajo complex and 61,000 barrels per day via the Centurion pipeline at our El Dorado refinery. 
Midland differentials averaged fourth quarter $8.88 and currently, we see the same differential trading at flat to Cushing due to new pipeline capacity coming on stream earlier than expected. We anticipate this differential to widen into the summer months and then revert to the current levels in the third quarter this year as current pipeline capacity comes on onstream. 
Fourth quarter consolidated gross margin was $22.17 per produced barrels sold, a 77% increase over the $12.54 recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by improved laid-in crude cost in the Mid-Con and Rockies regions as well as strong diesel cracks in oil markets. Rent expense in the quarter was 8 -- $48 million. And with that, let me turn it over to Rich."

For the fourth quarter of 2018, cash flow from operations was $425 million inclusive of turnaround spending of $103 million. 
For the Frontier standalone capital expenditures totaled $90 million for the quarter and $257 million for the full year of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our total cash balance stood at $1.2 billion, a $79 million increase over the balance on September 30. We funded the Sonneborn acquisition on February 1st with cash on hand, and we were left with over $700 million on the balance sheet. 
The remaining cash balance, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity over $2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we returned a total of $243 million of cash to shareholders comprised of $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $58 million and the repurchase of approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock totaling $185 million.
For the full year of 2018, HollyFrontier paid $234 million in regular dividends and spent $363 million repurchasing approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock for a total cash return of $597 million.
As of December 31, we have $1 billion of standalone debt outstanding and a modest debt-to-cap ratio of 14%. 
Total HEP distributions received by HollyFrontier during the fourth quarter were $37 million, a 3% increase over the same period in 2017. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million HEP limited partner units, representing 57% of HEP's outstanding LP units with a market value of over $1.7 billion as of last night's close.
Some additional guidance items for the full year of 2019. Capital spending, we expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both turnarounds and CapEx at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $40 million to $50 million in our lubricants business and $30 million to $40 million of capital for HEP. We are expecting a tax rate of 23% to 25%. And with respect to Sonneborn, we anticipate $25 million to $30 million of onetime integration costs in 2019.
And with that, Carina, we're ready to take some questions."

Kind of much the same way that we think about 2016 was the cyclical low in our Refining product markets. We are thinking that 2019 we'll see some year-over-year improvement versus 2018, and we'll continue to improve from there in the long run. So looking to our business, we are expecting improvement in 2019 versus 2019, primarily driven by the absence of that planned maintenance.

We are doing great -- certain of our plans, like Cheyenne. You guys have followed the progress along with us over the last 2 years-or-so. Now that plant has seen significant improvements during that time period. It is running, as Jim said, average 47,000 barrels per day versus capacity of 50,000. So doing well there.

We've been pleasantly surprised that they have been trading out at higher rates. I think we are pushing $9 or $10 now. It looks like when we look into the future, it's continuing that. I guess what we are attributing that a little bit of weakness in WTI at Cushing coupled with the strength in the Brent market as we continue to see the situation in the Middle East or cutbacks quarters coming out of OPEC, increased demand out of China. That's what we tend to expect for the remainder of this year. As you know, we're not a big player in the Brent market or the international markets, so it's difficult to get a good read on it. But that's our viewpoint that it should be in that $8 the $10 for the balance of the year. On the Canadian situation, it's a little harder to say what's going to happen. I think the Alberta government, when they implemented the quarter system, they tended to over correct the problem. We saw differentials go from $47 down to $9. That low differential in the Venezuelan and Mexican issues really impacted the heavy differential on a short-term basis. And in doing so, it basically rendered well economics coming out of Western Canada to be uneconomic. So you are seeing people like Imperial oil shot their program and others taking a look at it. We've looked at it a couple of ways on a long-term basis. The first way is that we look at it is a transportation and quality adjustment from the Gulf Coast. And the second way we sort of looked at the variable basis to rail and so what that was to be the price setting mechanism as we go forward. As a result, we started to came up with the same number looking at 2 different ways, and that's sort of on the $15 and $18 range for WCS differentials. I think we are seeing that and the other fact that it's coming into play is when you look at the forward curve on the WCS, you see some discounting in the fourth quarter because of IMO 2020. So the WCS in the fourth quarter of this year is trading at around minus $20. So that's our view on Western Canadian economics at this point in time."

Today, we reported fourth quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $142 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results include a lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustment that decreased pretax earnings by $329 million. Excluding this item, net income for the quarter was $394 million or $2.25 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $125 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the same period in 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $641 million, an increase of $307 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase in earnings is primarily due to our ability to capture the favorable crude discounts across our refining system.
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported an EBITDA loss of $4 million, driven by negative Rack Back EBITDA in the quarter. Rack Back EBITDA was negatively impacted by very weak base oil markets and the turnaround at the Mississauga plant. Rack Forward EBITDA was $49 million, representing a 12% EBITDA margin. Full year Rack Forward EBITDA was $213 million, representing a 13% EBITDA margin, in line with our guidance range.
Within the base oil markets, we believe 2018 was a cyclical low. We anticipate continued pressure on the base oil cracks into 2019. For HollyFrontier, we expect the negative Rack Back EBITDA to moderate with no planned maintenance this year at our Mississauga base oil plant. Additionally, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Sonneborn on February 1, further strengthening our Rack Forward business. For full year 2019, Rack Forward EBITDA is expected to be in the $275 million to $300 million range with an EBITDA margin of 11% to 16% of sales.
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $90 million for the fourth quarter compared to $125 million in the fourth quarter of last year, which included a noncash gain related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the Salt Lake City and Frontier Pipelines. HEP EBITDA was negatively impacted by lower UNEV volumes and unplanned maintenance on a refinery processing unit at Woods Cross in the fourth quarter. 
We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we announced and paid a $0.33 per share dividend totaling $58 million and repurchased $185 million of our stock. For full year 2018, we returned $597 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on our operations."

For the fourth quarter, our crude throughput was 406,000 barrels per day, slightly below our guidance of 410,000 to 420,000 barrels per day. This was primarily due to unplanned maintenance of one of the FCC units at our Woods Cross Refinery, which has since been resolved. 
For the full year, we ran 432,000 barrels per day of crude, and we successfully completed turnarounds at our Tulsa West, Mississauga and El Dorado plants. In the Rockies, our fourth quarter operating expense of $10.90 per throughput barrel was slightly elevated due to the unplanned maintenance at Woods Cross. We continue to make progress on our efforts to improve operations at our Cheyenne refinery. For the full year of 2018, we set an annual crude rate record averaging over 47,000 barrels per day.
In the Southwest, OpEx per throughput barrel was $5.36 for the quarter. Navajo also set an annual crude rate record averaging over 109,000 barrels per day, leading to the highest annual gasoline and diesel production ever recorded. 
In the Mid-Con, our operating expense per throughput barrel was $6.76 for the fourth quarter due to the turnaround at the El Dorado refinery, which was also in the fourth quarter. Despite a heavy maintenance year for the Mid-Con, we were able to set an annual record for gasoline production at our Tulsa Refinery.
Looking to 2019, we have a turnaround schedule for the first quarter at our Tulsa East plant that is expected to last through March. Both Cheyenne and El Dorado are scheduled for turnarounds in the fall. We expect to run between 400,000 and 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil for the first quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom for an update on our commercial operations."

For the fourth quarter, we ran 406,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 40% premium and 17% WCS and black wax crude oil.

For the fourth quarter, we ran 406,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 40% premium and 17% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $17.39 in the Rockies, $6.66 in the Mid-Con and $6.67 in the Southwest. 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we ended the year with a year-on-year increase in vehicle miles driven and good demand for products in both domestic and export markets. Gasoline inventories in the Magellan system ended the quarter at 8.8 million barrels, roughly 3.2 million barrels higher than September 30 levels. Diesel inventories ended the quarter at 6.6 million barrels, equaling third quarter levels. Days supply of both gasoline and diesel in the group finished at 28 and 36 days, respectively. 
Fourth quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $14.78, $27.16 in the Southwest and $26.67 in the Rockies. Crude differentials widened across the heavy and sour slates during the fourth quarter. In the Canadian heavy oil market, fourth quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $39.43 per barrel. But recently, we have seen this differential decrease to the $13 range as the Alberta government oil system has reduced the volume of crude available and developments in the Indonesia -- in the Venezuelan market has increased the demand for heavy crude in the Gulf Coast. 
Despite corners, the levels of apportionment on the Enbridge system remain high. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged heavy crude from Canada to meet our refining needs. Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 58,000 barrels per day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. 
While our El Dorado plant was in turnaround in the fourth quarter, we were able to take advantage of favorable WCS arbitrage economics by selling excess barrels into the Cushing market. We refined approximately 171,000 barrels per day of Permian crude in our refining system composed of 110,000 barrels of the Navajo complex and 61,000 barrels per day via the Centurion pipeline at our El Dorado refinery. 
Midland differentials averaged the fourth quarter at $8.88. And currently, we seen the -- see the same differential trading at flat to Cushing due to the new pipeline capacity coming onstream earlier than expected. We anticipate this differential to widen into the summer months and then revert to the current levels in the third quarter this year as current pipeline capacity comes on onstream. 
Fourth quarter consolidated gross margin was $22.17 per produced barrels sold, a 77% increase over the $12.54 recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by improved laid-in crude cost in the Mid-Con and Rockies regions as well as strong diesel cracks in all our markets. Rent expense in the quarter was 8 -- $48 million. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Rich."

For the fourth quarter of 2018, cash flow from operations was $425 million inclusive of turnaround spending of $103 million. HollyFrontier's stand-alone capital expenditures totaled $90 million for the quarter and $257 million for the full year of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our total cash balance stood at $1.2 billion, a $79 million increase over the balance on September 30. We funded the Sonneborn acquisition on February 1 with cash on hand and were left with over $700 million on the balance sheet. The remaining cash balance, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity over $2 billion. 
During the fourth quarter, we returned a total of $243 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $58 million and the repurchase of approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock totaling $185 million. For the full year of 2018, HollyFrontier paid $234 million in regular dividends and spent $363 million repurchasing approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock for a total cash return of $597 million. As of December 31, we have $1 billion of stand-alone debt outstanding and a modest debt-to-cap ratio of 14%. 
Total HEP distributions received by HollyFrontier during the fourth quarter were $37 million, a 3% increase over the same period in 2017. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million HEP limited partner units, representing 57% of HEP's outstanding LP units with a market value of over $1.7 billion as of last night's close.
Some additional guidance items for the full year of 2019. In capital spending, we expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both turnarounds and CapEx at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $40 million to $50 million in our Lubricants business and $30 million to $40 million of capital for HEP. We are expecting a tax rate of 23% to 25%. And with respect to Sonneborn, we anticipate $25 million to $30 million of onetime integration costs in 2019.

So look, in the fourth quarter, there were really two things going on that George mentioned. One was macro and one was micro. On the macro side, we had a turnaround in catalytic dewax train at Mississauga, which produces a lower Group III material. And this was about half the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, just a reminder, we had turnarounds in both trains in 2018, and we do not have any scheduled maintenance for 2019. And on the macro side, the basal markets were really weak, obviously, in the third and fourth quarter. And the rate of change was particularly painful in the Group III market where we saw some extreme behavior from some of our competition. We believe either late '18 or early '19 is the cyclical low really driven by the supply-demand balance. Supply coming on during 2018 in the debt that should trough here around the turn of the year, kind of much the same way that we think about 2016 was the cyclical low in the refining product markets. So we're thinking that in 2019, we'll see some year-over-year improvement versus 2018, and we'll continue to improve from there in the long run. So looking to our business, we're expecting improvement in 2019 versus 2019 (sic) [ 2018 ], primarily driven by the absence of that planned maintenance.

We've been pleasantly surprised that they've been -- they trading out at higher rates. I think we're pushing $9 or $10 now. It looks like when we look into the future, it's continuing there. I guess what we're attributing that to was a little bit of weakness on WTI at Cushing coupled with strength in the Brent market as we continue to see the situation in the Middle East or cutbacks quarters coming out of OPEC, increased demand out of China. That's what we tend to expect for the remainder of this year. As you know, we're not a big player in the Brent market or the international markets, so it's difficult to get a good read on it. But that's our viewpoint that it should be in that $8 to $10 for the balance of the year. On the Canadian situation, it's a little harder to say what's going to happen. I think the Alberta government, when they implemented the corner system, they tended to overcorrect the problem. We saw our differentials go from $47 down to $9. That low differential in the Venezuelan and Mexican issues really impacted the heavy differential on a short-term basis. And in doing so, it basically rendered well economics coming out of Western Canada to be uneconomic. So you're seeing people like Imperial Oil shatter their program and others taking a look at it. We've looked at it a couple of ways on a long-term basis. The first way is that we've looked at it is a transportation and quality adjustment from the Gulf Coast. And the second way we sort of looked at the variable basis to rail and saw what that was to be the price-setting mechanism as we go forward. And as a result, we sort of came up with the same number looking at it two different ways. And that's sort of in the $15 to $18 range for WCS differentials. I think we're seeing that. And the other factor that's coming into play is when you look at the forward curve on WCS, you see some discounting in the fourth quarter because of IMO 2020 so that WCS in the fourth quarter of this year is trading at around minus $20. So that's our view on Western Canadian economics at this point in time."

Today, we reported fourth quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $142 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results include a lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustment that decreased pretax earnings by $329 million. Excluding this item, net income for the quarter was $394 million or $2.25 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $125 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the same period in 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $641 million, an increase of $307 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase in earnings is primarily due to our ability to capture the favorable crude discounts across our refining system.
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported an EBITDA loss of $4 million, driven by negative Rack Back EBITDA in the quarter. Rack Back EBITDA was negatively impacted by very weak base oil markets and the turnaround at the Mississauga plant. Rack Forward EBITDA was $49 million, representing a 12% EBITDA margin. Full year Rack Forward EBITDA was $213 million, representing a 13% EBITDA margin, in line with our guidance range.
Within the base oil markets, we believe 2018 was a cyclical low. We anticipate continued pressure on the base oil cracks into 2019. For HollyFrontier, we expect the negative Rack Back EBITDA to moderate with no planned maintenance this year at our Mississauga base oil plant. Additionally, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Sonneborn on February 1, further strengthening our Rack Forward business. For full year 2019, Rack Forward EBITDA is expected to be in the $275 million to $300 million range with an EBITDA margin of 11% to 16% of sales.
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $90 million for the fourth quarter compared to $125 million in the fourth quarter of last year, which included a noncash gain related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the Salt Lake City and Frontier Pipelines. HEP EBITDA was negatively impacted by lower UNEV volumes and unplanned maintenance on a refinery processing unit at Woods Cross in the fourth quarter. 
We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we announced and paid a $0.33 per share dividend totaling $58 million and repurchased $185 million of our stock. For full year 2018, we returned $597 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

We continue to make progress on our efforts to improve operations at our Cheyenne refinery. For the full year of 2018, we set an annual crude rate record averaging over 47,000 barrels per day.
In the Southwest, OpEx per throughput barrel was $5.36 for the quarter. Navajo also set an annual crude rate record averaging over 109,000 barrels per day, leading to the highest annual gasoline and diesel production ever recorded. 
In the Mid-Con, our operating expense per throughput barrel was $6.76 for the fourth quarter due to the turnaround at the El Dorado refinery, which was also in the fourth quarter. Despite a heavy maintenance year for the Mid-Con, we were able to set an annual record for gasoline production at our Tulsa Refinery.
Looking to 2019, we have a turnaround schedule for the first quarter at our Tulsa East plant that is expected to last through March. Both Cheyenne and El Dorado are scheduled for turnarounds in the fall. We expect to run between 400,000 and 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil for the first quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom for an update on our commercial operations."

For the fourth quarter, we ran 406,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 40% premium and 17% WCS and black wax crude oil.

For the fourth quarter, we ran 406,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 40% premium and 17% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $17.39 in the Rockies, $6.66 in the Mid-Con and $6.67 in the Southwest. 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we ended the year with a year-on-year increase in vehicle miles driven and good demand for products in both domestic and export markets. Gasoline inventories in the Magellan system ended the quarter at 8.8 million barrels, roughly 3.2 million barrels higher than September 30 levels. Diesel inventories ended the quarter at 6.6 million barrels, equaling third quarter levels. Days supply of both gasoline and diesel in the group finished at 28 and 36 days, respectively. 
Fourth quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $14.78, $27.16 in the Southwest and $26.67 in the Rockies. Crude differentials widened across the heavy and sour slates during the fourth quarter. In the Canadian heavy oil market, fourth quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $39.43 per barrel. But recently, we have seen this differential decrease to the $13 range as the Alberta government oil system has reduced the volume of crude available and developments in the Indonesia -- in the Venezuelan market has increased the demand for heavy crude in the Gulf Coast. 
Despite corners, the levels of apportionment on the Enbridge system remain high. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged heavy crude from Canada to meet our refining needs. Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 58,000 barrels per day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. 
While our El Dorado plant was in turnaround in the fourth quarter, we were able to take advantage of favorable WCS arbitrage economics by selling excess barrels into the Cushing market. We refined approximately 171,000 barrels per day of Permian crude in our refining system, composed of 110,000 barrels of the Navajo complex and 61,000 barrels per day via the Centurion pipeline at our El Dorado refinery. 
Midland differentials averaged fourth quarter at $8.88. And currently, we seen the -- see the same differential trading at flat to Cushing through to the new pipeline capacity coming onstream earlier than expected. We anticipate this differential to widen into the summer months and then revert to the current levels in the third quarter this year as current pipeline capacity comes on onstream. 
Fourth quarter consolidated gross margin was $22.17 per produced barrels sold, a 77% increase over the $12.54 recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by improved laid-in crude cost in the Mid-Con and Rockies regions as well as strong diesel cracks in all our markets. Rent expense in the quarter was 8 -- $48 million. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Rich."

For the fourth quarter of 2018, cash flow from operations was $425 million inclusive of turnaround spending of $103 million. HollyFrontier's stand-alone capital expenditures totaled $90 million for the quarter and $257 million for the full year of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our total cash balance stood at $1.2 billion, a $79 million increase over the balance on September 30. We funded the Sonneborn acquisition on February 1 with cash on hand and were left with over $700 million on the balance sheet. The remaining cash balance, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity over $2 billion. 
During the fourth quarter, we returned a total of $243 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $58 million and the repurchase of approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock totaling $185 million. For the full year of 2018, HollyFrontier paid $234 million in regular dividends and spent $363 million repurchasing approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock for a total cash return of $597 million. As of December 31, we have $1 billion of stand-alone debt outstanding and a modest debt-to-cap ratio of 14%. 
Total HEP distributions received by HollyFrontier during the fourth quarter were $37 million, a 3% increase over the same period in 2017. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million HEP limited partner units, representing 57% of HEP's outstanding LP units with a market value of over $1.7 billion as of last night's close.
Some additional guidance items for the full year of 2019. In capital spending, we expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both turnarounds and CapEx at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $40 million to $50 million in our Lubricants business and $30 million to $40 million of capital for HEP. We are expecting a tax rate of 23% to 25%. And with respect to Sonneborn, we anticipate $25 million to $30 million of onetime integration costs in 2019.
And with that, Carina, we're ready to take some questions."

So look, in the fourth quarter, there were really two things going on that George mentioned. One was macro and one was micro. On the micro side, we had a turnaround in catalytic dewax train at Mississauga, which produces a lower Group III material. And this was about half the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, just a reminder, we had turnarounds in both trains in 2018, and we do not have any scheduled maintenance for 2019. And on the macro side, the basal markets were really weak, obviously, in the third and fourth quarter. And the rate of change was particularly painful in the Group III market where we saw some extreme behavior from some of our competition. We believe either late '18 or early '19 is the cyclical low really driven by the supply-demand balance. Supply coming on during 2018, and the debt that should trough here around the turn of the year, kind of much the same way that we think about 2016 was the cyclical low in the refining product markets. So we're thinking that in 2019, we'll see some year-over-year improvement versus 2018, and we'll continue to improve from there in the long run. So looking to our business, we're expecting improvement in 2019 versus 2019 (sic) [ 2018 ], primarily driven by the absence of that planned maintenance. So we're going to -- I think we're going to struggle to see the Rack Back portion reach its breakeven in 2019."

We've been pleasantly surprised that they've been -- they trading out at higher rates. I think we're pushing $9 or $10 now. It looks like when we look into the future, it's continuing there. I guess what we're attributing that to was a little bit of weakness on WTI at Cushing, coupled with strength in the Brent market as we continue to see the situation in the Middle East or cutbacks quarters coming out of OPEC, increased demand out of China. That's what we tend to expect for the remainder of this year. As you know, we're not a big player in the Brent market or the international markets, so it's difficult to get a good read on it. But that's our viewpoint that it should be in that $8 to $10 for the balance of the year. On the Canadian situation, it's a little harder to say what's going to happen. I think the Alberta government, when they implemented the corner system, they tended to overcorrect the problem. We saw our differentials go from $47 down to $9. That low differential in the Venezuelan and Mexican issues really impacted the heavy differential on a short-term basis. And in doing so, it basically rendered rail economics coming out of Western Canada to be uneconomic. So you're seeing people like Imperial Oil shutter their program and others taking a look at it. We've looked at it a couple of ways on a long-term basis. The first way is that we've looked at it is a transportation and quality adjustment from the Gulf Coast. And the second way we sort of looked at the variable basis to rail and saw what that was to be the price-setting mechanism as we go forward. And as a result, we sort of came up with the same number looking at it two different ways. And that's sort of in the $15 to $18 range for WCS differentials. I think we're seeing that. And the other factor that's coming into play is when you look at the forward curve on WCS, you see some discounting in the fourth quarter because of IMO 2020 so that WCS in the fourth quarter of this year is trading at around minus $20. So that's our view on Western Canadian economics at this point in time."

Today, we reported fourth quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $142 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results include a lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustment that decreased pretax earnings by $329 million. Excluding this item, net income for the quarter was $394 million or $2.25 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $125 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the same period in 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $641 million, an increase of $307 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase in earnings is primarily due to our ability to capture the favorable crude discounts across our refining system.
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported an EBITDA loss of $4 million, driven by negative Rack Back EBITDA in the quarter. Rack Back EBITDA was negatively impacted by very weak base oil markets and the turnaround at the Mississauga plant. Rack Forward EBITDA was $49 million, representing a 12% EBITDA margin. Full year Rack Forward EBITDA was $213 million, representing a 13% EBITDA margin, in line with our guidance range.
Within the base oil markets, we believe 2018 was a cyclical low. We anticipate continued pressure on the base oil cracks into 2019. For HollyFrontier, we expect the negative Rack Back EBITDA to moderate with no planned maintenance this year at our Mississauga base oil plant. Additionally, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Sonneborn on February 1, further strengthening our Rack Forward business. For full year 2019, Rack Forward EBITDA is expected to be in the $275 million to $300 million range with an EBITDA margin of 11% to 16% of sales.
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $90 million for the fourth quarter compared to $125 million in the fourth quarter of last year, which included a noncash gain related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the Salt Lake City and Frontier Pipelines. HEP EBITDA was negatively impacted by lower UNEV volumes and unplanned maintenance on a refinery processing unit at Woods Cross in the fourth quarter. 
We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we announced and paid a $0.33 per share dividend totaling $58 million and repurchased $185 million of our stock. For full year 2018, we returned $597 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

For the fourth quarter, our crude throughput was 406,000 barrels per day, slightly below our guidance of 410,000 to 420,000 barrels per day. This was primarily due to unplanned maintenance of one of the FCC units at our Woods Cross Refinery, which has since been resolved. 
For the full year, we ran 432,000 barrels per day of crude, and we successfully completed turnarounds at our Tulsa West, Mississauga and El Dorado plants. In the Rockies, our fourth quarter operating expense of $10.90 per throughput barrel was slightly elevated due to the unplanned maintenance at Woods Cross. We continue to make progress on our efforts to improve operations at our Cheyenne refinery. For the full year of 2018, we set an annual crude rate record averaging over 47,000 barrels per day.
In the Southwest, OpEx per throughput barrel was $5.36 for the quarter. Navajo also set an annual crude rate record averaging over 109,000 barrels per day, leading to the highest annual gasoline and diesel production ever recorded. 
In the Mid-Con, our operating expense per throughput barrel was $6.76 for the fourth quarter due to the turnaround at the El Dorado refinery, which was also in the fourth quarter. Despite a heavy maintenance year for the Mid-Con, we were able to set an annual record for gasoline production at our Tulsa Refinery.
Looking to 2019, we have a turnaround schedule for the first quarter at our Tulsa East plant that is expected to last through March. Both Cheyenne and El Dorado are scheduled for turnarounds in the fall. We expect to run between 400,000 and 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil for the first quarter.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we ended the year with a year-on-year increase in vehicle miles driven and good demand for products in both domestic and export markets. Gasoline inventories in the Magellan system ended the quarter at 8.8 million barrels, roughly 3.2 million barrels higher than September 30 levels. Diesel inventories ended the quarter at 6.6 million barrels, equaling third quarter levels. Days supply of both gasoline and diesel in the group finished at 28 and 36 days, respectively. 
Fourth quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $14.78, $27.16 in the Southwest and $26.67 in the Rockies. Crude differentials widened across the heavy and sour slates during the fourth quarter. In the Canadian heavy oil market, fourth quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $39.43 per barrel. But recently, we have seen this differential decrease to the $13 range as the Alberta government oil system has reduced the volume of crude available and developments in the Indonesia -- in the Venezuelan market has increased the demand for heavy crude in the Gulf Coast. 
Despite corners, the levels of apportionment on the Enbridge system remain high. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged heavy crude from Canada to meet our refining needs. Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 58,000 barrels per day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. 
While our El Dorado plant was in turnaround in the fourth quarter, we were able to take advantage of favorable WCS arbitrage economics by selling excess barrels into the Cushing market. We refined approximately 171,000 barrels per day of Permian crude in our refining system, composed of 110,000 barrels of the Navajo complex and 61,000 barrels per day via the Centurion pipeline at our El Dorado refinery. 
Midland differentials averaged fourth quarter at $8.88. And currently, we seen the -- see the same differential trading at flat to Cushing through to the new pipeline capacity coming onstream earlier than expected. We anticipate this differential to widen into the summer months and then revert to the current levels in the third quarter this year as current pipeline capacity comes on onstream. 
Fourth quarter consolidated gross margin was $22.17 per produced barrels sold, a 77% increase over the $12.54 recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by improved laid-in crude cost in the Mid-Con and Rockies regions as well as strong diesel cracks in all our markets. Rent expense in the quarter was 8 -- $48 million. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Rich."

For the fourth quarter of 2018, cash flow from operations was $425 million inclusive of turnaround spending of $103 million. HollyFrontier's stand-alone capital expenditures totaled $90 million for the quarter and $257 million for the full year of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our total cash balance stood at $1.2 billion, a $79 million increase over the balance on September 30. We funded the Sonneborn acquisition on February 1 with cash on hand and were left with over $700 million on the balance sheet. The remaining cash balance, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity over $2 billion. 
During the fourth quarter, we returned a total of $243 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $58 million and the repurchase of approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock totaling $185 million. For the full year of 2018, HollyFrontier paid $234 million in regular dividends and spent $363 million repurchasing approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock for a total cash return of $597 million. As of December 31, we have $1 billion of stand-alone debt outstanding and a modest debt-to-cap ratio of 14%. 
Total HEP distributions received by HollyFrontier during the fourth quarter were $37 million, a 3% increase over the same period in 2017. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million HEP limited partner units, representing 57% of HEP's outstanding LP units with a market value of over $1.7 billion as of last night's close.
Some additional guidance items for the full year of 2019. In capital spending, we expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both turnarounds and CapEx at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $40 million to $50 million in our Lubricants business and $30 million to $40 million of capital for HEP. We are expecting a tax rate of 23% to 25%. And with respect to Sonneborn, we anticipate $25 million to $30 million of onetime integration costs in 2019.
And with that, Carina, we're ready to take some questions."

So look, in the fourth quarter, there were really two things going on that George mentioned. One was macro and one was micro. On the micro side, we had a turnaround in catalytic dewax train at Mississauga, which produces a lower Group III material. And this was about half the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, just a reminder, we had turnarounds in both trains in 2018, and we do not have any scheduled maintenance for 2019. And on the macro side, the basal markets were really weak, obviously, in the third and fourth quarter. And the rate of change was particularly painful in the Group III market where we saw some extreme behavior from some of our competition. We believe either late '18 or early '19 is the cyclical low really driven by the supply-demand balance. Supply coming on during 2018, and the debt that should trough here around the turn of the year, kind of much the same way that we think about 2016 was the cyclical low in the refining product markets. So we're thinking that in 2019, we'll see some year-over-year improvement versus 2018, and we'll continue to improve from there in the long run. So looking to our business, we're expecting improvement in 2019 versus 2019 (sic) [ 2018 ], primarily driven by the absence of that planned maintenance. So we're going to -- I think we're going to struggle to see the Rack Back portion reach its breakeven in 2019."

We've been pleasantly surprised that they've been -- they trading out at higher rates. I think we're pushing $9 or $10 now. It looks like when we look into the future, it's continuing there. I guess what we're attributing that to was a little bit of weakness on WTI at Cushing, coupled with strength in the Brent market as we continue to see the situation in the Middle East or cutbacks quarters coming out of OPEC, increased demand out of China. That's what we tend to expect for the remainder of this year. As you know, we're not a big player in the Brent market or the international markets, so it's difficult to get a good read on it. But that's our viewpoint that it should be in that $8 to $10 for the balance of the year. On the Canadian situation, it's a little harder to say what's going to happen. I think the Alberta government, when they implemented the corner system, they tended to overcorrect the problem. We saw our differentials go from $47 down to $9. That low differential in the Venezuelan and Mexican issues really impacted the heavy differential on a short-term basis. And in doing so, it basically rendered rail economics coming out of Western Canada to be uneconomic. So you're seeing people like Imperial Oil shutter their program and others taking a look at it. We've looked at it a couple of ways on a long-term basis. The first way is that we've looked at it is a transportation and quality adjustment from the Gulf Coast. And the second way we sort of looked at the variable basis to rail and saw what that was to be the price-setting mechanism as we go forward. And as a result, we sort of came up with the same number looking at it two different ways. And that's sort of in the $15 to $18 range for WCS differentials. I think we're seeing that. And the other factor that's coming into play is when you look at the forward curve on WCS, you see some discounting in the fourth quarter because of IMO 2020 so that WCS in the fourth quarter of this year is trading at around minus $20.

Today, we reported first quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $253 million or $1.47 per diluted share. 
Certain items detailed in our earnings release increased net income by $160 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $93 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $137 million or $0.77 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $282 million, $34 million less than the first quarter of 2018 principally driven by maintenance in our Refining and Marketing segment and weaker base oil margins in our Lubricants business, which were partially offset by stronger earnings at HEP and 2 months of contributions from our Sonneborn acquisition. 
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported adjusted EBITDA of $20 million despite a very challenging base oil market. Rack Forward adjusted EBITDA was $53 million for the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 12% of sales.
Our integration of Sonneborn is going well, and as of May 1, we have achieved run rate synergies of $7 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year. 
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $94 million for the first quarter compared to $88 million in the first quarter of last year. Overall pipeline volumes increased 5% year-over-year driven by record volumes on our crude-gathering system of 157,000 barrels per day.
We also experienced strong third-party [indiscernible] shipments on the UNEV pipeline as an arbitrage between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas remained open during the [indiscernible] quarter. 
During the quarter, we returned $135 million of cash to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. Our focus remains on improving reliability and, by extension, both unit and absolute costs across the refining system. With the rebound in the gasoline market and no major planned downtime until September, we believe we are well positioned for strong financial performance heading into the summer driving season.

Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $4.46 in the Rockies, $1.62 in the Mid-Con and $2.75 in the Sout",513,"Thanks, Jim. For the first quarter of 2019, we ran 400,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 42% Permian and 20% WCS and black racks crude oil. Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $4.46 in the Rockies, $1.62 in the Mid-Con and $2.75 in the Southwest. 
In the first quarter of 2019, we started the year with high gasoline inventories and low gasoline cracks on the product side and decreasing crude differentials on both Canadian and Permian crude oils. Over the course of the quarter, the markets have improved, and we are optimistic for the remainder of the year as product fundamentals continue improving and gasoline and distillate inventories remain at reduced levels. Gasoline inventory in the Magellan system started the year at 8.9 million barrels and ended the quarter at 7.7 million barrels. Current inventory of gasoline are roughly 1 million barrels lower at 6.7 million barrels, well below the 5-year average. 
Diesel inventories are relatively static throughout the period. Days supply of gasoline and diesel in the group finished at 29 and 33 days, respectively. First quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $14.74, $19.15 in the Southwest and $15.51 for the Rockies. 
Crude differentials compressed across heavy and sour slates during the first quarter. In the Canadian heavy market, first quarter differentials were WCS at Hardisty averaged $12.69, well below the average differential we saw in the fourth quarter of $39.43. Recently, we have seen this differential trade in the $13 range as the Alberta government quota system has reduced the volume of crude output. Despite mandated quotas, the levels of [indiscernible] on the Enbridge remain high. The forward market for WCS has been widening as the market foresees incremental crude to be produced as well as the impact of IMO 2020 later in the year. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged crude from Canada to meet our refining needs. 
Canadian heavy and sour runs average 65,000 barrels per day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 171,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refining system composed of 106,000 barrels a day at the Navajo complex and 59,000 barrels per day delivered by the Centurion pipeline at the El Dorado refinery.
Midland differentials averaged in the first quarter at $2.57, and currently, we see the same differential trading at $4.16 below Cushing due to new pipeline capacity coming on later than originally expected. We anticipate this differential to remain wide into the summer months and then revert to tighter levels later in the year as additional pipeline capacity comes on stream. 
First quarter consolidated refinery gross margin was $12.74 produced barrels sold, representing a 1% decrease compared to the $12.83 recorded in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was driven by compressed laid-in crude costs in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions, offset by stronger gasoline and diesel cracks in the Southwest. In the first quarter, our rent expense was $39 million. 
And with that, I'm going to send it over to Rich."

Pretax earnings were positively impacted by a $232 million lower cost-to-market benefit, which was partially offset by Sonneborn acquisition cost of $13 million and a onetime inventory valuation step-up of $9 million. Table of these items can be found in our press release. We anticipate realizing an additional $13 million to $18 million of Sonneborn-related integration costs throughout the remainder of 2019. 
In the first quarter of 2019, cash flow from operations was $217 million, which includes turnaround spending of $79 million. HollyFrontier's standalone capital expenditures totaled $53 million for the quarter, and we also funded the Sonneborn acquisition with $663 million of cash on hand. 
As of March 31, our total balance sheet -- cash balance stood at $496 million, which is in line with our target cash balance of $500 million. The strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, put our total liquidity at over $1.8 billion. As of quarter end, we had $1 billion of standalone debt outstanding and a debt-to-cap ratio of 14%.
During the first quarter, we returned a total of $135 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $57 million and the repurchase of approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock totaling $78 million. 
ETP distributions received by HollyFrontier during the first quarter totaled $37 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HFC owns $59.6 million HEP Limited partner units, representing 57% of HEP's LP units and a market value of $1.6 billion as of last night's close.
For the full year of 2019, we continue to expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both standalone capital turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $40 million to $50 million at our Lubes and Specialty Products business and $30 million to $40 million of capital for HEP. 
And with that, Tamia, we are ready to take questions."

Primarily, where we do business in the Delaware Basin, we see a lot more light crudes coming on stream and not as many of the sour crudes.

We believe the market bottoming here in the first half of '19 with supply additions peaking and the most notable of those being ramp-up of excellent group 2 plant at Rotterdam right now. 
Specific to our business, we saw sequential improvement with the absence of a turnaround. This was somewhat hampered by the weather-related maintenance we had at Mississauga, which is in the second quarter. So in general, we expect to see the continued slow improvement through the remainder of the year. But really, in the long run, what we expect to see is demand growth absorbed these capacity additions similar to conditions you see in any cyclical business, frankly.

And there's no question, there's weakness on the Rack Back side. Rich talked about the additional capacity coming on both in Rotterdam and in the other regions of the world. 
So there's 2 things happening there. It's obviously adding supply, but it's not just a matter of additional supply that needs to be absorbed. There's also substitution occurring between the various grades of lube oils. So most of these new plants are group 2 in the market, as Rich said in his remarks, is trending towards higher-quality lubricants, which is group 2 and group 3. And what we expect to happen as this supply comes on is the group 1, which is primarily the base oil that's used in Asia and, to a certain extent, in Europe, that will be substituted by this increased supply of group 2. So a lot of substitution going on to absorb that capacity as well as continued growth overall for base oils in general. 
And then there's the Rack Forward section of the business, which again that's where our primary focus is for growth, to continue on capitalizing on our technology and know-how within Sonneborn and PCLI to grow that business in downstream markets."

I think we would all agree that, that's probably on the high end of where it should be. As we all know, the Permian pipelines are coming soon at the end of this year to bring more barrels from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. We think that'll put downward pressure on the Brent WTI spread. But our view is that still should be in the $5 per barrel range plus or minus. The way that we typically look at that, we break it into 2 components. What's the Brent to WTI Houston differential going to be? That's been typically running at about a $2 per barrel range recently. I think, directionally, that will widen out as there's more barrels coming into Houston from the Permian. Those Permian barrels are going to have to find new and different markets than where it's currently going to absorb the additional supply in Houston. And then what's the Houston to Cushing differential going to be? I think that's going to be very much a function of transportation economics, which is going to be roughly in a $3 per barrel range. As those pipelines fill, could be higher. If and when you capacity added to inland markets to the Gulf Coast, it could be lower. But bottom line is we expect long-term that differential to be at the $5 per barrel range."

Every dollar per barrel impact on the crack is going to be nominally $70 million per year to us. Most common number I've heard for the impact of IMO 2020 is probably in the $5 per barrel range. I've heard numbers as crazy as $20 per barrel. We tend to stick to the consensus type of number 5. So we go from there on that. 
As far as acquisitions, that's difficult to impossible to call. As I said earlier, we love to continue to grow our company we are not going to grow just for growth's sake. It's got to be value-oriented. I mean we've seen what we've seen in the recent past. I think we are pretty proud of what we've done.

Today, we reported first quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $253 million or $1.47 per diluted share.
Certain items detailed in our earnings release increased net income by $160 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $93 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $137 million or $0.77 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $282 million, $34 million less than the first quarter of 2018 principally driven by maintenance in our Refining and Marketing segment and weaker base oil margins in our Lubricants business, which were partially offset by stronger earnings at HEP and 2 months of contributions from our Sonneborn acquisition. 
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported adjusted EBITDA of $20 million despite a very challenging base oil market. Rack Forward adjusted EBITDA was $53 million for the quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was 12% of sales.
Our integration of Sonneborn is going well, and as of May 1, we have achieved run rate synergies of $7 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year.
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $94 million for the first quarter compared to $88 million in the first quarter of last year. Overall pipeline volumes increased 5% year-over-year driven by record volumes on our crude-gathering system of 157,000 barrels per day.
We also experienced strong third-party spot shipments on the UNEV Pipeline as the arbitrage between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas remained open during majority of the quarter.
During the quarter, we returned $135 million of cash to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. Our focus remains on improving reliability and, by extension, both unit and absolute costs across our refining system. With the rebound in the gasoline market and no major planned downtime until September, we believe we are well positioned for strong financial performance heading into the summer driving season.

For the first quarter of 2019, we ran 400,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 42% Permian and 20% WCS and black wax crude oil.

For the first quarter of 2019, we ran 400,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 42% Permian and 20% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $4.46 in the Rockies, $1.62 in the Mid-Con and $2.75 in the Southwest.
In the first quarter of 2019, we started the year with high gasoline inventories and low gasoline cracks on the product side and decreasing crude differentials on both Canadian and Permian crude oils. Over the course of the quarter, the markets have improved, and we are optimistic for the remainder of the year as product fundamentals continue improving and gasoline and distillate inventories remain at reduced levels. Gasoline inventories in the Magellan system started the year at 8.9 million barrels and ended the quarter at 7.7 million barrels. Current inventories of gasoline are roughly 1 million barrels lower at 6.7 million barrels, well below the 5-year average.
Diesel inventories were relatively static throughout the period. Days supply of gasoline and diesel in the group finished at 29 and 33 days, respectively. First quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $14.74, $19.15 in the Southwest and $15.51 for the Rockies.
Crude differentials compressed across heavy and sour slates during the first quarter. In the Canadian heavy market, first quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $12.69, well below the average differential we saw in the fourth quarter of $39.43. Recently, we have seen this differential trade into the $13 range as the Alberta government quota system has reduced the volume of crude output. Despite mandated quotas, the levels of apportionment on the Enbridge remain high. The forward market for WCS has been widening as the market foresees incremental crude to be produced as well as the impact of IMO 2020 later in the year. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged crude from Canada to meet our refining needs.
Canadian heavy and sour runs average 65,000 barrels per day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 171,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refining system composed of 106,000 barrels a day at the Navajo complex and 59,000 barrels per day delivered by the Centurion pipeline at the El Dorado refinery.
Midland differentials averaged in the first quarter at $2.57, and currently, we see the same differential trading at $4.16 below Cushing due to new pipeline capacity coming on later than originally expected. We anticipate this differential to remain wide into the summer months and then revert to tighter levels later in the year as additional pipeline capacity comes on stream.
First quarter consolidated refinery gross margin was $12.74 produced barrels sold, representing a 1% decrease compared to the $12.83 recorded in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was driven by compressed laid-in crude costs in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions, offset by stronger gasoline and diesel cracks in the Southwest. In the first quarter, our rent expense was $39 million.

A table of these items can be found in our press release. We anticipate realizing an additional $13 million to $18 million of Sonneborn-related integration costs throughout the remainder of 2019.
In the first quarter of 2019, cash flow from operations was $217 million, which includes turnaround spending of $79 million. HollyFrontier's stand-alone capital expenditures totaled $53 million for the quarter, and we also funded the Sonneborn acquisition with $663 million of cash on hand.
As of March 31, our total balance sheet -- cash balance stood at $496 million, which is in line with our target cash balance of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $1.8 billion. As of quarter-end, we had $1 billion of stand-alone debt outstanding and a debt-to-cap ratio of 14%.
During the first quarter, we returned a total of $135 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $57 million and the repurchase of approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock totaling $78 million.
HEP distributions received by HollyFrontier during the first quarter totaled $37 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HFC owns $59.6 million HEP Limited Partner units, representing 57% of HEP's LP units and a market value of $1.6 billion as of last night's close.
For the full year of 2019, we continue to expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both stand-alone capital and turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $40 million to $50 million at our Lubes and Specialty Products business and $30 million to $40 million of capital for HEP.
And with that, Tamia, we're ready to take questions."

Primarily, where we do business in the Delaware Basin, we see a lot more light crudes coming on stream and not as many of the sour crudes.

We believe the market bottoming here in the first half of '19 with supply additions peaking and the most notable of those being the ramp-up of Exxon's Group II plant in Rotterdam right now.
Specific to our business, we saw sequential improvement with the absence of a turnaround. This was somewhat hampered by weather-related maintenance we had at Mississauga, which has bled into the second quarter. So in general, we expect to see the continued slow improvement for the remainder of the year. But really, in the long run, what we expect to see is demand growth absorb these capacity additions similar to conditions you'd see in any cyclical business, frankly.
The secular trend remains at the higher-performance lubricants in all end markets and so we expect to see a Group III and higher-quality Group II base oils seek better margins in particular over the next few years."

And there's no question, there's weakness on the Rack Back side. Rich talked about the additional capacity coming on both in Rotterdam and in other regions of the world.
So there's 2 things happening there. It's obviously adding supply, but it's not just a matter of additional supply that needs to be absorbed. There's also substitution occurring between the various grades of lube oils. So most of these new plants are Group II in the market, as Rich said in his remarks, is trending towards higher-quality lubricants, which is Group II and Group III. And what we expect to happen as this supply comes on is the Group I, which is primarily the base oil that's used in Asia and to a certain extent, in Europe, that will be substituted by this increased supply of Group II. So there'll be a lot of substitution going on to absorb that capacity as well as continued growth overall for base oils in general.
And then there's the Rack Forward section of the business, which again that's where our primary focus is for growth, to continue on capitalizing on our technology and know-how within Sonneborn and PCLI to grow that business in downstream markets."

I think we would all agree that, that's probably on the high end of where it should be. As we all know, the Permian pipelines are coming soon at the end of this year to bring more barrels from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. We think that will put downward pressure on the Brent/WTI spread. But our view is it still should be in the $5 per barrel range plus or minus. The way that we typically look at that, we break it into 2 components. What's the Brent to WTI Houston differential going to be? That's been typically running in about the $2 per barrel range recently. I think, directionally, that will widen out as there's more barrels coming into Houston from the Permian. Those Permian barrels are going to have to find new and different markets than where it's currently going to absorb the additional supply that's hit in Houston. And then what's the Houston to Cushing differential going to be? I think that's going to be very much a function of transportation economics, which is going to be roughly in the $3 per barrel range. As those pipelines fill, it could be higher. If and when new capacity is added from the inland markets to the Gulf Coast, it could be lower. But bottom line is we expect long term for that differential to be about the $5 per barrel range."

Every dollar per barrel impact on the crack is going to be nominally $70 million per year to us. The most common number I've heard for the impact of IMO 2020 is probably in the $5 per barrel range. I've heard numbers as crazy as $20 per barrel. We tend to stick to the consensus type of number of $5. So you can go from there on that.
As far as acquisitions, that's difficult to impossible to call. As I said earlier, would love to continue to grow our company. We're not going to grow just for growth sake. It's got to be value-oriented. I mean, you've seen what we've done in the recent past. I think we're pretty proud of what we've done. I would probably predict that we won't be doing as many acquisitions going forward as we have the last 2.

And good morning, everyone. Today we reported first quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $253 million or $1.47 per diluted share.
Certain items detailed in our earnings release increased net income by $160 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $93 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $137 million or $0.77 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $282 million, $34 million less than the first quarter of 2018, principally driven by maintenance in our Refining and Marketing segment and weaker base oil margins in our Lubricants business, which were partially offset by stronger earnings at HEP and 2 months of contributions from our Sonneborn acquisition. 
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported adjusted EBITDA of $20 million despite a very challenging base oil market. Rack Forward adjusted EBITDA was $53 million for the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 12% of sales.
Our integration of Sonneborn is going well, and as of May 1, we have achieved run rate synergies of $7 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year.
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $94 million for the first quarter compared to $88 million in the first quarter of last year. Overall pipeline volumes increased 5% year-over-year driven by record volumes on our crude-gathering system of 157,000 barrels per day.
We also experienced strong third-party spot shipments on the UNEV Pipeline as the arbitrage between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas remained open during majority of the quarter.
During the quarter, we returned $135 million of cash to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. Our focus remains on improving reliability and, by extension, both unit and absolute costs across our refining system. With the rebound in the gasoline market and no major planned downtime until September, we believe we are well positioned for strong financial performance heading into the summer driving season.

For the first quarter of 2019, we ran 400,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 42% Permian and 20% WCS and black wax crude oil.

For the first quarter of 2019, we ran 400,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 42% Permian and 20% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $4.46 in the Rockies, $1.62 in the Mid-Con and $2.75 in the Southwest.
In the first quarter of 2019, we started the year with high gasoline inventories and low gasoline cracks on the product side and decreasing crude differentials on both Canadian and Permian crude oils. Over the course of the quarter, the markets have improved, and we are optimistic for the remainder of the year as product fundamentals continue improving and gasoline and distillate inventories remain at reduced levels. Gasoline inventories in the Magellan system started the year at 8.9 million barrels and ended the quarter at 7.7 million barrels. Current inventories of gasoline are roughly 1 million barrels lower at 6.7 million barrels, well below the 5-year average.
Diesel inventories were relatively static throughout the period. Days supply of gasoline and diesel in the group finished at 29 and 33 days, respectively. First quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $14.74, $19.15 in the Southwest and $15.51 for the Rockies.
Crude differentials compressed across heavy and sour slates during the first quarter. In the Canadian heavy market, first quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $12.69, well below the average differential we saw in the fourth quarter of $39.43. Recently, we have seen this differential trade into the $13 range as the Alberta government quota system has reduced the volume of crude output. Despite mandated quotas, the levels of apportionment on the Enbridge system remain high. The forward market for WCS has been widening as the market foresees incremental crude to be produced as well as the impact of IMO 2020 later in the year. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged crude from Canada to meet our refining needs.
Canadian heavy and sour runs average 65,000 barrels per day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 171,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refining system composed of 106,000 barrels a day at the Navajo complex and 59,000 barrels per day delivered by the Centurion pipeline at the El Dorado refinery.
Midland differentials averaged in the first quarter at $2.57, and currently, we see the same differential trading at $4.16 below Cushing due to new pipeline capacity coming on later than originally expected. We anticipate this differential to remain wide into the summer months and then revert to tighter levels later in the year as additional pipeline capacity comes on stream.
First quarter consolidated refinery gross margin was $12.74 produced barrels sold, representing a 1% decrease compared to the $12.83 recorded in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was driven by compressed laid-in crude costs in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions, offset by stronger gasoline and diesel cracks in the Southwest. In the first quarter, our rent expense was $39 million.

A table of these items can be found in our press release. We anticipate realizing an additional $13 million to $18 million of Sonneborn-related integration costs throughout the remainder of 2019.
In the first quarter of 2019, cash flow from operations was $217 million, which includes turnaround spending of $79 million. HollyFrontier's stand-alone capital expenditures totaled $53 million for the quarter, and we also funded the Sonneborn acquisition with $663 million of cash on hand.
As of March 31, our total balance sheet -- cash balance stood at $496 million, which is in line with our target cash balance of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $1.8 billion. As of quarter-end, we had $1 billion of stand-alone debt outstanding and a debt-to-cap ratio of 14%.
During the first quarter, we returned a total of $135 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $57 million and the repurchase of approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock totaling $78 million.
HEP distributions received by HollyFrontier during the first quarter totaled $37 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HFC owns $59.6 million HEP Limited Partner units, representing 57% of HEP's LP units and a market value of $1.6 billion as of last night's close.
For the full year of 2019, we continue to expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both stand-alone capital and turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $40 million to $50 million at our Lubes and Specialty Products business and $30 million to $40 million of capital for HEP.
And with that, Tamia, we're ready to take questions."

Primarily, where we do business in the Delaware Basin, we see a lot more light crudes coming on stream and not as many of the sour crudes.

We believe the market bottoming here in the first half of '19 with supply additions peaking and the most notable of those being a ramp-up of Exxon's Group II plant in Rotterdam right now.
Specific to our business, we saw sequential improvement with the absence of a turnaround. This was somewhat hampered by weather-related maintenance we had at Mississauga, which has bled into the second quarter. So in general, we expect to see the continued slow improvement for the remainder of the year. But really, in the long run, what we expect to see is demand growth absorb these capacity additions similar to conditions you'd see in any cyclical business, frankly.
The secular trend remains the higher-performance lubricants in all end markets, and so we expect to see Group III and higher-quality Group II base oils seek better margins in particular over the next few years."

And there's no question, there's weakness on the Rack Back side. Rich talked about the additional capacity coming on both in Rotterdam and in other regions of the world.
So there's 2 things happening there. It's obviously adding supply, but it's not just a matter of additional supply that needs to be absorbed. There's also substitution occurring between the various grades of lube oils. So most of these new plants are Group II in the market, as Rich said in his remarks, is trending towards higher-quality lubricants, which is Group II and Group III. And what we expect to happen as this supply comes on is that Group I, which is primarily the base oil that's used in Asia and to a certain extent in Europe, that will be substituted by this increased supply of Group II. So there'll be a lot of substitution going on to absorb that capacity as well as continued growth overall for base oils in general.
And then there's the Rack Forward section of the business, which again that's where our primary focus is for growth, to continue on capitalizing on our technology and know-how within Sonneborn and PCLI to grow that business in downstream markets."

I think we would all agree that that's probably on the high end of where it should be. As we all know, the Permian pipelines are coming soon at the end of this year to bring more barrels from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. We think that will put downward pressure on the Brent/WTI spread. But our view is it still should be in the $5 per barrel range plus or minus. The way that we typically look at that we break it into 2 components. What's the Brent to WTI Houston differential going to be? That's been typically running in about the $2 per barrel range recently. I think, directionally, that will widen out as there's more barrels coming into Houston from the Permian. Those Permian barrels are going to have to find new and different markets than where it's currently going to absorb the additional supply that's hitting Houston. And then what's the Houston to Cushing differential going to be? I think that's going to be very much a function of transportation economics, which is going to be roughly in the $3 per barrel range. As those pipelines fill, it could be higher. If and when new capacity is added from the inland markets to the Gulf Coast, it could be lower. But bottom line is we expect long term for that differential to be in about the $5 per barrel range."

Every dollar per barrel impact on the crack is going to be nominally $70 million per year to us. The most common number I've heard for the impact of IMO 2020 is probably in the $5 per barrel range. I've heard numbers as crazy as $20 per barrel. We tend to stick to the consensus type of number of $5. So you go from there on that.
As far as acquisitions, that's difficult to impossible to call. As I said earlier, we'd love to continue to grow our company. We're not going to grow just for growth sake. It's got to be value oriented. I mean, you've seen what we've done in the recent past. I think we're pretty proud of what we've done.

And good morning, everyone. Today we reported first quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $253 million or $1.47 per diluted share.
Certain items detailed in our earnings release increased net income by $160 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $93 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $137 million or $0.77 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $282 million, $34 million less than the first quarter of 2018, principally driven by maintenance in our Refining and Marketing segment and weaker base oil margins in our Lubricants business, which were partially offset by stronger earnings at HEP and 2 months of contributions from our Sonneborn acquisition. 
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported adjusted EBITDA of $20 million despite a very challenging base oil market. Rack Forward adjusted EBITDA was $53 million for the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 12% of sales.
Our integration of Sonneborn is going well, and as of May 1, we have achieved run rate synergies of $7 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year.
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $94 million for the first quarter compared to $88 million in the first quarter of last year. Overall pipeline volumes increased 5% year-over-year driven by record volumes on our crude-gathering system of 157,000 barrels per day.
We also experienced strong third-party spot shipments on the UNEV Pipeline as the arbitrage between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas remained open during majority of the quarter.
During the quarter, we returned $135 million of cash to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. Our focus remains on improving reliability and, by extension, both unit and absolute costs across our refining system. With the rebound in the gasoline market and no major planned downtime until September, we believe we are well positioned for strong financial performance heading into the summer driving season.

For the first quarter of 2019, we ran 400,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 42% Permian and 20% WCS and black wax crude oil.

For the first quarter of 2019, we ran 400,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 42% Permian and 20% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $4.46 in the Rockies, $1.62 in the Mid-Con and $2.75 in the Southwest.
In the first quarter of 2019, we started the year with high gasoline inventories and low gasoline cracks on the product side and decreasing crude differentials on both Canadian and Permian crude oils. Over the course of the quarter, the markets have improved, and we are optimistic for the remainder of the year as product fundamentals continue improving and gasoline and distillate inventories remain at reduced levels. Gasoline inventories in the Magellan system started the year at 8.9 million barrels and ended the quarter at 7.7 million barrels. Current inventories of gasoline are roughly 1 million barrels lower at 6.7 million barrels, well below the 5-year average.
Diesel inventories were relatively static throughout the period. Days supply of gasoline and diesel in the group finished at 29 and 33 days, respectively. First quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $14.74, $19.15 in the Southwest and $15.51 for the Rockies.
Crude differentials compressed across heavy and sour slates during the first quarter. In the Canadian heavy market, first quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $12.69, well below the average differential we saw in the fourth quarter of $39.43. Recently, we have seen this differential trade into the $13 range as the Alberta government quota system has reduced the volume of crude output. Despite mandated quotas, the levels of apportionment on the Enbridge system remain high. The forward market for WCS has been widening as the market foresees incremental crude to be produced as well as the impact of IMO 2020 later in the year. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged crude from Canada to meet our refining needs.
Canadian heavy and sour runs average 65,000 barrels per day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 171,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refining system composed of 106,000 barrels a day at the Navajo complex and 59,000 barrels per day delivered by the Centurion pipeline at the El Dorado refinery.
Midland differentials averaged in the first quarter at $2.57, and currently, we see the same differential trading at $4.16 below Cushing due to new pipeline capacity coming on later than originally expected. We anticipate this differential to remain wide into the summer months and then revert to tighter levels later in the year as additional pipeline capacity comes on stream.
First quarter consolidated refinery gross margin was $12.74 produced barrels sold, representing a 1% decrease compared to the $12.83 recorded in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was driven by compressed laid-in crude costs in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions, offset by stronger gasoline and diesel cracks in the Southwest.

As George mentioned, the first quarter included a few unusual items. Pretax earnings were positively impacted by a $232 million lower of cost-to-market benefit, which was partially offset by Sonneborn acquisition costs of $13 million and a onetime inventory valuation step-up of $9 million. A table of these items can be found in our press release. We anticipate realizing an additional $13 million to $18 million of Sonneborn-related integration costs throughout the remainder of 2019.
In the first quarter of 2019, cash flow from operations was $217 million, which includes turnaround spending of $79 million. HollyFrontier's stand-alone capital expenditures totaled $53 million for the quarter, and we also funded the Sonneborn acquisition with $663 million of cash on hand.
As of March 31, our total balance sheet -- cash balance stood at $496 million, which is in line with our target cash balance of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $1.8 billion. As of quarter-end, we had $1 billion of stand-alone debt outstanding and a debt-to-cap ratio of 14%.
During the first quarter, we returned a total of $135 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $57 million and the repurchase of approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock totaling $78 million.
HEP distributions received by HollyFrontier during the first quarter totaled $37 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HFC owns $59.6 million HEP Limited Partner units, representing 57% of HEP's LP units and a market value of $1.6 billion as of last night's close.
For the full year of 2019, we continue to expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both stand-alone capital and turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $40 million to $50 million at our Lubes and Specialty Products business and $30 million to $40 million of capital for HEP.
And with that, Tamia, we're ready to take questions."

Primarily, where we do business in the Delaware Basin, we see a lot more light crudes coming on stream and not as many of the sour crudes.

We believe the market bottoming here in the first half of '19 with supply additions peaking and the most notable of those being a ramp-up of Exxon's Group II plant in Rotterdam right now.
Specific to our business, we saw sequential improvement with the absence of a turnaround. This was somewhat hampered by weather-related maintenance we had at Mississauga, which has bled into the second quarter. So in general, we expect to see the continued slow improvement for the remainder of the year. But really, in the long run, what we expect to see is demand growth absorb these capacity additions similar to conditions you'd see in any cyclical business, frankly.

And there's no question, there's weakness on the Rack Back side. Rich talked about the additional capacity coming on both in Rotterdam and in other regions of the world.
So there's 2 things happening there. It's obviously adding supply, but it's not just a matter of additional supply that needs to be absorbed. There's also substitution occurring between the various grades of lube oils. So most of these new plants are Group II in the market, as Rich said in his remarks, is trending towards higher-quality lubricants, which is Group II and Group III. And what we expect to happen as this supply comes on is that Group I, which is primarily the base oil that's used in Asia and to a certain extent in Europe, that will be substituted by this increased supply of Group II. So there'll be a lot of substitution going on to absorb that capacity as well as continued growth overall for base oils in general.
And then there's the Rack Forward section of the business, which again that's where our primary focus is for growth, to continue on capitalizing on our technology and know-how within Sonneborn and PCLI to grow that business in downstream markets."

I think we would all agree that that's probably on the high end of where it should be. As we all know, the Permian pipelines are coming soon at the end of this year to bring more barrels from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. We think that will put downward pressure on the Brent/WTI spread. But our view is it still should be in the $5 per barrel range plus or minus. The way that we typically look at that we break it into 2 components. What's the Brent to WTI Houston differential going to be? That's been typically running in about the $2 per barrel range recently. I think, directionally, that will widen out as there's more barrels coming into Houston from the Permian. Those Permian barrels are going to have to find new and different markets than where it's currently going to absorb the additional supply that's hitting Houston. And then what's the Houston to Cushing differential going to be? I think that's going to be very much a function of transportation economics, which is going to be roughly in the $3 per barrel range. As those pipelines fill, it could be higher. If and when new capacity is added from the inland markets to the Gulf Coast, it could be lower. But bottom line is we expect long term for that differential to be in about the $5 per barrel range."

Every dollar per barrel impact on the crack is going to be nominally $70 million per year to us. The most common number I've heard for the impact of IMO 2020 is probably in the $5 per barrel range. I've heard numbers as crazy as $20 per barrel. We tend to stick to the consensus type of number of $5. So you go from there on that.
As far as acquisitions, that's difficult to impossible to call. As I said earlier, we'd love to continue to grow our company. We're not going to grow just for growth sake. It's got to be value oriented. I mean, you've seen what we've done in the recent past. I think we're pretty proud of what we've done.

And good morning, everyone. Today we reported first quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $253 million or $1.47 per diluted share.
Certain items detailed in our earnings release increased net income by $160 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $93 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $137 million or $0.77 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $282 million, $34 million less than the first quarter of 2018, principally driven by maintenance in our Refining and Marketing segment and weaker base oil margins in our Lubricants business, which were partially offset by stronger earnings at HEP and 2 months of contributions from our Sonneborn acquisition. 
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported adjusted EBITDA of $20 million despite a very challenging base oil market. Rack Forward adjusted EBITDA was $53 million for the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 12% of sales.
Our integration of Sonneborn is going well, and as of May 1, we have achieved run rate synergies of $7 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year.
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $94 million for the first quarter compared to $88 million in the first quarter of last year. Overall pipeline volumes increased 5% year-over-year driven by record volumes on our crude-gathering system of 157,000 barrels per day.
We also experienced strong third-party spot shipments on the UNEV Pipeline as the arbitrage between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas remained open during majority of the quarter.
During the quarter, we returned $135 million of cash to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. Our focus remains on improving reliability and, by extension, both unit and absolute costs across our refining system. With the rebound in the gasoline market and no major planned downtime until September, we believe we are well positioned for strong financial performance heading into the summer driving season.

For the first quarter of 2019, we ran 400,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 42% Permian and 20% WCS and black wax crude oil.

For the first quarter of 2019, we ran 400,000 barrels of crude oil composed of 42% Permian and 20% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $4.46 in the Rockies, $1.62 in the Mid-Con and $2.75 in the Southwest.
In the first quarter of 2019, we started the year with high gasoline inventories and low gasoline cracks on the product side and decreasing crude differentials on both Canadian and Permian crude oils. Over the course of the quarter, the markets have improved, and we are optimistic for the remainder of the year as product fundamentals continue improving and gasoline and distillate inventories remain at reduced levels. Gasoline inventories in the Magellan system started the year at 8.9 million barrels and ended the quarter at 7.7 million barrels. Current inventories of gasoline are roughly 1 million barrels lower at 6.7 million barrels, well below the 5-year average.
Diesel inventories were relatively static throughout the period. Days supply of gasoline and diesel in the group finished at 29 and 33 days, respectively. First quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $14.74, $19.15 in the Southwest and $15.51 for the Rockies.
Crude differentials compressed across heavy and sour slates during the first quarter. In the Canadian heavy market, first quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $12.69, well below the average differential we saw in the fourth quarter of $39.43. Recently, we have seen this differential trade into the $13 range as the Alberta government quota system has reduced the volume of crude output. Despite mandated quotas, the levels of apportionment on the Enbridge system remain high. The forward market for WCS has been widening as the market foresees incremental crude to be produced as well as the impact of IMO 2020 later in the year. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged crude from Canada to meet our refining needs.
Canadian heavy and sour runs average 65,000 barrels per day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 171,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refining system composed of 106,000 barrels a day at the Navajo complex and 59,000 barrels per day delivered by the Centurion pipeline at the El Dorado refinery.
Midland differentials averaged in the first quarter at $2.57, and currently, we see the same differential trading at $4.16 below Cushing due to new pipeline capacity coming on later than originally expected. We anticipate this differential to remain wide into the summer months and then revert to tighter levels later in the year as additional pipeline capacity comes on stream.
First quarter consolidated refinery gross margin was $12.74 produced barrels sold, representing a 1% decrease compared to the $12.83 recorded in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was driven by compressed laid-in crude costs in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions, offset by stronger gasoline and diesel cracks in the Southwest. In the first quarter, our rent expense was $39 million.
And with that, I'm going to send it over to Rich."

As George mentioned, the first quarter included a few unusual items. Pretax earnings were positively impacted by a $232 million lower of cost-to-market benefit, which was partially offset by Sonneborn acquisition costs of $13 million and a onetime inventory valuation step-up of $9 million. A table of these items can be found in our press release. We anticipate realizing an additional $13 million to $18 million of Sonneborn-related integration costs throughout the remainder of 2019.
In the first quarter of 2019, cash flow from operations was $217 million, which includes turnaround spending of $79 million. HollyFrontier's stand-alone capital expenditures totaled $53 million for the quarter, and we also funded the Sonneborn acquisition with $663 million of cash on hand.
As of March 31, our total balance sheet -- cash balance stood at $496 million, which is in line with our target cash balance of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $1.8 billion. As of quarter-end, we had $1 billion of stand-alone debt outstanding and a debt-to-cap ratio of 14%.
During the first quarter, we returned a total of $135 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $57 million and the repurchase of approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock totaling $78 million.
HEP distributions received by HollyFrontier during the first quarter totaled $37 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HFC owns $59.6 million HEP Limited Partner units, representing 57% of HEP's LP units and a market value of $1.6 billion as of last night's close.
For the full year of 2019, we continue to expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both stand-alone capital and turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $40 million to $50 million at our Lubes and Specialty Products business and $30 million to $40 million of capital for HEP.
And with that, Tamia, we're ready to take questions."

Primarily, where we do business in the Delaware Basin, we see a lot more light crudes coming on stream and not as many of the sour crudes.

Specific to our business, we saw sequential improvement with the absence of a turnaround. This was somewhat hampered by weather-related maintenance we had at Mississauga, which has bled into the second quarter. So in general, we expect to see the continued slow improvement for the remainder of the year. But really, in the long run, what we expect to see is demand growth absorb these capacity additions similar to conditions you'd see in any cyclical business, frankly.

And there's no question, there's weakness on the Rack Back side. Rich talked about the additional capacity coming on both in Rotterdam and in other regions of the world.
So there's 2 things happening there. It's obviously adding supply, but it's not just a matter of additional supply that needs to be absorbed. There's also substitution occurring between the various grades of lube oils. So most of these new plants are Group II in the market, as Rich said in his remarks, is trending towards higher-quality lubricants, which is Group II and Group III. And what we expect to happen as this supply comes on is that Group I, which is primarily the base oil that's used in Asia and to a certain extent in Europe, that will be substituted by this increased supply of Group II. So there'll be a lot of substitution going on to absorb that capacity as well as continued growth overall for base oils in general.
And then there's the Rack Forward section of the business, which again that's where our primary focus is for growth, to continue on capitalizing on our technology and know-how within Sonneborn and PCLI to grow that business in downstream markets."

I think we would all agree that that's probably on the high end of where it should be. As we all know, the Permian pipelines are coming soon at the end of this year to bring more barrels from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. We think that will put downward pressure on the Brent/WTI spread. But our view is it still should be in the $5 per barrel range plus or minus. The way that we typically look at that we break it into 2 components. What's the Brent to WTI Houston differential going to be? That's been typically running in about the $2 per barrel range recently. I think, directionally, that will widen out as there's more barrels coming into Houston from the Permian. Those Permian barrels are going to have to find new and different markets than where it's currently going to absorb the additional supply that's hitting Houston. And then what's the Houston to Cushing differential going to be? I think that's going to be very much a function of transportation economics, which is going to be roughly in the $3 per barrel range. As those pipelines fill, it could be higher. If and when new capacity is added from the inland markets to the Gulf Coast, it could be lower. But bottom line is we expect long term for that differential to be in about the $5 per barrel range."

Every dollar per barrel impact on the crack is going to be nominally $70 million per year to us. The most common number I've heard for the impact of IMO 2020 is probably in the $5 per barrel range. I've heard numbers as crazy as $20 per barrel. We tend to stick to the consensus type of number of $5. So you go from there on that.
As far as acquisitions, that's difficult to impossible to call. As I said earlier, we'd love to continue to grow our company. We're not going to grow just for growth sake. It's got to be value oriented. I mean, you've seen what we've done in the recent past. I think we're pretty proud of what we've done.

Today, we reported second quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $197 million or $1.15 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $175 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $372 million or $2.18 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $259 million or $1.45 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $647 million, an increase of $162 million compared to the second quarter 2018. This increase was principally driven by strong gasoline and diesel margins across our company, along with our first full quarter contribution from Sonneborn. 
The Refining and Marketing segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of $556 million compared to $385 million for the second quarter of 2018. Strong product margins in all of our regions resulted in a consolidated refinery gross margin of $19.64 per produced barrel, and 19% increase compared to the $16.57 for the same period last year. 
Our Lubricants Specialty Products business reported adjusted EBITDA of $29 million despite weakness in the base oil market. Rack Forward adjusted EBITDA was $64 million for the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 13% of sales. The strength in Rack Forward earnings was driven by improved finished product margins. 
Our integration of Sonneborn is progressing well. And as of July 30, we have achieved run rate synergies of $9 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year. 
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $89 million for the second quarter compared to $82 million in the second quarter of last year. Higher crude oil pipeline volumes around the Permian Basin and our crude pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah contributed to a 10% increase in volumes year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we returned $246 million of cash to shareholders through our regular dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking forward, we will continue our focus on improving reliability across our refining system and successfully integrating Sonneborn, further strengthening our earnings profile. With no major planned downtime until September, our refineries are well positioned first strong operational and financial performance in the third quarter.

Current inventories of grew 3 gasoline remained relatively static at 6.7 million barrels. This is in keeping with the 5 year average volume. Group III diesel inventories rose by 1.1 million barrels throughout the period to finish at 8.1 million barrels. 
Second quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $19.99, $31.30 in the Southwest and $32.19 in the Rockies. In our Southwest and Rocky regions, we saw higher margins as refinery operation issues on the West Coast affected markets in both Phoenix and Las Vegas. 
Crude differentials compressed across the heavy and sour slates during the second quarter. In the Canadian heavy market, second quarter crude differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $11.13, slightly below first quarter levels. 
[indiscernible] In the Enbridge system remain high at 40% despite the continuation of production cutbacks by the Alberta government. The former market for WCS remains wide there as the market is incremental crude production, coupled with received positive impact from IMO 2020. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price advantaged heavy crude oil from Canada to meet our Refining needs. Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 76,000 barrels a day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 160,000 barrels per day of Permian crude in our refining system composed of 100,000 barrels per day at the Navajo complex and 60,000 barrels per day delivered by the Centurion pipeline to our refinery at El Dorado. 
Midland differentials averaged the quarter at $2.13 under WTI. And currently, we see the same differential trading at around $0.70 below Cushing, as new pipeline capacity is expected to come onstream. 
We anticipate for the remainder of this year the differential to narrow as additional pipeline comes on. Our [indiscernible] expense for the quarter was $31 million, a $25 million degrees versus the $56 million in the same period last year. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rich. ."

As George mentioned, the second quarter included a few unusual items. Pretax earnings were negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment of $153 million, the lower cost of market charge of forth $8 million and Sonneborn integration costs of $4 million. The table of these items can be found in our press release. 
For the second quarter, cash flow from operations was $753 million, including turnaround spending of $31 million. HollyFrontier's stand-alone capital expenditures totaled $50 million in the quarter, producing free cash flow of $696 million. 
The second quarter strong free cash flow allowed us to return a total of $246 million of cash to shareholder comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $57 million as well as the repurchase of approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock totaling $189 million. And as of June 30, we had approximately $509 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Over the past 12 months, we're continuing to invest across our 3 business. HollyFrontier's returned over $800 million of cash to shareholders through both with dividends and share repurchase, representing a cash yield of 10%. 
At the end of the second quarter, our total cash balance stood at $915 million, which is above our targeted cash balance of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $2.3 billion. 
As of quarter end, we had $1 billion of stand-alone debt and a debt-to-capital ratio of 14%. 
Total HEP debt distributions received by HFC in the second quarter were $37 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HollyFrontier owns $59.06 million HEP limited partner units, representing 57% of HEP's LP units with a market value of $1.07 billion as of last night's close. 
A few guidance items for 2019. We continue to expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million for both stand-alone capital and turnarounds in our Refining and Marketing business; $40 million to $50 million at HollyFrontier Lubes and Specialties; and $30 million to $40 million of capital at HEP. 
We anticipate an elevated cash balance through the third quarter ahead of planned maintenance at both our El Dorado and Cheyenne refineries into the fourth quarter. 
In our Lubes and Specialty Products business, due to both, the continuing sales impacts on the flooding-related shutdown at our Tulsa facility as well as previously unplanned maintenance at Tulsa lube extraction unit in October, we're revising our annual Rack Forward guidance to $240 million to $260 million. We continue to expect $25 million to $30 million of Sonneborn integrate costs, implying another $9 million to $14 million, which will stretch into 2020. 
In the second quarter, due to the goodwill asset impairment, our effective tax rate was slightly elevated to 29%. Based on this, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to land at 25% to 27% and to revert back to normalized levels of 24% to 26% in 2020. 
And with that, Stacy, we're ready to take questions."

Today, we reported second quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders $197 million or $1.15 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $175 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $372 million or $2.18 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $259 million or $1.45 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $647 million, an increase of $162 million compared to the second quarter 2018. This increase was principally driven by strong gasoline and diesel margins across our company along with our first full quarter contribution from Sonneborn. 
The Refining and Marketing segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of $556 million compared to $385 million for the second quarter of 2018. Strong product margins in all of our regions resulted in a consolidated refinery gross margin of $19.64 per produced barrel, a 19% increase compared to the $16.57 for the same period last year. 
Our Lubricants Specialty Products business reported adjusted EBITDA of $29 million despite weakness in the base oil market. Rack Forward adjusted EBITDA was $64 million for the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 13% of sales. The strength in Rack Forward earnings was driven by improved finished product margins. 
Our integration of Sonneborn is progressing well. And as of July 30, we have achieved run rate synergies of $9 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year. 
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $89 million for the second quarter compared to $82 million in the second quarter of last year. Higher crude oil pipeline volumes around the Permian Basin and our crude pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah contributed to a 10% increase in volumes year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we returned $246 million of cash to shareholders through our regular dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking forward, we will continue our focus on improving reliability across our refining system and successfully integrating Sonneborn, further strengthening our earnings profile. With no major planned downtime until September, our refineries are well positioned for strong operational and financial performance in the third quarter.

Second quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $19.99, $31.30 in the Southwest and $32.19 in the Rockies. In our Southwest and Rocky regions, we saw higher margins as refinery operation issues on the West Coast affected markets in both Phoenix and Las Vegas.
Crude differentials compressed across the heavy and sour slates during the second quarter. In the Canadian heavy market, second quarter crude differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $11.13, slightly below first quarter levels. Apportionment on the Enbridge system remained high at 40% despite the continuation of production cutbacks by the Alberta government. The forward market for WCS remains wider, as the market foresees incremental crude production coupled with perceived positive impact from IMO 2020. We continue to be able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged heavy crude oil from Canada to meet our refining needs. Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 76,000 barrels a day at our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 160,000 barrels per day of Permian crude in our refining system, composed of 100,000 barrels per day at the Navajo complex and 60,000 barrels per day delivered by the Centurion pipeline to our refinery at El Dorado.
Midland differentials averaged the quarter at $2.13 under WTI. And currently, we see the same differential trading at around $0.70 below Cushing, as new pipeline capacity is expected to come onstream. We anticipate for the remainder of this year the differential to narrow as additional pipeline comes on.
Our rent expense for the quarter was $31 million, a $25 million decrease versus the $56 million in the same period last year.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Rich."

As George mentioned, the second quarter included a few unusual items. Pretax earnings were negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment of $153 million, a lower of cost or market charge of $48 million and Sonneborn integration costs of $4 million. A table of these items can be found in our press release.
For the second quarter, cash flow from operations was $753 million, including turnaround spending of $31 million. HollyFrontier's stand-alone capital expenditures totaled $50 million in the quarter, producing free cash flow of $696 million.
The second quarter free -- strong free cash flow allowed us to return a total of $246 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $57 million as well as the repurchase of approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock totaling $189 million. And as of June 30, we had approximately $509 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Over the past 12 months, while continuing to invest across our 3 businesses, HollyFrontier has returned over $800 million of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase, representing a cash yield of 10%.
At the end of the second quarter, our total cash balance stood at $915 million, which is above our target cash balance of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $2.3 billion.
As of quarter end, we had $1 billion of stand-alone debt and a debt-to-capital ratio of 14%.
Total HEP distributions received by HFC in the second quarter were $37 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million HEP limited partner units, representing 57% of HEP's LP units with a market value of $1.7 billion as of last night's close.
A few guidance items for 2019. We continue to expect to spend between $470 million and $510 million of both stand-alone capital and turnarounds in our Refining and Marketing business, $40 million to $50 million at HollyFrontier lubes and specialties and $30 million to $40 million of capital at HEP. We anticipate an elevated cash balance through the third quarter ahead of planned maintenance at both our El Dorado and Cheyenne refineries into the fourth quarter. In our Lubes and Specialty Products business, due to both the continuing sales impacts of the flooding-related shutdown at our Tulsa facility as well as previously unplanned maintenance at Tulsa's lube extraction unit in October, we're revising our annual Rack Forward guidance to $240 million to $260 million. We continue to expect $25 million to $30 million of Sonneborn integrate costs, implying another $9 million to $14 million which will stretch into 2020.
In the second quarter, due to the goodwill asset impairment, our effective tax rate was slightly elevated to 29%. Based on this, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to land at 25% to 27% and to revert back to normalized levels of 24% to 26% in 2020.
And with that, Stacy, we're ready to take questions."

Today, we reported second quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $197 million or $1.15 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $175 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $372 million or $2.18 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $259 million or $1.45 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $647 million, an increase of $162 million compared to the second quarter of 2018. This increase was principally driven by strong gasoline and diesel margins across our company, along with our first full quarter contribution from Sonneborn.
The Refining and Marketing segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $556 million compared to $385 million for the second quarter of 2018. Strong product margins in all of our regions resulted in consolidated refinery gross margin of $19.64 per produced barrel, a 19% increase compared to the $16.57 for the same period last year.
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported adjusted EBITDA of $29 million despite weakness in the base oil market. Rack Forward adjusted EBITDA was $64 million for the quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was 13% of sales. The strength in Rack Forward earnings was driven by improved finished product margins. Our integration of Sonneborn is progressing well. And as of July 30, we have achieved run rate synergies of $9 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year.
Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $89 million for the second quarter compared to $82 million in the second quarter of last year. Higher crude oil pipeline volumes around the Permian Basin and our crude pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah contributed to a 10% increase in volumes year-over-year.
During the quarter, we returned $246 million of cash to shareholders through our regular dividends and share repurchases.
Looking forward, we will continue our focus on improving reliability across our refining system and successfully integrating Sonneborn, further strengthening our earnings profile. With no major planned downtime until September, our refineries are well positioned for strong operational and financial performance in the third quarter.

Today we reported third quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $262 million, or $1.58 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $16 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $278 million, or $1.68 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $351 million or $1.98 per diluted share for the same period last year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $523 million, a decrease of $90 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. This decrease was principally driven by lower product margins and weaker laid-in crude advantage across our refining system. 
The Refining and Marketing segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $425 million compared to $507 million for the third quarter of last year. Consolidated refinery gross margin was $17.23 per produced barrel, an 11% decrease compared to the $19.41 for the same period last year. We set a new quarterly crude charge record averaging over 476,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. 
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported EBITDA of $38 million compared to $42 million in the prior year despite improvements in the base oil market. Rack Forward EBITDA was $51 million for the quarter and EBITDA margin was 11% of sales. Weakness in Rack Forward earnings was driven by unfavorable sales mix and the impact of macroeconomic headwinds and end markets. 
With respect to our acquisition, as of September 30, we have achieved run rate synergies of $10 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year. [ Holly Energy Partners ] reported adjusted EBITDA of $90 million for the third quarter compared to $87 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven by the strong third-party volumes and higher spot revenues on our crude oil pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah, which contributed to a 10% increase in volumes year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we returned approximately $260 million of cash to shareholders through our regular dividends and share repurchases, highlighting our continued commitment of returning excess cash to shareholders. 
For the remainder of 2019, we are focused on completing the turnaround work at our Cheyenne, El Dorado and Woods Cross facilities and expect to return to normal operations later this quarter. We are pleased with the current strength and product margins across our refining system and look forward to a strong finish to the year. 
Looking at the 2020, our outlook remains positive and believe IMO implementation will provide uplift to diesel margins and further discounts to heavy crude barrels. With a light turnaround schedule next year, we are well positioned to take advantage of strong product margins and improving crude discounts across our refining system.

In the Southwest, we ran 107,000 barrels per day of crude. Our operating expense per throughput barrel was $5.23, an increase of $0.54 versus in the third quarter of last year.

Group III diesel inventories dropped by 800,000 over the quarter to finish up at 7.6 million barrels. Current distillate or diesel inventories are at 6.1 million barrels. 
Third quarter 321 cracks in the Mid-Con were $17.29, $26.78 in the Southwest, and $26.85 in the Rockies. In our Southwest and Rockies regions, we continue to see higher margins as refinery operations on the West Coast and their problems have affected the markets in Phoenix and Las Vegas. 
In the Mid-Continent, gasoline cracks are trading lower as forward refinery maintenance ends, along with weaker seasonal demand. Diesel cracks remain higher however as harvesting has been delayed due to inclement weather. 
Crude differentials widened across the heavy barrel and narrowed on [indiscernible] stream in the third quarter. 
In the Canadian heavy market, third quarter differentials for WCS and [indiscernible] averaged $12.24 per barrel, slightly higher than second quarter levels. Both the current and the forward market for WCS remains even wider with differentials in the $17 range as the market perceived incremental crude production, coupled with the perceived positive impact of IMO 2020. 
Apportionment on the amperage systems remains high at 44% despite the continuation of production curtailments by the Alberta government. We, however, continue to be able to -- are able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price advantage heavy crude oil to meet our refining needs. 
Canadian heavy and sour rams averaged 72,000 barrels per day in our plants in the Mid-Continent Rocky regions. We refined approximately 153,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refinery system, composed of 107,000 barrels per day at the facility and 46,000 barrels per day at our El Dorado Refinery, delivered by the Centurion pipeline. 
Midland sour differentials averaged the third quarter of $0.50 below WTI and currently receive the same differential trading at $0.20 above Cushing, as new pipeline capacities come onstream. We anticipate this differential to narrow through the balance of the year as additional pipes come online. 
Our rent expense for the quarter was $8 million, which includes $37 million in small refinery exemption labors we received from the 2018 year at our Woods Cross and refineries. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Rich."

As George mentioned, the third quarter included a few unusual items. Pretax earnings were negatively impacted by a lower of cost to market charge of $34 million, and integration costs of $4 million, which were offset by a $37 million reduction in the cost of rims as a result of a small refinery redemptions into our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries for the 2018 calendar year. Table of these items can be found in our press release. 
For the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $441 million including turnaround spending of $42 million. HollyFrontier's consolidated capital expenditures were $68 million for the quarter, producing free cash flow of $373 million. 
The third quarter's strong free cash flow allowed us to return a total of $260 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend, totaling $55 million, and the repurchase of approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock totaling $205 million. As of September 30, we have approximately $320 million remaining on our share repurchase program. HollyFrontier has returned over $880 million of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over the past 12 months, representing a cash yield of 9%.
At the end of the third quarter, and with an eye towards substantial planned maintenance in the fourth quarter, our total cash balance stood at $982 million above our target of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility puts our total liquidity at over $2.3 billion. As of quarter end, we had $1 billion of standalone debt and the debt to cap ratio of 14%. 
Total ATP distributions received by HFC during the second quarter were $38 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million AGP limited partnering units, representing 57% of AGP's float with the market value of $1.4 billion as of last night's close. 
For the full year of 2019, we increased our capital spending guidance driven by higher turnaround scope and cost. We now expect to spend between $550 million and $590 million for both standalone capital and turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $45 million to $50 million and HollyFrontier loops and specialties, and $34 million to $40 million of capital for each EP. 
And with that, Cheryl, we are ready to take questions."

And when we look at the forward curves, we see it staying at those levels, if not increasing, through the year 2020. 
We truly believe that some [indiscernible] basis on the incremental rail rates. As you know, the Canadian or the Alberta government has said that if you move it by rail, you can move over and above the Fortis system. So that barrel is the last barrel being moved, so it does tend to set the market price and as we all know, rail is a lot more expensive than pipeline economics. 
Our volumes that we're able to run, that depends on prices and what our LT models are saying. Typically, we're somewhere between through the whole refining network 60,000 to 100,000 barrels a day, if not more, depending on the market conditions."

178254,635857739,1847102,"HollyFrontier Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2019",2019-10-31,"Earnings Calls","HF Sinclair Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $262 million or $1.58 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $16 mil",474,"Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $262 million or $1.58 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $16 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $278 million or $1.68 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $351 million or $1.98 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $523 million, a decrease of $90 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. This decrease was principally driven by lower product margins and weaker laid-in crude advantage across our refining system.
The Refining and Marketing segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $425 million compared to $507 million for the third quarter of last year. Consolidated refinery gross margin was $17.23 per produced barrel, an 11% decrease compared to the $19.41 for the same period last year. We set a new quarterly crude charge record averaging over 476,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported EBITDA of $38 million compared to $42 million in the prior year despite improvements in the base oil market. Rack Forward EBITDA was $51 million for the quarter, and EBITDA margin was 11% of sales. Weakness in Rack Forward earnings was driven by unfavorable sales mix and the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on end markets.
With respect to our Sonneborn acquisition, as of September 30, we have achieved run rate synergies of $10 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year. Holly Energy Partners reported adjusted EBITDA of $90 million for the third quarter compared to $87 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven by the strong third-party volumes and higher spot revenues on our crude oil pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah, which contributed to a 10% increase in volumes year-over-year.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $260 million of cash to shareholders through our regular dividends and share repurchases, highlighting our continued commitment of returning excess cash to shareholders.
For the remainder of 2019, we are focused on completing the turnaround work at our Cheyenne, El Dorado and Woods Cross facilities and expect to return to normal operations later this quarter. We are pleased with the current strength and product margins across our refining system and look forward to a strong finish to the year.
Looking into 2020, our outlook remains positive and believe IMO implementation will provide uplift to diesel margins and further discounts to heavy crude barrels. With a light turnaround schedule next year, we are well positioned to take advantage of strong product margins and improving crude discounts across our refining system.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on our operations."

For the third quarter, our crude throughput of 476,000 barrels per day was our highest ever recorded quarterly crude throughput across our refining system. For the third quarter, our consolidated operating cost of $5.94 per throughput barrel was $0.11 lower versus the same period last year on higher consolidated throughputs.
In the Mid-Con, we ran 294,000 barrels per day of crude. OpEx per throughput barrel was $4.77, a decrease of $0.30 versus the same period last year.
Our El Dorado Refinery set a new quarterly crude charge rate record during the third quarter averaging 160,000 barrels per day.
In the Southwest, we ran 107,000 barrels per day of crude. Our operating expense per throughput barrel was $5.23, an increase of $0.54 versus in the third quarter of last year. This was mainly due to higher-than-normal operating cost associated with the mechanical problem that we had with our reforming unit, which we repaired this month in October.
In the Rockies, we ran 75,000 barrels per day of crude. Our operating expense was $11.34 per throughput barrel, a $0.38 decrease over the same period last year.
As George mentioned, due to our significant planned maintenance, we expect to run 38 -- 380,000 barrels to 390,000 barrels per day of crude in the fourth quarter. We are currently ramping up the scheduled turnaround at our Cheyenne refinery. The ongoing turnarounds at our El Dorado and Woods Cross refineries are expected to be completed on schedule and return to normal operating rates in the second half of the fourth quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Tom for an update on our commercial operations."

For the third quarter of 2019, we ran 476,000 barrels of crude oil, which was composed of 32% Permian and 18% WCS and black wax crude oil.

For the third quarter of 2019, we ran 476,000 barrels of crude oil, which was composed of 32% Permian and 18% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $1.95 in the Rockies and $0.08 in the Mid-Con and over WTI by $0.43 in the Southwest.
In the third quarter of 2019, gasoline inventories in the Magellan system started the quarter at 7.1 million barrels and ended the quarter at 6.6 million barrels. Current inventories are slightly lower at 6.2 million barrels to date. Group III diesel inventories dropped by 800,000 over the quarter to finish up at 7.6 million barrels. Current distillate or diesel inventories are at 6.1 million barrels.
Third quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $17.29, $26.78 in the Southwest and $26.85 in the Rockies. In our Southwest and Rockies regions, we continued to see higher margins as refinery operations on the West Coast and their problems have affected the markets in Phoenix and Las Vegas.
In the Mid-Continent, gasoline cracks are trading lower as fall refinery maintenance ends, along with weaker seasonal demand. Diesel cracks remain high, however, as harvesting has been delayed due to inclement weather.
Crude differentials widened across the heavy barrel and narrowed on the sour slates during the third quarter.
In the Canadian heavy market, third quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $12.24 per barrel, slightly higher than second quarter levels. Both the current and the forward market for WCS remains even wider with differentials in the $17 range as the market perceives incremental crude production, coupled with the perceived positive impact of IMO 2020.
Apportionment on the Enbridge system remains high at 44% despite the continuation of production curtailments by the Alberta government. We, however, continue to be able to -- are able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged heavy crude oil to meet our refining needs.
Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 72,000 barrels per day in our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 153,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refinery system composed of 107,000 barrels per day at the Navajo facility and 46,000 barrels per day at our El Dorado Refinery, delivered by the Centurion pipeline.
Midland sour differentials averaged the third quarter of $0.50 below WTI. And currently, we see the same differential trading at $0.20 above Cushing, as new pipeline capacities come onstream. We anticipate this differential to narrow through the balance of the year as additional pipes come online.
Our rent expense for the quarter was $8 million, which includes $37 million in small refinery exemption labors we received from the 2018 year at our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Rich."

As George mentioned, the third quarter included a few unusual items. Pretax earnings were negatively impacted by a lower of cost or market charge of $34 million and Sonneborn integration costs of $4 million, which were offset by a $37 million reduction in the cost of RINs as a result of a small refinery exemptions granted to our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries for the 2018 calendar year. A table of these items can be found in our press release.
For the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $441 million, including turnaround spending of $42 million. HollyFrontier's consolidated capital expenditures were $68 million for the quarter, producing free cash flow of $373 million.
The third quarter's strong free cash flow allowed us to return a total of $260 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $55 million and the repurchase of approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock totaling $205 million. As of September 30, we have approximately $320 million remaining on our share repurchase program. HollyFrontier has returned over $880 million of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over the past 12 months, representing a cash yield of 9%.
At the end of the third quarter and with an eye towards substantial planned maintenance in the fourth quarter, our total cash balance stood at $982 million, above our target of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $2.3 billion. As of quarter end, we have $1 billion of stand-alone debt and a debt-to-cap ratio of 14%.
Total ATP distributions received by HFC during the second quarter were $38 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million HEP limited partnering units, representing 57% of HEP's float with a market value of $1.4 billion as of last night's close.
For the full year of 2019, we have increased our capital spending guidance driven by higher turnaround scope and cost. We now expect to spend between $550 million and $590 million for both stand-alone capital and turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $45 million to $50 million in HollyFrontier loops and specialties and $34 million to $40 million of capital for HEP.
And with that, Cheryl, we are ready to take questions."

Second issue we'd point out is, as we discussed in our second quarter call, we have some maintenance occurring on the lube extraction unit with the LEU [ at pulse ] set in the fourth quarter, so we did build inventory there to smooth sales and handle customers through the fourth quarter.

So we're incredibly frustrated, but I know we're also not alone. So all that said, look, we're going to do what's best for the shareholders. HEP was really formed for 2 reasons. First, to highlight the value of these assets within HFC, and HEP is still trading at about a 4-turn premium to HollyFrontier. The second was to access the capital markets, and clearly, that -- the equity capital markets in particular and clearly are broken at the moment. So we'll continue to evaluate our options here and monitor what -- how the market's going. The rate, as we sit here right now, we don't believe a buy-in makes sense. And really, the good news is that we're under no pressure here. HEP is very healthy operationally, commercially, has the right amount of leverage. It's got a coverage ratio north of 1.

Today, we reported third quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $262 million or $1.58 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $16 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $278 million or $1.68 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $351 million or $1.98 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $523 million, a decrease of $90 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. This decrease was principally driven by lower product margins and weaker laid-in crude advantage across our refining system.
The Refining and Marketing segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $425 million compared to $507 million for the third quarter of last year. Consolidated refinery gross margin was $17.23 per produced barrel, an 11% decrease compared to the $19.41 for the same period last year. We set a new quarterly crude charge record averaging over 476,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported EBITDA of $38 million compared to $42 million in the prior year despite improvements in the base oil market. Rack Forward EBITDA was $51 million for the quarter, and EBITDA margin was 11% of sales. Weakness in Rack Forward earnings was driven by unfavorable sales mix and the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on end markets.
With respect to our Sonneborn acquisition, as of September 30, we have achieved run rate synergies of $10 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year. Holly Energy Partners reported adjusted EBITDA of $90 million for the third quarter compared to $87 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven by the strong third-party volumes and higher spot revenues on our crude oil pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah, which contributed to a 10% increase in volumes year-over-year.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $260 million of cash to shareholders through our regular dividends and share repurchases, highlighting our continued commitment of returning excess cash to shareholders.
For the remainder of 2019, we are focused on completing the turnaround work at our Cheyenne, El Dorado and Woods Cross facilities and expect to return to normal operations later this quarter. We are pleased with the current strength and product margins across our refining system and look forward to a strong finish to the year.
Looking into 2020, our outlook remains positive and believe IMO implementation will provide uplift to diesel margins and further discounts to heavy crude barrels. With a light turnaround schedule next year, we are well positioned to take advantage of strong product margins and improving crude discounts across our refining system.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on our operations."

For the third quarter, our crude throughput of 476,000 barrels per day was our highest ever recorded quarterly crude throughput across our refining system. For the third quarter, our consolidated operating cost of $5.94 per throughput barrel was $0.11 lower versus the same period last year on higher consolidated throughputs.
In the Mid-Con, we ran 294,000 barrels per day of crude. OpEx per throughput barrel was $4.77, a decrease of $0.30 versus the same period last year.
Our El Dorado Refinery set a new quarterly crude charge rate record during the third quarter averaging 160,000 barrels per day.
In the Southwest, we ran 107,000 barrels per day of crude. Our operating expense per throughput barrel was $5.23, an increase of $0.54 versus in the third quarter of last year. This was mainly due to higher-than-normal operating cost associated with the mechanical problem that we had with our reforming unit, which we repaired this month in October.
In the Rockies, we ran 75,000 barrels per day of crude. Our operating expense was $11.34 per throughput barrel, a $0.38 decrease over the same period last year.
As George mentioned, due to our significant planned maintenance, we expect to run 38 -- 380,000 barrels to 390,000 barrels per day of crude in the fourth quarter. We are currently ramping up the scheduled turnaround at our Cheyenne refinery. The ongoing turnarounds at our El Dorado and Woods Cross refineries are expected to be completed on schedule and return to normal operating rates in the second half of the fourth quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Tom for an update on our commercial operations."

For the third quarter of 2019, we ran 476,000 barrels of crude oil, which was composed of 32% Permian and 18% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $1.95 in the Rockies and $0.08 in the Mid-Con and over WTI by $0.43 in the Southwest.
In the third quarter of 2019, gasoline inventories in the Magellan system started the quarter at 7.1 million barrels and ended the quarter at 6.6 million barrels. Current inventories are slightly lower at 6.2 million barrels to date. Group III diesel inventories dropped by 800,000 over the quarter to finish up at 7.6 million barrels. Current distillate or diesel inventories are at 6.1 million barrels.
Third quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $17.29, $26.78 in the Southwest and $26.85 in the Rockies. In our Southwest and Rockies regions, we continued to see higher margins as refinery operations on the West Coast and their problems have affected the markets in Phoenix and Las Vegas.
In the Mid-Continent, gasoline cracks are trading lower as fall refinery maintenance ends, along with weaker seasonal demand. Diesel cracks remain high, however, as harvesting has been delayed due to inclement weather.
Crude differentials widened across the heavy barrel and narrowed on the sour slates during the third quarter.
In the Canadian heavy market, third quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $12.24 per barrel, slightly higher than second quarter levels. Both the current and the forward market for WCS remains even wider with differentials in the $17 range as the market perceives incremental crude production, coupled with the perceived positive impact of IMO 2020.
Apportionment on the Enbridge system remains high at 44% despite the continuation of production curtailments by the Alberta government. We, however, continue to be able to -- are able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged heavy crude oil to meet our refining needs.
Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 72,000 barrels per day in our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 153,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refinery system composed of 107,000 barrels per day at the Navajo facility and 46,000 barrels per day at our El Dorado Refinery, delivered by the Centurion pipeline.
Midland sour differentials averaged the third quarter of $0.50 below WTI. And currently, we see the same differential trading at $0.20 above Cushing, as new pipeline capacities come onstream. We anticipate this differential to narrow through the balance of the year as additional pipes come online.
Our rent expense for the quarter was $8 million, which includes $37 million in small refinery exemption labors we received from the 2018 year at our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Rich."

As George mentioned, the third quarter included a few unusual items. Pretax earnings were negatively impacted by a lower of cost or market charge of $34 million and Sonneborn integration costs of $4 million, which were offset by a $37 million reduction in the cost of RINs as a result of a small refinery exemptions granted to our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries for the 2018 calendar year. A table of these items can be found in our press release.
For the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $441 million, including turnaround spending of $42 million. HollyFrontier's consolidated capital expenditures were $68 million for the quarter, producing free cash flow of $373 million.
The third quarter's strong free cash flow allowed us to return a total of $260 million of cash to shareholders comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $55 million and the repurchase of approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock totaling $205 million. As of September 30, we have approximately $320 million remaining on our share repurchase program. HollyFrontier has returned over $880 million of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over the past 12 months, representing a cash yield of 9%.
At the end of the third quarter and with an eye towards substantial planned maintenance in the fourth quarter, our total cash balance stood at $982 million, above our target of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $2.3 billion. As of quarter end, we have $1 billion of stand-alone debt and a debt-to-cap ratio of 14%.
Total ATP distributions received by HFC during the second quarter were $38 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million HEP limited partnering units, representing 57% of HEP's float with a market value of $1.4 billion as of last night's close.
For the full year of 2019, we have increased our capital spending guidance driven by higher turnaround scope and cost. We now expect to spend between $550 million and $590 million for both stand-alone capital and turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $45 million to $50 million in HollyFrontier loops and specialties and $34 million to $40 million of capital for HEP.
And with that, Cheryl, we are ready to take questions."

Second issue we'd point out is, as we discussed in our second quarter call, we have some maintenance occurring on the lube extraction unit with the LEU [ at pulse ] set in the fourth quarter, so we did build inventory there to smooth sales and handle customers through the fourth quarter.

We truly believe that some of it is basis on the incremental rail rates.

Today, we reported third quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $262 million or $1.58 per diluted share.

Today, we reported third quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $262 million or $1.58 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $16 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $278 million or $1.68 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $351 million or $1.98 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $523 million, a decrease of $90 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. This decrease was principally driven by lower product margins and weaker laid-in crude advantage across our refining system. The Refining and Marketing segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $425 million compared to $507 million for the third quarter of last year. Consolidated refinery gross margin was $17.23 per produced barrel, an 11% decrease compared to the $19.41 for the same period last year. We set a new quarterly crude charge record averaging over 476,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported EBITDA of $38 million compared to $42 million in the prior year despite improvements in the base oil market. Rack Forward EBITDA was $51 million for the quarter, and EBITDA margin was 11% of sales. Weakness in Rack Forward earnings was driven by unfavorable sales mix and the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on end markets.
With respect to our Sonneborn acquisition, as of September 30, we have achieved run rate synergies of $10 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year. 
Holly Energy Partners reported adjusted EBITDA of $90 million for the third quarter compared to $87 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven by strong third-party volumes and higher spot revenues on our crude oil pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah, which contributed to a 10% increase in volumes year-over-year.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $260 million of cash to shareholders through our regular dividends and share repurchases, highlighting our continued commitment of returning excess cash to shareholders.
For the remainder of 2019, we are focused on completing the turnaround work at our Cheyenne, El Dorado and Woods Cross facilities and expect to return to normal operations later this quarter. We are pleased with the current strength in product margins across our refining system and look forward to a strong finish to the year.
Looking into 2020, our outlook remains positive. We believe IMO implementation will provide uplift to diesel margins and further discounts to heavy crude barrels. With a light turnaround schedule next year, we are well positioned to take advantage of strong product margins and improving crude discounts across our refining system.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on our operations."

For the third quarter, our crude throughput of 476,000 barrels per day was our highest-ever recorded quarterly crude throughput across our refining system. For the third quarter, our consolidated operating cost of $5.94 per throughput barrel was $0.11 lower versus the same period last year on higher consolidated throughputs.
In the Mid-Con, we ran 294,000 barrels per day of crude. OpEx per throughput barrel was $4.77, a decrease of $0.30 versus the same period last year. Our El Dorado Refinery set a new quarterly crude charge rate record during the third quarter averaging 160,000 barrels per day.
In the Southwest, we ran 107,000 barrels per day of crude. Our operating expense per throughput barrel was $5.23, an increase of $0.54 versus in the third quarter of last year. This was mainly due to higher-than-normal operating cost associated with the mechanical problem that we had with our reforming unit, which we repaired this month in October.
In the Rockies, we ran 75,000 barrels per day of crude. Our operating expense was $11.34 per throughput barrel, a $0.38 decrease over the same period last year.
As George mentioned, due to our significant planned maintenance, we expect to run 38 -- 380,000 barrels to 390,000 barrels per day of crude in the fourth quarter. We are currently ramping up a scheduled turnaround at our Cheyenne refinery. The ongoing turnarounds at our El Dorado and Woods Cross refineries are expected to be completed on schedule and return to normal operating rates in the second half of the fourth quarter.

For the third quarter of 2019, we ran 476,000 barrels of crude oil, which was composed of 32% Permian and 18% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $1.95 in the Rockies and $0.08 in the Mid-Con and over WTI by $0.43 in the Southwest.
In the third quarter of 2019, gasoline inventories in the Magellan system started the quarter at 7.1 million barrels and ended the quarter at 6.6 million barrels. Current inventories are slightly lower at 6.2 million barrels per day. Group III diesel inventories dropped by 800,000 over the quarter to finish up at 7.6 million barrels. Current distillate or diesel inventories are at 6.1 million barrels.
Third quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $17.29, $26.78 in the Southwest and $26.85 in the Rockies. In our Southwest and Rockies regions, we continued to see higher margins as refinery operations on the West Coast and their problems have affected the markets in Phoenix and Las Vegas.
In the Mid-Continent, gasoline cracks are trading lower as fall refinery maintenance ends, along with weaker seasonal demand. Diesel cracks remain high, however, as harvesting has been delayed due to inclement weather. Crude differentials widened across the heavy barrel and narrowed on the sour slates during the third quarter.
In the Canadian heavy market, third quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $12.24 per barrel, slightly higher than second quarter levels. Both the current and the forward market for WCS remains even wider with differentials in the $17 range as the market perceives incremental crude production, coupled with the perceived positive impact of IMO 2020.
Apportionment on the Enbridge system remains high at 44% despite the continuation of production curtailments by the Alberta government. We, however, continue to be able -- are able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged heavy crude oil to meet our refining needs.
Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 72,000 barrels per day in our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 153,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refinery system, composed of 107,000 barrels per day at the Navajo facility and 46,000 barrels per day at our El Dorado Refinery, delivered by the Centurion pipeline.
Midland sour differentials averaged in the third quarter at $0.50 below WTI. And currently, we see the same differential trading at $0.20 above Cushing as new pipeline capacity has come onstream. We anticipate this differential to narrow through the balance of the year as additional pipes come online.
Our rent expense for the quarter was $8 million, which includes $37 million in small refinery exemption waivers we received for the 2018 year at our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Rich."

As George mentioned, the third quarter included a few unusual items. Pretax earnings were negatively impacted by a lower of cost or market charge of $34 million and Sonneborn integration costs of $4 million, which were offset by a $37 million reduction in the cost of RINs as a result of the small refinery exemptions granted to our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries for the 2018 calendar year. A table of these items can be found in our press release.
For the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $441 million, including turnaround spending of $42 million. HollyFrontier's consolidated capital expenditures were $68 million for the quarter, producing free cash flow of $373 million. The third quarter's strong free cash flow allowed us to return a total of $260 million of cash to shareholders, comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $55 million and the repurchase of approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock totaling $205 million. As of September 30, we have approximately $320 million remaining on our share repurchase program. HollyFrontier has returned over $880 million of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over the past 12 months, representing a cash yield of 9%.
At the end of the third quarter and with an eye towards substantial planned maintenance in the fourth quarter, our total cash balance stood at $982 million, above our target of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $2.3 billion. As of quarter end, we have $1 billion of stand-alone debt and a debt-to-cap ratio of 14%.
Total ATP distributions received by HFC during the second quarter were $38 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million HEP limited partnering units, representing 57% of HEP's float with a market value of $1.4 billion as of last night's close.
For the full year of 2019, we have increased our capital spending guidance driven by higher turnaround scope and costs. We now expect to spend between $550 million and $590 million for both stand-alone capital and turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $45 million to $50 million in HollyFrontier Lubes and Specialties and $34 million to $40 million of capital for HEP.
And with that, Cheryl, we are ready to take questions."

So for example, we saw new tariffs on sales into China this quarter, and we continue to feel the indirect impacts on end markets such as autos.
Second issue we'd point out is, as we discussed in our second quarter call, we have some maintenance occurring on the lube extraction unit, or the LEU, at Tulsa in the fourth quarter, so we did build some inventory there to smooth sales and handle customers through the fourth quarter.

We truly believe that some of it is based on the incremental rail rates. As you know, the Canadian or the Alberta government has said that if you move it by rail, you can move over and above the quota system. So that barrel is the last barrel being moved, so it does tend to set the market price. And as we all know, rail is a lot more expensive than pipeline economics."

Today, we reported third quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $262 million or $1.58 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $16 m",473,"Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, we reported third quarter net income attributable to HollyFrontier shareholders of $262 million or $1.58 per diluted share. Certain items detailed in our earnings release decreased net income by $16 million on an after-tax basis. Excluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $278 million or $1.68 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $351 million or $1.98 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $523 million, a decrease of $90 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. This decrease was principally driven by lower product margins and weaker laid-in crude advantage across our refining system. The Refining and Marketing segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $425 million compared to $507 million for the third quarter of last year. Consolidated refinery gross margin was $17.23 per produced barrel, an 11% decrease compared to the $19.41 for the same period last year. We set a new quarterly crude charge record averaging over 476,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.
Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported EBITDA of $38 million compared to $42 million in the prior year despite improvements in the base oil market. Rack Forward EBITDA was $51 million for the quarter, and EBITDA margin was 11% of sales. Weakness in Rack Forward earnings was driven by unfavorable sales mix and the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on end markets.
With respect to our Sonneborn acquisition, as of September 30, we have achieved run rate synergies of $10 million and continue to expect long-term synergies of $20 million per year. 
Holly Energy Partners reported adjusted EBITDA of $90 million for the third quarter compared to $87 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven by strong third-party volumes and higher spot revenues on our crude oil pipeline systems in Wyoming and Utah, which contributed to a 10% increase in volumes year-over-year.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $260 million of cash to shareholders through our regular dividends and share repurchases, highlighting our continued commitment of returning excess cash to shareholders.
For the remainder of 2019, we are focused on completing the turnaround work at our Cheyenne, El Dorado and Woods Cross facilities and expect to return to normal operations later this quarter. We are pleased with the current strength in product margins across our refining system and look forward to a strong finish to the year.
Looking into 2020, our outlook remains positive. We believe IMO implementation will provide uplift to diesel margins and further discounts to heavy crude barrels. With a light turnaround schedule next year, we are well positioned to take advantage of strong product margins and improving crude discounts across our refining system.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on our operations."

For the third quarter, our crude throughput of 476,000 barrels per day was our highest-ever recorded quarterly crude throughput across our refining system. For the third quarter, our consolidated operating cost of $5.94 per throughput barrel was $0.11 lower versus the same period last year on higher consolidated throughputs.
In the Mid-Con, we ran 294,000 barrels per day of crude. OpEx per throughput barrel was $4.77, a decrease of $0.30 versus the same period last year. Our El Dorado Refinery set a new quarterly crude charge rate record during the third quarter averaging 160,000 barrels per day.
In the Southwest, we ran 107,000 barrels per day of crude. Our operating expense per throughput barrel was $5.23, an increase of $0.54 versus in the third quarter of last year. This was mainly due to higher-than-normal operating cost associated with the mechanical problem that we had with our reforming unit, which we repaired this month in October.
In the Rockies, we ran 75,000 barrels per day of crude. Our operating expense was $11.34 per throughput barrel, a $0.38 decrease over the same period last year.
As George mentioned, due to our significant planned maintenance, we expect to run 38 -- 380,000 barrels to 390,000 barrels per day of crude in the fourth quarter. We are currently ramping up a scheduled turnaround at our Cheyenne refinery. The ongoing turnarounds at our El Dorado and Woods Cross refineries are expected to be completed on schedule and return to normal operating rates in the second half of the fourth quarter.

For the third quarter of 2019, we ran 476,000 barrels of crude oil, which was composed of 32% Permian and 18% WCS and black wax crude oil. Our average laid-in crude cost was under WTI by $1.95 in the Rockies and $0.08 in the Mid-Con and over WTI by $0.43 in the Southwest.
In the third quarter of 2019, gasoline inventories in the Magellan system started the quarter at 7.1 million barrels and ended the quarter at 6.6 million barrels. Current inventories are slightly lower at 6.2 million barrels per day. Group III diesel inventories dropped by 800,000 over the quarter to finish up at 7.6 million barrels. Current distillate or diesel inventories are at 6.1 million barrels.
Third quarter 3-2-1 cracks in the Mid-Con were $17.29, $26.78 in the Southwest and $26.85 in the Rockies. In our Southwest and Rockies regions, we continued to see higher margins as refinery operations on the West Coast and their problems have affected the markets in Phoenix and Las Vegas.
In the Mid-Continent, gasoline cracks are trading lower as fall refinery maintenance ends, along with weaker seasonal demand. Diesel cracks remain high, however, as harvesting has been delayed due to inclement weather. Crude differentials widened across the heavy barrel and narrowed on the sour slates during the third quarter.
In the Canadian heavy market, third quarter differentials for WCS at Hardisty averaged $12.24 per barrel, slightly higher than second quarter levels. Both the current and the forward market for WCS remains even wider with differentials in the $17 range as the market perceives incremental crude production, coupled with the perceived positive impact of IMO 2020.
Apportionment on the Enbridge system remains high at 44% despite the continuation of production curtailments by the Alberta government. We, however, continue to be able -- are able to purchase and deliver adequate volumes of price-advantaged heavy crude oil to meet our refining needs.
Canadian heavy and sour runs averaged 72,000 barrels per day in our plants in the Mid-Con and Rocky regions. We refined approximately 153,000 barrels a day of Permian crude in our refinery system, composed of 107,000 barrels per day at the Navajo facility and 46,000 barrels per day at our El Dorado Refinery, delivered by the Centurion pipeline.
Midland sour differentials averaged in the third quarter at $0.50 below WTI. And currently, we see the same differential trading at $0.20 above Cushing as new pipeline capacity has come onstream. We anticipate this differential to narrow through the balance of the year as additional pipes come online.
Our rent expense for the quarter was $8 million, which includes $37 million in small refinery exemption waivers we received for the 2018 year at our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Rich."

As George mentioned, the third quarter included a few unusual items. Pretax earnings were negatively impacted by a lower of cost or market charge of $34 million and Sonneborn integration costs of $4 million, which were offset by a $37 million reduction in the cost of RINs as a result of the small refinery exemptions granted to our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries for the 2018 calendar year. A table of these items can be found in our press release.
For the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $441 million, including turnaround spending of $42 million. HollyFrontier's consolidated capital expenditures were $68 million for the quarter, producing free cash flow of $373 million. The third quarter's strong free cash flow allowed us to return a total of $260 million of cash to shareholders, comprised of a $0.33 per share regular dividend totaling $55 million and the repurchase of approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock totaling $205 million. As of September 30, we have approximately $320 million remaining on our share repurchase program. HollyFrontier has returned over $880 million of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over the past 12 months, representing a cash yield of 9%.
At the end of the third quarter and with an eye towards substantial planned maintenance in the fourth quarter, our total cash balance stood at $982 million, above our target of $500 million. This strong cash position, along with our undrawn $1.35 billion credit facility, puts our total liquidity at over $2.3 billion. As of quarter end, we have $1 billion of stand-alone debt and a debt-to-cap ratio of 14%.
Total ATP distributions received by HFC during the second quarter were $38 million, a 2% increase over the same period in 2018. HollyFrontier owns 59.6 million HEP limited partnering units, representing 57% of HEP's float with a market value of $1.4 billion as of last night's close.
For the full year of 2019, we have increased our capital spending guidance driven by higher turnaround scope and costs. We now expect to spend between $550 million and $590 million for both stand-alone capital and turnarounds at HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing, $45 million to $50 million in HollyFrontier Lubes and Specialties and $34 million to $40 million of capital for HEP.
And with that, Cheryl, we are ready to take questions."

Second issue we'd point out is, as we discussed in our second quarter call, we have some maintenance occurring on the lube extraction unit, or the LEU, at Tulsa in the fourth quarter, so we did build some inventory there to smooth sales and handle customers through the fourth quarter.

And when we look at the forward curves, we see it staying at those levels, if not increasing, through the year 2020.
We truly believe that some of it is based on the incremental rail rates. As you know, the Canadian or the Alberta government has said that if you move it by rail, you can move over and above the quota system. So that barrel is the last barrel being moved, so it does tend to set the market price. And as we all know, rail is a lot more expensive than pipeline economics."
